            Police in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, are investigating an apparent break-in at the home of state Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was shot and killed at the house with her husband, Mark Hortman, early Saturday in what Gov. Tim Walz called “a politically motivated assassination.”
    


            “The home appeared to have been searched by an unknown individual; however, the family has indicated that they don't believe anything is missing,” Brooklyn Park Police said in a news release.
    


            Any evidence related to the Hortmans' shooting deaths had already been removed from the house by crime scene investigators, according to police.
    


            Authorities had placed a police trailer camera at the front of the home, but someone pried off the plywood covering the rear window and broke the glass to get inside, police said.
    


            Brooklyn Park Police are looking into the break-in, and crime scene investigators returned to the house to gather evidence. Police are asking neighbors to check surveillance cameras and report anything suspicious.
    


            Prosecutors say Vance Boelter, dressed like a police officer, visited the homes of at least four Minnesota lawmakers, shooting and killing Hortman, the top Democrat in the Minnesota House, and her husband, as well as shooting and severely wounding state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette.
    


            Officials said Boelter, 57, had an hit list of dozens of targets, which were largely Democrats or figures with ties to Planned Parenthood or the abortion rights movement.
    


            The search for Boelter lasted 43 hours and was the largest manhunt in Minnesota history. He faces six federal charges and four state charges.

“We are carrying out military strikes today,” Cruz said in an interview.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was caught stumbling to answer basic questions about Iran and the U.S.'s role in Israel's war in an eye-opening interview airing Wednesday, despite his full-throated support for overthrowing the Iranian government and deeper U.S. involvement in the fighting.

In clips of the interview with far right provocateur Tucker Carlson posted on social media on Tuesday, the senator alarmingly suggests that the U.S. is, in fact, already heavily involved in Israel's strikes on Iran. 

“We are carrying out military strikes today,” Cruz said. “I said we — Israel is leading them, but we're supporting them.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

This directly contradicts what federal officials have said about the U.S.'s involvement. The State Department has said that Israel's strikes are “unilateral,” and directed all embassies and consular posts to reiterate that claim in a cable, CBS reported on Sunday. The cable instructed officials to emphasize to their respective host governments that the U.S. “is not involved in Israel's unilateral action against targets in Iran and did not provide tanker support.”

This position has not changed in recent days, as the strikes have intensified and President Donald Trump openly mulls becoming more deeply involved in the war. Numerous Trump administration spokespeople claimed on Tuesday that any reports of the U.S. participating in Israeli strikes in Iran are “not true.”

“American forces are maintaining their defensive posture, and that has not changed. We will defend American interests,” said spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer on Tuesday. 

The U.S. military is already involved in the conflict. Officials have been open about the U.S.'s defensive positions in helping to strike down missiles fired at Israel. 

However, direct U.S. involvement in conducting strikes on Iran, as Cruz suggests is happening, would be a major escalation of the war. Cruz's statements potentially suggest that the U.S. is actually directly aiding in the bombings, as the Senate is privy to classified information about the military not available to the public.

“You're breaking news here,” said Carlson. “This is high stakes, you're a senator. If you're saying the United States government is at war with Iran right now, people are listening!” 

It's possible that Cruz is suggesting deeper U.S. involvement to push the Trump administration into striking Iran, as many conservative lawmakers have done in recent days — in hopes of pushing the dangerous pipe dream of regime change in Iran.

“I think it is very much in the interest of America to see regime change,” Cruz told Fox News on Sunday. “I don't think there's any redeeming the ayatollah.”

Despite his confidence that he could install a better government in Iran, earlier in the interview, Cruz is caught unable to even name basic facts about Iran's population.

“I don't know the population,” Cruz says.

“You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?” Carlson asks, incredulously. “How could you not know that?”

In a follow up, Carlson says, “okay, what's the ethnic mix of Iran?”

Cruz hesitates, then says, “they are Persians, and predominantly Shia,” he says, tellingly naming a religious sect rather than an ethnicity. When Carlson asks what proportion of the population is Persian, Cruz becomes incensed.

“I'm not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran,” Cruz says sarcastically, his voice raised.

“You're a senator who's calling for the overthrow of the government!” Carlson exclaims in response.

The exchange highlights a rift among the right over the U.S.'s role in the Middle East. Carlson's interview circulated widely online for exposing Cruz's blasé ignorance of the country he wants to wage war against.

However, Carlson, who has consistently allied with white supremacists, himself owes much of his career to the figures who peddled the lies that led to the Iraq War. Early on, Carlson was a proponent of the U.S.'s invasion, and only changed his mind later because of racist beliefs that Iraq and Afghanistan aren't “worth invading” because “the people aren't civilized.” 

This is, as commentators have noted, a drastically different approach to anti-interventionism from the left's anti-war and anti-imperialist foundations. And yet, Carlson's interview caught attention online as the right has sought to capitalize on genuine anti-war sentiment among the public that's been completely dismissed by the Democratic Party.

The survey also found that 61 percent of Republican-identified respondents supported US negotiations with Iran.

While it is widely known that American progressives overwhelmingly oppose the war on Iran at which President Donald Trump is increasingly hinting, new polling published Tuesday revealed that a thin majority of respondents who voted for the Republican president are also against U.S. involvement in the widening Israel-Iran war.

According to the Economist/YouGov survey of 1,512 U.S. adults conducted between June 13-16, 60% of all respondents oppose U.S. involvement in the war, while just 16% supported military action and 24% were unsure. Among those who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris for president last year, 71% opposed war on Iran.

So did 53% of Trump voters. In fact, a majority of respondents across all gender, race, age, and income categories opposed military action against Iran.

Independents 11% | 61%
Republicans 23% | 53%

The survey also found that more Republican-identified respondents supported U.S. negotiations with Iran than did Democrats, 61% to 58%. Fifty-six percent of all those surveyed back talks, while 18% oppose negotiations.

Reflecting disenchantment among people who voted for Trump because they believed his claim to be a “peace president,” Trump's favorite pollster, Rich Baris, director of Big Data Poll — who calls neoconservative Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) “war whores” — warned of dire electoral consequences should the U.S. go to war.

Kiss the Republican majority goodbye…For the next decade.If he pulls the trigger, it's all over for MAGA.

The National Iranian American Council also partnered with YouGov to ask 585 Iranian Americans how they feel about a possible U.S. war on Iran. Fifty-three percent of overall respondents said they “strongly” or “somewhat oppose” such action, while 36% strongly or somewhat back war. Strong opposition — 37% — was 20 points higher than strong support for an attack on Iran.

The poll also found that a strong majority of Iranian Americans want a new nuclear agreement that prevents Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The Trump administration — which, like multiple preceding ones concluded that Tehran is not seeking nukes — unilaterally withdrew from the landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, in 2018.

While there were hopes of a renewed deal during the tenure of former U.S. President Joe Biden, no agreement was reached, and Iranians continue to suffer under economic sanctions that critics have said are killing people and crippling the country's economy.

“We expect that Israel's military operations have only tilted opinion further against war in recent days,” NIAC president Jamal Abdi said in a statement. “Regardless, these results reinforce what we already know — our community is overwhelmingly against war and demands a foreign policy rooted in diplomacy, not destruction. We will share additional results from this timely survey next week.”

Trump, who has been threatening to attack Iran since his first term, earlier this year sent a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei in which he claims to have written, “I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing.”

“If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump said during a March NBC News interview.

A poll commissioned by Demand Progress and conducted by the Bullfinch Group recently found that 53% of registered voters — including 58% of Democrats, 47% of Independents, and 56% of Republicans — want Trump to “obtain congressional authorization before striking targets in other countries.”

Legislation that would compel Trump to get congressional approval to attack Iran under the War Powers Resolution of 1973 was introduced Tuesday by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and co-sponsored by at least 14 mostly progressive Democrats, while Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have introduced similar measures in the Senate.

President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday and speculated about appointing himself to lead the U.S. central bank.

Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday knocked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for what he expected would be a decision not to lower interest rates and said the man he put in the role during his last term had done a poor job.

Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, mused about appointing himself to lead the U.S. central bank, based on his dissatisfaction with Powell.

“Maybe I should go to the Fed,” Trump said. “Am I allowed to appoint myself at the Fed? I'd do a much better job than these people.”

Tariff threats put the Federal Reserve in ‘uncomfortable purgatory'

Trump has long criticized Powell and sparked market concern earlier this year when he suggested the central bank chief's termination couldn't come fast enough. Trump has since walked back from that rhetoric, saying he would not fire Powell before his term as chair ends next year, but he has not held back on his broader criticism and has made clear that he will not ask Powell to stay on as the central bank's leader.

“What I'm going to do is, you know, he gets out in about nine months, he has to, he gets fortunately terminated ... I would have never reappointed him, [President Joe] Biden reappointed him. I don't know why that is, but I guess maybe he was a Democrat ... he's done a poor job,” Trump said.

The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday as its policy makers weigh signs of a cooling economy, the risk of higher inflation from U.S. import tariffs, and the escalating crisis in the Middle East.

Trump expressed disappointment in advance of the decision and underscored his belief that the Fed had been too late at cutting rates.

“I call him 'too late Powell' because he's always too late. I mean, if you look at him, every time I did this I was right 100 per cent, he was wrong,” Trump said.

At least 28 people have been killed and 140 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17.

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported on June 18 that search and rescue operations in the Solomianskyi district lasted more than 39 hours, involving over 400 State Emergency Service rescuers and 200 pieces of equipment.

Initial data from Ukraine's National Police cited 15 dead and 124 injured, but the death toll was revised several times — first down to 10, then up to 16 by the State Emergency Service.

Early on June 18, more victims were found under the rubble of one residential building, raising the number of fatalities to 23. After completing the operation, Klymenko confirmed a total of 28 deaths from the attack.

The almost nine-hour-long strike saw Moscow's forces launch large numbers of kamikaze attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine's capital.

Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported the sounds of drones, missiles, and multiple rounds of explosions throughout the night.

The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia launched 472 aerial weapons overnight, including nearly 280 Shahed-type attack drones and two Kinzhal ballistic missiles. The strike primarily targeted Kyiv.

Ukraine's air defense forces reportedly destroyed 428 air targets, including 239 Shahed drones and 15 Kh-101 cruise missiles. Air defenses also intercepted one Kinzhal missile, while another was reportedly lost from radar tracking.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault "one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv," saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. 

"Such attacks are pure terrorism," he said in a statement on social media. "And the whole world, the U.S., and Europe must finally respond as civilized societies respond to terrorists."

Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block.

In a video posted on Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said cluster munitions had been found in one area of the city. He later added that June 18 would be an official day of mourning in Kyiv.

Many of the deaths and injuries occurred when a Russian missile hit a nine-storey residential building in the Solomianskyi district, "completely destroying" one section, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said.

"I saw the missile because it was low," Olena Kushnirova, a 46-year-old  nurse who lives in a neighboring building to the one that was hit, told the Kyiv Independent.

"I grabbed my daughter by the hand and shouted 'run!' It was literally 15 seconds. We ran to the toilet, and then there was a very powerful explosion."

During the attack on the capital, a 62-year-old U.S. citizen died in the Solomianskyi district in a building across from where medics were assisting the injured, Klitschko reported. Medical personnel confirmed biological death.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a "massive and brutal strike" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit.

"Putin does this on purpose... He sends a signal of total disrespect to the United States and other partners who have called for an end to the killing," Sybiha said. "Only strong steps and real pressure on Moscow can prove him wrong."

A Russian drone also hit a multi-storey building Darnytskyi District.

"At first there was shock," Tatiana Bratus, a 50-year-old resident of the building told the Kyiv Independent.

"People started running outside, shouting, some in panic, because the attack wasn't over yet. They said there were still rockets flying. People ran to the bomb shelter.

A kindergarten in the Darnytskyi district was also damaged, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration said. No casualties were reported at the site. 

The upper floors of residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts were also damaged.  

A dormitory at the Kyiv Aviation Institute was hit by drones during the attack, the news outlet Suspilne reported. Drones struck the institute's 10th floor and broke windows on three other floors.

Outside the capital, the attacks also caused damage and injured civilians in Kyiv Oblast towns. At least one woman was injured and multiple homes were damaged, according to the regional administration. 

The Russian strike damaged the production facility of Fahrenheit, a Ukrainian clothing manufacturer that supplies apparel and undergarments for both civilians and the military. The company announced it was forced to cancel all current orders and suspend new ones indefinitely following the destruction of its Kyiv site.

Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) freight train carrying grain. Several railcars overturned, temporarily halting operations and spilling grain from the damaged wagons. Ukrzaliznytsia said the damage would be "promptly repaired" and train traffic would not be affected.

Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, reported the destruction of two of its branches in Kyiv during the attack, according to CEO Ihor Smiliansky. The company's team is working to "quickly restore services," he said. 

The attack followed a series of drone strikes overnight on June 16 targeting Kyiv Oblast, including both the capital and surrounding settlements. In the Obukhiv district, a 60-year-old man was injured, according to regional authorities.  

Russian attacks against Ukraine have intensified in May and June, with Moscow launching several record-breaking mass strikes against Kyiv and other cities.

A spokesperson for Walz said the governor “wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans.”

President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday that he wouldn't call Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) following a series of shootings targeting Democratic lawmakers in the state.

Trump's comments — riddled with insults directed at Walz, who ran as vice president on the Democratic Party's presidential ticket last fall — represent a stark departure from presidential norms, as presidents typically disregard partisanship and reach out to state or local leaders to express their condolences or offer assistance after tragedies.

On Saturday, an individual named Vance Boelter impersonated a police officer and appeared at the homes of two lawmakers from the state's Democratic-Farm-Labor Party. He shot and killed Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman (D) and her husband; he also shot State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, who are expected to survive their injuries.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

According to a manifesto discovered by authorities, Boelter had a “hit list” of several other Democratic lawmakers he intended to assassinate. Police captured him on Sunday. 

Trump was blunt in his message to media following the shooting, saying he saw no reason to call the Minnesota governor.

“Why would I call him? I could call and say, ‘Hi, how you doing?' The guy doesn't have a clue,” Trump claimed, mocking Walz just days after the shootings took place. “He's a mess. So I could be nice and call, but why waste time?”

The blatant disregard for the governor of a state that is dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic and emotional tragedy has drawn criticism, including from members of Trump's own party.

“People have lost their lives, you make the call, you show the empathy,” former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) said in response to Trump's words. 

Walz has largely avoided commenting on the president's insults, though he has expressed disappointment through a spokesperson over the matter.

“Governor Walz wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans, but this tragedy isn't about Trump or Walz,” said the governor's spokesperson, Teddy Tschann. “It's about the Hortman family, the Hoffman family, and the State of Minnesota, and the Governor remains focused on helping all three heal.”

In a Minnesota Public Radio interview on Monday, before Trump publicly mocked Walz, the governor said he wasn't surprised that the president hadn't contacted him after the tragedy.

“I think I understand where that's at,” Walz said at the time.

            Nippon Steel has finalized its deal to buy 100% of US Steel, the iconic steelmaker that was once the world's most valuable company and a cornerstone of American industrial might.
    


            The companies announced Wednesday that the two had completed the partnership. Under the terms of the deal ﻿first announced in December 2023, Nippon will buy US steel for $55 per share, or $14.1 billion. The company will also retain its name and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania headquarters.
    


            But while Nippon is buying the entirety of US Steel, under the final deal the US government will gain a say in many key decisions on how the company is run. That includes giving President Donald Trump veto power over any decision to idle plants, reduce production or staffing levels.
    


            Despite the terms disclosed Tuesday, the acquisition comes despite Trump's past opposition the deal, saying he would only allow it because it was an “investment” by Nippon, not an outright purchase.
    


            “It's an investment, and it'll be a partial ownership (by Nippon),” Trump said last month, days after announcing he would approve the deal. “It will be controlled by the United States, otherwise I wouldn't make the deal.”
    


            The deal was previously blocked by President Joe Biden in his final weeks in office, citing national security grounds, and it was opposed by Trump when he was on the campaign trail. But once Trump took office, he said Nippon improved the deal and promised additional investment totaling $14 billion in the company's facilities, although only $11 billion in investment through 2028 is in the agreement Nippon and US Steel signed with the US government.
    


            At a rally at US Steel facility outside of Pittsburgh a week after saying he would allow the deal, Trump told a crowd of cheering steelworkers that it would be a good one for them.
    


            “They kept asking me over and over, and I kept rejecting it, no way, no way, no way,” he said. “The deal got better and better and better for the workers,” Trump said. “I'm going to be watching over it. It's going to be great.”
    


            Trump went on to say that US would keep its blast furnaces operating at full capacity for at least the next decade, and there would be “no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.”
    


            But while some local union officials were at the rally and praised the deal, the United Steelworkers union continued to oppose it. In a statement Sunday it questioned the promises and protections that the deal provides, even with Trump and future presidents having veto power over some moves.
    


            “Perhaps the historic “USS” logo will remain, but it seems it will be no more than a smoke screen to allow a wholly-owned privately held subsidiary of a Japanese corporation to be called ‘American.'”
    


            US Steel was once a symbol of American industrial dominance. It was the most valuable company in the world and the first to be worth $1 billion, soon after its creation in 1901. It was also crucial to the US economy throughout much of the 20th century providing the steel needed to build cars, appliances, bridges and skyscrapers, as well as weapons that helped win War War II.
    


            But it has suffered through decades of decline since its post-World War II height. It is no longer even the largest US steelmaker, and a relatively minor employer, with 14,000 US employees — 11,000 of whom are members of the USW.

The Supreme Court has upheld Tennessee's ban on providing such interventions as cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.

In a 6–3 decision released on June 18, the court disagreed with the Biden administration's argument that the law should face higher legal scrutiny than had been applied by an appeals court.

An anti-missile system operates as missiles are launched from Iran, as seen from Tel Aviv on June 18.Violeta Santos Moura/Reuters

Kevin Yin is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail and an economics doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley

For those of us who grew up in the decades after the Gulf War, certain shocks to the global economy seemed more an artifact of economics textbooks than reality.

Our formative macroeconomic experiences were not supply side shocks such as the 1973 OPEC embargo or Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, which drove up the price of oil and thus the costs of production. We were far more acquainted with drops in demand from repeated stock market bubbles and financial crises. For us, and the leaders of G7 nations in Kananaskis this week, the conflict between Israel and Iran is a reminder that old threats from the supply side are making a comeback.

In the almost 30 years between the end of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global business cycle was more or less defined by demand. As both the U.S.-led global order and market liberalization were ascendant, it was not supply chain disruptions and oil prices that posed the greatest threat to people's livelihoods, but the interrelated challenges of asset bubbles, currency crises and sovereign defaults, all of which are primarily demand-side risks.

Israel eyes the heart of Iran's nuclear ambitions

It is rather astonishing how stark this pattern was in that period. From domestic crises such as the housing crash of 2008 and the dot-com bubble in 2000, to events from abroad such as the Asian financial crisis in 1997 or the Argentine sovereign default in 2000, most macroeconomic shocks for nearly three decades were financial in nature. What these events had in common was that, in each case, an asset value collapsed, and the loss of wealth induced people and businesses to cut back their purchases, slowing economic activity. Unlike supply side shocks, demand shocks are not inflationary (prices do not rise if no one wants to buy things), and thus pose a far simpler challenge for central banks and finance ministries looking to get the economy back on track.

If the leaders at the G7 summit this week were under any illusions that this was still the world we lived in, Israel's unprecedented strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and key military officials last week should have jolted them out of it.

Iran's leader rejects call to surrender, says U.S. intervention would cause ‘irreparable damage'

Because oil, and energy more broadly, is a critical input to all production of goods and services, large oil price increases are the quintessential supply shock. The Israeli attack itself does not threaten oil supplies, but the most drastic of potential Iranian responses would. If Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei chooses to bomb oil assets in the Gulf states or, worse, block the Strait of Hormuz, the key shipping lane for around 20 per cent of global oil supplies, companies around the world will be forced to cut production, and consumers will see the cost of living rise again. Experts do not see these events as likely yet, but U.S. President Donald Trump's increasing willingness to get his country involved militarily is forcing Iran into a corner with fewer and fewer options.

The Israel-Iran conflict is part of a broader trend of countries emboldened to seek regional hegemony as the global influence of the U.S. wanes. But as geopolitical tension rises, so does its twin problem – the elevated risk of supply side shocks.

This was somewhat common before the nineties, as repeated wars and political crises in the Middle East put crude supplies at perpetual risk. But modern day Europeans are also familiar with this problem, since shipments of Russian gas halted from when Russia invaded Ukraine, sending European energy prices skyrocketing in 2022. Even Canada considered halting oil shipments in its trade war with the U.S. When international relations sour, energy supplies are among the first to go.

Opinion: For all the importance of G7, Canada's fortunes truly lie with China and India

But energy is not the only resource bottleneck at the whims of foreign affairs. China controls well over half the world's supply of rare earth metals, which serve as crucial inputs for everything from cars to computer chips, and around 85 per cent of processing capacity. The country has already exercised this leverage in retaliatory export controls in response to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Semiconductor chips are the key component in nearly all modern electronics, and more than 60 per cent of all semiconductors are manufactured in Taiwan, most by a single company. A war over, or blockade of, Taiwan could easily send prices soaring and grind production of many dependent goods and services to a halt. These threats would have been unthinkable 20 years ago, hence the West's willingness to allow these dependencies to grow unsupervised until now.

The economy is not even close to the most important victim of war. But in lessons from the past and present, even the most cynical Goldman Sachs analyst can see that peace pays. That we have returned to an era of politically driven supply side risks only adds increased urgency for our global leaders to work toward a more stable foreign-policy framework.

Since launching its military operation against Iran last Friday, Israel has dealt a devastating blow to the country's nuclear program, its ballistic missile arsenal, and its military leadership. But Israel is unlikely to be able to fully destroy Iran's nuclear program by itself. It does not have the bombers or heavy ordnance it would need to penetrate the fortified, underground Fordow enrichment facility. It has also evidently avoided striking fuel-storage facilities for fear of unleashing a public health crisis.

The United States has the aircraft and so-called bunker-buster bombs to cripple Fordow. That means that the outcome of the war will depend as much on decisions made by U.S. President Donald Trump as it will on further Israeli airstrikes. Israel has urged the United States to join the war, and if Trump decides to do so, Iran would almost certainly suffer a strategic defeat serious enough to push its nuclear capabilities back years and conceivably threaten the viability of the regime—which would quickly become a U.S. goal, owing to the logic of escalation.

But Trump should not enter the war as a combatant on Israel's side. The United States does have an interest in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. In 2015, it secured an agreement with Iran that would have blocked the Islamic Republic's quest for that for at least a decade, if not longer. Washington believed that negotiating an outcome in which Iran had a stake would be a more durable solution, and much less expensive than opting for war. Israel did not agree withthis approach, nor did Trump.

In 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement, an act that facilitated Iran's impressive accumulation of highly enriched uranium. It is no more in Washington's interest now than it was in 2015 to go to war for a result that could be achieved with far less risk through negotiations. That means that it is not in the U.S. interest to go to war to neutralize Fordow militarily, either, and it would be a mistake to do so. If Israel is determined to substantially damage Fordow, the Israel Defense Forces could do so by sending troops to Iran or by making it impossible to enter the facility or relocate centrifuges there. Achieving either goal, however, would be tricky and costly, and it is understandable that Israel would want to outsource the job to the Americans.

But subcontracting the Fordow job would put the United States in Iran's sights. Iran would almost certainly retaliate by killing American civilians. That, in turn, would compel the United States to reciprocate in an iterative process. Soon enough, the only targets left for Washington to hit would be the Iranian regime's leaders, and the United States would again go into the regime-change business—a business in which exceedingly few Americans want to be involved any longer.

U.S. involvement would pose risks for the president's political agenda, as well. To avoid both the international and domestic dangers, it is incumbent on Trump to develop a strategy that brings the war to an end by ensuring that Iran cannot immediately reconstitute its military nuclear program and allows both Iran and Israel to save face. This won't be easy, but it can be done. And the U.S. president needs to act strategically if he wants to save any portion of his substantial investments in Middle East peace—and prevent the war from incapacitating the United States' ability to meet other consequential challenges in Europe and Asia.

For days, the Trump administration failed to display any coherent strategy toward the war. Then, on Tuesday, Trump debuted much more hawkish language, calling for Iran's “unconditional surrender,” threatening to kill Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and using “we” when describing Israel's attacks. What he has not acknowledged, however, is that if the United States actually joins Israel's aerial campaign, the Islamic Republic has threatened to strike American targets: for example, naval assets in the Arabian Sea and U.S. military and diplomatic installations along the Arab side of the Gulf. Trump is preternaturally cautious about taking military action, and even the prospect of U.S. casualties on these ships or bases—and opposition from Gulf monarchies who will become targets themselves—will give him pause. But Iran's conventional response options are dwindling fast, and more direct U.S. involvement would likely lead Tehran to undertake asymmetric actions—terrorist attacks—against Israelis, Jews, and Americans worldwide.

Influential elements of Trump's MAGA base, such as the broadcaster Tucker Carlson, are already warning him not to reverse course on his “America first” policy. These supporters do not want him to supply Israel with arms, let alone send U.S. forces or aircraft to fight in the Middle East alongside Israel. Trump has pushed back against these critics, but they are not conceding the point; a cadre of Republicans in Congress are also counseling restraint. And once his conservative opposition senses broader public support, the free pass Trump has enjoyed from congressional Republicans may well be revoked on other issues important to him. If a rancorous debate breaks out over Middle East policy, Republican discord could, in particular, threaten the passage of Trump's signature “big beautiful bill.” And it would revive concerns about the United States' military adventures in the region.

Even if the Trump administration helps Israel incapacitate the Fordow facility, it will be immensely difficult to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop his military campaign before he is convinced that Iran's nuclear program cannot easily or quickly be reconstituted. In the past, Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies have estimated that after intense attacks against Iran's key nuclear facilities, the Islamic Republic could reestablish its program in about a year. Netanyahu has talked about destroying the program entirely, but in the absence of U.S. intervention, he has not defined a realistic and realizable way to achieve that goal. It is thus unclear whether even a medium to long-term disabling of Iran's nuclear program would satisfy Netanyahu.

Trump's best option, therefore, is to try to help bring the Israel-Iran war to an end in a way that preserves what Israel has accomplished militarily but also allows Iran to save enough face to return to negotiations. To do this, he will need to mobilize a multilateral effort to keep nuclear-related material out of Iran's hands, develop a negotiating strategy that takes advantage of the weakness that Iran has shown in the recent fighting, and conclude a credible agreement that effectively ends Iran's quest for a nuclear weapons capability.

All this will be far easier to propose than to achieve. If Trump puts outright pressure on Israel to stop its aerial strikes, Israel's supporters in both U.S. political parties will rise in protest, imperiling the rest of his political agenda. But if Trump attempts to simply sit the war out, it will grind on with unpredictable consequences. Iran may descend into civil war or societal collapse, creating a terrible humanitarian crisis; at the other end of the spectrum, an extended war of attrition would expose the combatants to costs that will be difficult to recover in the foreseeable future—and prolong Israel's efforts to draw the United States into the conflict.

Until now, Trump has combined tough rhetoric and threats with the demand that Iran return to the negotiating table and accept a deal that excludes any uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. This bob-and-weave approach will not be enough. Much more precise U.S. diplomatic intervention is required even as the Israeli aerial campaign maintains pressure on Iran in the background. Only a determined American president can pull off this complex, coercive diplomatic effort.

First, the president's senior military and intelligence advisers need to engage with Israel and seek agreement on a battle damage assessment that would judge whether enough damage has been done to Iran's nuclear program to justify stopping Israel's attacks. This assessment would factor in the Israeli assassinations of key Iranian military leaders, nuclear scientists, engineers, and administrators, as well as the damage inflicted on infrastructure. The fact that even future Israeli strikes are likely to leave Fordow's centrifuge halls and Iran's uranium hexafluoride storage site more or less intact will make this a difficult conversation. But the Trump administration must persuade Israel that Iran's capabilities can be adequately hobbled without destroying Fordow or continuing its attacks indefinitely.



Second, Trump must work with Netanyahu to define an end goal for the war that can be achieved quickly: a significant and specific measure of destruction of Iran's existing nuclear facilities and stockpile. Netanyahu's goals, thus far, appear much broader—the total destruction of Iran's nuclear program and, increasingly, regime change. Netanyahu must be advised that he cannot expect U.S. support for a policy aimed at regime change.

Third, with the help of U.S. allies in the Gulf, Iran's rulers will have to be convinced that accepting the bitter chalice of greatly diminished access to enrichment is better than economic strangulation, continued pounding from the air, and the possible loss of control over their country. Trump needs to enlist like-minded states such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to commit to a sustained multilateral effort to deny Iran the new nuclear-related equipment it would need to reconstitute its program and sprint for a bomb. An all-out effort along the lines of Operation Staunch—an embargo launched in the 1980s that weakened Iran's hand in its war with Iraq—would probably be required.

If progress can be made on these elements of the strategy, the United States should then draft a UN Security Council resolution proposing a cease-fire plan. The plan must include verifiable conditions related to Iran's nuclear program, such as the immediate return of nuclear inspectors, removing all barriers to those inspectors' access to the facilities they seek to examine, an embargo on the importation of components needed to reconstitute the program, the immediate export of any enriched uranium remaining in Iran, and a call to renew negotiations toward a nuclear deal.

If negotiations toward a deal do resume, Trump needs to take a realistic approach, accepting that his deal may end up looking more like a strengthened version of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement than something brand new. Insisting that Iran forgo enriching any uranium at all on its soil—a stance Trump's negotiators had taken after much back and forth—makes sense at the outset of resumed talks. But it will be very difficult for Trump to sustain that position given Iran's entrenched stance on enrichment. It will also be enormously difficult for Netanyahu—who has exposed Israel to punishing Iranian missile barrages with the aim of destroying Iran's program altogether—to concede both the survival of the Islamic Republic and any prospect of enrichment in Iran.

One way to deal with this concern—a proposal that is already on the table—would be for the United States to lead the setup of a regional consortium for enrichment under strict supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Such a solution could offer Iran a face-saving way of obtaining low-enriched uranium for medical and other benign purposes. And the presence of other parties, presumably some Arab states, and the location of this consortium outside Iran would go far in assuaging some of Israel's concerns.

This diplomatic effort by Trump carries political risks. A major multilateral push to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions will divert intelligence resources important to other targets, especially China and Russia, and probably necessitate a reversal of planned cuts to the U.S. intelligence apparatus. And any nuclear deal with Iran that allows the country to participate in uranium enrichment even outside its own territory will require Trump to spend political capital with his base. But these risks are worth it to avoid renewed war.

Israel's attack has already created a strategic shift in the Middle East. The country has again proved that its intelligence prowess and military dominance can redefine the region's politics. Once this war is over, Trump can turn his attention to a goal he has already articulated: translating that strategic transformation into the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states. This is a task the United States is best positioned to carry out.

But if Trump dithers—or, worse, fully joins Israel's war—he will destroy his ability to broker a more peaceful Middle East, an aim he has repeatedly stressed is precious to him. He must act, and in the right way, before Israel's appetite for regime change leads to another “forever war”—and before the logic of escalation leads Iran to shift from launching missiles to launching terror attacks, including against Americans.

Australia has, for the first time, imposed sanctions on Russia's so-called "shadow fleet" of oil tankers, targeting 60 vessels used to circumvent international sanctions and sustain the Kremlin's war effort in Ukraine, the Australian government said on June 18.

The move aligns Canberra with similar measures introduced by the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union. 

Australia's Foreign Ministry said the sanctioned vessels operate under "deceptive practices, including flag-hopping, disabling tracking systems and operating with inadequate insurance," enabling illicit Russian oil trade that undermines international sanctions.

"Russia uses these vessels to circumvent international sanctions and sustain its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine," the ministry said in a statement.

With this move, Australia has now sanctioned more than 1,400 Russian individuals and entities since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, the government said.

The step comes amid the continued operation of Russia's shadow fleet. According to a recent study by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), Russia currently operates 435 tankers outside the control of Western regulators to evade sanctions such as the G7-EU price cap on Russian oil. 

These vessels are typically un- or underinsured and pose a rising environmental risk due to their age and operational opacity.

KSE estimates that as of April 2024, 83% of Russia's crude oil and 46% of its petroleum product exports were shipped using shadow fleet tankers. The study warns that this undermines the effectiveness of Western sanctions and increases the likelihood of maritime disasters, as many of these ships fall outside international safety and insurance standards.

The EU formally adopted its 17th sanctions package against Russia in May, sanctioning nearly 200 vessels tied to the shadow fleet. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the new measures also target hybrid threats and human rights violations, with more sanctions under consideration. 

Some EU member states and observers have criticized the package for lacking stronger provisions to disrupt Russia's sanction evasion schemes.

Now, the EU seeks to approve its 18th sanctions package, which will add 77 more shadow fleet vessels to comply with the cap to prevent Russia from circumventing sanctions and propose imposing a ban on imports of petroleum products made from Russian oil.

The United States has signaled reluctance to pursue additional sanctions despite Moscow's continued aggression in Ukraine and rejection of ceasefire proposals supported by Western allies.

Regulators say online retailer not doing enough to prevent sale of counterfeit clothes and unsafe children's toys

The European Commission has accused the online retailer AliExpress of a “systemic failure” to prevent the sale of illegal and dangerous goods on its platform, as Brussels steps up its case against the Chinese company.

Issuing formal findings of an investigation launched in March last year, EU regulators said on Wednesday that AliExpress was failing to do enough to prevent the sale of counterfeit clothes and dangerous children's toys, among other items.

The company, which claims 104 million monthly users in the EU, did not devote enough resources to content moderation to take down illegal goods on sale on its platform, regulators said.

An EU official said the company – which is owned by Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce group founded by the Chinese billionaire Jack Ma – had “underestimated the general risk of the sale of illegal products”. The official added: “General measures they have in place to avoid the dissemination of illegal products do not work properly – it shows a systemic failure.”

The European Commission said these were preliminary findings, pending further investigation and responses from AliExpress. If EU officials uphold the verdict, the company can in theory be fined up to 6% of global turnover under the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA).

AliExpress has, however, persuaded EU regulators to close aspects of their investigation, by pledging to take action to tackle “hidden links” that take users to an illegal product via a legitimate one.

The online marketplace promised to develop a system to monitor and detect hidden links to illegal products, such as food supplements and medicines, which have been offered for sale via legitimate items. Such hidden links were also said to have taken children to pornographic material.

AliExpress also promised greater transparency over its advertising systems and availability of its data to researchers, which Brussels said addressed concerns in these areas.

The European Commission described the commitments as “legally binding” and said AliExpress could face fines if it failed to follow through.

The investigation comes under the DSA, which is intended to protect people from online harms such as disinformation, illegal content and dangerous products. The act imposes the strictest requirements on the largest companies with more than 45 million users, including Amazon, Google, Meta and X.

AliExpress said it had “proactively engaged and closely collaborated with the European Commission throughout this process” and would continue to do so.

“The commission has recognised our committed approach to ensure a high level of consumer protection and transparency through the breadth and depth of these voluntary commitments offered and agreed,” it said. “We are confident that a positive and compliant result will be achieved through continuing our mutual dialogue with the commission to address any remaining concerns on the DSA.”

Last year, the UK consumer group Which? found dangerous and illegal children's toys for sale on several websites including AliExpress. The consumer group bought 23 toys from seven platforms and found problems with more than half the items, including toys from AliExpress that broke into small pieces, or had sharp edges that could puncture a small child's skin.

The products were removed from sale after Which? alerted the companies. AliExpress said at the time it was working with regulators to prevent non-compliant products from being sold.

The European Consumer Organisation, whose members include Which?, welcomed Brussels' actions on Wednesday.

“It is now very important that the commission monitors whether the commitments AliExpress has agreed to are respected and if they are not, the commission should take more deterrent action,” the group's director general, Agustín Reyna, said.

Israel-Iran conflict is at a critical juncture as thousands flee Tehran. Plus, Alex Padilla makes speech about being handcuffed

Good morning.

Israel's war on Iran appeared to be approaching a pivotal moment on Tuesday night after five days of bombing and retaliatory Iranian missile strikes, as Donald Trump demanded “unconditional surrender” from Tehran and weighed his military options.

Trump convened a meeting of his national security team in the White House situation room after a day of febrile rhetoric in which the president gave sharply conflicting signals over whether US forces would participate directly in Israel's bombing campaign over Iran.

He told journalists in the morning that he expected the Iranian nuclear program to be “wiped out” long before US intervention would be necessary. Later, he took to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to suggest that the US had Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in its bomb-sights, and could make an imminent decision to take offensive action.

What's the latest in the conflict? Israel's defense forces said they launched a fresh wave of strikes on Tehran in the early hours of Wednesday morning, warning residents in parts of the city to urgently evacuate.

What's the situation on the ground? Some Tehran residents are fleeing the capital, with witnesses citing strong explosions hitting buildings in western and eastern parts of Tehran on Tuesday evening, the Associated Press reports.

Alex Padilla took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to deliver a deeply personal speech, formally entering into the congressional record his account of being restrained and forcibly removed as he attempted to ask a question at a press conference held by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, in Los Angeles last week.

Meanwhile, Brad Lander, New York City's comptroller and a mayoral candidate, was arrested on Tuesday by masked federal agents while visiting an immigration court and accompanying a person out of a courtroom.

What did Padilla say? “If that is what the administration is willing to do to a United States senator for having the [audacity] to simply ask a question, imagine what they'll do to any American who dares to speak up.”

What did Lander's wife say? In a news conference after the arrest, Meg Barnette said she was “extraordinarily proud” of her husband and called the ordeal “shocking and unacceptable.”

A federal appeals court on Tuesday seemed ready to keep Donald Trump in control of California national guard troops after they were deployed following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.

Last week, a district court ordered the US president to return control of the guard to the state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who had opposed their deployment. US district judge Charles Breyer said Trump had deployed the guard illegally and exceeded his authority. But the administration quickly appealed, and a three-judge appellate panel temporarily paused that order.

Tuesday's hearing was about whether the order could take effect while the case makes its way through the courts, including possibly the supreme court.

How unprecedented is this? It's the first time a US president has activated a state national guard without the governor's permission since 1965, and the outcome of the case could have sweeping implications for Trump's power to send soldiers into other US cities.

A volcano in eastern Indonesia has spewed a colossal ash tower into the sky, forcing the cancellation of dozens of flights to and from Bali.

PEN America has condemned the detention and deportation from the US of an Australian writer  as “gravely concerning”. Alistair Kitchen was last week detained at Los Angeles airport before being deported back to Melbourne.

Federal police have formally accused Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro of presiding over an illegal spying network that allegedly snooped on political rivals, journalists and environmentalists.

An analysis published in the journal Heart suggested heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome, 20% higher for stroke, and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Researchers at the University of Toulouse reviewed studies including about 200 million people.

Tinder is trialling a height filter. But what is behind the “6ft fixation” on dating apps, Leah Harper asks, and could it be blocking true connection? “I've worked with couples where there is a significant height difference and it makes no difference to their physical, emotional or sexual compatibility,” says one relationship therapist.

Turning recently closed coalmines into solar energy plants could add almost 300GW of renewable energy by 2030, according to a Global Energy Monitor report. If 312 surface coalmines, closed since 2020, were filled with solar panels and developed into energy plants, the report claims, it could generate enough energy to power Germany.

“I cried out loud as I punched – an ugly, guttural sound, so different to everything I'd been taught. In that moment, I didn't have to be demure, delicate or diplomatic,” writes Kia Abdullah. “I could be as fierce and angry as I wanted … Over the course of those three minutes, I felt my anger lift: the years, maybe decades, of it.”

MOSCOW, June 18 /TASS/. SPIEF may yield $95.5 billion in contracts, and US President Donald Trump leaves the G7 summit in Canada early. Meanwhile, Iran deploys a hypersonic missile to strike Israel. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines in Russia.

 

Contracts to be signed at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), which kicks off on Wednesday, may reach 7.5 trillion rubles ($95.5 billion), marking a 20% rise year-on-year, experts interviewed by Izvestia estimate. The key agreements are expected to contribute to developing Russian exports in new directions and other international initiatives. More than 20,000 delegates from over 140 nations are planning to attend the forum, running through June 21, with Bahrain enjoying the status of guest country at SPIEF 2025, which will be themed "Shared Values: The Foundation of Growth in a Multipolar World." This year's forum will differ by featuring deeper international cooperation and a more active investment strategy by both regions and individual companies, experts say.

The traditional plenary session, to be chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin, will crown SPIEF. It will take place on Friday, June 20. Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov specified that the head of state will present his vision of the situation in the Russian and global economy.

Also, events in the format of business dialogues with foreign partners from Africa, Bahrain, India, Iran, China, and EU countries will be held at the forum. The Russian side plans to sign a declaration on strategic cooperation with Indonesia, Ushakov added. In addition, American entrepreneurs will participate in SPIEF.

Politicians from around 50 countries will attend. A number of nations will be represented by heads of government and ministers, including Hungary's top diplomat Peter Szijjarto, Qatari Finance Minister Ali bin Ahmed Al Kuwari, and Cuban Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment Oscar Perez-Oliva.

"While SPIEF 2024 focused on identifying growth points in the evolving multipolar system, SPIEF 2025 will emphasize such shared values as trust, equal rights, and transparency as a foundation to build new international relations amid global fragmentation," Freedom Finance Global analyst Vladimir Chernov noted.

Contracts will likely be tied to the expansion of Russian exports, including in the fields of energy and defense, independent expert Andrey Bakhota suggested. "The most valuable agreements at the forum usually involve high-tech services that Russia offers to other nations - in constructing nuclear power plants, maintaining advanced weapons systems, or education," he explained. Bakhota said this year's forum may even yield 8 trillion rubles ($102 billion) worth of contracts. Among other major agreements, Finam expects projects in technological sovereignty, import substitution, digital economy, infrastructure modernization, and enhanced cooperation with partners from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

 

On June 17, US President Donald Trump decided to return home on the first day of the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Canada. He attributed his early departure to efforts to contribute to stabilizing the situation in the Middle East, as Israel and Iran have been exchanging strikes since June 13, when Israel launched its Operation Rising Lion.

So far, Trump has not put forward any specific proposals to either Israel or Iran. He reiterated that Tehran should have signed a nuclear deal with the United States. Meanwhile, Trump slammed a statement from French President Emmanuel Macron on why he had to leave the G7 summit even as he called on everybody to "evacuate Tehran," the city with a population of roughly 14 million, minutes before he departed from Canada.

Trump always goes against the current, so it was typical how he violated the protocol, said Pavel Koshkin, a senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies. According to him, this is how Trump shows his weariness with both Europe and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, Trump is concerned about prospects of resolving the confrontation between Israel and Iran, the expert in American studies emphasized.

Nor did the US leader meet with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, who was originally scheduled to attend the G7 summit. In that, it differed from all the previous summits, which have focused on the Ukraine crisis since 2022. Trump and Zelensky last met in the Vatican in May, when they attended the funeral of Pope Francis.

The format of G7 meetings is largely losing its relevance due to global shifts and the foreign policy course being pursued by the United States under Trump, Associate Professor at the Faculty of World Economy and International Affairs at the Higher School of Economics Lev Sokolshchik told Vedomosti. According to the expert, the current US administration tends to prioritize unilateral actions or bilateral format to multilateral institutions. This rhymes with the principle of Trump's foreign policy of putting American interests first, Sokolshchik stressed.

As regards the Iran-Israel conflict, the expert says the positions of the United States and Europe on Israel's security coincide. "The G7 leaders' statement affirmed Israel's right to self-defense. But any escalation poses serious risks to European countries, ranging from the disruption of transportation routes in the event of a potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz to new migrant waves," the expert concluded.

 

As the Israel-Iran conflict continued into the fourth day, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the newly appointed Iranian Chief of Staff Ali Shadmani was killed. He became the 14th representative of the Islamic Republic's military establishment killed in the Jewish state's operation, which claimed at least 300 civilian casualties over three days, Iranian Ambassador to Moscow Kazem Jalali said on Tuesday.

Since the launch of Operation Rising Lion targeting Iran's nuclear program, over 15,000 centrifuges at Iran's biggest underground enrichment plant in Natanz have been damaged. Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi said there was a possibility of both radiological and chemical contamination within the Natanz facility.

Meanwhile, Shlomi Binder, who heads the IDF Intelligence Directorate, told his officers that they will soon "break ground" in other areas of Iran.

The conflict between Israel and Iran is escalating rapidly with complete unpredictability, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on June 17. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Israel's attacks on civilian nuclear facilities in Iran are illegal, as they are pushing the world toward a nuclear disaster.

Since the latest escalation, Iran has fired more than 400 missiles and hundreds of drones on the Jewish state, IDF Spokeswoman Anna Ukolova told Izvestia. The chief of the Islamic Republic's General Staff called on residents in Israel's Tel Aviv and Haifa to evacuate the two cities. Tehran delivered strikes on the building of Israel's military intelligence and the Mossad headquarters, killing multiple Israeli officers and servicemen. Iranian attacks have killed 24 people in Israel and injured more than 640, Dmitri Gendelman, an adviser in the Israeli prime minister's office, said in a bulletin. In the early hours of June 17 alone, the Israeli military recorded 30 missile launches, the majority of which were destroyed.

On Tuesday morning, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced a fresh and more devastating wave of missile strikes against Israel, in which it fired a new missile that the Zionist regime failed to detect until it struck. Analysts think Tehran might have used its Fattah hypersonic missile in the attack.

Only several countries, namely Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, possess hypersonic missiles, military expert Dmitry Lyamin told Izvestia. "Systems that can not only fly at hypersonic speed but also make maneuvers are considered such weapons today," the expert explained. Exactly how many such missiles Iran has in service is classified, he emphasized. Also, he added, Tehran may have a hypersonic missile not previously disclosed.

 

Global portfolio wealth managers are becoming less fearful of trade wars, the latest survey conducted by Bank of America showed, with US trade talks with Britain and China inspiring their cautious optimism. However, the hostilities between Israel and Iran may now take center stage. Russian wealth managers believe that any potential US involvement in the conflict or the closure of the Strait of Hormuz may impact the global economy the most, even as they see such a scenario as unlikely.

Given that BofA's latest survey was conducted before Israel launched a surprise missile attack on Iran, it did not cover the recent escalation in the Middle East. Alyona Nikolayeva, portfolio manager at Astero Falcon, said the latest flare-up may disrupt expectations of a "soft landing of the economy" among most portfolio managers.

Even as missile attacks will heighten geopolitical risks, trade war risks will not be automatically pushed aside, portfolio managers interviewed by Kommersant believe. This is because, over the past two years, Iran and Israel have exchanged strikes for a third time already, with the two previous rounds being quite brief and not escalating into a broader conflict. Therefore, the role of this factor will largely depend on how long the hostilities last and what actions the parties involved take. "Should the US directly interfere in the conflict and the physical oil market comes under real pressure from supply shortages, oil prices may easily spike above $100 per barrel," Nikolayeva warned.

According to Igor Kozak, managing investment director at TKB Investment Partners, a potential blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could be critical for the global economy and markets, pushing oil prices to $130 per barrel. If prices remain at that level for an extended period, a likely outcome in a sustained oil shortage, global inflation will rise, forcing central banks worldwide to return to monetary tightening.

 

In January-May 2025, Russian coal exports unexpectedly returned to growth, despite an unfavorable market situation. Coal supplies to overseas countries saw a 1% year-on-year increase to 81.3 million metric tons, data from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) showed.

The growth is attributed to increased exports to China and Turkey, as well as the expansion of trading, CCI analysts note. In the first five months of 2025, coal exports to China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, grew by 14% to 43 million metric tons, while exports to Turkey increased by 1.5 times to 7.9 million metric tons.

Over the past three years, Russian coal exports have been declining amid sanctions, issues with railway infrastructure, and falling global commodity prices. Data from the Energy Ministry showed that last year, coal supplies abroad stood at 195.9 million metric tons, an 8% decline from 2023.

This year, Russian coal exports have been rising due to a flexible pricing policy of coal suppliers and a partial reduction in logistics costs, Sergey Suverov, an investment strategist at Aricapital, told Vedomosti. According to Dmitry Baranov, lead expert at Finam Management, the positive trend stems from low market prices that encourage additional purchases and favorable freight rates. Some importers chose to build coal reserves in advance amid emptying warehouses and expectations of a hotter-than-usual summer, he explained.

Independent industry expert Maxim Khudalov said that the evolution of trading schemes has enabled Russian companies to circumvent sanctions barriers and increase supplies, even though this has reduced export margins. According to the expert, Russia's eastern regions, capable of maintaining exports to China even amid low coal prices, have stronger export prospects.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on June 18 brushed off Moscow's demands for Kyiv to destroy or dismantle Western-supplied weapons as a condition for a ceasefire, saying it shows disregard for U.S. peace efforts.

"Russian officials make new absurd demands almost every day. Total inadequacy," Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on X.

"Moscow shows complete disregard for the United States' efforts to end the war."

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko raised the demand in an interview with the state-run newspaper Izvestia earlier this week.

"All these surpluses must be destroyed. All international algorithms are known. They must be reduced, disposed of, and guaranteed," Grushko said.

The Kremlin has previously demanded a complete halt on Western military aid to Ukraine as a key condition for a truce. Kyiv and its European partners have rejected this, instead urging increased military assistance to the war-torn country.

The demand reflects Moscow's growing list of maximalist conditions presented in its so-called "peace memorandum" during negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2.

While the recent peace talks ended with an agreement on major prisoner exchanges and repatriation of fallen soldiers, they have failed to achieve a breakthrough in the peace talks.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who initially pledged to broker peace in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office, has become increasingly disengaged in the effort. He has also been reluctant to apply pressure on Moscow to push it to a ceasefire deal despite repeatedly threatening additional sanctions.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor says decision ‘does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause' and ‘invites legislatures to engage in discrimination'

US supreme court upholds ban on youth gender-affirming care

In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision “does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and “invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight”.

This, she said, “authorizes … untold harm to transgender children”.

This case presents an easy question: whether SB1's ban on certain medications, applicable only if used in a manner ‘inconsistent with … sex', contains a sex classification. Because sex determines access to the covered medications, it clearly does. Yet the majority refuses to call a spade a spade. Instead, it obfuscates a sex classification that is plain on the face of this statute, all to avoid the mere possibility that a different court could strike down SB1, or categorical healthcare bans like it.

The Court's willingness to do so here does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight. It also authorizes, without second thought, untold harm to transgender children and the parents and families who love them. Because there is no constitutional justification for that result, I dissent.

She acknowledged her “sadness” and said the decision “abandons transgender children and their families to political whims”.

[T]he majority subjects a law that plainly discriminates on the basis of sex to mere rational-basis review. By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims. In sadness, I dissent.

The stories about Melissa Hortman keep coming in from her colleagues and friends as they grapple with her murder and prepare to honor her at a vigil tonight.

I just caught up with Zack Stephenson, who met Hortman when he was 18 and volunteered on her campaign and now is a state lawmaker and colleague of hers. Stephenson got to work closely with his longtime mentor and friend in what became the final months of her life - he as co-chair of a House committee that worked on the budget and she as speaker emeritus. He's one of several people I spoke to who called Hortman a mentor.

She was a leader who was not afraid to invest in other leaders. It didn't threaten her.

She talked about running for higher office at times, and Stephenson advocated for her to run for governor someday. But she also had a full life outside the office. In one classic example, Stephenson recalled a staff member who said his parents' gardening business was having trouble finding seasonal help. Hortman, an avid gardener, asked how much the gig paid. “She's like, ‘oh, yeah, great. I could pin my earbuds in, listen to disco music and just garden.' And then she was talking about it for weeks,” he said.

She told Democratic committee chairs at the start of the 2023 session to not mistake kindness for weakness - that they could be kind, respectful and still strong leaders, he said. That was how she operated. “No one worked harder than her,” Stephenson said.

Those kind of timeless values of, be kind to people, work hard, care about the institution more than partisan politics, those things really matter. People saw that.

Hortman's style of politics is one way to address the rise in political violence, Stephenson said. She was a successful negotiator because she actually listened to the other side and tried to find solutions. She stayed respectful, though with some humor and barbs here and there. She was a committed Democrat, but was more interested in good governance than partisan wins.

Clearly, what we need is more of that stuff.

Transatlantic airfares have dropped to rates last seen before the pandemic, data shows, the latest sign that fewer Europeans are traveling to the US amid concerns over US border controls and Donald Trump's policies.

The trend could extend into and beyond the summer holiday period, typically the busiest time for airlines and travel companies.

Overseas arrivals to the United States fell 2.8% in May from a year ago, according to preliminary data from the US National Travel and Tourism Office within the US Department of Commerce. Travel from western Europe fell 4.4% in May, led by a decline in travelers from Denmark and Germany.

Forward bookings suggest sustained declines are on the horizon, with total inbound bookings to the US in July down 13% year-over-year, according to OAG Aviation, an analytics firm.

Transatlantic airfare has been declining since the first quarter when Europeans started reconsidering travel to the US after Trump suggested annexing Greenland, launched a global trade war, and issued orders to tighten border policy. A stronger dollar has also deterred some trips.

I talked with Minnesota's Republican House speaker Lisa Demuth, a colleague and friend of Melissa Hortman's who worked closely with her in a tied state House this year.

Demuth said she learned a ton by watching how Hortman worked, and despite their political differences, they had a mutual respect. She recalled their shared love of Cheetos as a late-night snack during long legislative sessions and said Hortman was always direct, true to her word and looking for creative solutions even in rocky times.

Since Hortman's death by a gunman this weekend, Demuth, who is leading the chamber through this moment, said the body's human resources department is working to get resources to all members of the legislature and staff to make sure they have assistance. For her personally, on the fifth day since the murders, she said she has cried less today.

A vigil is planned for the state capitol this evening. Hortman's family has also put up a GoFundMe to support the Hortmans' two adult children with the costs of their parents' funerals and repairs to the home, cars and garage that were damaged by the shootings. “In the ensuing police response to capture the assassin, their home, garage and cars were severely damaged in a hail of bullets, stun grenades and tear gas canisters,” the fundraiser notes.

People are checking in with each other, Demuth said, and “there's an extra layer of compassion, not dependent on political alignment, but just people are like, how are you doing? And genuinely asking that and pausing for a response.”

In a time of heightened divisiveness, the tragic shootings can give people an opportunity to extend grace to each other regardless of their political disagreements and see each other first as people, she said.

“There are those moments that are fewer now than maybe they were years ago, something that we can recapture, where we can know each other as people,” Demuth said. “And then even when we disagree, it doesn't have to become personal.”

Donald Trump has once again knocked Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell for what he expected would be a decision not to lower interest rates and said the man he put in the role during his last term had done a poor job.

Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, mused about appointing himself to lead the US central bank, based on his dissatisfaction with Powell.

Maybe I should go to the Fed. Am I allowed to appoint myself at the Fed? I'd do a much better job than these people.

Trump has long criticized Powell and sparked market concern earlier this year when he suggested the central bank chief's termination couldn't come fast enough.

Trump has since walked back from that rhetoric, saying he would not fire Powell before his term as chair ends next year, but he has not held back on his broader criticism – he has called Powell a “major loser” – and has made clear that he will not ask Powell to stay on as the central bank's leader.

He told reporters:

What I'm going to do is, you know, he gets out in about nine months, he has to, he gets fortunately terminated ... I would have never reappointed him, Biden reappointed him. I don't know why that is, but I guess maybe he was a Democrat ... he's done a poor job.

The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged today as its policymakers weigh signs of a cooling economy, the risk of higher inflation from US import tariffs, and the escalating crisis in the Middle East.

Trump expressed disappointment in advance of the decision and underscored his belief that the Fed had been too late at cutting rates.

I call him ‘too late Powell' because he's always too late. I mean, if you look at him, every time I did this I was right 100%, he was wrong.

Vinay Prasad, the director of the US Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, has been named as the health regulator's chief medical and science officer, STAT News reports, citing an internal memo.

Prasad will also lead the center that regulates vaccines, and gene therapies. The agency's chief scientist and chief medical officer have typically been two distinct roles. Prasad will now hold three separate jobs at the agency, solidifying his position as a top adviser to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who announced the appointment to the staff, according to the STAT News report.

Pete Hegseth said that he would remove military troops from American cities that Trump deployed to assist federal law enforcement officers if the Defense Department is directed to as a result of a supreme court ruling.

“If the supreme court orders you to remove troops from American cities, will you do so?” asked senator Elizabeth Warren.

“As I've said senator, I don't believe district courts should determine national security policy, but if the supreme court rules on a topic, we will abide by that,” the defense secretary said.

Trump deployed National Guard troops and US Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against the administration's immigration enforcement policies. The move sparked widespread controversy, including among the leaders of the Los Angeles police department and California governor Gavin Newsom.

The US supreme court has ruled against the state of Texas and oil industry interests in their challenge to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) authority to license certain nuclear waste storage facilities.

The 6-3 ruling reversed a lower court's decision declaring a license awarded by the NRC to a company called Interim Storage Partners to operate a nuclear waste storage in western Texas unlawful. The NRC is the federal agency that regulates nuclear energy in the US.

The NRC issued a license in 2021 to Interim Storage Partners, a joint venture of France-based Orano and Dallas-based Waste Control Specialists, to build a nuclear waste storage facility in Andrews County in Texas, near the New Mexico border.

The US government and the company had appealed the decision by the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals that the NRC lacked authority to issue the license based on a law called the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The appeal was brought under Democratic former President Joe Biden and was continued under Republican president Donald Trump.

Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, released a statement following the Supreme court decision upholding the Tennessee ban on youth gender-affirming care. The statement says that the ruling is “yet another example of why governments, politicians, courts, and extremists have no place in the exam room.” It reads:

“We are profoundly disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision to side with the Tennessee legislature's anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.

Gender-affirming care is proven to save lives. Major medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, support gender-affirming medical and psychological care because it saves lives and improves mental well-being. Providers, pediatricians, and specialists have been making thoughtful, evidence-based, and age-appropriate health care decisions with families and transgender patients for decades.

Equal access to health care and bodily autonomy are fundamental human rights for every person, including our transgender children and youth. Instead of protecting young transgender people across the nation, states will now feel emboldened to codify discrimination more broadly in health care. This ruling is yet another example of why governments, politicians, courts, and extremists have no place in the exam room, endangering every transgender person. The consequences of this devastating decision will be felt by anyone who needs gender-affirming care; worse for transgender patients already facing widespread discrimination in hostile states.

The Tennessee Equality Project fought this bill in the 2023 legislative session, then stood up for Tennesseans on the steps of the Supreme Court on December 4th, 2024. We are even more determined in our fight for transgender rights across Tennessee and call on our allies to honor transgender youth by taking actions in state and local government. To our transgender community, we see you, we love you, and we stand with you.”

US senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said today that he has asked the Trump administration to provide all 100 senators a classified briefing on the situation unfolding between Israel and Iran that has resulted in days of the two countries trading missile attacks.

“We've gotten briefings and I have requested that we get an all-senators classified briefing,” Schumer said, adding that he believes it will be granted.

Speaking outside the White House, Donald Trump declined to answer reporters' questions on whether the US was planning to join Israel in launching air strikes on Iran or its nuclear facilities.

He said Iran had “reached out” and “wants to negotiate” but he feels “it's very late to be talking”.

“There's a big difference between now and a week ago,” Trump said. “Nobody knows what I'm going to do.”

Trump said that Iran had proposed to come for talks at the White House. He did not provide details. He described Iran as totally defenceless, with “no air defence whatsoever”.

Meanwhile, defence secretary Pete Hegseth told the Senate armed services committee the US military is “prepared to execute” any decision Trump might make on matters of war and peace, even as he declined to confirm preparations of strike options on Iran.

“If and when those decisions are made, the Department [of Defense] is prepared to execute them,” Hegseth said.

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called the decision part of the Republican “cruel crusade against trans kids” to divert attention away from proposed cuts to Medicaid.

Republicans' cruel crusade against trans kids is all an attempt to divert attention from ripping healthcare away from millions of Americans. We'll keep fighting and we'll keep marching on.

In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision “does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and “invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight”.

This, she said, “authorizes … untold harm to transgender children”.

This case presents an easy question: whether SB1's ban on certain medications, applicable only if used in a manner ‘inconsistent with … sex', contains a sex classification.

The supreme court's 6-3 decision is a major blow to the transgender community at a time when the Trump administration has taken steps to roll back gains made in recent years.

The court's majority opinion was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by the other five members of the conservative wing. The three liberal justices dissented.

Roberts wrote:

This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements.

A Tennessee state law banning gender-affirming care for minors can stand, the US supreme court has ruled, a devastating loss for trans rights supporters in a case that could set a precedent for dozens of other lawsuits involving the rights of transgender children.

The justices' 6-3 decision effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by the Trump administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to the one in Tennessee.

The case, United States v Skrmetti, was filed last year by three families of trans children and a provider of gender-affirming care. In oral arguments, the plaintiffs – as well as the US government, then helmed by Joe Biden – argued that Tennessee's law constituted sex-based discrimination and thus violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. Under Tennessee's law, someone assigned female at birth could not be prescribed testosterone, but someone assigned male at birth could receive those drugs.

Tennessee, meanwhile, has argued that the ban is necessary to protect children from what it termed “experimental” medical treatment. During arguments, the conservative justices seemed sympathetic to that concern, although every major medical and mental health organization in the US has found that gender-affirming care can be evidence-based and medically necessary. These groups also oppose political bans on such care.

In recent years, the question of transgender children and their rights has consumed an outsized amount of rightwing political discourse. Since 2021, 26 states have passed bans on gender-affirming care for minors, affecting nearly 40% of trans youth in the US. Twenty-six states have also outlawed trans kids from playing on sports teams that correspond with their gender identity.

Many of these restrictions have been paused by court challenges, but the supreme court's decision could have vast implications for those lawsuits' futures. A study by the Trevor Project, a mental health nonprofit that aims to help LGBTQ+ kids, found that anti-trans laws are linked to a 72% increase of suicide attempts among trans and nonbinary youth.

In a vivid illustration of the enormous schism on the American right over the Iran question, clips from Tucker Carlson's interview yesterday in which he calls out Texas senator Ted Cruz for not knowing basic facts about Iran have gone viral. The full interview will be out today.

Cruz, who has called for regime change in Iran, could not answer basic facts about the country, including its population size and ethnic makeup, spurring a shouting match with Carlson. At one point a fuming Carlson says to Cruz:

You're a senator who's calling for the overthrow of the government and you don't know anything about the country!

The former Fox News host has been highly critical of the prospect of Trump getting involved in Israel's war with Iran for being at odds with his isolationist “America First” approach to foreign policy and his administration's pledge to keep America out of “forever wars” in the Middle East. Trump has responded to his criticisms by repeating his stance that “Iran can't have nuclear weapon”.

Ted Cruz on Iran. Full interview tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/hJNwAHAnxZ

The exchange represents the wider dilemma Trump finds himself in with the issue threatening to split his Maga base, with even Georgia congresswoman and Trump loyalist Marjorie Taylor Greene leaping to Carlson's defence in a major break with the president, saying that anyone who supported intervention in Iran was not “America First”.

Yesterday conservative Republican congressman Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, sided with Democrats to introduce a bill that would block the president from engaging US forces in “unauthorised hostilities” with Iran without congressional approval. “This is not our war,” he said on X.

Trump's former political strategist, Steve Bannon, also argued on Carlson's podcast that allowing the “deep state” to drive the US into a war with Iran would “blow up” the coalition of Trump supporters.

Women across the political spectrum are more concerned about the state of the US economy and inflation under Donald Trump than men are, according to a new exclusive poll for the Guardian.

More Democrats than Republicans are now concerned about the economy following the president's return to power. But pessimism was higher for women even among Republicans and independents, according to a new Harris poll.

Overall, 62% of women and 47% of men said that the economy and inflation is getting worse, a gap of 15 percentage points. The gender gap crossed party lines with both Democratic and Republican women expressing greater concerns about the economy than men.

“Here's what everyone missed: women aren't being pessimistic about the economy – they're being realistic,” said Libby Rodney, chief strategy officer of Harris Poll.

Women are experiencing the sharp edge of inflation on essentials like groceries and childcare in ways that stock portfolios can't capture.

Across questions about their outlook on the state of the economy, most respondents (78%) expressed concerns about the amount of uncertainty, particularly around prices. Yet women appear to be bearing the brunt of Trump's economic policy, particularly around his tariffs.

More women (71%) than men (62%) reported being their household's primary shopper. This difference in household shopping responsibility translates into broader gaps in concern over affordability and prices:

More women said they are very worried about food prices (52% of women compared to 39% of men)

More women said they're spending more time trying to find deals or go to more affordable stores (36% versus 26%)

More women said their financial security is getting worse because of their difficulty in affording essential goods and services (55% versus 46%)

The differences increased when respondents were asked about their comfort in affording their lifestyles in the current economy, including affording a family, a home, life as a single individual, and childcare. Just 27% of women said they felt comfortable affording a family now, compared to 43% of men.

Although confidence in switching jobs was low among all respondents, 34% of men were confident in a job switch compared to 25% of women. Women are also more pessimistic about receiving a meaningful raise this year: 54% of women said they think they'll get a raise, compared to 63% of men.

US Senate Democrats have demanded health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr make public the reviews on which his department said it based its decision to cancel a contract for developing a bird flu vaccine.

Donald Trump's administration last month canceled a $590m contract awarded to Moderna in January by outgoing president Joe Biden's administration for the late-stage development of its bird flu vaccine for humans, as well as the right to purchase shots.

“This is a grievous mistake that threatens to leave the country unprepared for what experts fear might be the next pandemic - and there appears to be no rationale for this decision other than your ill-informed and dangerous war on vaccines,” senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth wrote in a letter seen by Reuters.

The cancellation endangers American lives and will likely contribute to a 20% rise in the price of eggs this year, they wrote to Kennedy, who has a long history of questioning the safety of vaccines contrary to scientific evidence.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services at the time said the contract was canceled after a comprehensive internal review determined the project did not meet the scientific standards or safety expectations required for continued federal investment.

Warren and Duckworth demanded Kennedy make the review public, alongside a similar review the department cited when it cut funding of a $258m program researching an HIV vaccine. They also asked for a detailed description of how the department decided to end the contracts, and a staff briefing.

“You have failed to justify either of these moves to cripple vaccine research,” Warren and Duckworth wrote. “Furthermore, these decisions appear to be part of your larger, unfounded vendetta against mRNA technology.”

Kennedy named eight members last week to serve on a panel of vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including some who have advocated against vaccines, days after abruptly firing all 17 members who had been serving on the independent committee of experts.

Several of his appointees specifically oppose the mRNA vaccine technology used in some of the newest immunizations such as the Covid-19 vaccine, including by Moderna.

MOSCOW, June 18. /TASS/. The Iran-Israel conflict has pushed Ukraine to the sidelines, as US President Donald Trump is more interested in playing his game in the Persian Gulf, Viktor Medvedchuk, head of the Other Ukraine movement and former leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party banned in Ukraine, said.

According to him, Washington is pulling back from pumping Kiev with weapons, as the US sees this as a threat to its own economy. He noted that even Vladimir Zelensky "has realized that the US's incredible generosity is over."

"It wasn't hard to predict that the US would abandon Zelensky's Ukraine at the most inconvenient moment for the Kiev regime. The illegitimate can only 'win' on television — and only if opposition media are eliminated. The Iran-Israel war has pushed the Ukrainian conflict into the background," Medvedchuk wrote in his opinion piece on the Smotrim.ru website.

He also emphasized that under the new paradigm, the burden of financing the Zelensky regime may fall on the shoulders of the Europeans - but they "will have to dig deep into their pockets."

In the politician's opinion, it would be more advantageous for European intelligence services to stage a provocation, although they are clearly late to act.

"Israel is much more successful in drawing the US into its war with Iran," he noted.

Medvedchuk added that Trump is more interested in the conflict in the Middle East, as he is forced to "play by the British rules in Ukraine."

"The other option is to play his own risky game in the Persian Gulf. So far, Trump is choosing the second scenario," he stated.

Medvedchuk also stressed that, against this backdrop, the US leader "does not want to declare Russia an ‘evil empire,' as he is counting on its mediation in resolving the Iranian issue."

PM managed to successfully balance foreign and domestic political considerations during his three days in Canada

There was one defining image from Keir Starmer's intense diplomatic shift at the G7 summit in Canada: him bending at Donald Trump's waist level to collect spilled pages of a UK-US trade deal. Defining, perhaps. But definitely partial.

Arguably more significant was a slightly more prosaic snap slipped out on the Downing Street Flickr feed a day before, showing Starmer engrossed in a chat with four other world leaders, Emmanuel Macron, Mark Carney, Giorgia Meloni and Friedrich Merz.

By No 10's version, briefed to reporters after the Sunday evening gathering in a hotel at the summit venue in Kananaskis, Starmer and Merz, the German chancellor, happened on each other by chance and began chatting, before the French president and Italian and Canadian prime minister joined in.

This highly informal chat over a glass of wine with no officials present was presented as a general pre-summit discussion. But it would not take much imagination to guess that much of this preparation was based around a perennial subject of modern diplomacy: how to handle Trump.

Taken together, the two vignettes sum up Starmer's balancing act which also takes in foreign and domestic political considerations.

For reasons that even Starmer cheerfully admits he doesn't entirely understand, Trump clearly likes him and regularly says so. As such, Starmer's unofficial role in Canada was to be a sensible voice of liaison with Carney, the host, and others, while also trying to stop the US president wandering too far off-piste.

In terms of overt results, this was not a success. Sitting next to Trump at the leaders' dinner, Starmer helped persuade him to sign up to the one joint G7 statement that emerged, calling on Israel and Iran to pull back from all-out war.

But then, as is so often the case with Trump, came the humiliation. More or less as soon as Starmer had insisted to the media that Trump had no interest in the US joining in against Iran, the already-departed US president was posting about the need for “unconditional surrender” from Tehran, hinting heavily that without this, US armaments could begin to fall.

At the same time, and as much as anyone can claim positives while the world slides ever further into crisis, Starmer's three days in Canada can still in part be viewed as a success, diplomatically and in terms of more domestic considerations.

His first destination was Ottawa for a pre-summit get-together with Carney, the still-new and surprising Canadian prime minister, whom Starmer knows well and talks about warmly in private.

The pair held a private dinner at Rideau Cottage, the temporary official residence for Canadian prime ministers with the usual home, 24 Sussex Drive, stricken by asbestos, mould and rodents, before going to a bar to watch Carney's ice hockey team, the Edmonton Oilers, lose one of the Stanley Cup final games to the Florida Panthers.

The pair then held formal bilateral talks the next day, pledging progress on mutual trade, before heading off to the more remote G7 venue, held in the small resort town of Kananaskis, in Alberta's stretch of the Rocky Mountains.

While the site was remote enough to stop even the faintest hint of protests – leaders were shuttled to and from Calgary airport in Chinook helicopters – it brought other worries, notably bears, with a huge local grizzly known as Boss spotted on the resort golf course the day before Starmer held broadcast interviews there.

Starmer is a keen and seemingly talented diplomat, even if his simultaneous cosying up to Trump, Carney and other leaders could do nothing to make the summit check even one of the current international crises.

But he leaves with some achievements, including Trump's signature on an executive order sealing a US-UK trade deal, which saves British aerospace and car manufacturers from the worst of American tariffs. Some British voters might have qualms about Starmer making such an effort with a president they dislike, but No 10 can, and does, point to tangible benefits.

In his various interactions with the UK press over the course of the summit, including TV interviews and two “huddles”, informal and off-camera press conferences with the print media, one on the flight over, Starmer also made sure to create news.

Flying to Canada he unexpectedly replied to a question on grooming gangs by announcing a national inquiry into them – to the visible surprise of the GB News reporter who asked – and subsequently made punchy criticisms of Conservative politicians for their failure to act.

At the second huddle, another standard-seeming question, on small boats, brought the threat of withholding visas for countries that refuse to take back refused asylum seekers.

Amid all this juggling of the big egos and difficult personalities at the G7, as well as the never-ending sequence of domestic issues to hose down, lies a broader and longer-term goal.

It is a political truism that voters tend not to notice diplomatic news, unless something goes obviously wrong. And it was certainly the case that Rishi Sunak's equally energetic summit efforts brought minimal attention, until he left a D-day event early during the election campaign.

But No 10 officials will be aware that when the next election comes, voters are likely to face a choice of Starmer, Nigel Farage or – perhaps – Kemi Badenoch. If the global scene is anywhere near as chaotic as now, there will be a big contrast between a leader who has shown he can adeptly pick his way around the summit circuit, and two diplomacy novices.

This might not be enough to change the course of an election. But it could concentrate some minds. And as Pierre Poilievre, the Trump-adjacent Conservative vanquished by Carney in Canada's election in April knows only too well, as a politician you entirely write off international affairs at your peril.

David Rosenberg says fraudsters used his name in a scheme that involved luring victims through professional-looking ads on social media.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

A Bay Street veteran and financial commentator is speaking out after finding himself at the centre of an alleged online “pump and dump” scam that used his identity to defraud some investors out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

David Rosenberg, an economist and founder of Rosenberg Research, said ads appearing on Facebook and Instagram as early as March have promoted a fake investment program falsely listing him as its administrator. 

Since then, he's heard from several individuals who lost money to the scheme, a sum Mr. Rosenberg said he believes exceeds $1-million, though the total amount is unknown. 

“We've been flooded with people coming to us and actually asking, is this for real?” Mr. Rosenberg said.

He said alarm bells rang for him when he received a message in April from a close friend asking how to invest through his new “Wolfpack program.”

“They said to me, ‘Is this something that small fish like us can invest in, or is it just for the big fish?'” Mr. Rosenberg said.

Rosenberg Research offers ETF-based model portfolios that clients can mirror, but the firm doesn't offer any investment programs under that name.

In the weeks that followed, Mr. Rosenberg heard from dozens of friends, acquaintances and strangers who were caught up in what appeared to be a pump-and-dump “pig butchering” scam. 

“It's a very vivid visual for a very devastating kind of victimization,” said Vanessa Iafolla, an anti-fraud consultant based in Halifax.

In these types of scams, victims are typically slowly lured over time, often through social media, and persuaded to invest increasingly larger sums through some form of misrepresentation. 

“You're getting this person to trust you,” she said. 

Syed Hasan said he fell prey to the scam in April after stumbling on a Facebook ad for a program that recommended stocks that promised quick returns of 30 to 70 per cent. 

After being added to a WhatsApp group called (03) Rosenberg Investment Strategy, which appeared to include dozens of other investors, Mr. Hasan was recommended to trade in specific stocks. 

The first stock he was pushed to buy had a recommended buy price of $2.91. After investing a small amount in the stock, it skyrocketed to $10 a month later – a 300-per-cent return, which gained his trust.

“You get greedy and think these guys know what they're doing,” he said in an interview.

Emboldened by the first win, Mr. Hasan said he invested in another stock recommended by an administrator of the group pretending to be David Rosenberg. It plummeted from $1.27 to 20 cents during the first 15 minutes of trading hours, resulting in an 80-per-cent loss. 

The first stock that they recommended also tanked 80 per cent at the same time. In total, Mr. Hasan estimated losing $16,000 over the course of the scam. 

Mr. Rosenberg says he and his family tried unsuccessfully to stop the fraud by reporting it to authorities, including the local police and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

While significant, it was still less than other alleged victims who spoke with The Globe. One investor said she lost half a million dollars in just one week after clicking on an ad on Facebook and joining the WhatsApp group. 

Another victim alleged that he lost his life savings of $450,000 after falling for the scam. “At nearly 60 there will be no way to recover from this,” he wrote in an e-mail to Rosenberg Research. 

The Globe is not identifying the alleged victims as they expressed concerns for their safety or professional reputation. 

Mr. Rosenberg said all the investors were lured in by professional-looking ads posted to social media, which then redirected them to a WhatsApp group. 

“They start by doing a proof of concept,” said Jacob Rosenberg, executive vice-president of client relations and operations at Rosenberg Research and Mr. Rosenberg's son.

The scammers presented obscure securities that swung dramatically in price, creating an illusion of quick profits, he said. Once investors handed over money and saw a positive return, they were lured into sending more, Jacob Rosenberg claims.

For the past two months he has been fielding calls and messages from people reporting major losses. “I would be absolutely shocked if this isn't in the millions,” he said. 

Efforts by Mr. Rosenberg and his family to report the fraud to authorities, including local police and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, largely went nowhere, he said. “It was a shrug of the shoulders.” Mr. Rosenberg added that the response prompted him to go public. 

But although investors reported their experiences to Mr. Rosenberg, they have not filed complaints with the police. Det. David Coffey from the Toronto police financial crimes unit said that law enforcement officials need victims to come forward in order to investigate. “We haven't had any victims report it,” he said.

Perpetrators behind these types of scams are often located outside the country and tracing a notoriously “murky” crime requires a wider effort involving telecom and social media companies, Det. Coffey said. 

“Investment fraud, it's the most prominent, most financially damaging, most profitable fraud,” he said. “There is a lot of money to be made, they're making billions and billions.”

Investment scams in Canada were responsible for about $311-million in reported losses in 2024, and 3,866 reported victims, up 6 per cent from the previous year, according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. The agency estimates that 90 to 95 per cent of fraud goes unreported.

Next week, when European and North American leaders gather in The Hague for the NATO summit, the main topics of discussion will be familiar: transatlantic burden sharing and national defense spending targets. Leaders will compare their efforts, tout increased budgets, and perhaps commit to the mutual goal of spending the equivalent of five percent of GDP on defense. This focus on dollars and euros is understandable given U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for more European contributions, but it misses a more profound question. Once it is paid for, who will oversee and take responsibility for Europe's defense?

To truly shift the burden from Washington to its allies, increased spending is necessary but not sufficient. NATO also needs to change the distribution of leadership and responsibility within the alliance. For over 75 years, NATO has operated under an implicit bargain: the United States leads, and Europe follows. The clearest manifestation of that arrangement is that the post of supreme allied commander for Europe, NATO's top military position, has always been held by an American.

During the Cold War, that practice made sense. The United States had the leading role in European security and so its general should lead the alliance. But today, a changing strategic landscape and the direction of U.S. domestic politics mean that the United States will not fill that role much longer. Europe now needs to lead the alliance, and to do that, a European needs to take the position of supreme allied commander.

Not long ago, this would have been considered a fringe position. For NATO's European members, it still is. But according to NBC News, the Trump administration considered whether to give up the commander's role, known as SACEUR, as part of a broader restructuring and cost-cutting initiative. In preparing for the Hague summit, the United States ultimately decided to retain the position, but it cannot continue to do so indefinitely. Europe and the United States should use this summit to prepare for a European SACEUR.

Opponents of such a move raise several concerns, including the legal and cultural difficulties of putting a European in control of the tens of thousands of U.S. forces still in Europe; the risk that the U.S. nuclear deterrent in Europe may not seem as credible to adversaries if Washington is not in command; and the general lack of European readiness to assume command. But there are solutions to overcome each of these obstacles—and now is the time to start applying them.

The original transatlantic bargain was built on the simple midcentury reality of American preeminence and European weakness. In 1949, Europe lay in ruins, and the United States provided not just military leadership but also economic lifelines and political cohesion. NATO's architecture of command reflects that asymmetry. Today, the political and economic reality is very different, and yet the asymmetric command structure persists, preventing Europeans from assuming the role they need to take in defending their own continent. The combined economies of European NATO members dwarf that of Russia. And European militaries, albeit uneven and lacking in key capabilities, are becoming more well funded and reform-minded. The threat landscape has also evolved. The challenges NATO faces today are ones that Europe, with the right structures and commitments, can and should take the lead in confronting. The United States, meanwhile, is changing its strategic focus away from Europe. A bipartisan consensus in Washington holds that China is the country's principal long-term challenge, and as a result, American attention and resources are flowing to the Pacific.

Perhaps more fundamentally, Americans increasingly believe that Europe should be able to take care of itself. The success of Trump's “America first” movement, not to mention his frequent threats to abandon the defense of Europe, should send a clear message that no matter what steps European governments take regarding defense, the era of U.S. leadership on the continent is coming to an end.

European leaders can either prepare for such a change or remain dangerously dependent on a partner whose attention tends to wander. Appointing a European supreme allied commander would be a key step in that preparation. It would be a tangible expression of Europe's willingness to assume responsibility for its own defense. A European commander would not require ending the U.S. role in NATO. It would signal, instead, that Europeans are ready to lead, not just passively follow American commands.

This would likely appeal to parts of the United States government—at least the parts outside of the uniformed military. As the United States looks to move its focus and resources toward Asia, giving up the commander position would allow the United States to remain part of NATO while also increasing Europe's responsibility for its own defense. The U.S. nuclear umbrella could continue to protect Europe, but the burdens of leadership would be shifted.

Currently, the supreme allied commander wears two hats; he also serves as the head of U.S. European Command, which oversees all U.S. forces in Europe. Because a European commander would lack that authority over the U.S. military presence in Europe, some fear that there would be friction in crisis scenarios. Before directing U.S. forces, for instance, the SACEUR would have to negotiate military responses with the U.S. political leadership.

But this is not an insurmountable problem. NATO's history is full of examples of shared command structures, such as the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. One possible solution would be for a European commander to be supported by a U.S. deputy commander who would retain authority over American forces, manage nuclear coordination, and ensure compliance with U.S. law.

Some argue that only an American general or admiral can effectively command U.S. troops. Yet U.S. troops have often served under non-American commanders, including in the UN operations in East Timor and Lebanon, in NATO operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan, and even in the EU-led mission in Bosnia. As in those cases, while a European commander could exercise NATO operational authority, the United States would retain the ultimate authority over its forces. A carefully structured arrangement, including a formal role for the U.S. deputy commander, could ensure compliance with U.S. legal frameworks while maintaining integrated NATO operations.

Concerns about nuclear deterrence are similarly overstated. The worry is that NATO's opponents would not believe that the U.S. government would ever support a European supreme allied commander's request for nuclear support. But what matters for nuclear deterrence is the credibility of the alliance's nuclear posture, which relies on both political will and operational clarity regardless of the nationality of the SACEUR. That credibility could be preserved under a European commander with a clear division of responsibilities: the European commander would oversee conventional operations, while nuclear responsibilities remained firmly under U.S. purview through the deputy commander. NATO's established protocols for the use of nuclear weapons would remain fundamentally unchanged. Adversaries would understand that NATO's deterrent remained intact, even as its military leadership evolved.



Another objection is that no European exists who has the talent and experience to fill the post of supreme allied commander. American four-star generals and admirals are groomed to lead combatant commands such as the European Command usually after overseeing tens of thousands of forces and handling large-scale multinational and joint operations. By contrast, no European officer today has commanded multinational forces on that scale in decades. No British general, for example, has commanded even a single deployed division (roughly 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers) since 2003 in the Iraq war.

This is a reasonable concern. But the only way to create European experience is to assign European responsibility. To accept the argument that Europeans have become incapable of rising to this level of leadership is to essentially condemn NATO to American leadership in perpetuity—and the United States will not accept that task forever. The leadership needs to change, and individual Europeans will need to grow into the role.

The process does not need to be rushed. To ensure a smooth transition, NATO could take a phased approach. The current supreme allied commander, U.S. General Christopher Cavoli, assumed the role in July 2022 and will likely hand over the reins to U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Alexus Grynkewich sometime this summer. Coincident with his appointment, the allies should agree at next week's summit that the next SACEUR will be European, as part of the expected progress in European capability development. A multiyear road map could include increased European command roles in NATO operations, expanded joint exercises, and a formal restructuring of the command hierarchy to accommodate shared leadership.

TRUST AND EVOLVE

The real barrier to a European supreme allied commander is not the lack of capability, doctrine, or personnel—it is the lack of political will. For decades, Europe has relied on American leadership not only because of U.S. power but also because doing so absolved Europeans of having to make difficult command decisions, resolved internal European disputes over who would lead within Europe, and helped cement the U.S. presence in Europe.

That dynamic is changing. France, Germany, Poland, and others are boosting defense budgets. EU initiatives are fostering greater defense cooperation. NATO's own defense planning process is pushing members to close capability gaps. The pieces of a more capable European pillar in NATO are slowly falling into place. What's needed now is a strong signal to adversaries and allies alike that Europe is both paying more and ready to lead.

The appointment of a European commander would be that signal. It would reflect Europe's progress while also accelerating it. It would place Europe at the center of its own defense while preserving U.S. engagement in a more sustainable form.

Ultimately, this is a question not just of power but of trust. Do Americans trust Europeans to command the alliance? Do Europeans trust themselves to command, and can they trust one another to agree on who should be the commander? If the answers to those questions are no, then the future of the NATO alliance will be bleak. After all, how can Europeans lead if they can't even take command? A NATO that evolves into a partnership of equals, however, will be stronger, more cohesive, and more resilient in the face of future threats. The time to start that evolution is now.

On June 12, Israel unleashed a series of strikes that damaged Iranian nuclear facilities and missile sites, destroyed gas depots, and, critically, killed scores of top regime officials. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei remains alive. But his most important deputies—including Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of the armed forces, and Hossein Salami, the commander in chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—are dead.

A few years ago, the sudden, near-simultaneous killing of Bagheri, Salami, and a host of other senior leaders would have been unthinkable. Over three decades, the hard-liners who control Iran's regime had built up what seemed like a formidable system of deterrence. They stockpiled ballistic missiles. They developed and advanced a nuclear enrichment program. Most important, they established a network of foreign proxies that could routinely harass Israeli and U.S. forces.

But Iran's hard-liners overplayed their hand. After Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, the regime's leaders opted for a campaign of maximum aggression. Rather than letting Hamas and Israel fight it out, they unleashed their proxies at Israeli targets. Israel, in turn, was compelled to expand its offensive beyond Gaza. It succeeded in severely degrading Hezbollah, the most powerful of Tehran's proxy groups, and eviscerating Iranian positions in Syria—indirectly contributing to the collapse of the Assad regime. Iran responded to this aggression by unleashing the two largest ballistic missile attacks ever launched against Israel. But Israel, backed by the U.S. military and other partners, repelled those attacks and incurred little damage. It then struck back.

With that, the foundation of Iran's deterrence strategy crumbled. Its ruling regime became more vulnerable and exposed than at any point since the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. And Israel, which has dreamed of striking Iran for decades, had an opportunity it decided it could not pass up.

Since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, leaders in Tehran have cultivated a web of proxies—Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and militias in Iraq—and developed ties with the Assad regime in Syria. These regional alliances, paired with Tehran's robust ballistic missile program, allowed Iran to threaten adversaries directly and from afar, giving hard-liners core sources of power. The country's leadership wasn't immune to pressure: it pursued nuclear negotiations with the United States in 2015, for example, to help alleviate the economic pain created by sanctions. But even these talks facilitated Iran's rise as a regional power. The resulting Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action provided Tehran with extensive sanctions relief without limits on its defense, other than temporary guardrails on enrichment. In 2018, the United States withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed sanctions. But Iran's consequent nuclear provocations served as a lightning rod to absorb outside pressure and insulate the regime's other malign behavior.

In October 2023, the Islamic Republic was peaking. It exerted heavy influence over a wide swath of land, from Iraq to the Mediterranean. It had bullied neighboring Arab rivals, namely Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, into submission. And Iranian proxies, armed with rockets, missiles, and drones, were keeping constant pressure on Israel.



The October 7 attacks seemed, at first, to only further empower Iran. After all, Tehran's primary regional adversary was suddenly enmeshed in an all-consuming conflict. Iran thus encouraged its proxies to join the fight against Israel, creating a united, regionwide front under Tehran's leadership. Hezbollah's persistent rocket fire into northern Israel forced civilians there to flee the towns near the border with Lebanon. In Yemen, the Houthis expanded their attacks to commercial shipping in the Red Sea, putting a severe strain on global commerce and compelling the United States to concentrate significant naval power and resources on countering their aggression. By mid-2024, Iran and its proxies were seriously testing the U.S.-led regional order.

Yet within a few short months, Iran's regional framework all but collapsed. Israeli military offensives eviscerated Hamas in Gaza and devastated Hezbollah in Lebanon—key nodes in Iran's decades-long pressure campaign against Israel. Then came the surprising fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, in December. Syria had been vital to Iran's larger deterrence architecture not only because it presented another front against Israel but also because Syrian territory—which shares a long border with Lebanon and northern Israel—contained the main route through which Iran supplied weapons to Hezbollah and to Palestinian militants in the West Bank.

In the face of these setbacks, Iran could have opted to regroup. Instead, it opted to escalate the conflict with Israel by directly striking the country in April and October 2024. By taking such action, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had hoped to showcase its military might and reestablish deterrence. Instead, the IRGC exposed the limitations of its missile capabilities. Even though the April and October strikes were the largest-ever ballistic missile attacks against Israel, Israel's vaunted air defenses, combined with those of the United States and its regional partners, intercepted almost all of Iran's drones and missiles. The small handful that did strike Israeli territory either missed their targets or did insignificant damage.

The attacks exposed Iran as weak. They also prompted Israel to hit back against Iran directly, using its superior airpower to destroy key Iranian air defense batteries and military facilities in October, shattering the final barrier that had previously prevented Tehran's adversaries from using military force against its territory. Iranian deterrence collapsed.

Despite the setbacks the Iranian regime had suffered, its leadership and military commanders were far from admitting defeat at the beginning of 2025. In a March 2025 speech, Salami rejected the idea that Iran had lost its competitive edge, touting the Islamic Republic's very survival as proof of the effectiveness of its grand strategy. The regime, after all, had been at war not with small powers but with large ones that had the most advanced weapons, equipment, and militaries. “It is miraculous that our nation has been able to stand up to arrogant powers,” Salami said. He struck a similar tone in a May speech, stating, “A nation [that] is not captive, a nation [that] raises the banner of resistance and acts on the words of its supreme leader with all its heart, such a nation will never be defeated.”

Now, of course, Salami is dead, and it is harder than ever for Iran to claim it has won its engagements. In just a few days, Israel has done significant damage to Tehran's military and nuclear program. Although the true scale of the destruction is known only to Iranian leaders, it is unlikely that the country will easily rebound from this low ebb. Perhaps most significant, Iran has lost nearly all of its ability to defend its skies from adversaries. Its once hailed air defenses have been destroyed or made inoperable across most of the country. Its missile stockpiles have been depleted, many of its mobile launchers have been destroyed, and the facilities it used to manufacture missiles and process their fuel lie mostly in smoldering ruins. Finally, much of Iran's nuclear enrichment program has been damaged or destroyed. Iran may still possess a stockpile of highly enriched uranium and some underground cascades of centrifuges. But in the near term, nuclear enrichment no longer provides deterrent value.

Added to this is the loss of the defense establishment's brain trust. The assassinations of numerous veteran commanders and military officials, including General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the IRGC's Aerospace Force and the architect of its missile strategy, will leave a gaping hole in the regime and erase knowledge built on decades of experience. The regime has already replaced these commanders, but what cannot be duplicated so quickly is the trust that their predecessors had earned from Khamenei, the commander in chief, and the influence that they held over the regime's grand strategy.



Faced with such a defeat, the regime could accept defeat, cut its losses, and seek compromise with Israel and the United States. That path, at the very least, would require the regime to abandon enrichment. It could also mean that Tehran has to give up its missile program, end support to proxies, and renounce its goal of destroying Israel. But as much as the Iranian people would prefer this outcome, for the regime it would be tantamount to total surrender, viewed as a solution that would portend the eventual collapse of Iran's ruling theocratic system.

To avoid a total surrender, Khamenei could also keep the fight going. That might include going for a nuclear breakout. Assuming Iran still possesses its stockpile of highly enriched uranium and retains the know-how, the regime could still try to test a nuclear device, hoping that becoming a nuclear state will restore a measure of its lost deterrence. Tehran could also continue to wage war, aiming to either exhaust Israel's will to fight or increase support for the regime among the Iranian people. The regime may even hope that Israel expands its strikes, or aim to draw in the United States, believing that if more Iranian civilians are killed, Iranian society will become more sympathetic toward the country's only defenders: the regime. That “rally around the flag” effect is, at this point, the regime's last remaining hope to get Iranians on its side.

But increased aggression is a very dicey bet and could leave the regime isolated and broke. The longer the war continues, the greater the destruction the country will face, which would reduce the regime's capacity to simply operate. If there is no rally around the flag effect, or if it eventually passes, the Islamic Republic's citizens could ultimately turn on the regime. And if the government secures a nuclear weapon in order to safeguard its hold on power, Iran could end up looking quite a lot like North Korea—a scenario no Iranian would want.

Whatever happens, the Iranian regime has doubtless lost its decades-long conflict with Israel. It will either have to give up its foundational political ideology and seek integration with the rest of the region through diplomatic and economic engagement, or it will need to double down on its beliefs, drawing further into itself. Ali Khamenei and the IRGC have lost; the regional status quo they established is finished.

China Cove is a small, crescent-shaped bay west of Tobermory, Ont. It is home to several rare and threatened species and the site of a 19th-century shipwreck.Supplied

One of the last unprotected stretches of wild shoreline along the iconic Bruce Peninsula in Southern Ontario has been saved from development. 

On Tuesday, the Nature Conservancy of Canada announced the purchase of 29 hectares of land adjacent to China Cove, a small, crescent-shaped bay located west of Tobermory, Ont., near the site of a 19th-century shipwreck.

The property includes nearly one kilometre of undisturbed waterfront and is home to several rare and threatened species including the Massasauga rattlesnake and Hill's thistle.

Both favour the area's alvar terrain, which consists of patches of bare or thinly covered limestone that stretch from the shoreline into the surrounding woods and host a unique assembly of species.

“They're kind of this beautiful world that unfolds in miniature,” said Esme Batten, the conservancy's program director for Midwestern Ontario, who called the area “a spectacular property.”

The cove is flanked by private lakeside homes to the north and south. Until Tuesday's announcement, it was set to be similarly divided into lots and sold off, Ms. Batten said.

Instead, the entire property was acquired by the Nature Conservancy with help from a combination of government and non-government partners and foundations.

That means the undeveloped stretch of shoreline will be kept in its natural state. It is a relatively small but important element in a larger network of public and protected lands that cover some 24,200 hectares across the peninsula. 

As an extension of the Niagara escarpment, the Bruce Peninsula (also known as the Saugeen Peninsula) is considered a region of global biological significance.

Jarmo Jalava, an ecology adviser with the Saugeen Ojibway Nation Environment Office who knows the peninsula and its wildlife well, praised the announcement from the Nature Conservancy.

While the preservation of natural habitat can be a challenge in any location that attracts tourists and developers, he said, the challenge is magnified when that location is a peninsula where displaced species have limited room to manoeuvre around human activity.

“That's where the connectivity becomes extra important because there are many species that can't fly like birds or can't just dart across the road and get over to a new place,” Mr. Jalava said.

Other important species at China Cove include the Midland painted turtle and the ram's-head lady's slipper, a type of orchid.

The property is also frequented by black bears and is a stopping off point for migrating birds making their way along the Lake Huron shore every year.

The name of the cove is derived from the China, a schooner that foundered on a rocky reef during a snowstorm in November, 1883. Although the crew were saved, the ship broke up and went down in the frigid waters.

The Nature Conservancy said it has rechristened the property Aah Mahwi Nibi, which means Crying Water – an Indigenous name that Ms. Batten said was suggested by an advisory board member and elder from the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation.

President Donald Trump is refusing to be drawn on whether he will order U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. “I may do it, I may not do it,” he says.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday he doesn't want to carry out a U.S. strike on Iran but suggested he stands ready to act if it's necessary to extinguish Iran's nuclear program.

Trump continued his increasingly pointed warnings about the U.S. joining Israel in striking at Tehran's nuclear program as Iran's leader warned anew that the United States would be greeted with stiff retaliation if it attacks.

The stakes are high for Trump — and the world — as he engages in a push-pull debate between his goals of avoiding dragging the U.S. into another war and preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

“I'm not looking to fight,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “But if it's a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.”

Trump earlier on Wednesday told reporters that it's not “too late” for Iran to give up its nuclear program.

“I may do it, I may not do it,” Trump said of a potential U.S. strike in another exchange with reporters at the White House on Wednesday. “I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do.”

“Nothing is finished until it is finished,” he added, signaling a decision could soon. “The next week is going to be very big — maybe less than a week.”

Trump also offered a terse response to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's refusal to heed to his call for Iran to submit to an unconditional surrender.

“I say good luck,” Trump said.

Khamenei earlier in the day warned that any U.S. strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them” and that his country would not bow to Trump's call for surrender.




Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told lawmakers that the Pentagon was providing possible options to Trump as he decides next steps on Iran.

Trump had said Tuesday the U.S. knows where Khamenei is hiding but doesn't want him killed — “for now.”

“He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump said. 

Trump's increasingly muscular comments toward the Iranian government follow him urging Tehran's 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his participation in an international summit earlier this week to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team.

Trump said that the Iranian officials continue to reach out to the White House as they're “getting the hell beaten out of them” by Israel. But he added there's a “big difference between now and a week ago” in Tehran's negotiating position.

“They've suggested that they come to the White House— that's, you know, courageous,” Trump said.

Iran's mission to the United Nations rejected Trump's claim in a statement on social media. “No Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House. The only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to ‘take out' Iran's Supreme Leader. ”

The U.S. president said earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to serve as a mediator with Iran. But Trump said he told Putin to keep focused on finding an endgame to his own conflict with Ukraine.

“I said, ‘Do me a favor, mediate your own,'” Trump said he told Putin. “I said, ‘Vladimir, let's mediate Russia first. You can worry about this later.'”

The comments represented a shift for Trump, who earlier this week said he was “open” to Putin's offer to mediate.

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said earlier Wednesday that Moscow has cautioned Washington against offering direct military assistance to Israel.

“We are warning Washington against even speculative, hypothetical considerations of the sort,” Ryabkov said, according to the Interfax news agency. “That would be a step drastically destabilizing the situation as a whole.”

The Russia-Iran relationship has deepened since Putin launched a war on Ukraine in February 2022, with Tehran providing Moscow with drones, ballistic missiles, and other support, according to U.S. intelligence findings.

Trump is also facing growing skepticism about deepening U.S. involvement in the Mideast crisis from some of his most ardent supporters. Trump during his 2024 run for the White House promised voters he would quickly end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and keep the U.S. out of costly conflicts.

Steve Bannon, who served as a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration, said the administration should tread carefully.

“This is one of the most ancient civilizations in the world, ok?” Bannon told reporters at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. “With 92 million people. This is not something you play around with. You have to think this through. And the American people have to be on board. You can't just dump it on them.”

Bannon and other Trump allies, including Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk and conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, have raised concerns that direct U.S. involvement in the conflict could be seen as a betrayal to some members of Trump's coalition and cause a schism in MAGA world.

To be certain, some Trump backers are supportive of the president taking military action against Iran and play down the risk of the U.S. getting mired in a conflict.

“In terms of U.S. involvement in military action, there is zero possibility of American boots on the ground in Iran,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said. 

Trump pushed back at the notion that deepening U.S. involvement could impact his standing with his base.

“My supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them more than they were even at election time when we had a total landslide,” Trump said.

Summer will make a dramatic entrance in the U.S. this week with a heat dome that will bring stifling temperatures and uncomfortable humidity to millions.

The heat will be particularly worrisome this weekend across wide stretches of Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin and Iowa, where forecasters are warning of extreme temperature impacts.

This will be the first stretch of true summertime weather for many from Midwest to the East Coast, said Tom Kines, a meteorologist at the private weather company AccuWeather. 

“A lot of those folks have been saying, where's summer? Well, buckle up, because it's coming,” said Kines. The humid conditions will make places that exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) feel as much as 20 degrees hotter, said Kines.



A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir that traps heat and humidity, said Ricky Castro, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Illinois. 

According to the NWS Weather Prediction Center, daytime temperatures will be in the 90s Fahrenheit (30s Celsius) and overnight temperatures will only drop to the mid-70s Fahrenheit (mid-20s Celsius) from the Great Lakes to the East Coast during the heat wave that's expected to last into next week.

Moisture blown northward from the Gulf of Mexico is fueling the muggy weather, said Jacob Asherman, a Weather Prediction Center meteorologist. This influx of Gulf moisture is fairly typical during late spring and summer, he said. 






The heat will be widespread into next week. On Friday, Denver could reach 100°F (38°C), according to the weather service. Chicago temperatures could reach 96 degrees (36°C) on Sunday. On Tuesday, Washington, D.C., could see a high of 99°F (37°C) and New York Central Park could reach 96°F (36°C).

Several states in the Midwest could see dangerous temperature impacts over the weekend, according to a weather service measure that rates the risk from zero to four. Parts of Nebraska and Kansas will be in the highest category on the scale on Saturday, meaning that anyone without effective cooling or sufficient hydration could face health risks. On Sunday, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri and Illinois also see a category 4 rating.

Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air, and the heat index is what the temperature feels like when the humidity outside is factored in, according to the weather service. 

When humans sweat, it cools the body down because it absorbs and removes heat as it evaporates off the skin. The air is saturated with water on humid days, which makes it harder for sweat to evaporate. Hot and humid days can be dangerous when the body is unable to cool itself off and can exacerbate pre-existing health conditions and even lead to heat stroke. 

Minimizing direct sun exposure, wearing loose and light-colored clothing, staying hydrated and spending time in air-conditioned spaces are ways to cool down during extreme heat, according to the NWS.

Some parts of the U.S., such as Phoenix, Arizona, are famously hot without the mugginess. Phoenix and nearby desert regions experience this so-called “dry heat” due to being located far away from large water bodies, mountains that block moist air masses and weather patterns that bring scarce precipitation. 

Sweat evaporates faster in dry climates compared to humid ones. This can be dangerous because it is easy to underestimate how dehydrated you are, according to Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System. 





In places such as Iowa, crops can affect the humidity in summer months. Plants feel the effects of hot weather and some people in the Midwest are familiar with “ corn sweat,” which is when crops move water to their leaves and other surfaces so it can evaporate, according to the Ohio State University. 

Madison County, Iowa, farmer Ryan Marquardt said corn sweat is “not as bad as a sauna, but it definitely would have a sauna effect. It's humid in there (the cornfield), so you're gonna sweat.” 

Cornfield contributions to the overall humidity are much lower compared to the humidity winds carry from the Gulf of Mexico, according to OSU.

Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza's viral Spanish-language national anthem performance became a flashpoint for L.A. Dodgers fans frustrated by the team's public silence during increased federal immigration arrests and raids. The Dodgers said there were “no consequences or hard feelings.” (June 18)

LOS ANGELES (AP) — As fans removed their caps and stood for the national anthem Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, they were met with a surprising rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza stood in front of the crowd, closed her eyes and belted the song out — in Spanish.

Her 90-second rendition, and a behind-the-scenes video she shared on social media of team representatives discouraging it beforehand, quickly went viral and have become a flashpoint for Dodgers fans frustrated by the team's lack of vocal support for immigrant communities impacted by the deportation raids across the U.S., including numerous neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles.

Protests over the arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have captured international attention and mostly been held in areas a short drive from Dodger Stadium.

Nezza says even after the discouragement from the team's representative, she hadn't yet decided whether to sing in English or Spanish until she walked out onto the field and saw the stands filled with Latino families in Dodger blue.

“This is my moment to show everyone that I am with them that we have a voice and with everything that's happening it's not OK. I'm super proud that I did it. No regrets,” the 30-year-old singer told The Associated Press. 

The team has yet to make a statement on the record regarding the arrests and raids.




Manager Dave Roberts has said he doesn't know enough about the issue to comment, but Dodgers hitter Kiké Hernández separately spoke out on Instagram over the weekend.

“I am saddened and infuriated by what's happening in our country and our city,” he said in a post in English and Spanish. “I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.”

In her viral TikTok video, Nezza is shown speaking with an off-camera Dodgers employee who tells her, “We are going to do the song in English today, so I'm not sure if that wasn't transferred or if that wasn't relayed.” She's received an outpouring of support since Saturday from celebrities like Jason Mraz, Kehlani, Chiquis, Ava DuVernay, The Kid Mero, Becky G and more.

“Don't you dare turn your backs on us now. We, as a city, have embraced you and need your support more than ever. Think about who fills up your stadium,” said Becky G, addressing the Dodgers in her Instagram story. 

The Spanish-language version Nezza sang, “El Pendón Estrellado,” is the official translation of the national anthem and was commissioned in 1945 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Peruvian-American composer Clotilde Arias.

Nezza says her manager immediately received a call from an unidentified Dodgers employee saying their clients were not welcome at the stadium again, but the baseball team said in a statement to the AP: “There were no consequences or hard feelings from the Dodgers regarding her performance. She was not asked to leave. We would be happy to have her back.”

Dodger Stadium has a long history with immigrant communities in Los Angeles. 

Many proudly wear Dodger blue jerseys and merchandise as an extension of their love for the city — the team still sells special “Los Dodgers” jerseys on its official website — and attend the stadium's multiple heritage nights honoring Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and more immigrant communities, including those from outside Latin America. The Dodgers' fan base is heavily Latino, and the team is among the select few to offer Spanish-language television broadcasts.

The franchise is also frequently praised for its history seeking out diverse talent, including Jackie Robinson (baseball's first Black player), Fernando Valenzuela (a Mexican icon who transcended baseball) and Chan Ho Park (the first Korean in the big leagues). 

But the relationship is not without tension, with some Mexican American and Latino residents resentful of the team's forceful eviction of Latino families in the 1950s to build Dodger Stadium in what is popularly known as Chavez Ravine.

Fans have since called for a boycott online, while others say they'd be willing to return if the team spoke out. 

“We love you. You've been so much a big part of our lives. … We would like to understand that you love us just the same. Or are we just money to you?” asked Power 106's Brown Bag Mornings host Letty Peniche in an Instagram video.

Los Angeles resident Alora Murray is considering a temporary boycott.

“Nobody is messing around about this,” said Murray. “Los Angeles is built upon the Dodgers. For them to not kind of be with us, I feel like us boycotting or not going to games will send that message.”

Many in the Latino community have been sharing videos of stadium security confronting fans who have political signs or messages on their clothing.

Longtime Dodger fan Emeli Avalos says she doesn't believe the team is apolitical since they released a statement to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

“If it's really about staying out of politics, then why do they support that? But when people down the street from them are getting taken, kidnapped, why do they stay silent?” she said.

Avalos attended Pride Night on June 13 wearing a shirt that said “Abolish ICE” on the front and “FDT” — an acronym for an expletive directed at President Donald Trump — on the back. In a popular TikTok video, Avalos is seen speaking with Dodgers security. She says she thought she was going to be asked to leave but was instead asked to cover the back of her shirt with her jersey.

“They told me, ‘The front is fine, you just gotta cover the back,'” said Avalos, who said she will not be returning to the stadium.

Another video of a fan being confronted by security for holding a banner with “ICE” crossed out circulated online over the weekend, furthering criticism of the team.

When asked about the incidents, a Dodgers spokesperson pointed to the team's stadium guidelines, which state the team “does not allow signs or banners of any kind.” Also prohibited is any attire the Dodgers deem — at their sole discretion — to be obscene, profane, vulgar, indecent, violent, threatening, abusive or prejudiced against any individual or group. 

Nezza does not think she will return to the stadium, despite the Dodgers' statement, but says she hopes her performance will inspire others to use their voice and speak out.

“It's just shown me like how much power there is in the Latin community,” she said. “We gotta be the voice right now.”

Emmanuel Acho, LeSean McCoy and James Jones react to the Tush Push staying put after a proposal to ban the call failed by two votes during the NFL spring meetings. 

Josh Allen is not seeing eye-to-eye with his own team about one of the biggest controversies in the sport.

The Buffalo Bills were one of 22 teams to vote to ban the tush push – 24 were needed to officially make the play illegal.

However, the quarterback himself, who has a knack for finding the end zone with his legs himself, said he believes that it should remain a part of the game.

"I'm a big believer in if you can't stop it, keep running it, right?" Allen told Sports Illustrated. 

"I think that there's a few teams that do it better than others, but then you look at a few teams that try to do it, and it doesn't have the same success. Because, one, they maybe don't practice it enough or, two, they don't have the guys to do it. And just because a couple teams do it better than others, I don't feel like it should be banned. 

"I understand the merit of what it brings, and so I don't really sway one way or the other. I try to play the game based on the interpretation of the rules. And if that was the rule that was passed, you know, we'll find a different way. But I feel like if you can use it to your benefit, use it to your benefit. If you don't like it, my advice is to stop it, you know?"

The Green Bay Packers initiated the rule-change proposal, which would have prohibited "an offensive player from pushing a teammate who was lined up directly behind the snapper and receives the snap, immediately at the snap." The proposal added that a penalty would be assessed on any offensive player who violated the rule.

Proponents of the play and those who oppose it both presented strong arguments, while the league expressed worry about safety.

Rich McKay, the NFL Competition Committee chair, said in April the issues go beyond safety, because there was not enough data to say whether it is a dangerous play. The league has said there have been no injuries reported from the tush push. 

Washington Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu called the play "cheap."

During the tush push meeting with owners, Philadelphia Eagles team owner Jeffrey Lurie reportedly brought Jason Kelce into the meeting to explain why the tush push should be kept in the game. The Eagles have had the most success with the play over the last few years, and Kelce's input was apparently enough for owners to forgo approving the ban.

What the hell did the Court just do to equal protection law?

It was obvious, if you listened to the Supreme Court's oral argument in United States v. Skrmetti last December, that the Court would vote — most likely along party lines — to uphold state laws banning many forms of transgender health care for minors. So nothing about Chief Justice John Roberts's majority opinion in Skrmetti is really surprising. All six of the Court's Republicans voted to uphold these laws, and all three of the Court's Democrats dissented.

But, as a matter of judicial craftsmanship, Roberts's opinion is disappointing even by the standards of the Roberts Court. It draws incoherent distinctions. It relies on old and widely criticized precedents to undermine legal principles that are well established by more recent cases. At times in his opinion, Roberts seems to misread statutory language that he just quoted a paragraph or two earlier.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

It appears, in other words, that the six justices in the majority started with the outcome that they wanted — bans on transgender health care for minors must be upheld — and then contorted their legal reasoning to fit that result.

Even if you share that goal, the decision in this case was unnecessary. As Justice Elena Kagan points out in a brief dissenting opinion, the issue before the Supreme Court Skrmetti concerned a threshold question: whether the Tennessee law at issue in this case should receive a heightened level of scrutiny from the courts before it was either upheld or discarded. The ultimate question of whether to uphold Tennessee's law was not before the justices.

The Court's Republicans, in other words, could have applied existing law, sent the case back down to the lower courts to apply this “heightened scrutiny,” and then ruled on the bans in a future case. Instead, Roberts's Skrmetti opinion went further to rule on the legality of the bans, and consists of about two dozen pages of excuses for why the Court's previous anti-discrimination decisions somehow do not apply to Tennessee's law.

One virtue of this approach is that it minimizes the broader implications of Skrmetti. At oral arguments, several justices suggested that, in order to uphold Tennessee's law, they might make sweeping changes to the rules governing all sex-based discrimination by the government — Roberts, for example, floated giving the government broad authority to discriminate on the basis of sex in the medical context. Roberts's actual opinion contains some language suggesting that the general rule against sex discrimination is weaker when the government regulates medical practice, but those sections of his opinion are so difficult to parse that they fall short of the broad changes he discussed at oral argument.

Ultimately, Roberts's Skrmetti opinion largely reveals something that close observers of this Supreme Court already know. The Court's Republican majority is impatient. They are often so eager to reach ideological or partisan results that they hand down poorly reasoned opinions and incomprehensible legal standards. 

Because the Skrmetti opinion is so incoherent, it is difficult to predict its broader implications for US anti-discrimination law. One thing that is certain, however, is that this decision is a historic loss for transgender Americans.

To understand why the Skrmetti opinion is so difficult to reconcile with the Court's previous decisions, it's helpful to understand the precise legal questions before the Supreme Court.

The first of two questions is whether Tennessee's ban on trans health care for minors classifies patients based on their sex assigned at birth. In United States v. Virginia (1996), the Supreme Court held that “‘all gender-based classifications today' warrant ‘heightened scrutiny.'” “All” means that all laws that classify people based on their sex must receive additional scrutiny from the courts, not just some laws that do so.

About half of the states have laws targeting transgender health care, but the Tennessee law at issue in Skrmetti is among the strictest. It prohibits people under the age of 18 from receiving many medical treatments to treat gender dysphoria or other conditions related to their transgender status — including bans on puberty blockers and hormone therapy.

Significantly, Tennessee's law is also quite explicit that the purpose of this law is to ensure that young people do not depart from their sex assigned at birth. The law declares that its purpose is to “encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex” and to prevent young people from becoming “disdainful of their sex.” That is an explicit sex-based classification. Patients who Roberts refers to as “biological women” are allowed to fully embrace femininity in Tennessee. But a child who is assigned male at birth may not.

Under Virginia, in other words, Tennessee's law — which relies on a sex-based classification — must be subject to heightened scrutiny.

To be clear, the mere fact that courts must give heightened review to Tennessee's law does not mean that the law will necessarily be struck down. As the Court held in Craig v. Boren (1976), “to withstand constitutional challenge…classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.” Some laws do survive this level of scrutiny.

Roberts's opinion raises several policy arguments for Tennessee's law, claiming that the procedures targeted by Tennessee are “experimental,” that they “can lead to later regret,” and that they carry “risks.” A court applying heightened scrutiny could consider these arguments and whether they justify upholding the law.

But Roberts bypasses this inquiry altogether, instead denying that the Tennessee law engages in sex-based classifications at all. The law, Roberts claims, only “incorporates two classifications.” It “classifies on the basis of age” by banning certain treatments only for minors. And it “classifies on the basis of medical use” by prohibiting doctors from prescribing those treatments to address gender dysphoria or similar conditions affecting transgender people, while simultaneously permitting those treatments to address other conditions.

Roberts is correct that Tennessee's law does draw lines based on these two classifications. But a law can do more than two things at once. And this law explicitly states that it exists to classify every child as either a boy or a girl, and then to lock them into that classification until their 18th birthday. Under Virginia, that classification demands heightened scrutiny.

The second legal question before the Court in Skrmetti was whether all laws that discriminate against transgender people are themselves subject to heightened scrutiny. Roberts, however, dodges this question by claiming that Tennessee's law “does not classify on the basis of transgender status.” Instead, he argues, the law classifies people based on whether they have conditions such as “gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence.”

Gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence are among the defining traits that make someone transgender. Roberts might as well have argued that Jim Crow laws do not discriminate on the basis of race, but instead discriminate based on the color of a person's skin.

To justify this distinction, Roberts points to the Court's decision in Geduldig v. Aiello (1974), which held that discrimination against pregnant people is not a form of sex discrimination because not all women become pregnant. But, even if it is true that not all transgender people experience gender dysphoria or a similar condition, post-Geduldig decisions have long held that the government cannot evade a ban on discrimination by claiming that it is merely discriminating based on a trait that closely correlates with a particular identity.

As the Court said in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic (1993), “a tax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews” — even though many Jews do not wear yarmulkes.

That said, the Court's decision not to rule on whether laws that classify on the basis of transgender status must receive heightened review is probably a blessing for transgender people, even if it is a small one. While Roberts's reasoning on this question is muddled, his opinion leaves open the possibility that a future Court may resolve this question in favor of transgender people — although that is highly unlikely to happen unless the Court's membership changes significantly.

Notably, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who is close to the center of the current Court, wrote a separate concurring opinion arguing that discrimination against trans people does not trigger heightened scrutiny.

For the most part, Skrmetti is a disaster for transgender people, and especially for transgender youth. It twists the Constitution in knots to uphold Tennessee's law. And the decision is likely to ensure that many parents of transgender children must move to blue states if they want their child to receive appropriate medical care.

Federal prosecutors on Tuesday announced the indictment of seven people believed to be behind the largest jewel heist in U.S. history.

Officials charged seven men with the theft of 24 bags containing $100 million worth of gold, diamonds, gems, luxury watches, and other items from a Brink's armored truck driving through California on July 11, 2022.

Ranging in age from 31 to 60, the men were all Los Angeles-area residents, living in Boyle Heights, Westlake, and Rampart Village, California.

The Hollywood-style robbery, which Justice Department officials said was the biggest jewelry grab they had ever seen, started when the goods were loaded onto a Brink's truck following a gem and jewelry show south of San Francisco.

The shows featured everything from decorative beads to rare Rolex watches. On the truck was millions of dollars' worth of jewelry Jean Malki, a veteran jeweler with four decades under his belt, had wrapped, including a necklace containing 25 carats of yellow diamonds, a rare Australian-mined black opal, and a Burmese ruby, he told New York magazine at the time.

Malki and a handful of other jewelers handed their entire collection to a Brink's guard, who packed it into his truck and told them they would get it the next day at a show about five hours south in Pasadena, California.

That day never came.

Around 2 a.m., at a truck stop near the Los Angeles County line, the guard driving the Brink's truck went inside to get something to eat. His co-pilot was asleep in a berth in the cab. When the driver returned less than half an hour later, he saw that 24 bags containing precious gems such as the ones Malki and 14 others had packed were gone.

According to the indictment, the men took the loot and headed for East Hollywood.

Some of the defendants allegedly did not grasp how large their haul was. In the days after the robbery, several of the co-conspirators deactivated their cellphones. The court filing did not say how the men gained access to the trailer.

The Brink's driver told deputies at the time that he was “pretty sure we were followed from the show where we got loaded.”

For months, the jewelers waited for law enforcement to announce arrests or leads in the case.Nothing happened.

Some of the jewelers lost their entire livelihoods. Others were locked in a legal battle with Richmond, Virginia-based Brink's that prevented them from receiving any insurance payouts.

Almost three years later, federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment against seven co-conspirators who allegedly carried out the theft at the Flying J Travel Center, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles. 

The men were each charged with conspiracy to commit theft from interstate and foreign shipments and theft from interstate and foreign shipments.

“It was a long time coming, and there were times when the victims and members of the team wondered whether we'd see this success,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Butler said Tuesday.

Some of the stolen jewelry, including watches, was recovered after search warrants were executed. Authorities also recovered a large amount of cash. Butler said search warrants are still being pursued and that many of the stolen jewels remain missing.

Two of the defendants arrested appeared in federal court on Tuesday. Another is an inmate at an Arizona prison, according to a press release from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. The co-conspirators, some of whom use aliases, are Carlos Victor Mestanza Cercado, Jazael Padilla Resto, Pablo Raul Lugo Larroig, Victor Hugo Valencia Solorzano, Jorge Enrique Alban, Jeson Nelon Presilla Flores, and Eduardo Macias Ibarra.

Some of the defendants have also been charged with smaller heists throughout San Bernardino County.

If convicted, Mestanza, Padilla, Lugo, Valencia, and Alban would face up to 20 years in federal prison for each robbery charge. All the defendants would face up to five years for the theft conspiracy charge and 10 years for each theft charge.

The California caper drew comparisons to infamous international heists, including the 1983 Brink's-Mat gold bullion job near London Heathrow Airport, 2003's Antwerp diamond theft in Belgium, and 2015's Hatton Garden burglary in London.

Republican Senator Jim Banks explains why Indiana Fever fans deserve an apology after the league's latest investigation during an appearance on OutKick's "Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich."  

Tennis legend Chris Evert needled WNBA players for lack of sportsmanship following Tuesday night's skirmish that saw Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark get poked in the eye and shoved to the ground in a game against the Connecticut Sun.

Clark and Sun players Marina Mabrey and Tina Charles were hit with technical fouls. Jacy Sheldon was given a flagrant foul. Later, Fever guard Sophie Cunningham appeared to retaliate with a hard foul on Sheldon. Both players were ejected from the game with 40 seconds left.

Evert was among those who commented on the Clark incident. 

"When will these ladies realize, accept, and appreciate @CaitlinClark22 is the best thing that ever happened to women's basketball. This is a bad look for the sport and what's happened to sportsmanship?" Evert wrote on X.

She responded to a social media post made by columnist Christine Brennan, who is set to release a book on Clark next month.

"The WNBA continues to fail to meet the moment. Terrible decision to allow Marina Mabrey to stay in the game. People are watching as never before. And this is what they see?" Brennan wrote on X.

It's far from the first time Clark has been poked, prodded and shoved to the floor. She was hit in the eye during a game against the Sun last year as well – and that's just been the tip of the iceberg.

Crew chief Ashley Gross spoke to a pool reporter after the game and was asked about the Clark technical foul.

"After the foul by Sheldon, Clark reacted in an unsportsmanlike manner," Goss said.

Fever coach Stephanie White told reporters after the game she didn't receive any explanation for the technical foul on Clark.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, a stunning setback to transgender rights.

The justices' 6-3 decision in a case from Tennessee effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump's Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to Tennessee's.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a conservative majority that the law does not violate the Constitution's equal protection clause, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.

“This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound,” Roberts wrote. “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.”

In a dissent for the court's three liberal justices that she summarized aloud in the courtroom, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims. In sadness, I dissent.”



The decision comes amid other federal and state efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use. In April, Trump's administration sued Maine for not complying with the government's push to ban transgender athletes in girls sports.







The Republican president also has sought to block federal spending on gender-affirming medical care for those under age 19 — instead promoting talk therapy only to treat young transgender people. And the Supreme Court has allowed him to kick transgender service members out of the military, even as court fights continue. The president signed another order to define the sexes as only male and female.

Trump's administration has also called for using only therapy, not broader health measures, to treat transgender youths.



Several of the states where gender-affirming care has not been banned for minors have adopted laws or state executive orders seeking to protect it. But since Trump's executive order calling for blocking federal funding for the treatment for those under 19, some providers have ceased some treatments. For instance, Penn Medicine in Philadelphia announced last month it would not provide surgeries for patients under 19.

The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Susan Kressly, said in a statement the organization is “unwavering” in its support of gender-affirming care and “stands with pediatricians and families making health care decisions together and free from political interference.” 

Five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled transgender, gay and lesbian people are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace. That decision is unaffected by Wednesday's ruling.

But the justices Wednesday declined to apply the same sort of analysis the court used in 2020 when it found “sex plays an unmistakable role” in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate. Roberts joined that opinion written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was part of Wednesday's majority.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett also fully joined the majority but wrote separately to emphasize that laws classifying people based on transgender status should not receive any special review by courts. Barrett, also writing for justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that “courts must give legislatures flexibility to make policy in this area.”

Chase Strangio, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued the case for transgender minors and their families, said in a statement that the ruling “is a devastating loss for transgender people, our families, and everyone who cares about the Constitution.”

Mo Jenkins, a 26-year-old trans woman who began taking hormone therapy at 16, said she was disheartened but not surprised by the ruling. “My transition was out of survival,” said Jenkins, a Texas native and legislative staffer at the state capitol in Austin.

Texas outlawed puberty blockers and hormone treatment for minors in 2023. The legislature in May also passed a bill that tightly defines a man and a woman by their sex characteristics.

“Trans people are not going to disappear,” Jenkins said.

Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti on social media called the ruling a “Landmark VICTORY for Tennessee at SCOTUS in defense of America's children!”

There are about 300,000 people between the ages of 13 and 17 and 1.3 million adults who identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute, at think tank at the UCLA School of Law that researches sexual orientation and gender identity demographics.

When the case was argued in December, then-President Joe Biden's Democratic administration and families of transgender adolescents called on the high court to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans. 

They argued the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. 

Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors but allows the same drugs to be used for other purposes.

Soon after Trump took office, the Justice Department told the court its position had changed.

A major issue in the case was the appropriate level of scrutiny courts should apply to such laws. 

The lowest level is known as rational basis review, and almost every law looked at that way is upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures.

The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, which applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show the law helps accomplish it.

Roberts' 24-page majority opinion was devoted almost entirely to explaining why the Tennessee law, called SB1, should be evaluated under the lower standard of review. The law's restrictions on treating minors for gender dysphoria turn on age and medical use, not sex, Roberts wrote.

Doctors may prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapy to minors of any sex to treat some disorders, but not those relating to transgender status, he wrote.

But in her courtroom statement, Sotomayor asserted that similar arguments were made to defend the Virginia law prohibiting interracial marriage that the Supreme Court struck down in 1967. 

“A ban on interracial marriage could be described in the same way as the majority described SB1,” she said. 

Roberts rejected the comparison.

BARCELONA (AP) — Iran is boasting that it has hypersonic missiles and says it already has begun firing the cutting-edge weapons at Israel.

There is no evidence that Iran has unleashed the missiles, and experts are skeptical of the claim.

But the use of these fast-moving projectiles could test Israel's vaunted missile-defense system and alter the course of the fighting between the two bitter enemies.

Here's a closer look at these advanced weapons:

Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard claimed Wednesday that it had fired what it said were hypersonic “Fattah 1” missiles toward Israel. But whether these missiles are hypersonic is a matter of debate.

Simply put, hypersonic weapons are any missile that travels beyond Mach 5, five times the speed of sound. Ballistic missiles, fired high up or outside the earth's atmosphere, routinely reach this speed.

But in modern warfare, experts say hypersonic weapons must also have advanced navigation systems – making them nimble and capable of changing their trajectory. This can challenge traditional defense systems, said Jack Watling, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. 

Traditional ballistic missiles fly on a trajectory that missile-defense systems like the U.S.-made Patriot can anticipate. Cruise missiles, which can hug terrain, or hypersonic missiles, which are fired to a lower altitude, have less predictable trajectories and are harder to stop.




“Radar can see a missile on a ballistic curve because it's above the radar horizon. If it's a hypersonic glide vehicle, it can fly lower and hills get in the way,” Watling said. “That further reduces the time that you will have to engage because if it comes over the horizon, you suddenly see it, and then it's over.”

Experts say the U.S. and China are the only countries that have developed new-generation hypersonic missiles — but neither have used them in battle. Other nations such as Russia, North Korea and Pakistan have tested or used missiles with similar but less sophisticated technology.

“In the way that it is currently being used, the term ‘hypersonic' often has little to no meaning and at the same time fuels competitive dynamics and a fear of missing out on the technology,” according to a 2022 report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The U.S. says it is putting hypersonic missiles on a stealth destroyer and is developing and testing other programs.

China tested its first hypersonic missile in 2017 and has since developed an array of hypersonic weapons that the U.S. Defense Department says could threaten Hawaii, Alaska and even the continental U.S. 

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has warned of China's “ huge investments ” in military technology including hypersonic weapons.

Most countries can't make missiles that would weather the temperature and momentum stresses of these incredibly fast munitions, Watling said.

“This is a hugely complicated task. The Iranians don't have the capacity to manufacture them,” he said. 

Most of the missiles Iran has deployed against Israel travel at hypersonic speed, but are barely maneuverable, so are not considered true hypersonic missiles, said Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at the Israeli think tank INSS and a former scientist in Israeli defense industries.

The missile it has launched, the Fattah 1 has had minimal success. Israel says Iran has fired over 400 missiles, with over 40 causing damage or casualties.

“Israel is able to intercept more than 95% of the missiles because speed is not crucial,” said Kalisky. “What is important is the maneuverability of the incoming missiles, and so far the maneuverability of these missiles is limited.”

He said Iran has two fast and maneuverable missiles, the Khorramshahr and Fattah 2, that would be “more difficult” to intercept. But neither have been deployed.

Russia has claimed to have used hypersonic missiles in its war against Ukraine, but experts say that while fast they do not maneuver enough to be considered true hypersonic weapons.

Russia President Vladimir Putin boasted of the development and use of the Orenshik in Ukraine — claiming that flies “like a meteorite” at 10 times the speed of sound, and that it was immune to any missile defense system. Ukrainian military officials said it reached Mach 11.

The Pentagon said last December the Oreshnik fired was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile.

Russia has also claimed its Kinzhal missile is hypersonic, but Ukraine has been able to intercept them with the U.S.-made Patriot missile defense system.

During the recent fighting between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir, Pakistan said it destroyed a Russian-built S-400 air defense system in India's border Punjab state with hypersonic missiles launched from a warplane.

Brazil, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Iran, Japan, South Korea and North Korea all have hypersonic weapons programs. The European Union is studying how to develop an interceptor for hypersonic missiles as it ramps up defense spending to counter the Russian threat.

Red Jumpsuit Apparatus lead singer Ronnie Winter has warned Christians who support President Donald Trump not to come to his shows, saying that “woke propaganda” will be present.

The rock band is best known for the 2006 hit “Face Down.” Winter's “PSA” was issued on his Instagram account, claiming that “being woke” means people are “awake” and that “I actually follow what Jesus says.” 

“If you're a Christian and you're watching this and you voted for Donald Trump, shame on you,” Winter said. “You're not allowed to come to my shows, I don't want you there. Don't come to my shows. It's awesome that you love ‘Face Down,' but it's not for you. It's not your song, ok?”

Winter told Trump supporters not to come to his shows “ever,” claiming that “woke propaganda” and the “actual words of Jesus” would be shared at his shows. He added that audiences can expect “a lot of acceptance” of people across “all areas of life,” accusing Trump supporters of not supporting this.

“Don't come, refunds are available,” Winter concluded. “Forever don't come. Goodbye.”

Comments on Winter's Instagram video have been turned off.

In April 2021, Winter uploaded a video of himself receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The singer stood by his previous posts about his “stay woke campaign,” saying he had not removed any of his old content.

MEL GIBSON ACCUSES NEWSOM AND BASS OF ‘INCOMPETENCE' AND ‘POOR LEADERSHIP'

Winter is not the only musician who has vocalized his opposition to Trump and the current administration. Shakira and Olivia Rodrigo have recently criticized Trump over his stance on immigration and deportations. Green Day, another rock band known for its criticism of the current president, recently had its lead singer, Billie Joe Armstrong, call the Trump administration “a fascist government.”

Another vocal Trump critic, Bruce Springsteen, ranted about the president during a recent show in Manchester, England.

In January, singer and actress Selena Gomez posted a video of herself crying over illegal immigrants getting deported, claiming “all my people are getting attacked.” Border czar Tom Homan criticized Gomez's video, saying the administration's enforcement of the law is done “without apology.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Emergency workers pulled more bodies Wednesday from the rubble of a nine-story Kyiv apartment building demolished by a Russian missile, raising the death toll from the latest attack on the Ukrainian capital to 28.

The building in Kyiv's Solomianskyi district took a direct hit and collapsed during the deadliest Russian attack on Kyiv this year. Authorities said that 23 of those killed were inside the building. The remaining five died elsewhere in the city. 

Workers used cranes, excavators and their hands to clear more debris from the site, while sniffer dogs searched for buried victims. The blast blew out windows and doors in neighboring buildings in a wide radius of damage.

The attack overnight on Monday into Tuesday was part of a sweeping barrage as Russia once again sought to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Russia fired more than 440 drones and 32 missiles in what Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was one of the biggest bombardments of the war, now in its fourth year.

Russia has launched a summer offensive on parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and has intensified long-range attacks that have struck urban residential areas.

At the same time, U.S.-led peace efforts have failed to grain traction. Also, Middle East tensions and U.S. trade tariffs have drawn world attention away from Ukraine's pleas for more diplomatic and economic pressure to be placed on Russia.




The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said the attack clashed with the attempts by the administration of President Donald Trump to reach a settlement that will stop the fighting.

“This senseless attack runs counter to President Trump's call to stop the killing and end the war,” the embassy posted on social platform X.

Kyiv authorities declared Wednesday an official day of mourning. Mourners laid flowers on swings and slides at a playground across the street from the collapsed building. On Tuesday, a man had waited hours there for his 31-year-old son's body to be pulled from the rubble.

Psychologists from Ukraine's emergency services provided counseling to survivors of the attack and to family members of those who died.

“Some people are simply in a stupor, they simply can't move,” Karyna Dovhal, one of the psychologists, told AP. “People are waiting for their sons, brothers, uncles ... Everyone is waiting.”

Valentin Hrynkov, a 64-year-old handyman in a local school who lived on the seventh floor of a connected building that did not collapse, said he and his wife woke up to the sound of explosions followed by a pause, and then another blast that rattled their own building.

He said his wife had shrapnel injuries in her back and his legs and feet were cut by broken glass. The damage trapped them in their apartment for around 30 minutes before rescue workers could free them, he said.

He felt an overwhelming sense of “helplessness and primal fear” during the attack, he told The Associated Press. 

“I was especially scared to sleep last night,” Hrynkov said. “A car drives by and I cover my head. It's scary.”

By dawn on Tuesday, residents of buildings in the densely populated neighborhood could be seen huddled in ground-floor entryways to seek shelter from the ongoing drone assault.

Drones were striking every few minutes within hundreds of meters of the building hit by the missile. The continuing attack forced firefighters and rescue teams to delay the rescue operation.

Relatives and friends of the destroyed building's residents later gathered outside in shock, many crying and calling out names, hoping survivors might still be found beneath the rubble.

PUERTO ESCONDIDO, Mexico (AP) — Hurricane Erick was nearing Mexico's Pacific coast on Wednesday on a forecast track to bring heavy rain, strong winds, storm surge and possible mudslides to its southern coastal region, forecasters said.

Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lighter amounts in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain.

The Category 1 storm on Wednesday morning was located about 130 miles (205 kilometers) south-southeast of Puerto Ángel, Mexico, and had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph). It was moving northwest at 8 mph (13 kph).

The hurricane center said Erick is rapidly intensifying and is expected to be at or near major hurricane status as it approaches the Mexican coast on Thursday, where it could make landfall. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher and wind speeds of at least 111 mph (180 kph).

Erick is forecast to be a major hurricane by Wednesday night or Thursday morning.

The storm's projected path would take its center near the resort of Acapulco, which was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared.

At least 52 people died in Otis and 32 were missing, after the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort's hotels.




Down the coast in Puerto Escondido near the southern edge of Erick's possible path, some fishermen began pulling their boats out of the water under a drizzling sky Wednesday. 

Even though the wind had yet to pick up at the Zicatela beach, red flags were up to warn people to stay out of the water. But some surfers ignored them as they continued to ride waves.

Laura Velázquez, Mexico's national civil defense coordinator, said Wednesday that Erick was forecast to bring “torrential” rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico.

The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides and there are numerous rivers that could jump their banks.

Thousands of troops were being deployed to the area, Velázquez said.

Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado said Wednesday that all schools were closed and the state had alerted all of the fishing and tourism operators of the risk of the coming storm and recommended they prepare their boats. Acapulco's port closed Tuesday evening. She said 582 shelters were prepared to receive people who might evacuate their homes.

One of the criticisms of the government's handling of Hurricane Otis was that authorities did not give sufficient warning about the threat posed by the rapidly intensifying storm. Many boats sank in Acapulco's harbor.

President Claudia Sheinbaum during her daily news briefing Wednesday warned residents in the hurricane's path to listen for government instructions and to wait it out in their homes or government shelters.

A hurricane warning was in effect from Acapulco to Puerto Ángel. A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected in the area, and preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, according to the hurricane center advisory.

President Donald Trump is refusing to be drawn on whether he will order U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. “I may do it, I may not do it,” he says.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump would not say Wednesday whether he has decided to order a U.S. strike on Iran, a move that Tehran warned anew would be greeted with stiff retaliation if it happens.

“I may do it, I may not do it,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters at the White House . “I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do.”

Trump added that it's not “too late” for Iran to give up its nuclear program as he continues to weigh direct U.S. involvement in Israel's military operations aimed at crushing Tehran's nuclear program.

“Nothing's too late,” Trump said. “I can tell you this. Iran's got a lot of trouble.”

“Nothing is finished until it is finished,” Trump added. But “the next week is going to be very big— maybe less than a week.”

Trump also offered a terse response to Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's refusal to heed to his call for Iran to submit to an unconditional surrender.

“I say good luck,” Trump said.

Khamenei earlier Wednesday warned that any United States strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them” and that his country would not bow to Trump's call for surrender.

Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told lawmakers Wednesday that the Pentagon was providing possible options to Trump as he decides next steps on Iran.

Trump said Tuesday the U.S. knows where Khamenei is hiding but doesn't want him killed — “for now.”




“He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump said. 

Trump's increasingly muscular comments toward the Iranian government follow him urging Tehran's 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his participation in an international summit earlier this week to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team.

Trump said that the Iranian officials continue to reach out to the White House as they're “getting the hell beaten out of them” by Israel. But he added there's a “big difference between now and a week ago” in Tehran's negotiating position.

“They've suggested that they come to the White House— that's, you know, courageous,” Trump said.

Iran's mission to the United Nations refuted Trump's claim in a statement on social media. “No Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House. The only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to ‘take out' Iran's Supreme Leader. ”

The U.S. president said earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to serve as a mediator with Iran. But Trump said he told Putin to keep focused on finding an endgame to his own conflict with Ukraine.

“I said, ‘Do me a favor, mediate your own,'” Trump said he told Putin. “I said, ‘Vladimir, let's mediate Russia first. You can worry about this later.'”

The comments were a shift from Trump who earlier this week said he was “open” to Putin's offer to mediate.

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said earlier Wednesday that Moscow has cautioned Washington against offering direct military assistance to Israel.

“We are warning Washington against even speculative, hypothetical considerations of the sort,” Ryabkov said, according to the Interfax news agency. “That would be a step drastically destabilizing the situation as a whole.”

The Russia-Iran relationship has deepened since Putin launched a war on Ukraine in February 2022, with Tehran providing Moscow with drones, ballistic missiles, and other support, according to U.S. intelligence findings.

Trump is also facing deep skepticism about deepening U.S. involvement in the Mideast crisis from some of his most ardent supporters. Trump during his 2024 run for the White House promised voters he would quickly end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and keep the U.S. out of costly conflicts.

Steve Bannon, who served as a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration, on Wednesday said the administration should tread carefully.

“This is one of the most ancient civilizations in the world, ok?” Bannon told reporters at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. “With 92 million people. This is not something you play around with. You have to think this through. And the American people have to be on board. You can't just dump it on them.”

Bannon and other Trump allies, including Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk and conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, have raised concerns that direct U.S. involvement in the conflict could be seen as a betrayal to some members of Trump's coalition and potentially cause a schism in MAGA world.

Trump pushed back at the notion that deepening U.S. involvement could impact his standing with bis base.

“My supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them more than they were even at election time when we had a total landslide,” Trump said.

Plenty of golfers had their fair share of displeasure at this past weekend's U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania.

Shane Lowry outwardly proclaimed, "f--- this place" after missing a putt, and on Sunday, despite J.J. Spaun's late charge to take home his first major, only three people finished under par in the final round.

One of those three players was Xander Schauffele, whose +6 overall was tied for 12th in the tournament. The conditions were brutal from the jump, but the two-time major champ thought the course was "very fair."

"Everyone had to play the same course," Schauffele told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. 

Schauffele admitted there were "weird breaks" that occurred throughout the weekend when golfers toed the line with danger. However, "You don't have to hit it in the bunkers or the rough – you can just hit it in the fairways."

"I thought the course was fair. I thought it was more playable because it rained a little, and the fairways and greens were more forgiving," he added. "You had to golf extremely well, which is what you're supposed to do to win a U.S. Open. You saw J.J. take control out of that rain delay, which is what you're supposed to do to win and be a major champ there."

Schauffele will be one of several major champs at TPC River Highlands in Cromwell, Connecticut, this weekend for the Travelers Championship, where the last seven winning scores have been -22, -23, -19, -13, -19, -17, and -17, a polar opposite to U.S. Open scores.

The 2024 PGA and Open champion won the Travelers in 2022, and while everybody wants to shoot lower, Schauffele said having both types of golf is a good balance.

"A mixture of both is nice. It's healthy. I've never shied away from the U.S. Open challenge, and I've never shied away from -25 winning a tournament," Schauffele said. "If you had to play Oakmont in U.S. Open conditions every week for 20 weeks, you'd wear yourself out, and vice versa. If you had to play a course where 25-under is winning for 20 weeks, you'd also wear yourself out. I think having a split and a little variety is nice for us."

This year's Travelers has exactly what Schauffele wants as he aims to catch fire ahead of The Open, the FedEx Cup, and the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in what's been a "weird" season for him.

"They definitely have done some things to make TPC River Highlands more difficult," Schauffele said. "Used to be lower rough, fairways used to be wider, they changed a couple holes to make it more difficult and less scoring-friendly… You're rewarded for really good shots, but there's water on a lot of holes, there's deep rough on some short-sided pins, a guy next to you can be shooting low, but you can be at even par not feeling great. I wouldn't call it a layup – you still have to be playing really good golf."

However, it will be a stark difference from what went down in western Pennsylvania.

"It'll be weird to be able to make seven or eight birdies in a round versus at Oakmont."

Burgeoning disagreements among Senate Democrats regarding the conflict between Israel and Iran have presented themselves as the latest challenge facing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). 

The New York lawmaker has experienced declining popularity in his own caucus amid myriad challenges this year following devastating results for Democrats, including in the Senate, during the 2024 elections.

Israel's recent attack on Iran has only served to intensify Schumer's troubles. As someone who has embraced pro-Israel stances, he now faces divisions among his ranks on the country's decision to attack Iran, as well as whether the United States should aid a war against the regime.

Schumer has remained silent on a war powers resolution that Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee, introduced on Monday. The resolution would require congressional debate and a vote before the U.S. takes any offensive measures to help Israel fight against Iran. 

And when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who caucuses with Democrats, introduced a bill this week seeking to bar funding for military force against Iran, Schumer declined to sponsor it, despite backing the same legislation in previous years. 

Despite Kiane and Sanders's outspoken stance, Schumer has yet to offer a public statement on the conflict since Trump signaled that military involvement could be coming earlier this week. Senior members of his administration have also declined to rule out such options.

Schumer's muted positioning over the past few days comes as his views on Israel differ sharply from members of his caucus, such as Sanders, making it difficult for the increasingly unpopular Senate minority leader to navigate politically as he seeks to hold on to power.

When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week launched a series of strikes against Iran directed at destroying its nuclear program, ballistic missile capabilities, and military leadership, Schumer initially issued a strong statement affirming the Jewish nation's right to defend itself from nuclear threats, while calling for diplomatic solutions to de-escalate the situation, similar to the Trump administration's approach.

“The United States' commitment to Israel's security and defense must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran's response,” he wrote. 

“The Iranian regime's stated policy has long been to destroy Israel and Jewish communities around the world. I have long said that Israel has a right to defend itself and that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,” the Senate's Democratic leader continued.

Such language has already set Schumer up for likely conflicts with conference members such as Sanders, who said, “This attack was specifically designed to sabotage American diplomatic efforts: Israel assassinated the man overseeing Iran's nuclear negotiating team, despite the fact that further talks with the United States were scheduled for Sunday. Whatever you think of the corrupt and authoritarian Iranian regime, this attack clearly violates international law and the United Nations Charter.”

Schumer's latest troubles add to a trend of aging establishment figures falling out of favor with their colleagues and struggling to corral raucous liberal elements of the party. 

Voters have also handed Schumer a searing report card as he seeks to lead the minority in the Senate, with an April poll of younger voters revealing just 23% approve of the job congressional Democrats were doing. 

Amid the dismal numbers, the Senate leader faces a tough path in boosting Democrats' power in the upper chamber ahead of the 2026 elections. An unfavorable 2026 Senate map could become even more challenging as Democratic incumbents keep retiring, with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) continuing this trend in April.

After losing the majority in the Senate to the GOP last November and more recently acquiescing to Trump's demands to move a key government spending bill forward, Schumer has faced calls to step down as leader. Some Democrats have proposed that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) should challenge him for his Senate seat. 

US MILITARY BOLSTERING MIDDLE EAST PRESENCE AMID ISRAEL-IRAN WAR

The turmoil in Schumer's corner echoes chaos in national Democratic quarters and the dismal view voters across the country have of the party.

Intra-party struggles with David Hogg at the Democratic National Committee illustrate tensions between the progressive and establishment wings of the party, as well as growing calls for younger leadership as aging power players, including Schumer, grapple to retain authority. Earlier this year, the GOP took its largest-ever advantage over Democrats in favorability ratings. As Democrats shed support, particularly from male and Hispanic voters, another poll this spring put the party's favorability rating at a record low of 29%.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel said Wednesday they have finalized their “historic partnership,” a year-and-a-half after the Japanese company first proposed its deal to buy the iconic American steelmaker for nearly $15 billion.

The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, delaying the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it. It also forced Nippon Steel to expand the deal, including adding a so-called “golden share” provision that gives the federal government a say in some matters.

“Together, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel will be a world-leading steelmaker, with best-in-class technologies and manufacturing capabilities,” the companies said.

The combined company will become the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, and bring what analysts say is Nippon Steel's top-notch technology to U.S. Steel's antiquated steelmaking processes. In exchange, Nippon Steel gets access to a robust U.S. steel market, strengthened in recent years by tariffs under President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, analysts say.

Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel did not list the full terms of the deal, and did not release a national security agreement struck with Trump's administration.

But in a statement Wednesday, the companies said the federal government will have the right to appoint an independent director and “consent rights” on specific matters. Those include reductions in Nippon Steel's capital commitments in the national security agreement, closing or idling of U.S. Steel's existing domestic facilities and changing U. S. Steel's name and headquarters.




Nippon Steel announced in December 2023 that it planned to buy the steel producer for $14.9 billion in cash and debt, and committed to keep the U.S. Steel name and Pittsburgh headquarters. 

The United Steelworkers union, which represents some U.S. Steel employees, opposed the deal, and Biden and Trump both vowed from the campaign trail to block it. 

Biden used his authority to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel on his way out of the White House after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

After he was elected, Trump changed course and expressed openness to working out an arrangement and ordered another review by the committee. That's when the idea of the “golden share” emerged as a way to resolve national security concerns and protect American interests in domestic steel production.

As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel also made a series of bigger capital commitments in U.S. Steel facilities, tallying $11 billion through 2028, it said.

Attorney Mehek Cooke on President Donald Trump's authority to activate National Guard troops to mitigate chaos in Los Angeles and a judge extending a block on Trump's Harvard international student ban.

The Department of Defense is sending thousands more National Guard troops to protect federal property amid anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots in Los Angeles. 

"By direction of the Secretary of Defense and in coordination with U.S. Northern Command, 2,000 additional California Army National Guard soldiers have been activated in a Title 10 status to support the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property in the greater Los Angeles area," according to a Tuesday release from U.S. Northern Command. 

The release says that the 49th Military Police Brigade will be sent to serve alongside the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat team and the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, under the direction of Task Force 51, which is commanded by Maj. Gen. Scott M. Sherman.

HEGSETH DEFENDS NATIONAL GUARD LA DEPLOYMENTS, SAYS ICE AGENTS MUST BE PROTECTED

The task force, which has been the subject of controversy since it was deployed to the West Coast city after an eruption of violence stemming from immigration operations carried out by ICE, will now be comprised of 4,100 National Guardsmen and 700 active duty Marines. 

Gov. Gavin Newsom last week sued the Trump administration for deploying troops to California in the first place, accusing the president of having "commandeered" 2,000 of the state's National Guard members "illegally, for no reason" without consulting with California's law enforcement leaders.

"The INCOMPETENT Governor of California was unable to provide protection in a timely manner when our Ice Officers, GREAT Patriots they are, were attacked by an out of control mob of agitators, troublemakers, and/or insurrectionists," Trump said on TRUTH Social in response to the lawsuit. "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled in favor of Newsom. 

An appellate court is currently reviewing the matter. 

Northern Command said that the troops will not be used in a civilian law enforcement capacity, but rather they will "provide Task Force 51 with adequate numbers of forces to provide continuous coverage of the area in support of the lead federal agency."

"The soldiers are completing training on de-escalation, crowd control, and use of the standing rules for the use of force in advance of joining the federal protection mission," the release said.

TRUMP TAKES ACTION AGAINST 'ORCHESTRATED ATTACK' ON LAW ENFORCEMENT BY DEPLOYING MARINES TO LA: ASSEMBLYMAN

"This is clean up from the Pentagon," Newsom spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo told Fox News Digital in a Wednesday morning statement. "This isn't a new deployment — it's the same group of soldiers who have been diverted from critical wildfire work and work at the border, now twiddling their thumbs for Donald Trump's political theater. This is the deployment of the second set of 2,000 federalized Guard soldiers, under the June 9 order. The description of what they are and aren't going to be doing is meant to be consistent with their legal position, rather than the immigration enforcement support we've seen them doing in Los Angeles."

About two weeks ago, riots erupted in Paramount, California, just south of Los Angeles, after ICE conducted immigration sweeps in the city. Those riots quickly spread north, leading to several nights of showdowns between law enforcement and unruly bad actors. 

Stores in downtown Los Angeles were broken into and looted, and some of the downtown area was vandalized with anti-ICE and anti-Trump graffiti. 

Several "Kill Trump" messages were graffitied in the city's downtown. The U.S. Secret Service told Fox News Digital last week it was "aware" of the threatening messages.

Meanwhile, violent behavior continues to flare up. 

A mob of 100 looters ransacked an AutoZone in southern Los Angeles early Monday morning, resulting in the reported loss of $67,000 in merchandise. 

Detectives are investigating whether the looting episode is related to a "street takeover."

Fox News' Alexandria Hoff reports on the government findings regarding the risks associated with gender surgeries on ‘Special Report.'

The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a Tennessee law banning specific transgender medical treatments for adolescents in the state is not discriminatory, ruling 6-3 to uphold the law.

At issue in the case, United States v. Skrmetti, was whether Tennessee's Senate Bill 1, which "prohibits all medical treatments intended to allow 'a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex' or to treat 'purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity,'" violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

That law prohibits states from allowing medical providers to deliver puberty blockers and hormones to facilitate a minor's transition to another sex.

It also targets healthcare providers in the state who continue to provide such procedures to gender-dysphoric minors— opening these providers up to fines, lawsuits and other liability. 

Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that the law question is not subject to heightened scrutiny "because it does not classify on any bases that warrant heightened review."

"This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field," he said. "The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound."

SUPREME COURT APPEARS DIVIDED OVER STATE BANS ON GENDER TRANSITION 'TREATMENTS' FOR MINORS

United States v. Skrmetti was one of the most closely watched cases of the Supreme Court's term, with potential ripple effects for ongoing legal battles over transgender rights – including bathroom access and participation in school sports.

The ruling could also serve as a legal pretext in future cases involving LGBTQ+ protections, including whether sexual orientation qualifies as a "protected class" on par with race or national origin.

"The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best," he added. "Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us … but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process."

All three liberal justices notably dissented in the case.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent that cited a long history of laws discriminating against others, noting that transgender persons in the U.S. make up less than 1% of the country's population. There are an estimated 1.3 million adults and 300,000 adolescents aged 13 to 17 who identify as transgender, according to the UCLA law school's Williams Institute.

She noted that SB1 "expressly classifies on the basis of sex and transgender status, so the Constitution and settled precedent require the Court to subject it to intermediate scrutiny."

"The majority contorts logic and precedent to say otherwise, inexplicably declaring it must uphold Tennessee's categorical ban on lifesaving medical treatment so long as ‘any reasonably conceivable state of facts' might justify it," Sotomayor said, adding: "By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims."

"In sadness, I dissent," she said.

The court's ruling comes after many other states have moved to ban or restrict medical treatments and procedures for transgender adolescents, drawing close attention to the case. 

During the December oral arguments, justices on the Supreme Court appeared reluctant to overturn Senate Bill 1, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting that state legislatures, rather than courts, are best equipped to regulate medical procedures.

Roberts noted at the time that the Constitution leaves such questions "to the people's representatives," rather than to nine justices on the Supreme Court, "none of whom is a doctor."

Justice Samuel Alito cited "hotly disputed" medical studies on the alleged benefits of such medical treatments, and told the government's attorney that those studies "found a complete lack of high-quality evidence showing that the benefits of the treatments in question here outweigh the risks." 

"Do you dispute that?" Alito asked during oral arguments.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, however, countered that with evidence from underage individuals who were denied treatment. 

"Some children suffer incredibly with gender dysphoria, don't they? I think some attempt suicide?" she asked. 

"The state has come in here and, in a sharp departure from how it normally addresses this issue, it has completely decided to override the views of the parents, the patients, the doctors who are grappling with these decisions and trying to make those trade-offs," she said then.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had asked the Supreme Court to hear the case on behalf of the parents of three transgender adolescents and a Memphis-based doctor who treats transgender patients. 

The Biden administration had previously joined the petitioners in the case via a federal law that allows the administration to intervene in certain cases certified by the attorney general to be of "general public importance."

However, the Trump administration notified the Supreme Court in February that the government would be changing its stance on the constitutionality of the law, saying the Tennessee law does not violate the equal protection clause. 

Also at issue was the level of scrutiny that courts should use to evaluate the constitutionality of state bans on transgender medical treatment for minors, such as SB1, and whether these laws are considered discriminating on the basis of sex or against a "quasi-suspect class," thus warranting a higher level of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. 

That was another focus of the oral arguments in December, as petitioners and respondents battled for more than two hours over the level of scrutiny that the court should apply in reviewing laws involving transgender care for minors, including SB1. 

Tennessee argued then that its law can still withstand even the test of heightened scrutiny, contending in a court brief that it does have "compelling interests" to protect the health and safety of minors in the state, and "in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession."

SUPREME COURT CAN TAKE MASSIVE STEP IN PREVENTING TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS' SPORTS WITH HISTORIC HEARING

Speaking to reporters after oral arguments in December, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said that the Constitution "allows the states to protect kids from unproven, life-altering procedures based on uncertain science."

The high court's decision comes at a time when transgender rights are a hotly contested topic. 

President Donald Trump cracked down on the issue almost immediately after being sworn in to his second White House term in January. Just weeks after his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order preventing biological men from competing in women's sports.

The order, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed on National Girls and Women in Sports Day. It prohibits schools and colleges that receive federal funds and are subject to Title IX from allowing transgender-identifying biological men onto women's sports teams and into women's locker rooms and restrooms.

The Trump administration's policies on transgender rights have inevitably become the targets of legal challenges launched by advocacy groups, medical organizations and individuals who claim they are discriminatory. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the Supreme Court ruling on social media Wednesday. "This Department of Justice will continue its fight to protect America's children and parental rights," she said on X. "I encourage other states to follow Tennessee's lead and enact similar legislation to protect our kids."

When Vice President JD Vance weighed in to defend his boss, President Donald Trump, on Iran, he was coming from a different place than many of his predecessors.

Unlike Dick Cheney under George W. Bush, Vance isn't more hawkish than his senior partner or viewed as pushing for war behind the scenes. 

When Vance endorsed Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, the Ohioan said he was doing so in part because there were no new wars in Trump's first term. In the Signalgate controversy earlier this year, Vance was the most skeptical of the Yemen strikes of Trump's senior national security team. On the same day he defended Trump, Vance denied his staff was leaking information to the press that contradicted the administration's foreign-policy line. 

Unlike George H.W. Bush under Ronald Reagan, Vance isn't seen as less of a true believer than the boss or a throwback to an older form of Republicanism. Vance is seen as a more consistent and committed populist, even if Trump started the MAGA movement a decade ago.

During Trump's first term, Mike Pence was also a throwback to an earlier Republican era and a bridge between MAGA and the mainstream conservative movement. That is much less necessary in the second term, when Trump is the unquestioned leader of the party and the former vice president has taken to defending pre-Trump conservatism from populism.

Unlike Dan Quayle under Bush the elder, Vance isn't seen as a lightweight. Yes, he is much younger than Trump and was only a freshman senator when he was elected vice president. But Vance has written an acclaimed book, Hillbilly Elegy, and many articles about wonkish policy topics. He has proven an effective messenger for their successful 2024 campaign and the Trump administration.

Vance is an important figure in a political movement indisputably spawned by Trump. He is also serving as vice president under a term-limited president, giving him as big a stake as anyone in the administration's success ahead of the 2028 elections.

The vice president had been a Trump critic early on, and sometimes a harsh one. This did not stop Trump from endorsing Vance in a crowded, competitive Republican Senate primary in Ohio. Months after Vance won that primary and the general election as other Republican Senate candidates struggled in the 2022 midterms, he returned the favor by endorsing Trump's renomination, while Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) was still seen as a threat. Vance's endorsement also came before the first Trump indictment. 

Vance leapfrogged many more established Republicans to become Trump's running mate, including Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), Marco Rubio, the former Florida senator who is now secretary of state, Doug Burgum, the former North Dakota governor who is now secretary of the interior, and Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the first term who now appears to be on the outs with the vice president.

You would certainly expect the vice president to defend the president. Kamala Harris went down with the ship last year defending Joe Biden. But Vance is doing so from an unusual vantage point, as an important movement leader in his own right who by all appearances is being actively groomed as a successor. (Trump has downplayed, and sometimes even denied, 2028 succession plan talk.)

That's why Vance is in a position to try to reassure MAGA dissenters about any perceived Trump apostasies, though it may involve the expenditure of political capital the vice president will need later.

“President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads,” Vance said when the Trump-Musk feud began to spiral out of control. “I'm proud to stand beside him.”

When MAGA influencers began speaking out against Trump's support of Israel's military strikes on Iran and any U.S. involvement, Vance said, “I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue.”

TRUMP TESTS SUPPORTERS' FAITH A DECADE INTO HIS LEADERSHIP OF MAGA AND GOP 

Many of these same MAGA influencers had vouched for Vance over other potential VP picks or lobbied Trump to add him to the 2024 Republican ticket.

Vance has more credibility as a Trump defender than other subordinates in the administration. He also has a lot more riding on the outcome.

Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., spoke with Fox News Digital about his bipartisan bill to codify oversight of foreign adversaries, including China, buying American farmland.

EXCLUSIVE: Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts is leading the charge with Democrat Sen. John Fetterman to codify oversight on foreign countries buying American farmland.

The bipartisan Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure (AFIDA) Improvements Act seeks to implement recommendations published by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2024, which found the AFIDA was ill-equipped to combat foreign ownership of American agricultural land. 

"Communist China is our greatest geopolitical threat," Ricketts told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview, adding, "This is a way for us to improve the disclosure that's going on with regard to the purchase of this agricultural land, so we can take other action if necessary to make sure we're not giving Communist China the opportunity to buy agricultural land."

The bill's proposal comes as two Chinese nationals – a University of Michigan post-doctoral research fellow, Yunqing Jian, and Huazhong University of Science and Technology student Chengxuan Han – were held in federal custody after they were accused of smuggling biological materials into the United States.

The suspects have been charged with "smuggling a fungus that has been described as a "potential agroterrorism weapon" into the heartland of America, where they apparently intended to use a University of Michigan laboratory to further their scheme," interm U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Jerome Gorgon said in a statement.

The fungus causes a "head blight," described as a disease of wheat, maize, rice and barley, and is responsible for billions of dollars of economic losses throughout the world each year, according to the Department of Justice. If ingested by humans, the substance can cause vomiting, liver damage and "reproductive defects in humans and livestock." 

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital that the Trump administration is focused on "keeping our homeland secure" through enhanced border screenings. 

"Protecting America's food supply and national security remains a top priority. Last week's smuggling attempt by Chinese nationals of Fusarium graminearum, a dangerous crop-destroying fungus, posing a significant bioterrorism threat, only highlights this imperative to combat this threat," McLaughlin said. 

"That could potentially be very damaging to agriculture," Ricketts told Fox News Digital. "We also know that Chinese nationals have been trying to steal our biotechnology with regard to agriculture. They've also been crashing gates of bases. Supposed Chinese tourists have been flying drones around bases. Of course, the Chinese flew a surveillance balloon over our country when the Biden administration just let that happen."

Ricketts said China has been aggressively buying American agriculture, "which is why we need to have a heightened sense of vigilance around protecting our homeland."

Foreign investors own over 40 million acres of agricultural land in the United States, and between 2010 and 2021, Chinese ownership of American agricultural land increased from 13,720 acres to 383,935 acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 

"It's not just about the number of acres that they own, but the fact that they own it around Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota or Fort Liberty in North Carolina. They're buying it around sensitive military installations," Ricketts said. 

The bill, also co-sponsored by Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, John Cornyn of Texas, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, requires AFIDA reporting for foreign persons holding more than 1% interest in American agricultural land.

The AFIDA Improvements Act aims to increase information-sharing between the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the USDA. It also requires updates to the AFIDA's handbook and establishes a deadline for USDA to set up an online AFIDA system.

Based on the GAO's recommendations, the bill seeks to update the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 to better equip the USDA to combat foreign adversaries' ownership of American agricultural land. 

"We are at the most dangerous point in our history right now since World War II," Ricketts said. "We have to be investing in our military. We have to be supporting our friends around the world that are pushing back on these dictators. Communist China is one of them."

Additionally, the bill comes as conflict in the Middle East reaches a boiling point between Iran and Israel, reigniting concerns about national security. Israel successfully coordinated attacks against Iran from inside the country, and Ricketts pointed to Ukraine's success in targeting a Russian air base.

"What Ukraine was able to do against Russia with their operation that destroyed some of their strategic bombers, and they placed trucks with drones close to an air base and had those drones attack their squadrons. We could be vulnerable to the same thing if China did that here. They've owned farmland close enough to our air bases to be able to launch a drone strike. That should be very concerning to us," Ricketts said. 

Ricketts added that American farmland should not be a "tool that our adversaries, like Communist China, can use to attack us from inside our own country."

There has been little movement on the bill since it was just recently introduced. That is largely because Senate Republicans are narrowly focused on advancing Trump's "big, beautiful bill" ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., explains how to 'deter' the Iranian terror regime on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.'

While the U.S. weighs its future involvement in the conflict between Iran and Israel, many leaders are looking with fresh eyes at Iran's activities targeting Americans worldwide over four decades. 

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., posted on Tuesday, "The forever war is the war that Iran has waged against the U.S., Israel, and the civilized world since 1979." 

The examples of Iran's involvement in attacks on Americans include direct and proxy attacks on U.S. forces, support for terror groups, and assassination efforts.

In the early days of the Islamic revolution in 1979, radical Islamic students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's first supreme religious leader, took hold of the situation, spurning international appeals to release the hostages. The last U.S. hostages were released 444 days later.

In 2023, Sayyed Issa Tabatabai, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's representative in Lebanon, admitted during an interview with the state-controlled Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) that the Islamic Republic was involved in two 1983 bombings that killed Americans in Lebanon. 

The bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 63 victims, including 17 Americans. When two suicide truck bombs exploded at the barracks of multinational forces in Lebanon, 220 Marines, 18 U.S. Navy sailors and three U.S. Army soldiers were killed, and 58 French troops were murdered.

In the IRNA interview, Tabatabai said "I quickly went to Lebanon and provided what was needed in order to [carry out] martyrdom operations in the place where the Americans and Israelis were." He also stated that he received a fatwa from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordering him to carry out the attacks, though the IRNA removed the assertion "shortly after publication," according to a report and translation of the interview from the Middle East Media Research Institute.

On June 25, 1996, 19 U.S. Air Force members were killed when a truck bomb exploded outside the Khobar Towers. Al Jazeera reported that in 2006, a U.S. court found the Iranian government responsible for the attack, committed by Saudi members of Hezbollah. The court ordered Iran to pay $254 million to victims of the attack. 

According to a 2019 Pentagon report cited by the Military Times, Iran bears responsibility for the deaths of 603 U.S. service members in Iraq between 2003 and 2011. This figure accounted for 17% of U.S. deaths in the country during the period. 

Some U.S. victims have been able to prove Iran's connections to our enemies in court.

In 2022, surviving family members and victims won a case against the Islamic Republic of Iran, using the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to hold the regime accountable for its support of terror actors who killed or injured 30 U.S. personnel in Afghanistan.

IRANIAN STRIKES ON ISRAEL ESCALATE, KILLING AT LEAST 24 AND DAMAGING US EMBASSY BRANCH IN TEL AVIV

Bill Roggio, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and editor of the Long War Journal, testified in support of the victims. He told Fox News Digital that "Iran's support for the Taliban and al Qaeda and the impact it had on the deaths and injuries to American soldiers and civilians is incalculable. Iran provided money, weapons, training, intelligence, and safe haven to Taliban subgroups across Afghanistan, including in the heart of the country in Kabul." In Roggio's estimation, "Iran's support for the Taliban was only rivaled by that of Pakistan. I would argue that Iran's extensive support facilitated nearly every Taliban attack on U.S. personnel."

In 2022, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., found that Iran likewise owed damages to the families and victims of 40 U.S. service members who were injured or killed in Iraq due to Iran's support of terrorism in the country.

In attempted retribution for the murder of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran targeted two U.S. bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq with surface-to-surface missiles in 2020. 

In January 2024, three Americans were killed, and 25 others were wounded in a drone attack on an outpost in Jordan near the border with Syria. Two Iranians, one of whom had dual U.S. citizenship, were charged in connection with the attack.

IRANIAN MEN CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH FATAL DRONE STRIKE THAT KILLED THREE US SOLDIERS

At the time of the attack, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex) said that Iranian proxies had "launched over 150 attacks on U.S. troops" following Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks.

Roggio reported that on June 14, Iranian-backed militias "launched three drones" at Ain al Assad, a U.S. base in western Iraq. The drones were shot down before reaching their target. 

Roggio said that the drone attack "appears to be an unsanctioned strike by an unnamed Iranian militia. Unlike past attacks, no group has claimed credit, and there have been no follow-on strikes." He believes Iran "wants to keep the U.S. out of the fight, as the U.S. military has the capability to hit the underground nuclear facility at Fordow."

Between October 2023 and August 2024, Iranian-backed Islamic Resistance in Iraq militias launched 180 attacks against U.S. forces in Syria, Iraq and Jordan. Throughout their "decades of experience," Roggio says Iraqi militias "are estimated to have killed more than 600 U.S. service members."

Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent and private investigator, disappeared from an Iranian island in 2007. Levinson was held hostage and was declared dead in 2020, when he was said to have died in Iranian custody. His family blamed the Iranian regime for his capture and imprisonment.

Just last year, Iran executed Jamshid Sharmahd. Sharmahd survived an assassination attempt in California in which an Iranian agent was convicted of the planned murder. He was then kidnapped by the Iranian regime in Dubai in 2020 as part of a business trip.

The history of prisoner exchanges between Iran and the U.S. dates back to 1979. The most recent prisoner exchange of five Americans imprisoned in Iran for five Iranians detained in the U.S. occurred in September 2023. As part of the deal, the U.S. released $6 billion in frozen assets in South Korea.

In November, the Department of Justice announced charges against an Iranian citizen and two New Yorkers for their role in a murder-for-hire plot targeting multiple American citizens, including President Donald Trump. 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News' Bret Baier on Monday that Trump remains an Islamic Republic target. "They want to kill him. He's enemy number one."

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stood defiant in the face of President Donald Trump's threats, saying any intervention would be met with “irreparable damage.”

In a televised address, Khamenei sought to reassure Iranians amid increasing signals that the United States could join Israel in its assault on Iran. He turned to Iranian history to wave off Trump's threats, warning of retaliation if any actions were taken against Tehran.

“Intelligent people who know Iran, the nation, and the history of Iran will never speak to this nation in the language of threats, because the Iranian nation cannot be surrendered,” Khamenei said. “The Americans should know that any U.S. military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage.”

He added that Iran “will stand firm against an imposed war, just as it will stand firm against an imposed peace.”

“This nation will not surrender to anyone in the face of imposition,” Khamenei added.

His remarks about an imposed peace were primarily a reference to Trump's Tuesday Truth Social post that said, “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”

Other Iranian officials echoed Khamenei's comments. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Iran's Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said, “Any American intervention would be a recipe for an all-out war in the region.”

Intervention “would be extremely reckless, extremely irresponsible,” he continued while signaling an openness for continued diplomacy.

“Diplomacy never ends,” Baghaei remarked.

Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Ali Bahreini said Trump's calls for unconditional surrender were “very hostile,” and he promised that Iran was ready to “respond very firmly” if the U.S. intervened.

“There is a line which, if crossed, there should be a response on our side. And that line will be defined by our relevant authorities, including military forces,” he said.

A response from Iran could include attacks on vulnerable U.S. bases scattered across Iraq, Syria, and other Middle Eastern countries. Though considerably weakened by Israeli strikes since Oct. 7, 2023, Iran still has hundreds of thousands of militiamen it can call upon through its proxy forces, primarily based out of Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen.

Trump signaled a change in rhetoric over the past several days following Israel's success in its decapitation strikes against Iran. On Tuesday, he taunted Khamenei by suggesting the U.S. knew where he was hiding and may choose to assassinate him in the future.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” he said in a post on Truth Social, referring to Khamenei. “He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

The U.S. has moved military assets to the Middle East in preparation for a possible strike against Iran, including refueling aircraft and naval vessels. Israel is relying on the U.S.'s 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs to hit Iran's underground Fordo nuclear enrichment facility, buried hundreds of feet underground in the side of a mountain.

TRUMP TAUNTS AYATOLLAH, SAYS US KNOWS HIS LOCATION BUT WON'T KILL HIM ‘FOR NOW'

Reports increasingly indicate that Trump may soon order limited strikes against Iran's nuclear program.

“The movement right now is away from diplomacy and toward U.S. involvement,” a Trump administration official told Politico's Dasha Burns. “We are moving toward taking out Iranian nuclear facilities.”

Francis Collins led the NIH for a decade before its dismantling. He's still searching for answers.

Francis Collins has overseen some of the most revolutionary science of the last few decades. He led the Human Genome Project that sequenced the entire human genome by 2003, and then in 2009, he became director of the National Institutes of Health, where he served under three presidents and led the agency's research on a Covid-19 vaccine.

But nothing in his years leading biomedical research for the US government could have prepared him for the disruption at NIH over the past few months. Over 1,000 employees at the NIH were suddenly fired at the beginning of April. (Those firings are still being challenged in the courts, but as of now, the employees remain out of work.) Trump administration officials have barred researchers from studying certain topics like vaccine hesitancy or the health effects of wildfires.

“I had experienced transitions before, and those were bumpy sometimes,” Collins told me in a recent interview. “But I didn't expect science to be under this kind of full-bore attack, which is really what happened almost immediately after inauguration day.”

In the past few months, Collins saw scientists placed under communications gag orders, restrained from speaking freely even when no media were present. “You were effectively muzzled,” he says.

Collins, who had stepped down as NIH director in 2021 and had taken over a lab studying diabetes, soon felt he could no longer do his job as a scientist should. He started to worry he might be pushed out. “So I pulled my folks together in a conference room. They didn't know what was coming. And I told them, ‘By tomorrow night, I'm no longer gonna be here.' And we all cried. I never thought it would end this way. My wife came to pick me up on that last Friday, and I just walked out of the building and got in the car and said, ‘I guess this is it. That's how it ends?'”

Just four years ago, Collins was President Donald Trump's NIH director. Now, in Trump's second term, he's resigning under pressure. How did we get from a world where the NIH was universally recognized as a jewel of scientific research to a world where the government is essentially tearing it down from the inside?

I spoke to Collins on Vox's Unexplainable podcast about how so many Americans lost trust in science and how we might be able to get it back. Our interview has been edited for clarity and length.

I'm constantly hearing that Americans have lost trust in science. Is that fair to say?

I think it's totally fair. You can look at all the surveys about trust. Americans have lost trust in almost every institution. 

But I think it was more than that. I think Covid did a lot of harm to people's trust in science because, first of all, it was a huge, disastrous experience for the world. There were days where thousands of Americans were dying. As one of those people who was communicating with the public about what we knew about the virus and what they might do to protect themselves, we were doing the best we could with the information we had, but the information was incomplete. So we often had to change recommendations over time because we learned more about the virus and about the pandemic, and people began to wonder, do these guys know what they're talking about?  

So suddenly this has become such a target for an attack: whether science is something that's good for our country or not.

Your most recent book, The Road to Wisdom, is all about trust. If you were telling the story of the loss of trust and everything going on in the science agencies today, how far back would you start?

It depends on the particular demographic you're talking about. I'm a person of faith, and certainly people of faith have tended to be among the most skeptical of science, and that goes back 150 years or more — the sense that maybe science is trying to do damage to our Christian faith. That was there certainly well before Covid. 

But what group was most resistant to accepting the vaccines? It was white evangelical Christians. I'm a white evangelical Christian, so those are my people, but it broke my heart to see how that happened. And I think Covid did something, took what had been a tendency for science to be political and turned it into a really big deal. If you were a Democrat, you're much more likely to get vaccinated than if you were a Republican. Does that make sense? Not in the slightest, but that's how it was.

When it's becoming clear that more than 50 million Americans aren't getting the vaccine, one of the most remarkable scientific achievements in human history, did that tell you anything about the pursuit of science and how it works?

It certainly woke me up to the fact that we apparently had not done a very good job in explaining to people that when science is tackling some really hard problems and occasionally gets the wrong answer, it's going to get self-corrected because science is about truth. Science is not just a bunch of people who are coming up with answers that they like. These are answers that aren't gonna be sustainable unless they're actually true. And maybe here's also where I began to realize 

That's another problem that society has that I was unaware of in terms of its severity: the importance of truth, the fact that there is such a thing as objective truth. Not everybody shared that: “That might be true for you, but it's not true for me.” I would hear people say that about things that were established facts, and that's a road to destruction of a society if it becomes widespread. Unfortunately, it seems to be doing so right now.

It seems like you believed that all you had to do was develop the vaccine, get to the thing that worked, and then people would take it? Then there's this whole other piece of convincing people that you and the scientific community at large didn't do.

Yep. I was naive about science communication and how it works. And I was, without knowing to call it this, an adherent to the knowledge deficit model.

What does that mean? 

That means that if you're trying to communicate science to get somebody to make a decision, it's because they're missing knowledge, and you're gonna provide that. You're gonna fill their deficit, and then everything will be fine.

You just tell them: Here's a fact. And now they believe the fact?

I'm an expert, here's the fact, and then they'll make the right decision. 

But no, it doesn't work that way, especially when there's already skepticism and distrust. You're seen as an elitist who maybe has an ax to grind or something you're trying to put over on them, and you may even do more harm than good by going after somebody's misunderstandings head-on. They're just gonna dig their heels in more thoroughly. 

I guess what I've learned is we need to do a lot more listening and really understand where people are coming from, and also be prepared to tell stories instead of going down the road with statistics. But that's challenging: For a scientist, that sounds like an anecdote and I would never get away with that in the seminar room. 

But this is not the seminar room, people. We need to actually find better ways to help people understand what we do.

You were in charge of the NIH during Covid. You were often the one communicating to the public. Are there things that you would do differently if you could do it over again?

I wish every time that myself or anybody who was putting forward a public health message would have started off saying, “Look, this is an evolving situation. We still don't know answers to a lot of things we need to know about this pandemic. So what I'm gonna tell you today is the data we've got, but we might have to change that later when we get more information.” We almost never said that.

The other thing is  our one-size-fits-all approach just didn't feel like it made any sense to the public. People in rural communities, who were far away from the carnage that was happening in New York City or Washington, DC, as the virus was running wild, were left wondering: “Why do I have to close my business? I haven't even seen any cases here yet.” I think we lost a lot of people in states that didn't necessarily have heavy academic research centers, who couldn't quite imagine how they should believe us because we didn't seem like we understood what life was like on a small farm in Nebraska. 

During Covid, my number one goal was to save lives. I'm a physician. I took the Hippocratic Oath. I assumed there were other people worrying about the economic effects of this and the effects on children's learning when they were kept out of school. It didn't feel like that was my thing. My thing was to try to keep people from dying. But it became clear to me that that may have been something I was a little bit wearing blinders about. Maybe those other factors about economic harms and harms to children's learning should have been a bit more front and center to the conversations that I was part of.

So I understand looking back on it and saying, “Okay, it would've been more accurate to communicate the level of uncertainty.” To say to people, “This is evolving. We don't know.” Do you think that would've led to a different outcome?

I don't know. I wish we could do the experiment, and maybe we could figure out a way to do it in some controlled space. 

But  I would say 20 percent of the problem was the less-than-perfect communication of the science, and 80 percent of it was the deluge of misinformation and disinformation that contaminated the conversation to the point where a lot of people stopped listening to the actual facts. 

There didn't seem to be any penalty for stating something that's absolutely false, though, and I haven't heard anybody apologize for that.

When I think about your willingness to have difficult conversations, to accept responsibility for mistakes, it seems like this is something that most people are not doing. I've heard you mention maybe we could have something like a truth and reconciliation commission. Or a pandemic amnesty on a larger level, where people could really be open about their mistakes. Do you think that could have any effect?

You know, I proposed the idea of amnesty at an event and the audience blew up. They were not there. People are too angry. 

On both sides? 

On both sides. They're feeling too hurt, too much harm has been done to them. So amnesty, I don't think we're there. Truth and reconciliation, people were okay with that. Because they can imagine that other people are gonna have to ask for forgiveness for what they did. 

But right now, we're so dug in. I hope that this truth and reconciliation option is out there right now. It doesn't quite feel like people are ready to go there. 

It seems to me like what we need is more people embracing uncertainty, more people talking about their mistakes. Whether it's people with their friends who they disagree with, or whether it's the highest scientists in our scientific agencies. How do we get there?

We're a long way from there. When you're in this circumstance where there seems to be a real pitch battle between the various tribes, it makes it hard for anybody to say, “I might be wrong.” The fact that I've been willing to say that has resulted in a lot of attacks, even from people who I thought were my friends. They said, “Oh no, you can't show weakness like that.” 

Well, yeah, we really do need to do that, but we need to all do it and not just expect a few people who are then gonna get whacked for it. It's hard right now, and you don't see a lot of that in our country.

If I were a young scientist and I wasn't sure whether I should stay in the field, what would you say to me?

I would say you're at a really paradoxical time because this is the most incredibly exciting moment for biomedical research. So many things are becoming possible that I would not have dreamed would happen in my lifetime. We're on this exponential curve of gathering insights. So if that's your dream to be part of, don't give it up. 

Now, the paradox is right at the moment, there's a lot of negative things happening in the United States that seem to be threats. But the case here is so compelling that I don't believe those facts can be suppressed for very long. You can already look at polls in which the American public says, “I don't think they should be harming medical research.” That's right there. Seventy-seven percent of Americans raise that point in one poll. 

That's people on both sides of the aisle. There's some momentum there.

Senate Republicans will put the focus back on former President Joe Biden with their first hearing Wednesday on his cognitive status while in office and whether ex-White House officials shielded his health decline.

The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear testimony from former first-term Trump administration officials, including Sean Spicer, while Democrats will boycott proceedings they deride as a “political undertaking” unworthy of the panel's time.

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE: WHAT TO KNOW AS TRUMP ORDERS AN INVESTIGATION INTO HIS PREDECESSOR

Here's what to expect from the GOP-led hearing titled “Unfit to Serve: How the Biden Cover-Up Endangered America and Undermined the Constitution.”

The hearing will feature three Republican witnesses, two of whom served in Trump's first term.

The witnesses are Spicer, former Trump White House press secretary and communications director; the Claremont Institute's Theodore Wold, former acting assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy under Trump and former deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy; and the University of Virginia School of Law's John Harrison.

Democrats declined to call any witnesses as part of their snubbing the hearing, which will be led by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Eric Schmitt (R-MO).

In a preview of his message to senators, Spicer suggested he planned to criticize media coverage of Trump's first term compared to how the press treated Biden's presidency.

“The scrutiny that was baselessly directed at President Trump during his first term was wholly absent from the media coverage of the Biden White House,” Spicer told the Washington Examiner. “The media lacked any sense of curiosity that would naturally stem from what the public could see with their own eyes. Even in the face of deeply concerning — and public — signs of President Biden's mental and physical decline, legacy media outlets were silent.”

The hearing will center more on the constitutional and procedural implications of Biden's perceived unfitness and center less on medical testimony or direct claims of cognitive impairment.

The focus is expected to lean toward questions of executive authority, such as whether officials were making decisions in the White House during key moments of Biden's presidency rather than the commander in chief, as well as what role aides or advisers may have played in concealing his limitations.

“I think we're going to be very forward-looking,” Schmitt told the Washington Examiner. “I think it's important that people have faith that they actually have a president who makes decisions and not by autopen or a bunch of nameless staffers, which is what was happening. … It's just exploring all aspects of the failure and making sure it doesn't happen again.”

Cornyn said he has questions about the Cabinet's ability to remove a sitting president via the 25th Amendment, such as who is “accountable when the Cabinet fails to do its duty?” and “are there penalties for failing to act?”

“Most importantly, as part of our legislative responsibilities, should Congress consider amending the 25th Amendment further to further clarify responsibilities and protocols in case this disaster befalls our nation again?” Cornyn said in Senate floor remarks. 

Republicans plan to use the hearing to explore the alleged internal “cover-up,” not just within the administration but also the media, regarding Biden's capacity. GOP senators are likely to highlight concerns about whether anyone else was effectively calling the shots during periods when Biden appeared visibly unaware or when he was out of the public eye.

Last week, Trump briefly attempted to link former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco to the immigration crisis and Biden's use of an autopen in office. The device, used by presidents for decades for signatures on letters and other superlative purposes that House investigations have zeroed in on, is traditionally less used for executive orders or pardons.

“We're moving murderers out of our country that were put here by Biden or the autopen. The autopen really did it. I mean, the people — whether it's Lisa Monaco or whoever operated the autopen — these are criminals,” Trump said. “People are criminals who allow criminals into our country. And I don't think that Biden knew what the hell he was doing. I don't think he even knew about it.”

While Trump's reference to Monaco and the autopen were vague, his remarks came as he and other Republicans, including an outside government watchdog group, have accused the former president of handling multitudes of official acts using the device.

The Oversight Project, formerly an extension of the conservative Heritage Foundation, claims to have uncovered three separate autopen signatures used during Biden's presidency. It further alleges that there were at least eight separate occasions that the device was used on days when Biden was already signing separate legislation from the White House with an in-person signature.

It “raises serious questions about why the autopen was used so frequently when the President was readily available to sign these critical documents personally,” the Oversight Project said in a statement.

Biden, who is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, has denied that his staff acted without his direction. His legal team has said the use of an autopen is a well-established legal practice, though Republicans and Trump have questioned whether Biden was aware of all the executive agenda items and pardons that were signed using the device.

“I made the decisions during my presidency,” Biden said in a statement earlier this month.

Judiciary Committee Democrats will skip out on the hearing, designed by Republicans to offer a table-setter for ensuing GOP-led inquiries on Biden. Their absence is part of a broader strategy by Democrats to ignore what they consider dubious political fishing expeditions by Republicans.

“We have so many important topics to consider, and this is a totally political undertaking by several of my colleagues,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), the panel's top Democrat. “It is a waste of the Senate Judiciary Committee's time.”

Durbin will offer opening remarks and then depart.

Other Judiciary Committee Democrats either declined to comment on whether they would participate or appeared inclined to skip out also.

“I think the hearing is more performative and theatrical than anything else,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told the Washington Examiner. “I'm not super interested in going to it. It's not an issue that really involves what I view as my job as a United States senator.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) chastised Republicans for being “unrelenting in diversionary actions,” accusing them of trying to divert focus from President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill being debated in Congress by the GOP.

“It's one of their many circus-like diversions that is a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing,” Schumer told reporters, borrowing a line from William Shakespeare's play Macbeth.

Schmitt, the hearing's Republican co-chairman, said that “even the Democrats can't defend Joe Biden's shadow presidency.”

“It's a shame Democrats are once again turning a blind eye and refusing to confront the truth — that Biden was unfit to govern, and those closest to him knew it all along,” Schmitt told the Washington Examiner.

The hearing offers a preview of what may come from other ongoing, more in-depth GOP-led investigations into Biden.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) is conducting his own inquiry behind the scenes. He has contacted more than two dozen current and former aides seeking “voluntary” interviews about Biden's health in office, a debate that was reignited last month with the former president's cancer diagnosis.

DEMOCRATS TO SNUB SENATE GOP HEARING ON BIDEN MENTAL DECLINE ‘COVER-UP'

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) is running a parallel but far more aggressive investigation that has homed in on his use of the autopen. Comer recently subpoenaed Biden's physician for a deposition.

And the Justice Department, at the direction of Trump, will conduct a vast investigation into Biden's health, the alleged cover-up, and whether someone else may have been secretly in control of the Oval Office.

It was the second public appearance by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since the strikes began, and came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” in a social media post and warned Khamenei that the U.S. knows where he is but has no plans to kill him, “at least not for now.”

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected U.S. calls for surrender in the face of blistering Israeli strikes and warned that any military involvement by the Americans would cause “irreparable damage” to them.

“Wise individuals who know Iran, its people, and its history never speak to this nation with the language of threats, because the Iranian nation is not one to surrender,” he said in the low-resolution video, his voice echoing. An Iranian diplomat had earlier warned that U.S. intervention would risk “all-out war.”

Some of the strongest moves on Wall Street were again in the oil market, where crude prices dropped after Trump said it's not “too late” for Iran to give up its nuclear program. 

Oil prices have been yo-yoing for days because of rising and ebbing fears that Israel's fighting with Iran could disrupt the global flow of crude.

During his 2024 run for the White House, Trump promised voters he would quickly end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and keep the U.S. out of costly conflicts.

Steve Bannon, who served as a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration, on Wednesday said the administration should tread carefully.

“This is not something you play around with,” Bannon told reporters. “You have to think this through. And the American people have to be on board. You can't just dump it on them.”

Trump has pushed back at that notion, saying: “My supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them more than they were even at election time when we had a total landslide.”

Trump says Iranian officials continue to reach out. “They've suggested that they come to the White House — that's, you know, courageous.” 

Iran's mission to the United Nations refuted Trump's claim in a statement on social media: “No Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House. The only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to ‘take out' Iran's Supreme Leader.”

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday that Moscow has cautioned Washington against offering direct military assistance to Israel.

“We are warning Washington against even speculative, hypothetical considerations of the sort,” Ryabkov said, according to the Interfax news agency. “That would be a step drastically destabilizing the situation as a whole.”

Trump said earlier this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to serve a mediator with. But the U.S. president said he told Putin to keep focused on finding an endgame to his own conflict with Ukraine.

Carrie Best-Lary was among hundreds of Jews who had traveled to Israel on a trip that was supposed to be about culture and Jewish roots, only to find herself fleeing on a cruise ship to Cyprus. She is in one of two groups that have converged on the Mediterranean island — one leaving Israel and the other trying to get back in.

At a scary time, the two groups that never expected their paths to cross are coming together, seeking shelter and sharing kosher meals.

Cyprus has become a transit point for those being evacuated from Israel or Israelis wishing to return home after being stranded abroad, with thousands now in Cyprus trying to reach Israel.

Witnesses say there have been more than 10 powerful explosions in central Tehran as Israel continues its campaign, with white smoke rising into the air. Iranian officials did not immediately acknowledge the strikes.

The Israeli military urged people to head to shelters after it said it identified missile launches in Iran on Wednesday evening.

Israel had eased some restrictions for civilians earlier in the day, as Iranian missile attacks have been waning.

There were no immediate reports of injuries, according to Israel's emergency rescue service.

“I may do it, I may not do it,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters at the White House . “I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do.”

Iran's supreme leader issued a fresh warning Wednesday that U.S. direct involvement in Israel's military operations be greeted with stiff retaliation.

The “bunker-buster” bombs believed necessary to significantly damage Iran's underground nuclear sites would have to be dropped from an American aircraft.

The denial by Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei comes after three planes flew to Muscat, Oman, from Iran on Wednesday, despite Iranian airspace being closed.

The U.S. State Department is making plans to evacuate American citizens from Israel by flights and cruise ships, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said on Wednesday.

In a post on X, he said Americans interested in leaving Israel should enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) for updates. The link is: https://t.co/rXymPRTQJJ

Huckabee's post comes just a day after the State Department said it had stood up a special task force to assist Americans wanting to leave Israel and other Mideast countries.

There are some 700,000 Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, now in Israel and thousands more in other Mideast countries, including Iran.

A top leader of the Houthi rebels in Yemen, one of Iran's allies, say they will keep up their support for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip until Israeli “aggression stops, and the siege is lifted.”

“Our operations in support of Gaza will not cease, no matter the sacrifices,” said Houthi-backed president Mahdi al-Mashat in a statement Wednesday.

The Houthis are the last militant group in Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.

They've been firing long-range missiles at Israel in the months since it resumed the war in Gaza, setting off air raid sirens but generally causing few casualties. They're also been attacking shipping in Mideast waters.

Republican U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, whose district covers Iowa's capital and suburbs, said the U.S. would back up nuclear negotiations with firm consequences.

“This is something that needs to be on the negotiating table to make the Iranians aware: that there's a real threat here if they refuse to negotiate a peaceful end to their nuclear program, the U.S. has the ability to eliminate it for them,” Nunn told the AP in Dubai on Wednesday.

He's one of four U.S. representatives — two Democrats and two Republicans — visiting wealthy Persian Gulf allies, including Saudi Arabia.

Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider said they're working to get a sense of the challenges facing the so-called Abraham Accords, in which four Arab countries normalized relations with Israel in 2020.

The members of the U.S. House of Representatives are visiting the United Arab Emirates, a key ally in the Gulf, as the conflict between Israel and Iran has frozen nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran.

“A nuclear-armed Iran is an existential threat,” Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider told the AP in Dubai.

Schneider represents northern Illinois' wealthy and working-class communities along Lake Michigan and is a classic swing district with a large number of Jewish voters.

Highlighting deterrence, Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said: “If Iran attacks our forces, I will guarantee you that there will be a very hard response.”

Bacon also hails from a swing district that includes Omaha and which voted for Kamala Harris last fall while sending the Republican back to Congress.






Speaking to the faithful gathered in St. Peter's Square for a general audience, Pope Leo XIV urged: “We must not get used to war. On the contrary, we must reject as a temptation the allure of powerful and sophisticated weapons.” 

The pope said Tuesday that “the heart of the church is torn by the cries rising from places of war, especially Ukraine, Iran, Israel and Gaza,” and appealed for peace “in the name of human dignity and international law.”

In the year and a half before his death, Leo's predecessor Pope Francis became increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the Israeli military's harsh tactics in Gaza. Francis also advocated freeing the hostages held by Hamas, meeting with their families.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An Iranian semiofficial news agency has denied “rumors” that an Israeli airstrike targeted the home of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 

It's the first time media in Iran has explicitly acknowledged the Islamic Republic's paramount leader was a target.

The report came from the Fars news agency, believed to be close to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.

Fars described the rumors as showing “the U.S. and the Zionist regime's anger and confusion in the face of the supreme leader's firm statements made today.”

Three aircraft took off from Iran for Muscat, Oman's capital, on Wednesday. The flights come as Iranian airspace has been closed for days. Their flight trackers all turned on in southeastern Iran, meaning it wasn't immediately clear from where the aircraft took off. 

Iran offered no explanation for the flights and Oman did not immediately acknowledge any arrival of Iranian officials to the sultanate. 

Oman has been a key mediator between Iran and the United States during their five rounds of talks over Tehran's nuclear program.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier Wednesday warned that the United States that strikes targeting Iran will “result in irreparable damage for them” and that his country would not heed to Trump's call for surrender.

“I say good luck,” Trump said when asked about the supreme leader's refusal to surrender.

“Nothing's too late,” Trump said when asked about whether direct U.S. involvement in Israel's military operations against Iran was becoming inevitable. He added. “I can tell you this. Iran's got a lot of trouble.” 

Trump's comments came as during an event on the White House South Lawn to watch the raising of a new flagpole.

NetBlocks, a group which monitors government-caused internet interference, said Iran was “in the midst of a near-total national internet blackout.”

“The incident follows a series of earlier partial disruptions and comes amid escalating military tensions with Israel after days of back-and-forth missile strike,” it said in a post on the social media platform X.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Raja Khatib, whose wife and two daughters were killed in a strike Saturday, said his tragedy showed Jews and Arabs had a shared destiny on the land.

“We have a common future. We need to understand that we have a common destiny,” said Khatib, whose home in the Palestinian city of Tamra in northern Israel was struck. “So let's end all the wars ... and live in peace.”

Israel has roughly 2 million Palestinian citizens.

Khatib described a scene of devastation in his home the night of the strike.

“I heard a huge, big bomb. Then, it became completely dark and dusty,” Khatib said. He tried to ascend to the top floor where his loved ones were killed, “but everything was destroyed.” Khatib's sister-in-law was also killed in the strike.

The Israeli military is urging members of the Iranian security services to contact Israel's Mossad intelligence service, claiming they had been receiving messages from officials worried about Iran's “uncertain future.”

There was no immediate way to independently verify the claim.

In a post on the social platform X in Farsi, the Israeli military provided a website and urged users to employ a virtual private network before attempting contact.

“Even those who identify themselves as members of the regime's security institutions express their fear, despair, and anger at what is happening in Iran and ask us to contact Israeli authorities - so that Iran does not suffer the same fate as Lebanon and Gaza,” the message added.

The message did not elaborate. However, it comes as Iran is in a frenzy over spies, prompting warnings to officials to abandon certain devices, apps and web services.

Late Wednesday afternoon, internet access across Iran crashed. Authorities offered no immediate explanation.

Just after 4 p.m. local time, a likely Israeli airstrike sent a giant plume of gray smoke skyward in the eastern reaches of Tehran. 

It wasn't immediately clear what was targeted.

Israel is easing some restrictions for civilians that have frozen the country in place over the past week, the military announced on Wednesday, six days into the confrontation with Iran. 

While schools are still closed, people will begin returning to workplaces where there is access to shelters.

Restrictions are being eased further in areas along Israel's periphery, which have been targeted fewer times than the country's center. 

“This decision to gradually open the economy in the various regions is a message of victory over the Iranian enemy,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday. Iran has fired fewer missiles as the conflict has worn on, allowing Israeli air defense systems greater accuracy with interceptions.

State television has aired footage of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei giving a statement that was read out by a TV anchor a short while ago. 

The footage strikingly contrasted against the high-quality recording typically produced of his speeches, with his voice echoing as he sat in a room with beige curtains behind him. 

A portrait of Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who Khamenei succeeded, was over his left shoulder, with an Iranian flag to his right.

Khamenei warned the United States that joining the Israeli strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them.”

Germany's foreign minister has underlined European countries' willingness to talk to Iran about a solution to the crisis over its nuclear program. But he says there needs to be movement from Tehran.

Johann Wadephul said Wednesday that “it is never too late to come to the negotiating table, if you come with honest intentions.” 

He spoke two days after he held a call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi along with his French and British counterparts and the European Union foreign policy chief.

Wadephul said the European officials made clear that their countries –- which were part of Iran's 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers –- “still stand ready to negotiate on a solution.”

But he added that “Iran must now move urgently. Iran must take confidence-building and verifiable measures,” including a credible statement that Tehran is not striving for a nuclear weapon.

The European Union says it has helped evacuate about 400 of its citizens out of Israel via Jordan and Egypt as part of its efforts to coordinate emergency response to the conflict within the 27 nations of the bloc.

“Up till now, we have an estimate that over 400 EU citizens were repatriated via this civil protection mechanism of the EU,” said Eva Hrncirova in Brussels on Wednesday. 

She said the EU was fielding requests by Slovakia, Lithuania, Greece and Poland for assistance in evacuating from the Middle East.

“Member states coordinate the list and we co-finance these flights up to the 75% of the transport costs,” she said. 

In the message, Khamenei also urged officials to “continue their work with strength and trust in God.”

“God will certainly and surely make the Iranian nation ... victorious,” he said.

State television said that a video of Khamenei giving the same address would be aired later.

Khamenei's last message to the nation, which was released late Friday after the start of the Israeli campaign, was also first read out on television before he appeared himself reading it a while later. It may be a security measure to protect Khamenei, whose exact location isn't public knowledge.

Iran's supreme leader has warned the United States that joining the Israeli strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them.”

The comments by 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came in a statement read out by a state television anchor against a still image of the leader. It wasn't clear why Khamenei did not appear himself on screen, as he has done earlier since the Israeli attacks began on Friday.

“Any military involvement by the U.S. in this field will undoubtedly result in irreparable damage for them,” the statement said.

Greece's Foreign Ministry says the evacuees included citizens of Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. 

They were flown to Athens early Wednesday from Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh on board two military transport planes, the ministry said.

Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said Bank Pasargad had been targeted, along with Bank Sepah, Iran's first bank, which found its online services disrupted Tuesday.

She said experts are working to resolve the problem.

Iran has been cutting off access to the wider world for Iranians via the internet and blocking landlines from receiving and making international calls.

A group of hackers calling itself “Gonjeshke Darande,” or “Predatory Sparrow,” claimed the cyberattack on Bank Sepah. It wasn't immediately clear if the Bank Pasargad attack was also their work.

The group has claimed hacking a major steel mill in 2022 and disrupting gas stations in 2023.

Iran, long sanctioned by the West, faces difficulties in getting up-to-date hardware and software.

Israel's military said it has destroyed five Iranian AH-1 attack helicopters at a base in western Iran in the Kermanshah area.

The Israelis published black-and-white video of the bombing destroying the helicopters.

Iran did not immediately comment.

Iran under the shah purchased some 200 of the Bell AH-1 SuperCobras, which remain in service as Iran is sanctioned internationally and broadly unable to purchase new weaponry.

Thailand's government has advised Thai nationals were advised to leave Tehran at the earliest chance possible, although there is no immediate plan for an evacuation from Iran.

Nikorndej Balankura, spokesperson of the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said there are about 350 Thais in Iran and no one has been reported injured. He said only five people have expressed their wish to return to Thailand.

The Thai embassy in Tehran has set up a temporary shelter for Thais in Amol, and has temporarily relocated its office to Kordan to ensure safety of those who need to travel for its services. 

Streets in Iran's capital, Tehran, again were deserted Wednesday amid the Israeli attacks.

Occasional cars and men on scooters sped past the closed shops and stores.

Hundreds of Pakistanis living in Iran have arrived at the Taftan border crossing on Wednesday as they make their way back home to Pakistan amid the conflict.

Telecom worker Ghulam Mustafa Ijaz said he was advised to leave Tehran with his family because the situation was becoming dangerous. 

“We left everything behind and carried just one bag containing some necessities and food items,” Ijaz said. “We are five family members, but we carried just one bag. We just left, and left everything else there.”

Iran and Pakistan share a 900-kilometre (560-mile), largely lawless border where smugglers and militants roam freely. Although Pakistan has shut some of the formal crossings, the ones at Taftan and Gabd-Rimdan in southwest Balochistan province remain open for nationals seeking to return home.

Pakistan has strongly condemned Israel's attacks. It has denied that it will provide military assistance to Iran, including nuclear weapons.

Iran's ambassador in Geneva is deriding as “hostile” and “unwarranted” U.S. President Donald Trump's comments calling for Iran's “unconditional surrender.”

Ambassador Ali Bahreini told reporters the Israeli campaign “has not been able to bring big damage to our nuclear facilities” because it had taken precautions to protect them.

Bahreini insisted that Iran has no intention to produce nuclear weapons, a top concern for Israeli authorities. He said “we will continue to produce the enriched uranium as far as we need for peaceful purposes.”

The ambassador rejected any talk of a “setback” on Iran's nuclear research and technological activities caused by Israel's military action, saying “our scientists will continue their work.”

Both the semiofficial Fars and ISNA news agencies reported Wednesday that a replacement system had been installed to replace its Soubashi radar site in western Iran.

The original Soubashi radar, located in the heights of Kaboudarahang County in Iran's Hamedan province, played a crucial role in Iran's air defense network, providing extensive coverage for western, northwestern, and southwestern Iran. 

Hamedan has been repeatedly targeted in Israeli strikes since Israel's campaign began Friday.

“The IAEA has information that two centrifuge production facilities in Iran, the TESA Karaj workshop and the Tehran Research Center, were hit,” the International Atomic Energy Agency wrote on the social platform X.Karaj is a city just outside of Tehran.“At the Tehran site, one building was hit where advanced centrifuge rotors were manufactured and tested,” it added. “At Karaj, two buildings were destroyed where different centrifuge components were manufactured.”

A top Iranian diplomat says his country will “respond strongly” to Israel's “aggression” and will do so likewise against the United States if U.S. forces join the conflict between the rival Middle East powers as it moved into a sixth day on Wednesday.

Ali Bahreini, Iran's ambassador in Geneva, sought to project a defiant message from Tehran and defended its nuclear program as purely peaceful and designed for civilian use at a long-planned news conference with the United Nations press corps in the Swiss city.

Overnight, the United States moved air force refueling tankers and C17s to European bases in Prestwick, Scotland, and Aviano in Italy, according to Aurora Intel, a group that reviews open source information in real time in the Middle East.

This comes as the U.S. is shifting military aircraft and warships into and around the Middle East to protect Israel from Iranian attacks as President Donald Trump warns Tehran to step back from the conflict.

On Tuesday, the U.S. relocated a dozen F-16s from the Italian base to Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, said the group.

A spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry issued a warning Wednesday that an American intervention in the ongoing Israeli strikes targeting his country would spark “an all-out war.”

Esmail Baghaei made the comments in an interview live on Al Jazeera English. It was his first in the ongoing conflict.

“I think any American intervention would be a recipe for an all-out war in the region with very, very bad consequences for the whole international community,” he said.

Baghaei's comments suggested that Iran believes that Gulf Arab countries wouldn't allow the U.S. to launch attacks from any bases in their countries. 

However, the U.S. has aircraft carriers and long-range bombers it could employ for any attack.

Asked if he thought the U.S. could control Israel, Baghaei grimaced and said “Not really.”

Iranian state television has aired its first footage of a downed Israeli drone during Israel's campaign against the Islamic Republic.

In the footage aired Wednesday, a state television reporter stands next to the large drone he identifies as a Hermes 900.

Other footage aired showed what appeared to be the drone going into a tailspin before crashing in a farm field.

Writing in Hebrew appeared on the components of the drone.

The wreckage corresponded to photographs of the Hermes 900, which is a long-endurance drone.

Israel's military did not respond to questions about the alleged drone shootdown.

Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East “as soon as possible” and said China is “deeply worried as Israel's military operation against Iran has caused a sudden escalation of tensions in the Middle East.”

Xi, on a visit to the Kazakh capital Astana late Tuesday, added that China “opposes any actions that infringe upon sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of other countries.”

He added that “China is ready to work with all parties to play a constructive role in restoring peace and stability in the Middle East.”

China has already called on all its nationals to leave Iran, with whom it has long maintained close trade and political ties.

Two flights from Larnaca, Cyprus, landed at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport Wednesday morning, an airport spokesperson said, marking the first flights to bring Israelis abroad back home since the Israel-Iran conflict began.

Footage showed the first plane gliding down the tarmac after landing in Tel Aviv.

Israel's minister of transportation, Miri Regev, greeted the captain in the airport's control tower.

“We are waiting for you here with great anticipation,” she told her in Hebrew. “Very excited, first rescue flight.”

Israel closed its airspace to commercial flights because of the multiple volleys of ballistic missiles launched toward the country each day by Iran.

Tens of thousands of Israelis are stranded abroad, according to Israeli media reports.

Egypt's top diplomat has held calls with both Iran's foreign minister and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, Cairo and Tehran say.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty held the calls Tuesday with Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Witkoff.

Abdelatty reportedly stressed “the necessity of working toward de-escalation in the region and resorting to diplomatic and political solutions that contribute to containing the escalating situation and averting the risk of a widespread conflagration in the Middle East.”

Abdelatty “underscored the imperative of achieving an immediate ceasefire and returning to the path of negotiations as the only means to reach a sustainable agreement regarding the Iranian nuclear program,” his office said in a statement.

A social media account associated with Araghchi confirmed the calls took place.

U.S. officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Federal Reserve kept a steady hand on interest rates, maintaining them at their target range of 4.25% to 4.5%.

The central bank is calling for two rate cuts this year, but policymakers see higher inflation. They have also cut their outlook for gross domestic product.

At his press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers are "well positioned to wait" before moving further on rates. He also said that "we're beginning to see some effects" of tariffs on inflation.

While speaking about the sustained strength in the labor market, Powell added that he sees no signs in the near term that the U.S. economy will weaken.

"The U.S. economy has defied all kinds of forecasts for it to weaken, really over the last three years, and it's been remarkable to see … again and again when people think it's going to weaken out. Eventually it will, but we don't see signs of that now," he said.

Federal Reserve Chair Powell said on Wednesday that tariffs are an unavoidable cost increase to businesses and consumers.

"Everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming months from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs," Powell said. "It will be someone in that chain that I mentioned, between the manufacturer, the exporter, the importer, the retailer, ultimately somebody putting it into a good of some kind or just the consumer buying it."

"All through that chain, people will be trying not to be the ones who can take up the cost but ultimately, the cost of the tariff has to be paid. And some of it will fall on the end consumer."

— Brian Evans

Byron Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments, said the Federal Reserve is likely making a trade-off when it comes to keeping tariff inflation low.

In emailed comments, Anderson wrote that the Fed's decision to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday was unsurprising.

"The Fed has flipped from a long-term data stance when inflation was raging, to this short-term data focus toward rising inflation, as we are seeing cracks in soft data coming from growth, consumers, labor markets, and housing," he said. "The Fed seems obsessed with tariff inflation and are willing to sacrifice employment and GDP growth before adjusting this stance."

Anderson added: "CPI and PCE should see further disinflation from housing over the next year as inventories continue to increase and prices start to decrease."

— Lisa Kailai Han

Fed Chair Powell said the "dot plot" should be interpreted with a grain of salt as the macroeconomic environment remains highly risky.

"I think what you see people doing is looking ahead at a time of very high uncertainty and writing down what they think the most likely case is. No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction, and everyone would agree that they're all going to be data dependent," Powell said.

The projection reflects 19 individual members' expectations for rates, and it indicates an expectation of two rate reductions this year.

— Yun Li

The U.S. economy has not yet seen the full effect of tariffs on prices for consumers, Fed Chair Powell said.

"It takes some time for tariffs to work their way through the chain of distribution to the end consumer. A good example of that would be goods being sold at retailers today may have been imported several months ago before tariffs were imposed. So we're beginning to see some effects, and we do expect to see more of them over the coming months," he said.

— Jesse Pound

With a bevy of economic variables still unsettled, Fed Chair Powell said the central bank is content to sit tight until it learns more.

"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policies," Powell said at his post-meeting news conference.

Powell noted that Trump's tariffs have the potential both to cause one-time price increases that the Fed likely would look through, or a longer-lasting hit to inflation.

— Jeff Cox

Fed Chair Powell highlighted a recent uptick in inflation expectations in his opening remarks and said that trend may be tied to tariffs.

"Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up over recent months, as reflected in both market and survey-based measures. Respondents to surveys of consumers, businesses and professional forecasters point to tariffs as the driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2% inflation goal," Powell said.

— Jesse Pound

The Federal Reserve's meeting had a dovish tone, with expectations for two rate cuts still in place for this year despite upward revisions to near-term inflation forecasts, said Simon Dangoor, head of fixed income macro strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

"Implicitly, FOMC members continue to expect stronger near-term inflation to prove largely transitory and their tolerance to upward moves in unemployment remains low," he said. "We expect the Fed to remain on hold at next month's meeting but think a path could open up to a resumption of its easing cycle later this year should the labor market weaken."

— Michelle Fox

The big news from the Federal Reserve's meeting is the increase in the number of members that don't want to cut interest rates this year, said Jim Caron, chief investment officer for the portfolio solutions group at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

"We went from four people calling for no rate cuts to now seven people calling for no rate cuts," he said on "Power Lunch."

"We're moving towards a no-rate-cut environment going forward," he added.

— Michelle Fox

The Federal Reserve could wind up holding interest rates steady through the end of this year, said David Kelly, JPMorgan Asset Management chief global strategist.

If the inflation is expected to go up due to tariffs, it will fade by 2026, he noted.

"Even if you get a sugar rush from fiscal stimulus, from this bill going through Congress, that sugar rush will fade. Sugar rushes do," Kelly said in an interview with CNBC's "Power Lunch."

"By the end of the next year, the economy should be cooling down. Inflation should be cooling down, and maybe then they can give us some lower rates," he said. "Right now, do not hold your breath waiting for low rates from the Federal Reserve because they don't seem to have any intention of delivering them."

The three major averages kept their gains on the session following the Federal Reserve's move to keep rates steady.

At 2:20 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 was up 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.38%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 106 points, or 0.25%.

The federal funds rate sets what banks charge one another for overnight lending, but also has a domino effect on almost all of the borrowing and savings rates Americans see every day.  

The Fed's decision to hold rates steady means "borrowing rates are high, with mortgage rates near 7%, many home equity lines of credit in double-digit interest rate territory, and the average credit card rate still above 20%," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. "But savers continue to be rewarded with inflation-beating returns on the top-yielding savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit."

From credit cards and mortgage rates to auto loans and savings accounts, here is a breakdown of all the ways the Fed's moves influence your wallet.

— Jessica Dickler

Federal Reserve policymakers opted to keep interest rates at their 4.25% to 4.5% range.

The central bank also stuck with its forecast for two rate cuts. However, policymakers said they see higher inflation.

Stocks were modestly higher across the board just prior to the Fed's rate announcement.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 150 points, or 0.35%. The S&P 500 was toting a 0.37% gain, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.48%.

— Darla Mercado

As the Federal Reserve's rate decision neared, Trump critiqued Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "stupid."

Speaking outside the White House on Wednesday morning, Trump said he didn't expect central bank policymakers to cut rates at the conclusion of their June meeting.

"So we have a stupid person," Trump said of Powell. "Frankly, you probably won't cut today."

"Europe had 10 cuts, and we had none. And I guess he's a political guy, I don't know. He's a political guy who's not a smart person, but he's costing the country a fortune," Trump said.

Fed funds futures trading suggests the Federal Reserve will likely stand pat on rates Wednesday, keeping them at the target range of 4.25% to 4.5%.

The Federal Reserve's outlook could be the big market-moving development on Wednesday.

Policymakers are widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of their June meeting, but traders are eager to hear their latest outlook on the path forward for rates.

The Federal Open Market Committee will be issuing its Summary of Economic Projections, which includes policymakers' forecasts on inflation, economic growth and the unemployment rate. The Fed's closely followed "dot plot" is also part of the outlook, showing FOMC members' projections for interest rates.

The forecast comes at a critical time for the U.S. economy, which is grappling with uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariff policy, mixed economic data and now a conflict between Israel and Iran that is pushing energy prices higher.

The Federal Reserve is largely expected to stay put on interest rates, maintaining them at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, which is where they've been since December.

Even as rates are off their highs and the Fed put through three cuts in late 2024, borrowing costs remain relatively high for consumers.

During the week of June 13, rates on 30-year fixed mortgages are at 6.89%, according to MND. That's up from 4.29% during the week of March 11, 2022 — just before the Fed embarked on its rate-hiking campaign. Home equity loan rates are also high, sitting at 8.4% as of June 13, compared to 5.96% in March 2022, per Bankrate.

Credit card borrowers are also paying more on their balances, with rates hovering at 20.12%, per Bankrate. That's up from 16.34% in March 2022.

Higher rates have been good news for savers, however. Yields on money market funds were at 0.44% as of June 13, compared to 0.08% in March 2022, according to Haver. Five-year certificates of deposit have seen their annual percentage yields rise to 1.71% as of June 13, up from 0.50% in March 2022, Haver found.

The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved Gilead's twice-yearly antiviral injection for preventing HIV – a milestone that the company and some experts say could help bring the world closer to ending the decades-long epidemic caused by the virus. 

But the launch of the injectable drug, which will be marketed under the name Yeztugo, faces a set of potential threats, including the Trump administration's proposed cuts to federal funding for HIV prevention efforts. 

In two groundbreaking clinical trials last year, Gilead's injection proved to be capable of virtually eliminating new HIV infections when taken every six months. Patients take it less frequently than all existing HIV prevention medications, including daily pills from Gilead and another injection from GSK received every other month. 

That makes Yeztugo a valuable and far more convenient tool for addressing an epidemic that led to around 1.3 million new infections and contributed to the deaths of 630,000 people globally in 2023, according to the World Health Organization. 

The U.S. alone sees 700 new cases and 100 HIV-related deaths each week, Gilead CEO Daniel O'Day said in an interview ahead of the approval. HIV continues to have a disproportionate impact on people of color, gay and bisexual men, other men who have sex with men and transgender women.

"It's hard to overstate the importance of this for global public health," O'Day said, adding that the injection "really will bend the arc of the epidemic as we roll this out across the globe."

But the magnitude of its impact will also depend on how easy it is to get, said Jeremiah Johnson, executive director of PrEP4All, an organization focused on expanding access to HIV prevention medications. 

Lenacapavir, the generic name of Yeztugo, has an annual list price of $28,218 in the U.S. before insurance, a Gilead spokesperson said in an email. That is in line with existing branded medications approved for the same use: pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which reduces the risk of getting HIV. 

A month's supply of Truvada and Descovy, Gilead's daily pills for PreP, are both around $2,000 without insurance, which amounts to around $24,000 per year. One dose of GSK's Apretude, which is taken once monthly for the first two months and then once every other month thereafter, costs roughly $4,000 before insurance.

"We are working to make Yeztugo accessible for anyone who needs or wants it and expect to see broad insurance coverage," the Gilead spokesperson said, adding that there is broad insurance coverage for existing prevention options.

The company said it has a copay savings program for eligible insured patients that may reduce out-of-pocket payments for Yeztugo to as little as zero dollars. Gilead also has a program for eligible uninsured people to receive the injection for free.

Lenacapavir is already approved for treating HIV under the brand name Sunlenca, which has a price tag of more than $42,200 per year. One analysis in 2024 found that the drug could be made for as little as $26 to $40 a year.

Mizuho analysts have estimated that lenacapavir could reach peak sales of around $4 billion globally for both HIV prevention and treatment.

O'Day said the company is also committed to supplying the drug for that use globally as the virus "knows no boundaries." Gilead in October granted licenses to six generic manufacturers to produce and sell lower-cost versions of the injection in 120 low- and lower-middle-income countries.

Gilead also promised to supply doses for up to 2 million people at no profit before those generic versions come to the market, O'Day said. 

PrEP has been available for a decade in the form of daily pills, but infections have climbed or remained roughly flat in many areas. Pills can be difficult for many people to take consistently for several reasons, including inconvenience and stigma around HIV and PrEP in many communities, particularly outside the demographic of white men who have sex with men.

Black Americans account for 39% of new HIV diagnoses but only 14% of PrEP users, while Hispanic people represent 31% of new diagnoses but just 18% of PrEP users, according to AIDSVu.

"Unfortunately, there's still enormous amount of stigma and cultural challenges when it comes to HIV prevention," Johanna Mercier, Gilead's chief commercial officer, said in an interview. "Getting a twice-a-year injection really gives you that privacy that people have been looking for."

She said Gilead aims to ensure that more people, especially those not currently using PrEP, are aware of that convenience advantage and efficacy of the company's injection.

In one late-stage trial, 99.9% of patients who took Gilead's injection did not contract an infection. There were only two cases among more than 2,000 patients, effectively reducing the risk of HIV infection by 96% and proving 89% more effective than Gilead's daily pill Truvada. The study enrolled cisgender men, transgender women, transgender men and gender nonbinary individuals who have sex with partners assigned male at birth.

Another trial on cisgender women found that none of the participants who received Gilead's injection contracted an HIV infection, demonstrating 100% efficacy. 

In the U.S., ensuring access to underserved populations will also require broad insurance coverage. While most PrEP users are under commercial plans, the federal Medicaid program is also crucial to reaching lower-income communities.

Medicaid is the largest source of insurance coverage for people who have the virus in the U.S., covering an estimated 40% of nonelderly adults with HIV, according to health policy research organization KFF. That makes Republicans' proposed funding cuts to Medicaid a huge potential threat to HIV treatment and prevention access.

Mercier said, as of now, Gilead believes that Medicaid will continue to cover HIV services and support.

"There are pretty incredible programs out there, not only Medicaid and other government programs, that really have safety nets to make sure that people who need or want access, both for HIV treatment and prevention, are set up," she said, also pointing to Gilead's programs for uninsured individuals.

But PrEP4All's Johnson said the "entire foundation for HIV prevention in America is under attack at this moment."

Other proposed federal funding cuts could make it harder to get Gilead's injection into the hands of physicians and patients, Johnson said. For example, the White House's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 includes deep cuts to several HIV prevention programs, particularly those run through the CDC.

While some funding streams are continuing, Johnson said they are doing so "in a way that would completely destabilize the entire field of HIV prevention."

He said if Congress does not push back on the proposed cuts, people currently taking PrEP "could start to slip off" and HIV infections could rise in many communities.

A multitrillion-dollar tax package issued Monday by the Senate Finance Committee would offer a tax break for drivers on auto loan interest, but it doesn't seem to be available for used cars, tax experts said.

The Senate GOP tax plan is part of a broader domestic policy bill that Republicans are trying to get to President Trump's desk by the Fourth of July, and aims to partially fund tax cuts by slashing spending on health programs like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. The House passed its version — the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" — in May.

One of the legislation's many provisions would let taxpayers deduct up to $10,000 of auto loan interest from their taxable income in any given year. The average driver paid $1,332 of annual loan interest charges on new cars bought in 2024, according to AAA.

The tax break — which President Trump proposed when campaigning for president last year — would be available from 2025 through 2028.

Qualifying vehicles must be U.S.-assembled cars, minivans, vans, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, or motorcycles for personal use.

The Senate legislation excludes all-terrain vehicles, trailers and campers, which the House bill had included.

The deduction would only be available for loans secured after after December 31, 2024, according to the Senate legislation. It must also be the first loan on the vehicle.

Unlike a tax plan passed by the House in May, Senate Republicans appear to limit the tax deduction to new — and not used — passenger cars, tax experts said.

The Senate limits the tax break to vehicles for which "the original use ... commences with the taxpayer," according to the legislative text.

That phrasing is "pretty clear" in its meaning that only loans on new cars are eligible for the tax deduction, said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

"They don't say the word 'new cars' but I don't see another way of interpreting that language," Gardner said.

That would limit the usefulness of the tax break for low- and middle-income taxpayers, who more often buy used cars, Gardner said.

A survey of low- and middle-earning households published in 2023 by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, showed 61% had bought a used vehicle, while 39% bought a new one.

Average household income was $115,000 for new-vehicle buyers in 2023, compared to $96,000 for a used-car buyer, according to Cox Automotive.

Cox estimates more than 20 million households will buy a used car in 2025. In March, it forecast about 16 million new-vehicle sales this year, though said tariffs levied by the Trump administration cloud the sales outlook.

Higher earners tend to get more value from tax deductions than low and middle earners, Gardner said. Deductions reduce the amount of taxable income that households pay, and high earners generally pay a higher federal tax rate than lower-earning households.

"The more you earn, the higher the tax rate you pay, meaning the more benefit you get from this thing," Gardner said.

However, the auto loan interest deduction starts to lose value when a taxpayer's annual income exceeds $100,000. The threshold is $200,000 in the case of a joint tax return filed by married couples.

The deduction's value falls by $200 for each $1,000 of income over those thresholds.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration put 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts. Those tariffs are expected to push up car prices, and in turn erode the deduction's value for households, Gardner said.

"Tariffs will completely eat up the value of this deduction for a lot of people," he said.

William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, said he thinks the "biggest change" from the House version of the legislation is "to prevent loans against used cars."

Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo has applied for a permit to test its robotaxis in New York City, underscoring its intent to operate in one of the largest ride-hailing markets in the US despite an absence of local regulations supporting commercially operated autonomous vehicles.

The company has applied for a permit with the city's Department of Transportation to operate its vehicles autonomously in Manhattan with a trained human specialist supervising behind the wheel, spokesperson Ethan Teicher said in a statement Wednesday. Shares in rival ride-hailing providers Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc. slid on the news.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets ended the trading day lower as investors monitored the latest developments in the Middle East.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 provisionally closed 0.34% lower, with healthcare stocks leading the decline.

Germany's DAX index and the French CAC 40 both ended the trading day around 0.4% lower, while the  FTSE 100 bucked the trend to close 0.1% higher.

A spate of interest rate decisions from central banks are due tomorrow, including the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank. Traders are also bracing for the Federal Reserve's latest rate policy decision, due later today.

British lender TSB has attracted acquisition interest from larger rivals NatWest and Santander, according to two media reports.

Spanish financial news outlet Vozpopuli reported overnight that TSB's parent Sabadell had been approached by U.K. bank NatWest, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland, expressing takeover interest.

According to the news outlet's sources, NatWest is expected to make a 2.3 billion euro ($2.65 billion) offer for TSB.

British broadcaster Sky News also reported that Santander had approached Sabadell with similar intentions for TSB.

Earlier this year, NatWest also reportedly made a £11 billion offer ($14.8 billion) to acquire Santander's U.K. banking division.

Shares of a little-known Swedish company Bambuser are up around 75% this morning after it revealed details of a deal with China's Alibaba.

Bambuser said it has partnered with Alibaba Cloud, the technology subsidiary of the Chinese giant, to make its live video shopping technology available in the Chinese market.

Livestream shopping is a phenomenon that originated in China in 2016, where companies and individuals market their wares over a live video stream. Consultants McKinsey say the trend is growing in the U.S. and Europe as well, helped by the growth of social media app TikTok in those markets.

"To support its entry into the Chinese e-commerce market, Bambuser leverages Alibaba Cloud's secured cloud infrastructure and innovative video solutions to bring its complete video commerce platform to the brands in the market," the company said in a statement.

The deal with Alibaba is expected to help Bambuser gain access to a large market in China —  where 55% of users engage in live video shopping, the most globally.

"As a leading cloud service provider, we aim to collaborate with Bambuser to foster retail business growth in China, the largest e-commerce landscape in the world," said Esmie Wang, general manager of the EU at Alibaba Cloud Intelligence.

The share price surge partly reverses a long-term decline in the share price of Bambuser. The company's stock has given up nearly all the gains it had accumulated during the pandemic.

The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will give an update on its key interest rate on Thursday, a day after U.K. inflation cooled slightly to 3.4%.

"Make no mistake: despite the still elevated levels of inflation, this will be welcome news for the MPC," Deutsche Bank's Sanjay Raja said in a note after the print was released. "The Bank's preferred measure (excluding indexed and volatile components, rents, and foreign holidays) [dropped] below 4% y/y for the first time since February 2022."

Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, noted that the conflict between Israel and Iran could also impact inflation moving forward.

"The price at the [gasoline] pump played a big part in the slight fall in headline inflation but the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has impacted the oil price in the past week, with UK motorists already bracing themselves for hikes and airfares also expected to soar," he said.

Deutsche Bank's Raja agreed that policymakers will be monitoring the situation in the Middle East, which would "undoubtedly complicate the MPC's task."

"The focus now will turn to geopolitical events and the rise in energy prices," he said. "Higher energy prices will mean higher inflation expectations. The trump card? The labour market data. The ongoing labour market loosening should give the MPC a little more confidence in its 'gradual and careful' approach to dialling down restrictive policy."

Jordan Rochester, head of FICC strategy at Mizuho Bank EMEA, agreed that the British labor market could influence sentiment at the Bank of England.

"It is the labour market news that has provided the recent dovish surprise and could prove to be the justification for a dovish shift in voting/language tomorrow," he said.

Sweden's central bank cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday to 2% amid weakening inflation, but pointed to geopolitical risks ahead.

"The economic recovery that began last year has lost momentum, and inflation is expected to be somewhat lower than in the previous forecast," it said in a press release, noting "favourable conditions for stronger economic activity in Sweden," partly because of increasing real household wages.

Annual Swedish inflation most recently came in at a cooler-than-expected 2.3% in May, according to the country's statistics office. The central bank — known as Riskbank — aims to keep inflation at a lower 2%.

Looking ahead, the central bank warned "there are substantial risks linked to trade policy and the geopolitical tensions, not least as a result of the escalating conflict in the Middle East, which could affect economic developments abroad."

We're around 25 minutes into Wednesday's trading session, and so far there's no consensus movement among regional stocks. 

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen marginally lower, with sectors in mixed territory. 

Major bourses are also pointing in different directions, with Germany's DAX index slightly below the flatline while the FTSE 100 and the French CAC 40 last seen up by around 0.1%.

Ahead of a business update on Wednesday, Airbus raised the upper end of its dividend payout ratio and confirmed its full-year guidance.

The company said that it would extend "the upper range of the dividend payout ratio to 30-50% from the current payout ratio of 30-40%."

Shares were last seen trading 1.4% higher.

U.K. government bonds, known as gilts, strengthened slightly after inflation came in in line with analysts' expectations.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt was around 2 basis points lower by 7:07 a.m. in London. Yields on 2- and 20-year gilts were down by around 1 basis point, while 5- and 30-year gilt yields remained unchanged.

Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.

U.K. inflation cooled slightly to 3.4% in the year to May, data from Britain's Office for National Statistics showed on Wednesday.

The reading was in line with analyst expectations.

A month earlier, inflation unexpectedly surged to 3.5%.

Good morning and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering European financial market action and the latest regional and global business news, data and earnings.

Futures data from IG suggests sharp falls across European markets at the open, with London's FTSE looking set to open 52 points lower at 8,827, Germany's DAX down 245 points at 23,447, France's CAC 40 down 75 points at 7,665 and Italy's FTSE MIB 329 points lower at 39,568.

Global investors continue to assess ongoing fighting between Israel and Iran tensions after continued missile attacks and airstrikes on Monday.

Oil prices have risen on supply worries, and the price of gold has also increased amid a flight to safe haven assets after the conflict erupted last week.

Those prices rose further overnight, and U.S. stock futures turned lower, after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a further escalation in attacks could be coming as he urged Iranians to evacuate Tehran.

— Holly Ellyatt

The U.S. Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision is due Wednesday afternoon. Fed funds futures are pricing in an almost 100% likelihood that the central bank will keep rates unchanged, as per CME's FedWatch tool, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's continued pressure on Fed Chief Jerome Powell for a rate cut.

Investors will be keeping a close eye on Powell's post-meeting comments and for the central bank policymakers' forecast on rate policy, as the Federal Open Market Committee will be sharing members' "dot plot" of rate expectations.

In Europe, U.K. investors will be keeping a close eye on inflation data from the U.K. for May, with economists expecting the consumer price index to have risen 3.4% in the year to May. Elsewhere, Sweden's Riksbank publishes its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday.

There are no other data or major earnings reports due.

Amazon-owned autonomous vehicle startup Zoox on Wednesday opened a sprawling new manufacturing facility in the San Francisco Bay Area, paving the way for more robotaxi production as it plans a commercial rollout of its fleet later this year.

The company will use the site in Hayward, California, to increase its robotaxi fleet significantly. The facility is currently producing one robotaxi per day, but Zoox said it expects to accelerate that rate over the coming year.

At full scale, it will have the capacity to assemble 10,000 robotaxis a year, with roughly three robotaxis being produced per hour, the company said. Zoox did not provide a timeline for reaching that production level.

"We don't need to crank out a vehicle every minute because we're not selling these things," Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said on the facility's production floor during a tour.

Zoox needs more of its toaster-shaped robotaxis to roll off the assembly line in order to fulfill its mission of deploying a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S. Zoox, founded 11 years ago and purchased by Amazon for $1.3 billion in 2020, began testing its robotaxis on public roads in 2023.

The company currently has a few dozen robotaxis on public roads in Foster City, California, San Francisco and Las Vegas. Zoox expects to eventually operate between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in small- to medium-sized cities where it offers ride-hailing services, Evans said.

Zoox is racing to catch up to Alphabet's Waymo, which operates the only fully public driverless ride-hailing service in the U.S. Waymo has aggressively expanded into new U.S. markets in recent years, and provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.

Evans said Zoox is "very proud" of Waymo's progress, adding that it helps validate the work that Zoox and others are doing to deploy an autonomous ride-hailing service.

Elon Musk's Tesla is poised to launch its robotaxi service in Austin on June 22, though Musk cautioned that date could shift as the company is "being super paranoid about safety."

Zoox is gearing up to launch public rides in Las Vegas, its first commercial market, later this year. San Francisco is expected to follow in 2026, with additional locations in Austin and Miami coming in the next few years.

Similar to other ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, Zoox riders will be able to hail a robotaxi via an app.

Unlike Waymo, which uses Geely Zeekr minivans, Zoox has developed its own custom-built "carriage-style" vehicles, where up to four passengers face each other and there's no steering wheel. Evans called the robotaxis "high-end computers on wheels."

Zoox CTO Jesse Levinson has said previously that the cost of developing Zoox's bespoke robotaxis is "significant." The cost of each vehicle should come down as Zoox scales up its fleet, Levinson said during the tour.

Zoox said the new facility, spanning roughly 3½ football fields, is the first site "dedicated solely to producing purpose-built robotaxis" in the U.S., a well-timed move given President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies. The facility was occupied by bus manufacturer Gillig prior to Zoox's arrival.

About half of the company's suppliers are based in the U.S., but it also sources some parts from countries including China and Italy.

Zoox may open additional manufacturing facilities elsewhere in the U.S. and internationally over time, Evans said.

The facility is located just across the bay from Zoox's headquarters in Foster City, California. The company also operates a small manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, which will now be used to assemble its test fleet of retrofitted Toyota SUVs and to configure the sensor pods that sit atop its robotaxis, enabling them to see in all directions.

The Hayward facility currently employs about 100 technicians. Zoox also uses robots for specific tasks on the floor like applying adhesive for glass installation and transporting the robotaxi from station to station down the assembly line.

Once the vehicle is assembled, it goes through end-of-line testing. This includes a calibration bay to ensure all cameras and sensors work properly, a station that stress tests the powertrain at high speeds and then the vehicle takes a "shower" in a simulated rainstorm to check for any leaks.

The robotaxis take several laps around a test track located behind the facility before they're considered "fit for the road," Zoox said.

Zoox has ramped up marketing as it prepares to open its service to the public.

"Because the vehicle looks so different, we need to announce ourselves," Evans said.

OpenAI:

OpenAI has been shifting away from relying on Scale AI for data-labeling work.

OpenAI is phasing out the work it does with data-labeling startup Scale AI, cutting ties with the company days after Meta Platforms Inc. invested billions of dollars in it and hired its founder. 

Scale accounted for a small fraction of OpenAI's overall data needs, according to an OpenAI spokesperson who confirmed the firm's decision to phase out work with the company. The ChatGPT maker was already in the process of winding down its reliance on Scale before Meta, an OpenAI competitor, took a 49% stake in the firm, the spokesperson said, adding that OpenAI had been seeking other providers for more specialized data needed to support increasingly advanced artificial intelligence models.

Shares of a little-known Chinese herbal medicine company have surged this year, with a fresh rally seeing the price quadruple in less than a week. 

It's been a head-scratching move, since the company is unprofitable, and shares have moved on seemingly no news.

Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based firm specializing in traditional Chinese medicine, saw its US-listed stock soar 398% over the first two days of the week. But that move pales in comparison to the year-to-date increase, which amounted to roughly 60,000% through Tuesday's close.



The company, which offers a proprietary oral formula it says can help treat disorders like ADHD and autism, has not generated any revenue, according to a regulatory filing from October. Over the last two fiscal years, the company said it lost a combined $10.4 million.

So, what on earth is going on with this stock? Here's what to know.

Regencell, which trades under the ticker "RGC" on the Nasdaq, soared 283% on Monday after its 38-for-1 stock split went into effect. The company originally announced the stock split on June 2.

While stock splits don't generate any value for the company — with overall market cap staying unchanged — they are often viewed as a bullish driver, since a lower per-share price can make a stock more appealing to retail investors.

Regencell finished Monday with a market cap of $30 billion, which swelled further to $39 billion at Tuesday's close. That made it — at least temporarily — worth more than more well-known companies like Lululemon, Kraft Heinz, and Reddit.  

The rapid rise of Regencell stock was bound to catch the eye of the retail crowd, but even the enduringly bullish cohort is incredulous about what might be going on.

Though Regencell is still less talked about than flagship stocks like Tesla and Apple, users on Reddit were quick to identify the surge this week, with some speculating that Regencell was the market's newest "meme stock."

"Regencell is doing some weird stuff again," one user wrote on the subreddit r/shortsqueeze.

"I'm trying to decide if I should pull out before a possible crash," another user, who said they were a longtime investor, said on the r/pennystocks subreddit.

"I was gambling. Didn't have a clue what this company is," another user wrote on a separate thread on r/shortsqueeze about Regencell this month. "I've been watching it go the last two weeks and keep telling myself that it will crash as soon as I buy back in."

Regencell stock was also surging around the time Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continued his anti-vaccine push, with the Health and Human Services Secretary removing all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week, an independent panel that helps shape vaccination policies in the US.

Regencell says it has a proprietary Traditional Chinese Medicine formula, a liquid-based oral formula it says can help treat ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder.

The formula, which is meant to be taken twice a day and aims to treat the "fundamental cause" of neurocognitive disorders, contains "only natural ingredients," the firm says.

Its website lists various herbs with qualities that can help with blood circulation, digestion, "detoxication," and other functions.

"We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable," the firm said in its October filing.

The company only has a small number of shares available to trade, one factor that can explain the large swings in its stock. Out of its 500 million shares, just 30 million are available for public trading. That's a far lower percentage than the average for the more widely traded stocks that populate major indexes.

Most of the company is owned by Regencell's CEO, Yat-Gai Au. He owned 86% of the company, or a $426 million stake in the first quarter, according to holdings data.

His net worth has surged to as much as $33 billion this week, according to Bloomberg, vaulting him into the ranks of the world's richest people.

Regencell's second-largest holder, Digital Mobile Venture, owned 7.6% of the company at the end of the first quarter, or around $37.5 million. RBC, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley also owned miniscule amounts of the stock.

Initial public offerings from Chinese or Hong Kong-based firms have been in the spotlight recently.

A report from The Wall Street Journal this week said that more than 20 China-based companies and 17 Hong Kong-based companies that went public on the Nasdaq since 2020 have lost 50% of their value or more in a single trading day over the last two years.

In 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority issued a warning about a "heightened threat of fraud" related to small-cap companies that had recently gone public on US exchanges.

Many of the companies associated with fraud had operators based in China or broker-dealers based in Hong Kong, the regulator said.

In many cases, the broker-dealers were allocated 90% or more of the public float, Finra said, meaning they held most of the IPO shares.

The small remaining float leaves stocks vulnerable to market manipulation, it said, referring to such companies as "ramp-and-dump schemes."

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Nobitex, was hacked for more than $90 million Wednesday, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.

The funds were drained from platform wallets into addresses bearing anti-government messages explicitly referencing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, pointing to a politically motivated cyberattack, Elliptic said.

Blockchain research firm Chainalysis said the stolen crypto included bitcoin, ethereum, doge, ripple, solana, tron, and ton.

Pro-Israel hacking group Gonjeshke Darande, or "Predatory Sparrow," claimed responsibility for the attack and said it would release the exchange's source code. Elliptic said the exchange was offline at the time of its post.

Predatory Sparrow also claimed credit for a separate cyberattack on Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah this week.

Fighting erupted between Israel and Iran on Friday and the countries have continued to trade missile fire. Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened the U.S. with "irreparable damage" Wednesday in response to President Donald Trump's demand that the country surrender.

Though the stolen assets have not been conclusively attributed to the group, Elliptic said the funds were sent to cryptographic addresses the hackers likely cannot control — suggesting the money was intentionally destroyed as a symbolic act rather than stolen for profit.

"Our analysis reveals that the addresses used in the attack were burner addresses where the attackers do not possess the private keys, meaning that the motive for stealing the $90+ million in funds is for other than financial gain," said Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, in a statement.

Elliptic's research linked the Nobitex exchange to the IRGC, a powerful branch of the Iranian military designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and Canada.

Past investigations have connected the platform to sanctioned IRGC-linked ransomware operatives and individuals close to Khamenei.

Blockchain data also shows activity between the Nobitex exchange and wallets associated with Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Houthis.

Elliptic said it's continuing to monitor virtual asset flows tied to Iranian entities and has updated its compliance tools to reflect emerging threats in the region's crypto ecosystem.

Apollo has been a major backer of Wolfspeed since at least 2023.

Struggling chipmaker Wolfspeed Inc. will be taken over by creditors including Apollo Global Management Inc. under a proposal that would put it into bankruptcy just long enough to slash billions in debt, according to people familiar with the plan.

The company will soon announce a deal with lenders for a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information is private. In the weeks after that restructuring support agreement is signed, the company would ask creditors to vote on the deal and then file a Chapter 11 case, according to one of the people.

U.S. Steel shares stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday after Japan's Nippon Steel completed its acquisition of the iconic American industrial name.

President Donald Trump has insisted for weeks that the companies would form a "partnership" in which U.S. Steel would remain American-owned.

But the New York Stock Exchange notified the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday that U.S. Steel's shares would be removed from listing, after the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America.

U.S. Steel shares stopped trading at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday after Nippon completed its acquisition, according to a notice from the NYSE. The delisting will be effective on June 30, NYSE said.

Trump opposed Nippon's bid to acquire U.S. Steel in the runup to the 2024 presidential election, but he changed his stance after he took office, ordering a new review of the deal in April. Former President Joe Biden had blocked Nippon's acquisition in January, citing national security concerns.

Trump announced a "partnership" between U.S. and Nippon in a May 23 post on his social media platform Truth Social, causing confusion among investors and union members about whether the structure of the original deal had changed somehow.

U.S. Steel and Nippon started adopting the president's "partnership" language, though they never backed off from the terms of the original December 2023 merger agreement in their filings with SEC. U.S. Steel will continue to operate under its name.

Trump did compel U.S. Steel and Nippon to sign a national security agreement with the U.S. government as a condition for him clearing the deal.

The U.S. president will wield a "golden share" under the terms of the agreement. U.S. Steel said Wednesday that the golden share gives the president veto power over the following decisions:

A majority of U.S. Steel's board members and its CEO will be U.S. citizens, according to the terms of the national security agreement. Nippon also agreed that U.S. Steel will remain incorporated in the U.S.

Nippon will invest $11 billion in U.S. Steel by 2028, including $1 billion in initial spending on a greenfield project that will be completed after 2028, according to the agreement.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he gave Iran an "ultimatum" as he considers whether to order a U.S. strike against the country, amid its ongoing conflict with Israel. 

Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem began preparing for large-scale evacuations of Americans who want to leave Israel.

"I may do it, I may not do it," Trump told reporters at the White House when asked if he would order that strike in support of Israel's ongoing bombardment of Iranian nuclear and military targets.

"I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do," Trump said. "I can tell you this, that Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate."

Asked if he gave Iran an ultimatum, Trump said, "You could say so. Maybe you could call it the ultimate ultimatum."

About an hour later, U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said evacuation flights and cruise-ship departures are being arranged for American citizens seeking to leave Israel.

A U.S. strike against Iran is one option among a range that Trump is weighing after meeting with his top national security advisors in the Situation Room on Tuesday afternoon.

Earlier that day, Trump had called for Iran's surrender and threatened its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling him an "easy target."

In his remarks Wednesday morning, Trump also claimed that Iran had reached out to the U.S., and had even offered to send a delegation to the White House for talks.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations quickly denied this, and rejected the prospect of accepting a peace plan in the midst of hostilities with Israel.

"No Iranian official has ever asked to grovel at the gates of the White House," the mission said on its official X account. "The only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to 'take out' Iran's Supreme Leader."

"Iran shall respond to any threat with a counter-threat, and to any action with reciprocal measures," the mission added.

Earlier Wednesday, Khamenei threatened the U.S. with "irreparable damage" if Washington followed through with a military strike against nuclear facilities in the regional power. 

"Any American military entry will undoubtedly be met with irreparable damage," Khamenei said, according to NBC News reporting. He added that America's potential involvement in Iran "will 100% backfire" and that "the damage they suffer will be far worse than anything Iran may face. If they enter militarily, they will face harm that they cannot recover from."

CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment.

Iran and Israel have been trading missile fire since Friday, when the Jewish state launched what it called a preemptive attack on Iran's nuclear program and other military sites. 

The International Atomic Energy Agency on Wednesday said two nuclear centrifuge production facilities in Iran were hit.

Trump on Tuesday warned that the patience of the U.S. — a historically close ally and weapons provider of Israel — was "wearing thin."

"We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now," Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform, stressing the White House does not want missiles "shot at civilians, or American soldiers" but nevertheless aims for Tehran's "UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!"

Khamenei responded Wednesday, saying "the Iranian people are not a people who can be forced into surrender."

Under Trump's second administration, the White House has been attempting to broker a deal over Iran's nuclear program, with talks so far yet to bear fruit. 

Washington has previously insisted it was not directly involved in the hostilities, but Trump's latest comments have stoked speculation over a change in strategy — and a potential direct U.S. military attack against Iranian sites.

"From the beginning, it was suspected that America was involved, and now, with their own officials' words, this suspicion is growing stronger," Khamenei said.

Tensions between the two historical Middle Eastern foes have been running high since the October 2023 attack on Israeli territory carried out by Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas. Israel has since accused Iran of offensives undertaken through its network of regional allies that also include Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi groups. Tehran denies involvement.

Amid ongoing fire exchanges, Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, on Wednesday said in a Google-translated social media update that "a tornado passes over Tehran" and "this is how dictatorships collapse."

Earlier in the week, leaders of the world's Group of Seven most advanced economies had labeled Iran a "principal source of regional instability and terror" in the Middle East and jointly called for "broader de-escalation of hostilities" regionally. Speaking on the sidelines of the G7 summit, Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said that Israel is doing "the dirty work" for the Western world, according to Google-translated comments carried by German outlet ZDF.

Markets have been avidly watching developments in the conflict, which threatens to envelop the broader oil-rich Middle East region and has driven investors to safe-haven assets, such as gold.

Analysts are struggling to predict the extent to which Israel and Iran's escalating conflict could influence oil prices.

Israel's surprise attack on Iran's military and nuclear infrastructure on Friday has been followed by five days of spiraling warfare between the regional foes.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday called for an "unconditional surrender" from Tehran, warning Washington's patience was wearing thin. In response, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, threatened the U.S. with "irreparable damage" in the event of a military intervention, according to NBC News reporting.

Energy markets are weighing the likelihood of direct U.S. involvement in the conflict, as well as the potential for major supply disruptions — particularly worst-case scenarios, such as Iran blocking the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz that links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman.

John Evans, an analyst at oil broker PVM, said Wednesday that a "blanket of unease" had descended upon oil markets in recent days.

"Our market is settling into a world where missile exchanges are commonplace but the cynicism of it being normal has yet to set in because of how easily the situation could escalate," Evans said in a research note.

Israel's Bazan oil refinery complex sustained damage from an Iranian attack earlier this week, while an Israeli airstrike at the South Pars field, the world's largest gas field, prompted Tehran to partially suspend production. The South Pars gas field is shared between Iran and Qatar.

"The situation is as fluid as the underlying commodity it mostly affects and while there is a fraternal 'your guess is [as] good as mine' in future price divination, positioning will continue to be at least defensively long," PVM's Evans said.

The chief executives of oil companies TotalEnergies, Shell and EnQuest told CNBC on Tuesday that further attacks on critical energy infrastructure could have serious consequences for global supply and prices.

Oil prices, which have jumped in recent days, extended gains on Wednesday.

International benchmark Brent crude futures with August delivery traded 0.3% higher at $76.69 per barrel at 2:02 p.m. London time. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with July delivery, meanwhile, traded up 0.5% at $75.25 per barrel.

Per Lekander, founder of investment management firm Clean Energy Transition, described the situation for oil markets ahead of Israel's attack on Iran last week as "bad," given plentiful supply growth from OPEC and non-OPEC producers and soft demand.

"I was increasingly convinced we were heading for a 2014/2020 reset lower to $30-50 to get capex down and start a new cycle. In fact, the current conflict makes that outcome even more likely when [the] conflict is over as producers are now producing and hedging as much as they can," Lekander said in a note.

"While this is going on it is a roulette. We have a $10 [per barrel] risk premium in the price which is fair given that there clearly are some interruptions (mainly Iran exports and some lower tanker loadings)," he added.

Looking ahead, Stephen Schork, editor of The Schork Report, on Wednesday said that a significant escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict could push oil prices substantially higher.

"We're kind of stabilizing right now. I think we're waiting for that next headline to come out and really, I think that anyone who does not think oil could go higher, I really think they are trading on hope and not reality," Schork told CNBC's "Access Middle East."

"We are now facing the biggest threat to the oil markets since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and perhaps even greater than the 1974 Arab oil embargo," he added.

Schork said there was a roughly 5% chance of oil prices climbing to above $103 per barrel within the next five weeks, with much longer odds of crude soaring as high as $160 per barrel by the end of summer, if flows out of the Persian Gulf are seriously disrupted.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran is staring down the possibility of seeing its most important nuclear facilities hit by a 30,000-pound American bomb.

White House officials on Tuesday told NBC News that U.S. President Donald Trump is considering a range of options including striking Iran directly, after the American leader repeatedly asserted that his administration would not allow Iran to continue its nuclear program or reach bomb-making capability.

Trump called for Iran's "unconditional surrender" and wrote in a post on Truth Social that the U.S. has the ability to assassinate Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 

"He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now," Trump wrote shortly after declaring "total control" over Iranian airspace.

Khamenei on Wednesday responded, threatening the U.S. with "irreparable damage" if Washington follows through with a military strike. "The damage they suffer will be far worse than anything Iran may face. If they enter militarily, they will face harm that they cannot recover from," the Iranian leader said, according to NBC News reporting.

The rapidly escalating conflict, triggered by Israel's surprise attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities on June 13, has sent oil prices surging and put a region on edge. Initially encouraging of diplomatic talks with Tehran, Trump's statements have become increasingly threatening as populations across the Middle East brace for what comes next. 

But destroying Iran's nuclear program — which Tehran asserts is for civilian energy purposes only — is no easy feat.

Iran's most advanced and hardened nuclear facility, the Fordo plant in the country's northwest, is a fortress. 

Built inside a mountain some 300 feet underground and reinforced by layers of concrete, the plant — which is the most likely target of a potential American strike — is impenetrable by any bomb except the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). The U.S. is the only country in the world that has this "bunker buster" weapon, as well as the only country with the aircraft capable of transporting and deploying it: the B2 Spirit stealth bomber. 

This is in part why Israel has been so eager for U.S. involvement in its offensive operations against Iran in addition to its defensive ones.

But a strike in itself would not be a one-and-done job, military experts say.

"So you have two challenges. You would have to drop two of these penetrators at the exact same site" and likely need multiple bombing rounds, according to David Des Roches, a professor and senior military fellow at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C. 

"And then you would never be precisely sure how much of the facility you've damaged," he added, meaning personnel may need to be deployed on the ground. 

"This leads me to believe that for those facilities, Israel will ultimately gain control of the air and then land forces on the ground, force their way into the facility by detonating the doors, and then go and place explosive charges, exfiltrate whatever intelligence they can get, and just detonate it from the inside," Des Roches told CNBC.

Iran's military capabilities have been severely degraded over the past few days by Israeli attacks, which have taken out substantial parts of its air defenses, ballistic missile batteries, command-and-control nodes and dozens of top commanders.  

Still, such a strike by the U.S. could trigger Iran to respond by striking at U.S. assets in the region like embassies and military bases. Trump has made clear that any attack on U.S. personnel would draw a fierce American response, which would then pull the world's most powerful military more deeply into a regional conflict. 

"The Iranians have signaled that they are ready to attack U.S. bases in the region in the event of a U.S. attack on their domestic soil," said Gregory Brew, senior analyst on Iran and energy at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, noting that American bases in Iraq are particularly vulnerable. 

"There are risks in that environment that an Iranian retaliation causes U.S. casualties, kills U.S. servicemen, and potentially compels President Trump to expand the scope of U.S. action and order additional strikes on Iran and that, of course, would threaten general escalation and drag us into not just a single operation, but potentially a protracted air campaign." 

Despite its enormous scale, the GPU-57 bunker buster would not create wide-scale damage beyond the area of the facility, Des Roches said. But it would have a "profound psychological effect on the Iranians," he added, who have already seen significant damage and radioactive contamination risk wrought to the infrastructure of several of their nuclear sites in other parts of the country. 

A further critical question remains whether the Trump administration will limit itself to targeting nuclear sites, or whether it will expand operations beyond that — something Israel's government has also been urging, as it conveys its desire to see regime change for its longtime adversary.

"I think the conflict will end when Israel is confident that Iran has lost, for a significant period of time, the ability to make a nuclear weapon, and that its defenses are weakened enough that Israel will be able to go back and effectively disrupt any further effort by Iran to make a nuclear weapon," Des Roches argued.  

If Fordo remains operational, Israel's attacks would barely slow Iran's ability to build a bomb, nuclear analysts say. The decisions from the While House in the coming days will therefore prove decisive not only for the trajectory of Iran's nuclear program, but for the survivability of the Islamic Republic's regime as a whole.

Ali Vaez, Iran project director at nonprofit Crisis Group, believes that "Iran can survive and rebuild its nuclear program," even without a diplomatic avenue for a deal with the U.S. 

"The U.S. entering the war will close the door on diplomacy," Vaez told CNBC. "Trump might be able to destroy Fordow, but he won't be able to bomb away the knowledge that Iran has already acquired."

Bob McGrew, the former chief research officer at OpenAI, said professional software engineers are not going to lose their jobs to vibe coding just yet.

McGrew, who left OpenAI in November, said on the latest episode of Sequoia Capital's "Training Data" podcast that product managers can make "really cool prototypes" with vibe coding. But human engineers will still be brought in to "rewrite it from scratch."

"If you are given a code base that you don't understand — this is a classic software engineering question — is that a liability or is it an asset? Right? And the classic answer is that it's a liability," McGrew said of software made with vibe coding.

"You have to maintain this thing. You don't know how it works, no one knows how it works. That's terrible," he continued.

McGrew said that in the next one or two years, coding will be done by a mix of human engineers working with AI tools like Cursor and AI agents like Devin working in the background.

He added that while the liability that comes with using agents to code has gone down, it is "still, net, a liability."

Human engineers are needed to design and "understand the code base at a high level," McGrew said. This is so that when something goes wrong or if a project "becomes too complicated for AI to understand," a human engineer can help break the problem down into parts for an AI to solve.

McGrew did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The rise of AI has spurred fears of companies replacing their software engineers with AI. 

In October, Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, said on an earnings call that the search giant was using AI to write more than 25% of its new code.

Garry Tan, the president and CEO of Y Combinator, said in March that a quarter of the founders in the startup incubator's 2025 winter batch used AI to code their software.

"For 25% of the Winter 2025 batch, 95% of lines of code are LLM generated. That's not a typo," Tan wrote in an X post.

On Tuesday, Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon, said in a memo to employees that AI will "reduce our total corporate workforce" and provide "efficiency gains."

"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," Jassy said.

Would you be bothered if your coat was officially classified as a windbreaker or a raincoat, or your shoes as slippers? Businesses do care though, as classifications under a preferred category can help them pay lower tariff rates.

As U.S. President Donald Trump imposes duties on friends and foes alike, manufacturers are increasingly rethinking the classification of their products and resorting to "tariff engineering" to incur lower duties, several customs lawyers, supply chain and shipping experts told CNBC.

Tariff engineering — a practice that precedes Trump — involves changing an item's materials, altering its dimensions or compositions so that the finished products can be justified to fit in a different "harmonized system code," legal experts said.

Although most new tariffs added during Trump's second term are broad-based, the U.S. government has carved out exemptions for certain products, leaving doors open for companies to benefit through tariff engineering, trade lawyers pointed out.

After Trump unveiled sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs in April, several overseas manufacturers moved to bundle steel and aluminum elements into their final products to qualify a lower 25% duty under Section 232, said David Forgue, a partner at Chicago law firm Barnes, Richardson & Colburn.

Things, however, changed quickly in June as Trump jacked up tariffs on all steel, aluminum products and derivatives to 50%, except those from the U.K. "Now that the duties are reversed, we're now seeing companies remove those elements and ship them separately again," Forgue said.

There is "nothing inherently illegal or even untoward about leveraging strategic design choices that result in creating different products that are subject to different tariff classification and duty rates," said John Foote, a customs lawyer at Kelley Drye & Warren in Washington D.C. "Tariff engineering is one of the few things you can do to try to get it right and reduce your duty liability."

There are over 5,000 different product classification codes that U.S. customs authority uses while assessing tariffs. These tariff classifications were determined through decades of negotiations between governments and industry bodies, often varying by product category.

Winnebago Industries, an American manufacturer of motorhomes, or recreational vehicle, said in its quarterly earnings call in March that it planned to "work with outside experts to develop and implement effective [tariff] mitigation strategies, including tariff engineering and deferrals."

Aneel Salman, chair of economic security at Islamabad Policy Research Institute, described the act as "clever art of outsmarting customs," as importers and manufacturers tweak products "just enough" to qualify for lower duties.

"I was talking to somebody recently and they were showing me their lapel pin," said Kelley Drye & Warren's Foote. The pin, tacked onto the person's suit, featured a "festive design" with pieces of cubic zirconia at the back, Foote said.

The inclusion of cubic zirconia helped the company that manufactures those pins avert a 14% tariff, as the item no longer fell under festive article category but got classified as jewelry, Foote subsequently learnt.

"The value attributable to the cubic zirconia was significant enough [and] it was a relatively easy manufacturing change," Foote said.

The practice of tariff engineering can be traced back to 1882, when an importer coated sugar with molasses to avoid higher duties imposed on lighter-colored sugar. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court ruled the act perfectly legal: "so long as the goods are truly invoiced and freely and honestly exposed to the officers of customs for their examination, no fraud is committed."

Since then, companies, big and small, have continued to play chess with the U.S. tariff classification system, with several household names successfully implementing strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs.

For instance, Columbia Sportswear has never been shy about its use of tariff engineering. "I have a whole team of people that work together with designers and developers and merchandisers and with customs, and to ensure that during the design process that we're considering the impact of tariffs," Jeff Tooze, the company's vice president of global customs and trade, told Marketplace during Trump's first term.

Among its alterations, the company added small zippered pockets below the waist on women's shirts, allowing them to be exempted from higher duties under the U.S. customs rules.

Similarly, footwear maker Converse adds fuzzy-felt fabric to the soles of its signature All Stars sneakers, rather than the typical full-rubber one, to be categorized as slippers rather than athletic shoes, helping it cut tariff drastically.

Snuggies, the fluffy blanket with sleeves imported mainly from China, nearly halved its tariff costs by winning a lawsuit in 2017 classifying it as a blanket, not an item of clothing.

Fast-moving consumer good and garments, apparel and footwear sectors can find it relatively easy to implement tariff engineering, said Andrew Wilson, supply chain strategist at consultancy Supplino Inc.

For more sophisticated and "heavily-regulated" sectors such as automotive, aerospace, electronics and medical devices, "it's especially challenging ... because even minor changes may require extensive validation and approval," Wilson said.

"You might be looking at another 12 to 24 months of testing, certification and validation in order to get that done," Wilson added, as it requires extensive collaboration across departments including design, engineering and legal team.

Companies have to tread a fine between between redesigning their products and fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications.

A case in point illustrating the challenges with tariff engineering is Ford Motor. The automaker had for years imported its Transit Connect van as a passenger van, then removed the second row seats to sell them as cargo vans. In doing so, Ford circumvented a hefty 25% tariff and only paid a 2.5% import duty.

The U.S. Justice Department said in its ruling last year that Ford was "misclassifying cargo vans" and that the back-row seats "were never intended to be, and never were, used to carry passengers."

"The article must be a 'commercial reality' at importation. The risk is that customs [may] find the changes to be "fraud or artifice," [that case] the tariff engineering may be rejected,” said Forgue.

"In some cases changing certain things about a product doesn't change the essential character of what the good is," said Derek Scarbrough, founder of Global Logistical Connections. "If you add something to a shopping cart, it's still a shopping cart," he added.

U.S. Customs and Border Control has developed a so-called "binding ruling" system where companies can obtain official determinations on product classifications and HTS code before importing.

Adam Lees, an attorney at law firm Harris Sliwoski, who has helped clients prepare such ruling letter requests, described it as "a way for companies to get CBP's official blessing" before shipment. 

Some companies, however, may be deterred from seeking such official rulings, as a potential unfavorable ruling could be constraining. "You're stuck using whatever they said, and if they disagree, all of a sudden, you can't go under the radar anymore," Scarbrough said.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

"Do you need a U.S. warehouse?"

"Do you need a Mexico warehouse?" "Shipping to Europe?"

Salespeople, speaking in Mandarin Chinese, weren't shy about pushing their logistics services when I attended the 10th Shenzhen International Cross-Border E-Commerce Expo this week. One logistics company even hired foreign-looking models in glittery silver dresses to parade around the venue.

It's one of the biggest events of the year for companies selling from China to the U.S. and other countries via the internet. In the midst of a tepid truce in the U.S.-China tariff war, many companies appeared eager to enter the U.S. market.

But the game to survive has changed.

"The past 30 years have helped Chinese companies to become very mature in supply chain integration," Tina Hsu, partner at startup AIGC Empower, told me in Mandarin at the expo. "Today, if there is a tool that can help [businesses] tell a story better, resonate with users … they could go overseas with the identity of a brand to operate in a healthier manner that's longer term and with higher profits."

AIGC Empower claims it has those tools. At a joint launch with Amazon and Wayfair in Zhuhai, China, last month, Hsu said AIGC introduced two generative AI-powered products: a system for quickly researching local markets to understand consumer needs, and a tool for producing images for product advertisement. The service starts at 10,000 yuan ($1,390) per product per year — and has already received around 100 orders, Hsu said.

"To be honest, it's not every customer here who can appreciate the value" of our product and the need for branding, she said, noting it's Chinese entrepreneurs who studied abroad that understand it best. But she warned that without inherent differentiation, Chinese companies will find it hard to survive overseas in the next 30 years.

While a few companies with Chinese roots such as Temu and Shein have grabbed the most attention when it comes to cross-border e-commerce, several smaller Chinese businesses have also been tapping the internet to sell directly to overseas consumers, as competition at home has intensified.

"The U.S. consumer market is still the world's largest, and the destination for most cross-border e-commerce sellers," said Li Xiaoming, distribution manager at Miao Shou, which sells software that allows merchants to analyze data from multiple e-commerce platforms in one place. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.

Although companies have turned to other countries, they're still holding onto some resources for deploying into the U.S. market — if conditions improve in the next few months, he said.

Regardless, Chinese sellers are piling into the cross-border e-commerce trend.

Miao Shou claimed that it had a total of 800,000 customers as of June, with around 200,000 companies joining the platform in the past six months. Li said the company aims to double clients' sales transaction volume on its platform this year.

To stand out in such a competitive environment, these companies need better branding and marketing, especially in the current trade climate.

"We believe tariffs this time mark a process of complete market reshuffling," pushing out companies that previously only relied on price, not product quality, to compete, Bear Huo, China general manager at fintech startup FundPark, said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.

With $750 million in financing from Goldman Sachs and HSBC, FundPark lends money to smaller Chinese businesses selling their wares overseas. Huo, who used to work at Alibaba, said that the startup has become an official loan provider for certain Chinese sellers on Walmart, and aims to reach a similar partnership with sellers on Amazon later this year.

Huo said FundPark is lending more to businesses for advertising as clients have ramped up their marketing spend to up to 20% of the product transaction value — a jump from 3% to 5% in 2023.

While ad spending can lead to short-term spurts in sales, building a brand is a longer-term process, and a far more challenging task. Even advertising legend John Hegarty has described the difficulties of getting companies to make bold, transformational moves in order to stand out in the market. But if Chinese exporters are to compete globally, they need to focus on the hard task of building a brand.

It's similar to what's playing out in China's cut-throat electric-car industry. Companies have been slashing prices and offering more high-tech features, but to stand out over the longer-term, they need to create brands that resonate with consumers.

Some Chinese companies believe they already have what it takes to build a brand, but lack the legal resources to protect themselves — especially as market incumbents launch targeted lawsuits that can force a Chinese seller to go out of business.

It's become such a pressing challenge that a group of Chinese merchants have backed a new platform that uses a low-cost insurance structure for litigation services that can otherwise be quite expensive, according to Jack Zhang, secretary-general at the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association's legal insurance division. He's leading the project with a team of about 30 people.

His plan is to group lawsuits into the thousands or tens of thousands, thereby negotiating a lower rate with law firms in the U.S. or another market. It's far from an operating service, and Zhang hopes he can reach the 1,000-case threshold around this time next year.

Several companies at the expo also advertised services from compliance to business registration — getting a U.S. trademark will cost the equivalent of $485, now available at a $150 discount, one flyer said. But as many of the vendors appeared to mimic each other's style, only attempting to undercut others on price, it's clear the concept of a brand has yet to take off.

Xiaopeng He, founder of Xpeng, talks about pressures and competition in the Chinese EV market: over-capacity, price wars, and technological innovations. He says the Turing chip is a necessary invention to help Xpeng transition to a large tech company.

Hong Hao, managing partner, at Lotus Asset Management, talks about where he's seeing opportunities in the China markets: biotech, bubble tea, and Pop Mart.

Nicholas Burns, former ambassador to China, joins "Closing Bell Overtime" to talk the role China could play in the Iranian-Israel conflict.

China's retail sales sharply beat expectations in May. Sales recorded their largest jump since December 2023, boosted by government subsidies and surging online shopping as a major e-commerce sales event started early. Industrial output and fixed-asset investment both saw growth soften from the prior month and missed expectations.

U.S.-China renewed trade truce left military-grade rare-earth issue unresolved. That's according to a Reuters report, citing two people briefed on the London bilateral meeting. Beijing has yet to loosen its grip on exports of some specialized rare-earth magnets, while U.S. maintains curbs on exporting cutting-edge AI chips to China.

China resumed Boeing's jet deliveries. Boeing delivered a new 787-9 aircraft to China's Juneyao Airlines on Saturday, months after Beijing had suspended the U.S. aerospace giant's deliveries amid tit-for-tat retaliation against Washington. That delivery comes after China agreed on dialing back some punitive measures against the U.S. with more trade negotiations underway.

Hopes of a quick ceasefire between Israel and Iran were dashed by several social media posts from U.S. President Donald Trump. As he took an early departure from the Group of Seven summit, Trump said it "certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire" and that he was involved in something "much bigger than that."

What's bigger than a ceasefire? An escalation in conflict on the prospect of the U.S. joining the hostilities in the Middle East. Trump, on his social media platform Truth Social, threatened Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that he is an "easy target" and wants him to "surrender."

Trump's posts on Truth Social brought U.S. stocks lower and caused oil prices, which were on the retreat Monday, to shoot up more than 4% during Tuesday's trading session in America. A weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales report in May also added to the heavy sentiment in markets.

The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting will conclude Wednesday. While central bankers are expected to leave interest rates unchanged, the committee will release updated projections of where they see rates going. Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions from the media at this press conference. All of those are market-moving events — so it's a relief, at least, they come from official communiques.

Trump weighs strike on IranA U.S. military strike against Iran is one of the options Trump is considering, after meeting with his top national security advisors on Tuesday afternoon, current and former administration officials told NBC News. Earlier in the day, Trump wrote on Truth Social that the U.S. knows "exactly" where the Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is "hiding," and demanded "UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!"

U.S. markets fell while Asia trades mixedU.S. stocks retreated Tuesday as Trump's rhetoric on Iran ramped up. The S&P 500 fell 0.84%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.91%. Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Wednesday. At 1:30 p.m. Singapore time, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.77% even as the government reported a drop in exports in May, while South Korea's Kospi added 0.56%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, however, lost 1.23%.

Exports from Japan fall in MayJapan exports in May declined 1.7% year over year, according to data from Japan's trade ministry released Wednesday. While that drop fares better than the 3.8% decline expected from a Reuters poll of economists, it's still the steepest fall since September 2024 and reverses the 2% growth in April. Exports to the U.S. dropped 11.1% from a year earlier, much worse than than the 1.8% fall in April.

Meta trying to poach OpenAI staff: AltmanOn a podcast released Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Meta had sought to hire "a lot of people" from the artificial intelligence company, and had offered signing bonuses as high as $100 million — but "so far none of our best people have decided to take them up on that." Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is frustrated with his firm's standing in the AI space, sources told CNBC.

U.S. passes landmark crypto billThe U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark crypto bill that establishes federal guardrails, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. It also opens the door to a range of issuers, including banks, fintechs, and major retailers looking to launch their own stablecoins or integrate them into existing payment systems.

[PRO] Global stocks will reign: InvestorsThe era of U.S. exceptionalism might be coming to an end. Not only have global stocks vastly outperformed those in America year to date, investors also think they will be the best-performing asset class over the next five years, according to the results of Bank of America's latest fund manager survey.

The Fed is likely to keep rates the same but give a forecast that moves markets. What to expect

While any immediate movement on interest rates seems improbable, the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes Wednesday, will feature important signals that still could move markets.

Among the biggest things to watch will be whether Federal Open Market Committee members stick with their previous forecast of two rate cuts this year, how they see inflation trending, and any reaction from Chair Jerome Powell to what has become a concerted White House campaign for easier monetary policy.

As things stand heading into the meeting, markets are pricing in the next cut to come in September, which would be the one-year anniversary of a surprisingly aggressive half-percentage-point reduction the FOMC instituted amid concerns over the labor market. The committee added two more quarter-point moves by the end of the year and has been on hold since.

Meta Platforms tried to poach OpenAI employees by offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million, with even larger annual compensation packages, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said.

While Meta had sought to hire "a lot of people" from OpenAI, "so far none of our best people have decided to take them up on that," Altman said, speaking on the "Uncapped" podcast, which is hosted by his brother.

"I've heard that Meta thinks of us as their biggest competitor," he said. "Their current AI efforts have not worked as well as they have hoped and I respect being aggressive and continuing to try new things."

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

The Meta CEO is personally trying to assemble a top artificial intelligence team for its "superintelligence" AI lab and has invested heavily in AI through its Meta AI research division, which also oversees its Llama series of open-source large language models.

The moves come after Meta had once again delayed the release of its latest flagship AI model due to concerns about its capabilities, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

Meanwhile, sources have previously told CNBC that Zuckerberg has become so frustrated with Meta's standing in AI that he's willing to invest billions in top talent. 

Last week Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, announced he was leaving for Meta as part of a deal that saw the Facebook parent dish out $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the AI startup. Wang added that a small number of Scale AI employees would also join Meta as part of the agreement. 

The Times had previously reported that Wang would head a research lab pursuing "superintelligence," an AI system that surpasses human intelligence.

The company has also recently poached other top talent, including Jack Rae, a principal researcher at Google's AI research laboratory DeepMind, according to a report from Bloomberg. The report added that Zuckerberg had been directly involved with the recruitment efforts. 

Speaking on the podcast, which was released on Tuesday, Altman said that Meta's strategy of offering a large, upfront, guaranteed compensation would detract from the actual work and not set up a winning culture.

"I think that there's a lot of people, and Meta will be a new one, that are saying 'we're just going to try to copy OpenAI,'" he added. "That basically never works. You're always going to where your competitor was, and you don't build up a culture of learning what it's like to innovate."

However, spending big on startups and their talent is nothing new to the AI space. Former Apple chief design officer Jony Ive joined OpenAI after the company acquired Ive's AI devices startup io through a $6.4 billion all-equity deal last month.

Some tech analysts have also pushed back against the notion that Meta has been missing the mark on AI.

"They basically built the rails for open source AI development, and so much of what is happening in AI is being built on Meta," Daniel Newman, CEO at Futurum Group, told CNBC's "Power Lunch" last week. 

Open-source generally refers to software in which the source code is made freely available on the web for possible modification and redistribution. Llama's open-source characteristics have allowed many third-party applications to be built on top of it.  

Newman added that Meta's massive investments, such as in ScaleAI, will continue to push it forward in training its behemoth models.

The once-hypothetical cuts are coming, whether employees are ready or not.

On Tuesday, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, confirmed the fears of many workers in the age of artificial intelligence: He said he expects the technology will lead to job cuts at the tech giant.

In his memo, which was posted online, Jassy did not announce immediate layoffs. He said that, in the next few years, "efficiency gains" from AI would translate to a smaller corporate workforce.

Marlo Lyons, a certified executive coach, told Business Insider that jobs will inevitably change — including outright disappearances. "So is your job at risk? Absolutely. If you don't get on board with AI, yes, absolutely, you're going to lose your job."

Amazon is now one of the largest companies to explicitly state that AI will impact its employees' jobs.

BI previously reported that roles that include tasks that AI can perform are disappearing from job boards faster than positions that have fewer tasks that AI can accomplish.

Shopify's CEO said in April that, before hiring anyone new, employees must prove AI can't do the job better. Duolingo plans to phase out contractors and replace them with AI. And Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, has said that the company might not hire engineers in 2025 because those already on the payroll are getting so much more done thanks to AI tools.

The industry you're in matters. Office workers appear to be particularly at risk. In late May, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, suggested AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said earlier this month that he expects the impact of AI on white-collar jobs to be so significant that it will lead to a recession.

Christian Schneider, the CEO of New York-based startup fileAI, told BI that he's already seeing job losses in corners of the tech industry, and he expects AI to exacerbate the trend.

"I'm totally expecting a tightening," he said. "I think when we look into tech layoffs, it's so apparent that something is changing."

Melissa Swift, the founder and CEO of work consultancy Anthrome Insight, told BI that productivity hasn't always increased to the same degree as tech advances. It often "ticks up slowly, like a kiddie roller coaster going up the first big hill."

Those who aren't keeping up risk being left behind. And refusing to acknowledge the risk doesn't make it go away, Lyons said.

"So if you're redesigning the workplace, and how things are getting done — whether it's a workflow or structures of teams, or the same thing with AI — you can hold on with white knuckles, but it's still going to happen around you," Lyons said.

Of course, not all the jobs affected by advancements in AI will mean the workers filling them will be laid off. Jassy acknowledged in his statement that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs."

Schneider said some jobs will change so that typical back-office, rote tasks will fall to AI and allow more workers to take on people-facing roles. Or, officegoers once responsible for pulling and preparing data might now move to the end of the process to, for example, check the quality of the results AI produces.

While some jobs will disappear and others will evolve, Schneider said, workers are often good at adapting.

"Honestly, I wouldn't want to underestimate people's drive," he said.

Chinese jewelers are snapping up platinum as they seek to bounce back from a slump in gold jewelry sales, an industry group said.

Surging gold prices, which hit a record high above $3,500 an ounce in April, have deterred even buyers from China, who have a cultural attachment to the yellow metal.

In the first quarter of the year, gold jewelry sales in China tanked nearly 27% from a year ago to 134.5 tons, according to the China Gold Association.

Meanwhile, gold bar and coin consumption surged nearly 30%, showing that investor demand for haven assets remains strong.

"Jewelry fabricators and distributors are trying to save themselves because gold jewelry sales are falling off a cliff. They need to find a new metal for jewelry so that they can survive," Weibin Deng, the regional head for Asia Pacific at the World Platinum Investment Council, told Business Insider.

China imported 11.5 metric tons of platinum in April, its highest monthly intake in a year.

That demand has helped push global platinum prices up around 40% year-to-date, with spot prices near $1,265 per ounce. Spot gold prices have also surged, up roughly 30% over the same period.

The price of platinum is still about one-third of gold, making the white precious metal a compelling proposition for Chinese consumers. In China, jewelry is generally priced by weight rather than on a per-piece basis, said Deng.

"It cannot be too expensive, otherwise people wouldn't buy it," he said of the price-sensitive Chinese market.

Goldman Sachs analysts wrote on Tuesday that platinum's blistering rally lacks fundamental support. They said the metal's issues include price-sensitive Chinese demand, slowing auto demand, and the expectation that there will be no significant decline in supply.

The analysts attributed strong gains in the platinum market to speculative demand and high gold prices, which are keeping investors away from trading in the yellow metal.

"This hesitancy likely stems from investors believing they missed the initial rally," wrote the Goldman analysts, referring to the blistering gold rally earlier.

"Instead, interest has shifted to other precious metals as investors seek catch-up opportunities," they wrote.

The WPIC is stepping up marketing and public education to position platinum as a precious metal that has investment value and room to run, Deng said.

Deng said the council is also working with Chinese jewelers to be more efficient in terms of fabrication and market operations to lower prices for consumers

Deng said it's more expensive to work on platinum than gold as it requires more energy to melt the white metal. But reducing production costs is key to making platinum jewelry more accessible to consumers, he added.

Another challenge: The gold market is far more liquid. It's easier for consumers to sell or trade in gold jewelry with a small discount.

WPIC is partnering with jewelers in China to develop similar resale channels for platinum pieces.

Platinum isn't just for jewelry. It's used in everything from car parts to electronics. That broad demand helps support its value.

But according to Deng, it's platinum's visibility in jewelry that plays a crucial role in how consumers perceive it as a precious metal.

"Gold and silver have long been seen as currencies and stores of value around the world. To make the platinum jewelry market sustainable, consumers need to view platinum the same way — as a store of value," he said.

Deng acknowledged that gold is likely to remain the ultimate store of value in the eyes of the consumer, but even a small demand switch from gold to platinum would be significant.

The BofA analysts wrote last week that even a 1% switch in gold to platinum jewelry could help double the white metal's supply deficit to 1.6 million ounces, which would help support prices.

 The “ancient” Bitcoin cohort is growing faster than the amount of new coins mined, and with institutional flows accelerating, the path to $1 million BTC is starting to take shape. 

Key takeaways:

The number of Bitcoin held for over 10 years is increasing faster than new coins are mined—550 BTC/day versus 450 issued BTC/day.

17% of BTC is already considered illiquid, and projections suggest up to 30% by 2026.

Fidelity Digital Assets released a report highlighting a pivotal shift in Bitcoin's supply dynamics after the 2024 halving. The report noted that the “ancient” Bitcoin supply, coins held for 10 years or more, has started to outpace new issuance, with 550 BTC entering the ancient supply category daily compared to 450 BTC issued. 

This trend, coupled with steady purchasing from institutional investors, raises a compelling question: Could this increasing demand send Bitcoin's price to $1 million?

The current Bitcoin ancient supply is over 17% of the total issuance (3.4 million BTC valued at $360 billion at $107,000/BTC). This reflects strong holder conviction, with daily decreases occurring less than 3% of the time. The report projects this share could reach 20% by 2028 and 25% by 2034, tightening available supply.

At the same time, institutional investor capital is accelerating. According to Bitwise, Bitcoin inflows are expected to reach $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026 in its base case scenario. 

Diverse participants drive this: nation-states potentially reallocating 5% of gold reserves ($161.7 billion, or 7.7% of supply), US states adopting at 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth management platforms allocating 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubling holdings ($117.8 billion). In a bull case, inflows could exceed $426 billion, absorbing over 4 million Bitcoin (19% of supply), further tightening liquidity. 

This institutional accumulation, alongside ancient supply growth, suggests a scenario where a significant portion of Bitcoin's supply becomes illiquid, potentially amplifying analysts' price targets due to increasing demand.

Reaching $1 million per Bitcoin requires a market capitalization of $21 trillion, a tenfold increase from the current $2.10 trillion with 19,880,604 BTC mined, or 94.66% of the 21 million total. The fixed supply and growing illiquidity could facilitate BTC's next significant milestone. 

Historical trends after the halving events (2013, 2017, 2021) exhibit rallies driven by reduced supply growth and rising demand, supporting the thesis that current dynamics could lead to a similar outcome.

The impact of the ancient supply is evident, with 17% of the supply illiquid and projected to grow, the liquid supply diminishes. If institutional investors continue accumulating, 30% of the supply could become illiquid by 2026 (6.3 million BTC).

However, certain challenges still exist. After the 2024 US election, ancient supply has declined on 10% of days—nearly four times the historical average—indicating even long-term holders can sell during volatility. Similarly, five-year holder supply decreased 39% of days post-election, three times the typical rate, correlating with sideways price action in Q1 2025. 

This suggests that while illiquidity trends are strong, market conditions can trigger supply increases, potentially moderating price appreciation.

However, Bitwise noted $35 billion in sidelined demand in 2024 due to risk-averse policies at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. Its bear case projects over $150 billion in inflows, while the bull case exceeds $426 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC, underscoring significant demand potential.

Thus, Bitcoin's ancient supply and projected institutional inflows form a narrative of increasing scarcity. While reaching $1 million is a mighty target, the current trajectories suggest it is a realistic price target.

				PM Petr Fiala defeats an opposition motion to topple his administration months before scheduled elections.			

AI generated Text-to-speech

The Czech government on Wednesday survived a no-confidence vote triggered by a bitcoin scandal involving a drug dealer that has thrown the country's politics into turmoil.

Some 98 out of 192 MPs present voted against an opposition motion to topple Prime Minister Petr Fiala's government — which could have triggered a snap ballot just four months before the country is scheduled to vote in regular elections. By contrast, 94 MPs voted to bring down the government.

The no-confidence motion followed a scandal that saw Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blažek from Fiala's conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS) resign last month after accepting a €40 million bitcoin donation to the ministry from a convicted drug dealer.The cryptocurrency was provided by Tomáš Jiřikovský, who according to the courts ran an illegal darknet market that had drugs for sale, and who had served time in prison for embezzlement, drug trafficking and illegal possession of weapons. Czech newspaper Deník N broke the news last week that police are investigating the donation.Blažek, whose embroilment in multiple scandals from pressuring judges to meeting a pro-Russian lobbyist earned him the moniker Don Pablo — a play on deceased Colombian drugs baron Pablo Escobar — claims everything he did was “ultra-legal” and that Jiřikovský had donated money as “a form of penance.”The bitcoin affair is likely to further boost the election prospects of the current populist frontrunner Andrej Babiš, leader of the opposition ANO party, who previously governed Czechia from 2017 to 2021. Recent polling shows ANO leading with 31.2 percent support while the governing Spolu (Together) coalition — of which ODS is a part — trails with 21.6 percent.Babiš has called the ODS “a criminal organization” and termed Fiala “the head of the mafia.”Eva Decroix, who has taken over as the new Czech justice minister, said her task will be to restore public trust in the ministry and to ensure the bitcoin scandal is thoroughly investigated.For the government to be overthrown, at least 101 MPs in the 200-seat lower house of parliament would be required to support the motion. The government has a fragile majority of 104 MPs.

Fiala's government has survived four votes of no confidence since it took power in 2021.

“It was so ultra-legal that it couldn't be more legal,” claims ousted justice minister.

 China has been looking to challenge the US dollar's reserve status and wants to expand the digital yuan's reach to include domestic and international payments. 

China's central bank chief Pan Gongsheng has pledged to expand the footprint of the digital yuan, reaffirming the country's vision for its central bank digital currency (CBDC).

According to a Reuters report, China is creating an international operations center in Shanghai for the digital yuan, also known as e-CNY. Pan made the remarks at the Lujiazui Forum, a professional forum for high-profile local and international finance regulators and executives.

China envisions a “multipolar” currency system where multiple currencies support the global economy, Pan said. This vision contrasts with the current system, where a few currencies, like the US dollar and the euro, play large roles in the global financial system.

The US dollar, in particular, may have become less appealing to investors in 2025, partly due to the unscripted rollout of tariffs by US President Donald Trump over the past months.

Pan also weighed in on digital technologies, claiming that traditional cross-border payment systems are vulnerable to geopolitical risk.

“Traditional cross-border payment infrastructures can be easily politicized and weaponized, and used as a tool for unilateral sanctions, damaging global economic and financial order," he said.

Stablecoins, often pegged to the US dollar, have become well-known for their ability to facilitate cross-border transactions. These digital assets are considered one of crypto's first breakthrough mainstream use cases and present a contrast to CBDCs, which are controlled by a centralized entity, such as central banks.

Despite the rising adoption of stablecoins, many countries continue to pursue CBDCs. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, is advancing its stablecoin pilot program. In Europe, lawmakers across member states continue to push for a digital euro, while the United Arab Emirates expects to roll out the digital dirham by the end of 2025. Israel has also released a preliminary design for a digital shekel.

According to a Feb. 11 report from the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), CBDC interest is cooling among central banks, with 31% delaying implementation plans. Among the central banks, common concerns include regulation and economic conditions.

China began exploring the creation of a CBDC in 2014 and has plans to expand the digital yuan as a payment tool both internationally and domestically. The country has hoped to combat the US dollar's role as the world's reserve currency. The two countries had been mired in a trade war since Trump rolled out the tariffs.

 The move will lower collateral requirements to access leverage for crypto trading due to the relatively stable value of US government debt. 

Crypto derivatives exchange Deribit and spot exchange Crypto.com are accepting BlackRock's tokenized US Treasury fund as trading collateral for institutional and experienced clients.

The move will allow institutional traders to use a low-volatility, yield-bearing digital instrument as collateral for their accounts, lowering the margin requirements for leveraged trading, according to Forbes.

Coinbase, one of the world's biggest exchanges by trading volume, announced a $2.9 billion deal to acquire Deribit in May 2025.

The deal can expand the utility of BlackRock's Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL).  The fund holds nearly 40% of the tokenized Treasurys market share, or roughly $2.9 billion in value locked, according to data from RWA.XYZ.

Tokenized US Treasury products are slowly emerging as an alternative to traditional stablecoins, thanks to their yield-bearing properties. The growth of these products reflects the broader merger of cryptocurrencies with the legacy financial system.

BlackRock tipped plans to integrate BUIDL as a collateral asset across crypto derivatives platforms and centralized crypto exchanges, including OKX and Binance, in October 2024.

In January 2025, the community governing Frax Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, voted to add support for BUIDL as backing collateral for the Frax-USD stablecoin (frxUSD).

Proponents of the integration characterized BUIDL as beneficial, providing deeper liquidity, transfer options and lower counterparty risk from using a collateral asset created and backed by the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, with around $11.5 trillion in assets under management.

Despite the positive outlook from the Frax Finance community and other digital asset platforms, centralization concerns and the possibility of structural financial risk persist among industry executives and market participants.

Six firms including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Ondo Finance, Superstate, Centrifuge and Circle account for over 88% of the tokenized US treasury market.

Most of the US Treasurys currently onchain were tokenized on the Ethereum network, which continues to be the leading blockchain for real-world tokenized assets. Ethereum holds $5.7 billion of the total $7.3 billion in tokenized government securities.

Circle CEO, Chairman and co-founder Jeremy Allaire details IPO excitement, high-utility stablecoin, the GENIUS Act's 'excellent' points and the state of America's macroeconomy in a wide-ranging interview.

A revolution in the cryptocurrency world may soon go mainstream, as lawmakers move to formally regulate stablecoins, a digital currency designed to maintain a fixed value. 

"The internet is now colliding with the financial industry and the financial system," said Circle CEO and co-founder Jeremy Allaire on "Mornings with Maria" Wednesday. "There's an opportunity to build very significant scaled platforms and utilities in the same way that we've seen those built in other industries on the internet."

Circle is a New York-based company specializing in stablecoins. Going public in early June, Circle's share prices saw an eye-popping surge on opening day, signaling a strong appetite for digital currency backed by real world assets. 

Stablecoin values are pegged to currencies like the U.S. dollar, unlike its more price-volatile competitor Bitcoin. This makes them more predictable for everyday use, and more attractive for many consumers and lawmakers. In Allaire's terms, stablecoin is "over-the-top internet money."

Earlier this week, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, the first federal legislation focused on stablecoin regulation. It received bipartisan support and backing from President Donald Trump, who has embraced cryptocurrencies during his second term. The legislation could lay the groundwork for integrating stablecoins into the broader financial system.

"It's an excellent piece of legislation," said Allaire of the bill. "It's wonderful to see our political leaders, our economic leaders kind of embracing this and working towards it. I think [the] GENIUS Act is, I believe, going to get picked up and get brought to the president's desk in the near future."

Supporters say stablecoins could help cement the U.S. dollar's dominance on the global stage by turning it into a frictionless, exportable digital currency.

"This is great for the dollar," said Allaire. "It turns digital dollars into an export product of the United States, and it proliferates the digital dollars across the internet. And so, if we're in a digital currency space race with China, or with other countries, or BRICS, or what have you, this is a huge way to win."

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed that optimism in a post on X, writing in part: "Recent reporting projects that stablecoins could grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of the decade."

At its core, Allaire argues, stablecoins offer a safer, smarter approach to digital finance.

"It is a very powerful force," he said. "You're not holding a bank's credit risk. You're holding the U.S. government's short-term Treasuries. And so, it's a powerful model that I think just intuitively people understand. It's a safer, higher-utility form of money."

Vietnam has always been a leader in using crypto. But even though many people use it, the country's crypto market has been in a confusing state because the rules weren't clear. This left investors and businesses unsure about what they could and couldn't do. That's finally changing. On June 14, 2024, Vietnam passed a new law called the Law on Digital Technology Industry. This is a big step forward to make crypto legal and set clear rules. The law will start on January 1, 2026. It aims to make the rules clear, protect users, and help Vietnam move towards a more digital and transparent economy, just like the rest of the world.

Vietnam has just made a big decision with its new Law on Digital Technology Industry. This new policy sets the rules for how the country will deal with crypto and digital technology in the future. Here's what it means: First, the law officially recognizes cryptocurrencies as digital assets and divides them into two groups, virtual assets and crypto assets. It does not cover things like stocks, digital versions of traditional money, or other typical financial tools. This makes it very clear what is included. This new clarity is great news for crypto businesses and investors who were unsure about the rules before.

The law also puts the government in charge of defining business rules, licensing conditions, and oversight for these digital assets. Importantly, it comes with strict cybersecurity and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements bringing Vietnam in line with global standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Vietnam has been on FATF's “gray list” since 2023, and this law is a big step toward fixing that by tightening up rules to stop money laundering and terrorist financing.

But this new law isn't only about crypto. It also offers big benefits to the entire digital tech industry. These benefits include tax breaks, incentives for land use, support for research and development, and even training programs to develop local skills. The aim is to make Vietnam a leader in new technologies like AI, semiconductors, and blockchain. This law isn't just a set of rules, it's Vietnam's way of declaring itself a leader in the global digital economy.


Key Features of Vietnam's Crypto Policy
To better understand the law's impact, here's a breakdown of its key components:






Aspect

This table illustrates how Vietnam's crypto policy balances regulation with innovation, creating a structured yet attractive environment for digital assets.
Vietnam Crypto Policy Sparks Optimism
The crypto community is very excited about Vietnam crypto policy, seeing it as a big step forward. The recently passed law officially recognizes digital and crypto assets, provides financial support and tax breaks for blockchain startups, and strengthens measures against money laundering. These actions are expected to attract serious developers and investors to Vietnam's crypto scene, even though the law will take effect in 2026.
This move places Vietnam as a leader in clear regulations within the region, setting an example that other Southeast Asian countries might follow. The law clearly separates virtual assets from crypto assets, follows international guidelines to get off the financial grey list, and sets up direct government oversight on creating, storing, and transferring cryptocurrencies, all while enforcing rules against money laundering. With this proactive approach and Vietnam is set to become more prominent in the digital finance world.
Hope and Caution on Vietnam's New Crypto Policy
Analysts believe this new move could lead to more people using digital assets. However, not everyone is convinced. While some experts are positive about Vietnam's progress in crypto, others advise caution, especially considering past events like the $400 million Matrix Chain scam. This shows the need for strong rules and educating investors as the country moves forward with its new crypto laws. Overall, the outlook is positive, but how the market will react after 2026 is still uncertain.
Vietnam's new crypto policy, part of the Law on Digital Technology Industry, is an important step toward the future of finance. By making cryptocurrencies legal, setting clear rules, and offering benefits to promote innovation, Vietnam is preparing for a surge in digital assets. Some say that “more countries will follow, and the shift is already happening,” suggesting this could inspire global changes. Everyone will be watching as Vietnam's crypto journey develops, with the potential to change digital finance in Southeast Asia and beyond.

Crypto World News

June 19, 2025 by Arslan Tabish 

Analytical platform CryptoQuant has highlighted that Binance has become the most popular exchange for receiving altcoins and stablecoins. The most number of transactions are always done on the platform, particularly during times of significant market rallies. 

This analysis reveals that, on average, there is a sharp increase in transactions involving the inflow of altcoins to exchanges following significant market rallies. These spikes typically indicate that traders are attempting to realize profits. This action typically correlates with short-term price spikes and a high volume of transactions. Binance is the primary beneficiary of such inflows, which account for the majority of transaction volume.

In the November-December 2024 rally, the role of exchange as a market leader was also seen even stronger. This exchange reached the highest daily inflows of 59,000 altcoin transactions. Comparatively, Coinbase covered 26,000 and the rest of the exchanges 24,000. This data reiterates the fact that exchange is the leader in altcoin trading.

The most significant counter is the increase in the number of addresses unique to altcoin outflows to exchanges during periods of healthy rallies. Binance retains the top spot, with a maximum of 42,000 altcoin addresses sending altcoins to its exchange. Coinbase came in second with 21,000, and the rest of the exchanges got 18,000. Based on this trend, Binance is the go-to altcoin exchange during times when there is high activity in the market.

Binance continues to lead inflow transactions even in these under the radar times. The data indicate that platform processes approximately 13,000 altcoin inflow transactions. Coinbase does between 6,000 and other platforms do about 10,000. This constant movement reflects a well-developed infrastructure and a wide liquidity at platform.

The market leadership of exchange can also be seen in stablecoin inflows. Binance has obtained nearly 53,000 stablecoin transactions on the Ethereum network. Coinbase ranks second with 42,000, Bybit ranks third, with 28,000, and OKX with 11,000. All the other exchanges have a share of 53,000 additional transactions. These figures indicate the place where the traders are depositing their money in anticipation to make a move in future.

The exchange commands even a bigger share on the TRON network. It had 384,000 transactions of the USDT inflow in the last week alone. Bybit was next with 321,000 and HTX with 163,000. This pattern suggests a significant role for Binance in the trading domain, particularly with stablecoins such as TRON-based USDT.

Similarly, the overall dominance of exchange in maintaining continuous leadership in altcoin and stablecoin inflows reflects the high level of users and its developed infrastructure. The exchange is still the main entrance to Capital, becoming part of the crypto market as traders keep on coming to it as a source of liquidity and to trade.

The Governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, announced the establishment in Shanghai of an international operations center for the digital RMB, its central bank digital currency (CBDC). He also discussed the expansion of international trade finance, with industry pundits suggesting this aims to improve financing for Chinese goods that are finished in other countries to sidestep sanctions.

A speech published by the central bank did not cover these operational details, but instead urged changes in global currencies and cross border payments. 

The governor strongly criticized the US, although semi-indirectly. He said that international dominant currencies are like public goods. When the country that controls the currency starts using the currency for its own self interest it undermines that public good feature. He warned that accumulated domestic fiscal and structural issues in that country could spill over into an international financial crisis. Additionally, the Governor complained about the weaponization of currency for geopolitical purposes.

Hence, he called for greater diversification in currency usage worldwide. That's certainly not the first time a Chinese central bank governor has pushed for that. It's also not new for a governor to suggest a greater take up of the IMF's special drawing rights (SDR) in international trade. Beyond currency, he also addressed payment systems.

The topic of blockchain and DLT in cross border payments was discussed in the context of both central bank digital currencies and stablecoins. He only alluded to mBridge, the international cross border CBDC originally developed by five Asian and Middle Eastern central banks with help from the BIS. The BIS withdrew from the project saying it had graduated, around the time of talk of sanctioned countries such as Russia or Iran participating.

The central banker said these technologies have greatly shortened the payment chain, but also pointed to the supervision risks of stablecoins. For now, with Hong Kong passing stablecoin legislation, it seems that island is being used as a learning and observation ground for mainland China.

“Technologies such as smart contracts and decentralized finance will also continue to promote the evolution and development of the cross border payment system,” he said.

The largest tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), can now be used as collateral on two of the most active crypto trading platforms, Crypto.com and Deribit, issuer Securitize said in a Wednesday press release.

The listings allow institutional traders to post BUIDL tokens as margin for leveraged trades on those two exchanges, while also earning yield on the underlying token.

The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets, growing about 400% in the past year to over $7 billion in market capitalization, rwa.xyz data show. These tokens let investors earn a yield on their idle cash, just like a money market fund, but without leaving the blockchain environment. They are also increasingly being used as collateral for trading.

With $2.9 billion in assets, BUIDL is the largest of the tokenized Treasury funds and is backed by a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries.

"Tokenized Treasuries are being actively used to improve capital efficiency and risk management across some of the industry's most sophisticated trading venues, while still offering yield," Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said in the statement. "The [BUIDL] fund is evolving from a yield-bearing token into a core component of crypto market infrastructure."

In today's dynamic digital asset market, investors are constantly searching for the best crypto presale to buy right now.

Among countless crypto presale projects, Nexchain has captured serious attention with its advanced AI-powered architecture and growing investment base. This pre-sale cryptocurrency opportunity is quickly establishing itself as one of the top crypto presales due to its strong fundamentals and real-world applicability.

As token pre-sales continue to attract interest, Nexchain stands apart on the crypto presale list with its innovative Layer 1 blockchain solution.

The crypto ICO presale market is often flooded with hype-driven projects, but Nexchain delivers both cutting-edge technology and market-ready utility. For anyone looking to buy presale crypto tokens with long-term value, Nexchain offers an excellent opportunity.

Alongside it, projects like Solaxy also add depth to the growing landscape of new crypto token presales.

Nexchain is redefining what crypto presale projects can achieve by integrating artificial intelligence directly into its Layer 1 blockchain infrastructure. This unique approach allows Nexchain to optimize scalability, security, and interoperability across multiple industries.

Unlike many crypto coins on presale, Nexchain delivers technology that supports complex applications while maintaining exceptional transaction speeds and network efficiency.

By merging AI with Proof-of-Stake through its Hybrid Consensus model, Nexchain ensures both flexibility and high levels of security for its users.

The platform supports next-generation smart contracts capable of adapting in real-time, making it attractive for businesses, developers, and investors seeking functional solutions rather than speculative promises.

Currently, Nexchain's token presale is progressing through Stage 19, with NEX priced at $0.074 per token. This structured presale allows participants to join at favorable rates before the token reaches its listing price, which brings significant ROI potential.

So far, Nexchain has raised $4.7 million in USDT, underscoring strong investor confidence. As more participants enter, Nexchain continues to climb the crypto presale list as one of the top crypto presales in today's market.



Solaxy is quickly gaining traction as its presale enters its final stretch. Positioned as a solution to address Solana's long-standing network congestion, Solaxy goes beyond the usual meme coin narrative by offering functional technology that's already available for user testing. With live testnet operations, block explorer tools, bridge integration, and Hyperlane support, Solaxy presents a hands-on experience for both developers and casual investors.

Those looking to buy presale crypto have fewer than four days to secure SOLX tokens. Purchases can be made by connecting a crypto wallet to the official Solaxy presale site, accepting SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, or even bank card transactions. Alternatively, the presale is available through the Upcoming Tokens launchpad on the Best Wallet app.

Following the presale, Solaxy tokens will be claimable with immediate exchange listings scheduled shortly thereafter.

Having already raised over $57 million, Solaxy's listing phase is shaping up to be one of the most significant events among crypto presale projects this year.

As the race for the best crypto presale heats up, Nexchain remains firmly in the spotlight. Its AI-powered blockchain, secure hybrid consensus, and broad real-world applications continue to attract both institutional and retail investors.

Among the top crypto presales, Nexchain delivers the rare combination of advanced technology and strong market positioning.

Whether investors are scanning the crypto presale list or evaluating crypto ICO presale opportunities, Nexchain stands out as one of the most promising crypto coins on presale right now. For those aiming to buy presale crypto with real long-term growth, Nexchain leads the field.

There's something new and surprising from the people who brought us Words With Friends and Lucky's Tale. 

Thousands, a revolutionary Web3 protocol that transforms word-of-mouth marketing into a universal attribution infrastructure – together with sister company The Wildcard Alliance – today announced a joint $9 million fundraising round.

Arbitrum Gaming Ventures and Paradigm co-led the round. The McKinney, Texas-based companies, founded by co-CEOs Paul and Katy Drake Bettner whose past work includes Words With Friends, Lucky's Tale, and Age of Empires, have secured $6.5 million to date and expect to close the remaining funding over the next 60 days.

Wildcard is a third-person, 2v2 Collectible Card Action Game (CCAG) that seamlessly blends fast-paced arena combat with strategic deck-building. As a champion, you battle in real-time, summoning powerful creature-companions from your deck to fight alongside you. Master dynamic abilities, outplay opponents with skillful action mechanics, and harness the power of your summons in a thrilling fusion of collectible card strategy and third-person action combat—all set in a live, interactive arena.

This new funding builds on the companies' $46 million Series A raised in 2022, and will be usedto accelerate development of their integrated ecosystem of products, utilizing the Thousandsprotocol and Thousands.tv platform to unlock new channels of creator-centric user acquisitionand help launch their own upcoming game, Wildcard.

“It's simple,” said Paul Bettner, co-CEO, in a statement. “Wildcard only succeeds if its creators and community succeed. So we need a better way to reward these incredible contributors who drive immensevalue to the game. Thousands gives us the on-chain ‘rails' to solve this problem, to record and reward user acquisition and conversion at every step of the funnel.”

The synergy between Wildcard and Thousands has already demonstrated explosive growth. 

The Thousands network recorded over $800,000 in revenue in May 2025 alone, with an average revenue-per-stream of $50,000, average viewer-to-payer conversion of 77%, and a new all-time-high revenue record at $134,000 — metrics that far exceed industry standards.

The Thousands network addresses an untapped, trillion-dollar word-of-mouth economy, by making influence and attribution transparent, programmable, and incentive-aligned. The Thousands network enables creators and communities to earn instantly when their content drives conversions, while IP owners benefit from significantly lower customer acquisition costs compared to traditional channels.

“Thousands is redefining how games and content reach audiences,” said Rick Johanson, founding partner at Arbitrum Gaming Ventures, in a statement. “Their web-native streaming layer – think Twitch meets WalletConnect – allows every connected viewer to become an active participant in an on-chain economy, transforming spectators into engaged users.”

“We believe in this game, and we believe in this team,” said Dave White, research partner at Paradigm, in a statement. “Paul, Kate, and team have created one of the most eagerly anticipated games in crypto and we're very excited for what comes next.”

Since their initial funding, both platforms have achieved significant milestones. Wildcard was recently approved for release on Steam, where the 100k+ community are now playtesting Alpha builds of the game weekly, in preparation for Wildcard's Early Access release later this year.

These playtests are broadcast on Thousands.tv several times a week, helping to demonstrate the Thousands' network's ability to sustain engagement and monetization, with an average revenue per viewer of $141 dollars.

“Thousands doesn't feel like streaming. It's no longer a one-way street.”, said Payton Kaleiwahea, content creator and founder of WolvesDAO, in a statement. “Fans and creators are interacting; you're not just watching the game. You're connected to it. You're inside it. With Thousands, being there matters, and that changes everything.”

The companies have 30 full-time employees and another 30 or so contractors.

The penalty follows a joint investigation conducted by the ICO and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.

Between April and September 2023, a hacker carried out a credential stuffing attack on 23andMe's platform, exploiting reused login credentials that were stolen from previous unrelated data breaches.

 

This resulted in the unauthorised access to personal information belonging to 155,592 UK residents, potentially revealing names, birth years, self-reported city or postcode-level location, profile images, race, ethnicity, family trees and health reports.

The type and amount of personal information accessed varied depending on the information included in a customer's account.

The ICO investigation found that 23andMe did not have additional verification steps for users to access and download their raw genetic data.

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said: “This was a profoundly damaging breach that exposed sensitive personal information, family histories, and even health conditions of thousands of people in the UK.

“As one of those impacted told us: once this information is out there, it cannot be changed or reissued like a password or credit card number.

“23andMe failed to take basic steps to protect this information. Their security systems were inadequate, the warning signs were there, and the company was slow to respond. This left people's most sensitive data vulnerable to exploitation and harm.

“We carried out this investigation in collaboration with our Canadian counterparts, and it highlights the power of international cooperation in holding global companies to account. Data protection doesn't stop at borders, and neither do we when it comes to protecting the rights of UK residents.”

The ICO found that 23andMe breached UK data protection law by failing to put in place appropriate authentication and verification measures as part of its customer login process, including, but not limited to, mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure password requirements, or unpredictable usernames.

The company also failed to put in place appropriate security measures that focused on the access to and download of raw genetic data.

The report also found that  23andMe failed to put in place measures to monitor for, detect and appropriately respond to cyber threats to its customers' personal information.

Additionally, 23andMe's response to the incident was inadequate and they missed many opportunities to act, the ICO said.

Despite all this activity, the company did not start a full investigation until October 2023, when a 23andMe employee discovered that the stolen data had been advertised for sale on Reddit.

Only then did 23andMe confirm that a breach had occurred.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) posted a memo yesterday detailing a meeting between its Crypto Task Force and JP Morgan. While the task force primarily handles cryptocurrency issues, it also oversees tokenization matters that increasingly affect traditional finance (TradFi) companies.

JP Morgan's meeting agenda revealed three key discussion points: an overview of its existing digital finance services including repo solutions and debt platforms, analysis of how capital markets activity might migrate to public blockchains, and plans for future regulatory engagement.

The discussion likely centered heavily on tokenized collateral, an area where multiple regulators are actively involved. The CFTC is currently running tokenized collateral pilots for derivatives margin posting, and the DTCC is launching its own platform. The CME is also participating in this space.

Traditional margin requirements involve initial margin at trade inception and variation margin over time. Securities typically serve as initial margin while cash covers variation margin due to settlement delays. This creates market risks during volatile periods when institutions must sell assets to generate cash.

Tokenization offers a solution by allowing institutions to transfer tokenized securities directly to meet margin requirements without selling underlying assets. JP Morgan's recent announcement of JPMD deposit tokens on the Base public blockchain further addresses cash collateral needs, providing an alternative to stablecoins.

The bank already operates a tokenized collateral solution on its permissioned blockchain, Kinexys, alongside an intraday repo solution called Digital Financing and a bond issuance platform called Digital Debt Services. However, using permissioned blockchains creates integration challenges that public blockchains can ease.

While BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have tokenized money market funds on public blockchains, so far their usage has primarily attracted crypto institutions rather than traditional finance companies. JP Morgan sees an opportunity to serve the latter market.

The meeting was led by Scott Lucas, JP Morgan's Head of Markets Digital Assets since early 2021, who serves on the boards of blockchain firms Ownera (interoperability) and HQLAᵡ (digital collateral). He was joined by Justin Cohen, who oversees product development for the equity derivatives group that would potentially automate tokenized collateral posting for the bank's own trading operations.

 Forbes Staff. 

Donald Trump has deepened his ties with Chinese billionaire Justin Sun—who's fighting civil charges in the United States of fraud and market manipulation—as the president's stablecoin begins minting on Sun's blockchain, which hosted the largest share of illicit crypto activity last year, according to a crypto intelligence firm.

Trump and his family control about 40% of World Liberty Financial, according to its website—where he's listed as chief crypto advocate—and in April, the firm launched a stablecoin, USD1, pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by Treasuries and cash equivalents.

On June 11, Tron founder Justin Sun announced his blockchain had begun minting USD1, making the stablecoin native to his network.

World Liberty Financial earns interest on its USD1 reserves, so the more USD1 minted, including by Tron, the more the president's company stands to profit, Molly White, a crypto researcher told Forbes.

In March 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against Sun and his company, alleging market manipulation and selling unregistered securities; Sun has denied the charges and the judge paused the case at the request of both parties this February to allow time to discuss a possible settlement (a move that came just weeks after Sun invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial).

In 2024, Tron hosted 58% of all illicit crypto activity—the most of any blockchain and more than Ethereum and Bitcoin combined—“reflecting continued preference for blockchains that have low transaction fees, smart contracts, and popular stablecoins,” according to blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told Forbes in a statement Trump has no conflicts of interest because his “assets are in a trust managed by his children”; a spokesperson for World Liberty Financial declined to comment; and spokespeople for Tron and the Trump Organization did not respond to inquiries.

Trump can earn income from his businesses while in office through the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, the same structure he used during his first term. He is its sole donor and beneficiary, while Donald Trump Jr. serves as the trustee. The Trump Organization confirmed in an April regulatory filing in the United Kingdom that Trump retains control over his businesses. As president, he has pledged to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world,” aligning with his expanding investments in digital assets. Sun, who has now invested a total of at $75 million in World Liberty Financial, has become an advisor to the company. In May, he toured the White House and dined with Trump at his D.C.-area golf club for being one of the top holders of the president's meme coin, a separate crypto venture, according to social media posts.

$57.4 million: Trump's income from World Liberty Financial in 2024, which only launched in September, according to a financial disclosure he released Friday.

“We've seen increased criminal use of stablecoins on the Tron blockchain, and I think the launch highlights how little is known about USD1 and World Liberty Financial's ability to thwart criminal activity,” White told Forbes. “There is very little transparency into how the project intends to grapple with this persistent problem, and whether they have the capacity to do so responsibly.”

While TRM Labs found “the largest percentage of illicit crypto activity occurred on the TRON blockchain” in 2024, Tron also “saw the most significant decline in illicit volume, dropping by $6 billion and halving its proportion of illicit volume.” TRM Labs credited the decline to Tron's efforts to root out abuse, including collaborating with, yes, TRM Labs to establish what it calls the “first-ever private-sector financial crime unit.”

“The first USD1 minted on Tron—just the beginning of something much bigger,” World Liberty Financial's X account posted in response to Sun's announcement. “Appreciate the support, @justinsuntron. Let's bring USD1 everywhere.”

In addition to Tron, two other crypto firms that announced relationships with World Liberty Financial in the past month also have faced scrutiny from U.S. authorities. In May, USD1 started trading on KuCoin, an exchange recently banned from the United States after admitting to anti-money laundering violations and agreeing to pay $300 million in penalties. It also launched on Binance, which admitted in a November 2023 plea deal with the Justice Department to anti-money laundering and sanctions violations, agreeing to pay $4 billion in penalties. (Days after USD1 launched on BInance, the SEC dropped a lawsuit it had brought against the firm.)

Tron is going public through a reverse merger with a toy manufacturer, SRM Entertainment, the companies announced on Monday. As part of the deal, SRM will raise $100 million to buy Tron tokens and issue $210 million in shares and warrants. SRM Entertainment will change its name to Tron Inc. and Sun will become an advisor. Sun shared a post claiming Eric Trump was expected to join the company, though Trump denied it, calling Sun a “great friend” but saying the report was “inaccurate.”

The Tron-SRM merger was brokered by Dominari Securities, whose parent company—Dominari Holdings—is partially owned by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. The brothers each hold more than 5% of the firm, largely in exchange for serving 10 weeks on an previously somewhat dormant advisory board that also includes three other Trump Organization executive vice presidents. Dominari Holdings CEO Anthony Hayes praised the advisory board's work in a letter to shareholders.

On Tuesday, the Senate passed the Genius Act, a crypto industry-backed bill that would create new rules for stablecoins like USD1. In response to Trump's crypto ventures, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., introduced the End Crypto Corruption Act, which would ban presidents and other top officials from “issuing, endorsing or sponsoring crypto assets.” The bill is pending and has 24 co-sponsors.

Forbes estimates Trump's net worth at about $5.2 billion, with crypto now accounting for most of his wealth. Sun is worth around $8.5 billion.

Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex has been hacked for $90 million by Israel-linked hacking activist group Gonjeshke Darande, according to a blog post from blockchain security firm Elliptic.

The group said in an X post: “After Bank Sepah, it was Nobitex's turn,” referencing their Tuesday cyberattack on Iran's state-owned lender. They warned that Nobitex's internal data and source code would be released within a day, and any assets left on the exchange would be “at risk.”

On-chain sleuth ZachXBT first flagged suspicious outflows totaling $81.7 million in Tron's TRX TRX$0.27032, bitcoin BTC$103,771.04, dogecoin DOGE$0.16668 and other tokens in his Telegram channel on Wednesday.

The stolen funds were traced to a wallet using a provocative vanity address: TKFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXy2r7mNX.

Estimates of funds stolen was later updated to over $82 million, with funds stolen across Bitcoin, Dogecoin and EVM chains from addresses including"0xffFFfFFffFFffFfFffFFfFfFfFFFFfFfFFFFDead," "1FuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXaAovLX," and "DFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXWLW65t."The group called Nobitex a “core part of the regime's terror financing network,” accusing it of helping Iran evade international sanctions by enabling crypto-based payments.

Nobitex, Iran's largest exchange, confirmed the attack in an X post but did not mention or confirm stolen funds.

The hack also does not appear to be financially motivated, Elliptic said. 

The funds were sent to vanity addresses created through "brute force" methods - involving the creation of large numbers of cryptographic key pairs until one contains the desired text. 

"But creating vanity addresses with text strings as long as those used in this hack is computationally infeasible. This means that Predatory Sparrow would not have the private keys for the crypto addresses they sent the Nobitex funds to, and have effectively burned the funds in order to send Nobitex a political message," Elliptic said.

At the time of writing, it is unclear what attack method was used by Gonjeshke Darande to conduct the exploit.

The hack comes amid a flurry of cyber and physical attacks between Iran and Israel.

Gonjeshke Darande, believed by cybersecurity analysts to have ties to Israeli intelligence, has previously claimed responsibility for coordinated infrastructure attacks on Iranian steel factories and gas stations.

With the source code leak looming, Nobitex now faces not only financial loss but a full-blown credibility crisis — and users who haven't yet moved funds may stand to lose everything, per the hacking group's followup threats.

Cathie Wood's Ark Invest sold a combined 300,108 shares of Circle Internet Group   on Tuesday across three of its ETFs, continuing to take profit for a second day in a row, this time to the tune of $44.7 million.

The move came as CRCL closed in New York Tuesday at $149.15 as it continues to maintain investor momentum after a monster rally during its first days of trading earlier this month. 

ARK's trimming of its CRCL position coincided with a major policy milestone: the U.S. Senate's bipartisan passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate stablecoin issuers like Circle. 

The Act is considered an industry win, and was welcomed by Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who called it a "genius" piece of legislation in an X post.

An investor notice indicates that as ARK sold CRCL, it increased its positions in chip designer AMD, which has been described as an undervalued AI play following the release of its recent roadmap, as well as Taiwan Semiconductor, a chip manufacturing company.

Feniix Energy, an energy firm based in Latin America, has completed a $75 million acquisition of a live oil and gas operation using blockchain tokenization, according to a statement shared with CryptoSlate on June 17.

Global Settlement, a blockchain firm specializing in real-world assets (RWAs), executed the deal through its GSX Protocol.

The protocol enabled instant settlements, reduced counterparty risk, and lowered transaction fees. It also introduced full transparency throughout the funding and ownership process.

Notably, stablecoins were used to settle the transaction, removing the need for traditional banking intermediaries. This marked a pivotal move in financing capital-intensive projects using decentralized finance tools.

The acquisition was structured entirely through tokenized debt and equity. An unnamed leading commodity trading company provided the debt portion, making this the first known instance of a fully tokenized capital structure used to purchase an active energy asset.

Feniix Energy's Director, Alejandro Uribe, described the deal as a milestone in energy financing. He said that blockchain brought unmatched speed, visibility, and trust features that were often missing in traditional financing.

He said:

“Our collaboration with Global Settlement demonstrates how innovation can bridge traditional finance and the crypto economy, unlocking substantial value for our stakeholders.”

Global Settlement founder Kyle Sonlin added that the deal aimed to showcase the real-world benefits of tokenization. He emphasized that on-chain infrastructure helped streamline capital flows and reduce operational costs.

Industry observers see this acquisition as a breakthrough moment for blockchain adoption in traditional sectors. The use of tokenized capital in live infrastructure deals signals growing confidence in blockchain as a financing tool for institutional-grade projects.

The timing of this deal aligns with rising momentum in the RWA space. A June 16 report by CoinGecko noted that the tokenized treasuries market surged 544.8% in 2024, reaching an all-time high of $5.6 billion by April 2025.

It's got us beat by 34.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Classical and quantum mechanics don't really get along as the science of the subatomic can get, well, weird. Take, for instance, quantum entanglement, which says that the state of one particle can be determined by examining the state of its entangled pair regardless of distance. This strange fact flies in the face of classical physics, and even led Albert Einstein to famously describe this quantum quirk as “spooky action at a distance.” 

This is what is known as “quantum nonlocality,” where objects are influenced across distances (seeming beyond the speed of light) whereas classical physics follows local theory, the idea that objects are influenced by their immediate surroundings. This is a pretty sharp divide as explained by the famous no-go theorem known as the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) paradox, which essentially details how quantum theory cannot be described by local realistic description. 

Named for the physicists who described the paradox in 1989, GHZ-type paradoxes show that when particles can only be influenced by proximity they produce mathematical impossibilities. As New Scientist reports, the paradox can even be expressed through a calculation where 1 equals -1. This paradox is useful in showing how quantum properties can not be described using classical means, but a new paper published in the journal Science Advances, decided to see just how strange these paradoxes could get. 

Essentially, an international team of scientists wanted to see how un-classical particles of light could get—and the results were maybe stranger than the authors originally anticipated. This extremely technical experiment produced photons, or particles of light, that existed in 37 dimensions. Just as you and I exist in three dimension—plus an additional temporal dimension—these photons required 37 similar reference points.

“This experiment shows that quantum physics is more nonclassical than many of us thought,” Technical University of Denmark's Zhenghao Liu, a co-author of the study, told New Scientist. “It could be [that] 100 years after its discovery, we are still only seeing the tip of the iceberg.”

Pulling this off is not an easy thing to do as Liu and his team needed to feed a version of the GHZ paradox into coherent light—even in color and wavelength—so that they could easily manipulate the photons. This essentially resulted in the most “nonclassical effects in the quantum world” that's ever been created, Liu told New Scientist. 

“We believe that this work has opened several avenues for future research,” the authors write. “We hope our findings can be used to build even stronger quantum advantages in high-dimensional systems.”

In other words, if we've only discovered the tip of the iceberg, just imagine what quantum breakthroughs are lurking just below the surface.

The remarkable discovery offers a rare glimpse into a bygone era from 1,800 years ago.

Archaeologists discovered three remarkable 1,800-year-old, residential-style tombs featuring rooms and windows, where an ancient Chinese family was laid to rest alongside their treasured possessions. 

While preparing for a local park expansion in Rizhao, China, archaeologists stumbled upon the tombs, which date back to the Han dynasty. But the archaeologists weren't actually the first to find the tombs; looters had previously discovered at least portions of them at some point, largely clearing out two of the tombs, while leaving the third relatively undisturbed. 

According to a translated statement from the Institute of Archaeology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences reported by the Miami Herald, what makes the tombs so fascinating—apart from the 70 artifacts constituting a family treasure located in the third tomb—is residential design.

Two of the tombs contained inscriptions of the Huan surname, showing the distinct familial connection between them. Experts say the tombs, accessed through passageways, share a similar design. The most intact tomb, known as M3, includes interconnected rooms with wooden windows and doors, indicating it may have been the final resting place of a married couple. 

The excavation in Rizhao, which is about 400 miles from Beijing, yielded more than 70 artifacts, ranging from an iron sword to bronze mirrors and a variety of pottery. It likely constituted the family's treasure, the archaeologists say.

In a distinctly unusual discovery, the team also located pieces of a coffin carriage, which was used to transport coffins into the tomb. The archaeologists described it as “exquisitely crafted and an uncommon find.” 

The discovery of ancient tombs in China sheds light on cultural practices of bygone eras. A recent find from the second Jin Dynasty, approximately 800 years old, provides evidence of non-Chinese influence in the cultural tapestry of Shanxi province. 

That discovery, which was also a three-tomb set, showed each had its own distinct characteristic and style, from architectural design to murals. Brick-carved arches, doors, and windows played heavily, and murals featured flora patterns and figures. Each tomb told its own story with epitaphs and inscriptions linking historical and geographical information key at the time.

Metrics details

Kupffer cells (KCs) are tissue-resident macrophages that colonize the liver early during embryogenesis1. Upon liver colonization, KCs rapidly acquire a tissue-specific transcriptional signature, mature alongside the developing liver and adapt to its functions1,2,3. Throughout development and adulthood, KCs perform distinct core functions that are essential for liver and organismal homeostasis, including supporting fetal erythropoiesis, postnatal erythrocyte recycling and liver metabolism4. However, whether perturbations of macrophage core functions during development contribute to or cause disease at postnatal stages is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a mouse model of maternal obesity to perturb KC functions during gestation. We show that offspring exposed to maternal obesity develop fatty liver disease, driven by aberrant developmental programming of KCs that persists into adulthood. Programmed KCs promote lipid uptake by hepatocytes through apolipoprotein secretion. KC depletion in neonate mice born to obese mothers, followed by replenishment with naive monocytes, rescues fatty liver disease. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF1α) in macrophages during gestation prevents the metabolic programming of KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, thereby averting the development of fatty liver disease. These results establish developmental perturbation of KC functions as a causal factor in fatty liver disease in adulthood and position fetal-derived macrophages as critical intergenerational messengers within the concept of developmental origins of health and diseases5.

Early-life environmental factors strongly influence the risk of developing non-communicable diseases in adulthood, a concept known as developmental origins of health and diseases (DOHaDs)5. Maternal malnutrition, obesity, infection, environmental pollutants and psychosocial stress have been associated with metabolic disorders, neurological diseases, cancer and dysregulated immune responses in offspring6,7,8,9,10,11. At the cellular level, maternal immune activation can alter fetal haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), contributing to neonatal sepsis12. A maternal high-fat diet (HFD) or viral infection can also program microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, leading to neuronal disorders9,13. However, it remains elusive whether macrophages outside the brain can act as intergenerational messengers and causally contribute to disease onset, serving as cellular components in DOHaDs7,8.

Tissue-resident macrophages, including KCs in the liver, are long-lived, yolk sac-derived cells that support tissue development and homeostasis via production of growth factors, signalling molecules, and phagocytosis of waste products and apoptotic cells4. The liver, one of the first organs colonized by macrophages1, exposes fetal KCs early to maternal blood components from the placenta14. Whether maternal environmental factors, particularly diet, influence KC development and functions, thereby leading to liver disease, remains unknown.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is rising with global obesity15. MAFLD can progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In diet-induced MAFLD, yolk sac-derived KCs can lose self-renewal and are, at least partially, replaced by monocyte-derived KC-like cells, diversifying the macrophage pool16,17,18,19. These macrophages adapt to the fatty liver environment, altering their epigenome and transcriptome, and contribute to disease progression through the secretion of inflammatory and non-inflammatory mediators19,20. Although our understanding of MAFLD and the role of KCs in disease progression to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis is growing, it remains unclear how KCs respond to maternal obesity-induced fatty liver disease (FLD) in the offspring and whether they drive disease onset.

Here we show that maternal obesity induces a HIF1α-dependent metabolic reprogramming of yolk sac-derived KCs, persisting into adulthood and driving FLD. Using fate-mapping, depletion and conditional knockout (KO) models, combined with multi-omic profiling, we identified KCs as intergenerational messengers that translate maternal nutritional cues into long-lasting hepatic dysfunction. Our study uncovers a causal link between developmental KC perturbation and adult-onset FLD, positioning yolk sac-derived macrophages as central players in DOHaDs.

Maternal obesity is associated with obesity and liver disease in offspring in humans and animal models21, yet mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that KCs may contribute to FLD due to their early liver colonization and metabolic roles4. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6Jrcc female mice were fed a HFD for 8 weeks, leading to increased body weight and homeostatic model for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). These diet conditions did not lead to maternal inflammation as assessed by serum cytokine and chemokine measurements, with only interleukin-1α (IL-1α), C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) and leptin being upregulated (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). Females were then bred to control diet (CD)-fed males. To dissect gestational versus lactational effects, newborn mice were cross-fostered and/or weaned onto a CD or HFD (Fig. 1a, maternal obese groups). As maternal lean control groups, we analysed offspring born to CD females and fed with a CD throughout life or weaned on a HFD (Fig. 1a). At 11 weeks, the maternal obese groups fed with a CD after birth (HFDMCDLCD; M denotes maternal diet during gestation and L refers to foster mother diet during lactating phase) or weaning (HFDMHFDLCD) showed no differences in body weight or white adipose tissue (WAT) weight compared with the maternal lean group on a CD (CDMCDLCD; Extended Data Fig. 1e). Only groups on a HFD postnatally (CDMCDLHFD, HFDMCDLHFD and HFDMHFDLHFD) developed obesity (Extended Data Fig. 1e), indicating that a post-weaning diet, not maternal obesity alone, determines overall body and WAT weight.

By contrast, liver lipid content increased in all maternal obese groups, as shown in the Oil-red-O (ORO) and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stainings, although the liver weight was similar in all conditions (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Both principal component analysis (PCA; Fig. 1d) and hierarchical clustering of lipidomics analyses (Extended Data Fig. 1g) indicated that maternal obese groups with a CD as their final diet (HFD>CD) were distinct from all animals fed a HFD as their final diet (CD>HFD and HFD>HFD), all of which diverge from CDMCDLCD (CD>CD). Indeed, the HFDMCDLCD and HFDMHFDLCD groups showed a significant increase of lipid species, such as saturated triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and cholesterol esters, whereas maternal lean CDMCDLHFD as well as maternal obese HFDMCDLHFD and HFDMHFDLHFD groups showed only a moderate increase of lipid accumulation compared with CDMCDLCD livers.

We next performed serum metabolomics profiling of more than 900 metabolites and lipids to test whether the observed FLD phenotype of offspring born to obese mothers is also associated with systemic alterations, which might even serve as specific biomarkers. Group differences primarily reflected final dietary status (CD versus HFD; Extended Data Fig. 1h and Supplementary Table 1). Comparing CDMCDLCD with HFDMCDLCD offspring, in which body composition was similar but the FLD phenotype was most prominent in HFDMCDLCD livers, revealed 129 significantly altered metabolites (Supplementary Table 2), which were enriched in the metabolic pathways ‘taurine and hypotaurine metabolism', ‘arginine biosynthesis' and ‘histidine metabolism' (Extended Data Fig. 1i). In particular, the glutamine:glutamate ratio, two amino acids that feed into arginine biosynthesis, was significantly increased in HFDMCDLCD mice (Supplementary Table 2). Although generally decreased in FLD22, a maternal obesity model has reported an increased ratio correlating with liver metabolic state23, suggesting a biomarker for maternal obesity-driven FLD. In summary, maternal obesity induces a distinct FLD phenotype in offspring compared with postnatal diet-induced FLD.

We next characterized the maternal obesity-induced FLD phenotype focusing on hepatic myeloid cells, which have a critical role in FLD initiation and propagation24. Quantification confirmed increased neutrophils, monocytes and classical dendritic cells (cDC1 and cDC2) in HFDMCDLCD offspring (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). KC numbers were increased across maternal obese groups, whereas liver capsular macrophages were unaffected. Post-weaning HFD in maternal lean controls (CDMCDLHFD) did not induce myeloid cell influx (Extended Data Fig. 2b). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sorted KCs (Extended Data Fig. 2c) revealed clustering according to their in utero exposure to either lean (CD>) or obese (HFD>) mothers (Fig. 1e). Co-expression network analysis (hCo-Cena)25 identified five modules (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 3). The steelblue module represented genes upregulated by maternal obesity. Pathway enrichment analyses using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and HALLMARK databases revealed an upregulation of genes related to ‘cell activation involved in immune response'. Among these genes was Trem2, which has been previously described to be upregulated in KCs during FLD17, and which was accompanied by its downstream signalling cascade molecules Tyrobp and Syk in the same module (Fig. 1g). In addition, Myd88, Gpnmb and the monocyte-specific genes Ccr2 and Cx3cr1 were found in the steelblue module with the highest expression in HFDMCDLCD KCs (Fig. 1g). Moreover, we found the term ‘glycolysis/gluconeogenesis' to be enriched in the steelblue module (Fig. 1f). By contrast, the turquoise and lightgreen modules indicated that metabolic processes such as ‘oxidative phosphorylation', ‘cellular respiration' and ‘xenobiotic metabolism' were downregulated upon maternal obesity (Fig. 1f). Thus, maternal obesity causes an inflammatory response of KCs, and leads to an alteration of their metabolic status on a transcriptional level. To validate the transcriptional changes of KCs at the protein level, we performed spectral flow cytometry-based metabolic profiling26 of KCs from CDMCDLCD and HFDMCDLCD offspring (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Although most nutrient transporters and metabolic enzymes involved in the glucose and lipid metabolic pathways remained unchanged, the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA), a key component of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) were reduced in HFDMCDLCD KCs compared with CDMCDLCD (Extended Data Fig. 2e). These findings indicate that maternal obesity impairs the metabolic capacity of offspring KCs.

To determine systemic effects, we assessed serum cytokines and bone marrow compartment cellularity. No systemic cytokine elevation or progenitor changes were observed (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). Together, maternal obesity-induced FLD is accompanied by local inflammation and a switch of KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis.

Diet-induced FLD models show increased monocyte influx and replacement of yolk sac-derived KCs16,17,18. Our RNA-seq data hinted at a monocyte signature in KCs from maternal obesity offspring. To address KC ontogeny, we generated Tnfrsf11aCre;Rosa26LSL-YFP;Ms4a3FlpO;Rosa26FSF-tdTomato mice. This double fate mapper allows to follow ontogeny of yolk sac-derived pre-macrophages and bone marrow-derived monocytes simultaneously using a combination of conventional recombinase approaches (Fig. 2a,b). We have previously shown that Tnfrsf11aCre mice label pre-macrophages and their progeny efficiently1. However, Tnfrsf11a is a core macrophage gene1 whose expression is induced once monocytes differentiate into macrophages27,28 whereby fetal-derived and bone marrow-derived macrophages remain undistinguishable. Thus, we additionally took advantage of the newly developed Ms4a3FlpO mice (Extended Data Fig. 4a), as we previously have shown that the Ms4a3 locus specifically targets monocytes and, thus, all monocyte-derived macrophages29. First, we confirmed that the fate-mapping efficiency of Ms4a3FlpO mice was as efficient as in Ms4a3Cre mice, with more than 95% Ly6C+ blood monocytes being labelled with tdTomato (tdT; Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Among these monocytes, we observed a small fraction (approximately 13%) that already expressed YFP, suggesting that these cells already start to express a core macrophage program. However, none of the monocytes was only YFP+, demonstrating that the double fate mapper can unequivocally distinguish between the yolk sac-derived and adult bone marrow-derived waves of haematopoiesis (Extended Data Fig. 4c). High YFP labelling was also confirmed in microglia that are yolk sac derived30,31 (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). In 11–12-week-old CDMCDLCD livers, more than 96% of KCs were YFP+, with minimal tdT labelling (less than 1% for YFP+tdT+ and approximately 3% for tdT+; Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4d), consistent with yolk sac origin1,29. Similarly, HFDMCDLCD KCs retained high YFP labelling (approximately 96%), despite the FLD phenotype and monocyte gene upregulation. Thus, KCs remain of yolk sac origin despite experiencing maternal obesity and a FLD environment during adulthood, and therefore can serve as intergenerational messengers conveying information that they experience in utero to adult life.

We hypothesized that developmental programming of KCs by maternal obesity impairs their homeostatic function and promotes FLD via paracrine signalling. To test this hypothesis, we co-cultured hepatocytes with KCs from CDMCDLCD or HFDMCDLCD livers without direct cell contact, ensuring that only paracrine signalling occurred (Fig. 2d). Real-time lipid accumulation in hepatocytes was monitored using LD540 labelling to visualize neutral lipids via live-cell imaging. Hepatocytes co-cultured with HFDMCDLCD KCs exhibited significantly greater lipid accumulation, as indicated by increased LD540 intensity after 4 h, compared with those co-cultured with CDMCDLCD KCs (Fig. 2e). Thus, KCs that have experienced dietary factors from obese mothers during embryogenesis exert their FLD-promoting function via paracrine signalling.

To further validate KC-dependent lipid accumulation in hepatocytes in vivo, we utilized the KC–diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) mouse model32, in which human DTR is expressed under the control of the KC-specific Clec4f promoter, enabling targeted depletion of KCs within 24 h following a single dose of diphtheria toxin (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). We generated HFDMCDLCD offspring with either the Clec4fDTR/+ or Clec4f+/+ genotype. At postnatal day 0 (P0), diphtheria toxin was injected to deplete KCs in Clec4fDTR/+, followed by transplantation of tdT+ bone marrow monocytes and HSPCs from naive mice at P1 to replenish the KC niche (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5c). We confirmed the presence of tdT+ KC-like cells in the adult liver of Clec4fDTR/+ mice, despite a large fraction of KC-like cells originating also from endogenous tdT− progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 5d). This treatment effectively rescued the fatty liver phenotype in Clec4fDTR/+ HFDMCDLCD mice, as evidenced by reduced lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes, demonstrated by ORO and H&E staining (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 5e). By contrast, Clec4f+/+ littermates receiving the same diphtheria toxin injection and cell transfer retained lipid accumulation, consistent with observations in C57BL/6Jrcc mice (Fig. 1b,c). Moreover, replenishment of the empty KC niche solely by endogenous monocytes or HSPCs and residual KCs (Clec4fDTR/+ mice injected with diphtheria toxin but without any cell transfer from a naive source), did not rescue the fatty liver phenotype (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 5e), indicating that HSPCs themselves may be developmentally programmed, as previously reported33,34. In summary, we demonstrate that KC-derived paracrine factors drive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes in the offspring of obese mothers.

As HIF1α regulates the metabolic switch of macrophages from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis35,36, we tested whether preventing HIF1α-dependent developmental programming of KCs by maternal obesity would rescue the FLD phenotype. We used LysMCre;Hif1af/f mice, in which Hif1a is depleted in macrophages and other myeloid cells37. As maternal diet during lactation showed minimal impact (Fig. 1), we focused on the dietary switch after birth in the maternal obese groups and used HFD-fed animals after weaning as control groups (Fig. 3a). Both Hif1af/f (wild type (WT)) and LysMCre;Hif1af/f (KO) littermates gained body weight and WAT weight when the end diet was a HFD (CDMHFD and HFDMHFD), indicating that myeloid-specific loss of HIF1α does not prevent diet-induced obesity (Extended Data Fig. 6a).

Next, we focused on the liver phenotype. As in the C57BL/6Jrcc mice, the total liver weight remained unaltered (Extended Data Fig. 6a), and Hif1af/f offspring born to obese mothers (HFDMCD WT) developed a FLD, as observed by ORO staining (Fig. 3b,c) and lipidomics (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Similar to the lipidomics results in C57BL/6Jrcc mice, HFDMCD WT offspring showed an increase of saturated triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters. However, HFDMCD KO offspring was rescued from developing a FLD (Fig. 3b–d and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c), indicating that depletion of HIF1α in KCs during embryogenesis is sufficient to prevent their metabolic programming, which ultimately drives lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. This effect was diminished when KO offspring was kept on a HFD after birth (HFDMHFD KO), as they showed a similar development of FLD as HFDMHFD WT with high lipid accumulation (Fig. 3b,c) and significant increase of triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerol and cholesterol esters (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Hepatocyte transcriptomes reflected these differences (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e).

To assess a possible transient activation of HIF1α by maternal obesity specifically during gestation that may have long-lasting effects, we performed RNA-seq of KCs isolated from C57BL/6Jrcc mice at P0 born to CD-fed or HFD-fed mothers. Comparing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from CD and HFD conditions resulted in 54 regulated genes (Extended Data Fig. 7a). To investigate gene regulation patterns, we inferred transcription factor activity on the basis of all DEGs and a collection of transcriptional regulatory interactions38, indicating that DEGs were downstream of HIF1α, among other transcription factors (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Indeed, a total of five HIF1α target genes (Hif3a, S100a8, S100a9, Tgfb3 and Vegfa) were among the 29 upregulated DEGs (Extended Data Fig. 7c), and HALLMARK analysis of these 29 upregulated DEGs revealed that they fall into the term ‘hypoxia' (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Of note, only Hif3a expression was regulated, whereas genes encoding other HIF proteins were not transcriptionally regulated (Extended Data Fig. 7e). To validate that HIF1α is transiently active in KCs, we evaluated HIF1α protein expression in KCs of P0 neonate mice born to either HFD or CD mothers (Extended Data Fig. 7f). Quantification of immunofluorescence staining in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm showed an increase of HIF1α translocation to the nucleus in maternal obese neonate mice when compared with maternal lean neonate mice (Extended Data Fig. 7g). These data indicate that KCs react to maternal obesity by increased HIF1α translocation to the nucleus, leading to the upregulation of HIF1α target genes at birth.

Together, our results show that the development of KCs from the offspring is perturbed by maternal obesity in a HIF1α-dependent manner, and that ablation of HIF1α function in fetal KCs rescues the development of FLD during adulthood caused by maternal obesity.

As FLD induced by maternal obesity was only rescued by Hif1a deletion if the offspring was kept on a CD, we asked whether additional factors, such as inflammation, may add to the hepatic lipid accumulation at postnatal stages when the offspring is fed with a HFD. To address whether hepatocytes may attract immune cells and cause a slowly increasing local inflammation in the liver when experiencing a HFD throughout life, we used the hepatocyte transcriptome data and investigated expression of chemoattractant factors. Indeed, we found Agt (encoding angiotensin), C3 (encoding complement C3), Lect2 (encoding leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2) and Cxcl12 (encoding C-X-C motif chemokine 12) to be particularly upregulated in hepatocytes isolated from HFDMHFD WT and/or HFDMHFD KO groups, which are involved in attracting monocytes and neutrophils39,40,41 (Extended Data Fig. 8a). In line with these findings, flow cytometry analyses showed an, albeit not always significant, increase in the number of recruited myeloid cells (monocytes, neutrophils, cDC1 and cDC2; Extended Data Fig. 8b). Of note, deletion of Hif1a did not decrease myeloid cell numbers compared with WT littermates in any of the dietary conditions (Extended Data Fig. 8b), suggesting that the recruitment and/or proliferation of all myeloid cells is independent of HIF1α function at this early stage of FLD.

To investigate how HIF1α-dependent developmental programming in KCs causes FLD, we analysed the transcriptomes of WT and KO KCs from maternal lean and maternal obese conditions. PCA showed that maternal obesity, not the end diet, was the main driver of the KC transcriptional program (Fig. 3e), similar to the C57BL/6Jrcc model (Fig. 1e). Only KCs from HFDMCD KO mice clustered with maternal lean conditions (Fig. 3e), demonstrating that developmental programming events caused by maternal obesity are HIF1α dependent. Focusing specifically on HIF1α-dependent gene regulation, comparing HFDMCD WT versus HFDMCD KO KCs, yielded 409 DEGs (adjusted P value of 0.1; Supplementary Table 4). GO term analysis of DEGs downregulated in HFDMCD KO KCs revealed terms such as ‘fatty acid metabolic process', ‘cellular response to xenobiotic metabolism' and ‘blood coagulation, fibrin clot formation' (Extended Data Fig. 8c and Supplementary Table 5). As ex vivo culture data indicated that KCs cause lipid accumulation via paracrine factors (Fig. 2d,e), we searched for secreted ligands with corresponding hepatocyte receptors. Among 25 differentially expressed ligands, the majority were upregulated in HFDMCD WT compared with HFDMCD KO KCs (Fig. 3f). Among them, we detected apolipoproteins (Apob and Apoa1) and many coagulation factors, such as Fga, Fgb, Fgg, F2, F8 and F9, which encode fibrinogen, thrombin and coagulation factors VIII and IX, respectively.

To validate HIF1α-dependent upregulation of KC-derived ligands at the protein level, we performed proteomics on isolated KCs from CDMCD WT, CDMCD KO, HFDMCD WT and HFDMCD KO offspring. First, we compared HFDMCD WT with CDMCD WT to identify proteins induced by maternal obesity (WT list). Next, we compared HFDMCD WT with HFDMCD KO to identify HIF1α-dependent proteins in the context of maternal obesity (HFDMCD list). These analyses identified 66 and 59 differentially expressed proteins, respectively, as well as 147 proteins that were both HIF1α dependent and induced by maternal obesity (Cross list; Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 8d). GO, HALLMARK and KEGG analyses of these proteins revealed pathways such as ‘triglyceride catabolic process', ‘complement and coagulation cascades', ‘insulin-like growth factor receptor signalling pathway' and ‘ECM receptor interaction' among the Cross proteins. In addition, lipid transport pathways were enriched in the WT and HFDMCD lists, whereas immune-related terms were specifically enriched in the HFDMCD list (Extended Data Fig. 8e and Supplementary Table 6). A heatmap visualizing Cross proteins (Fig. 3h) showed that HIF1α deficiency in KCs prevented the upregulation of many proteins, including apolipoproteins and coagulation factors, in response to maternal obesity. Together, these transcriptional and proteomic analyses identified several HIF1α-dependent candidates induced by maternal obesity, potentially acting as KC-derived paracrine signals driving lipid accumulation in hepatocytes.

To determine whether maternal obesity-induced changes persist into adulthood and to avoid potential contamination from sorted KCs42, we performed single-nucleus RNA (snRNA)-seq–assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) on nuclei isolated from 12-week-old C57BL/6Jrcc HFDMCDLCD and CDMCDLCD offspring. This allowed for the epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis of individual cells. Integration of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data resulted in various hepatic cell types, including KCs and hepatocytes (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Subclustering the KCs revealed five distinct KC states (Fig. 4a,b), with clusters 0, 1 and 4 expressing high levels of Adgre1, Timd4 and Clec4f. Clusters 2 and 3, which increased relatively to the total KC numbers in the HFDMCDLCD condition, exhibited high levels of the MHC class II-related genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and Cd74) in cluster 2 and immune-regulation and metabolic-response genes (Pparg, Lilr4b and Lgals3) in cluster 3 (Fig. 4b). Increased MHC class II expression was validated in the HFDMCDLCD liver parenchyma, whereas CDMCDLCD mice showed restricted MHC class II expression around the periportal and central veins of the liver (Extended Data Fig. 9c).

Source data

Comparisons of ATAC-seq peak-related genes between HFDMCDLCD and CDMCDLCD KCs identified 28 downregulated and 60 upregulated gene loci (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Despite the relatively low numbers, GO term analyses of downregulated genes indicated enrichment of lipid metabolic processes (Extended Data Fig. 9e). Of note, ATAC-seq peaks were differentially present within the Pck1 locus, a gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, which is an enzyme that typically has an antagonistic role to glycolysis. Plotting the gene expression validated the loss of Pck1 expression across all HFDMCDLCD KC states (Extended Data Fig. 9f), aligning with the metabolic switch described earlier (Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). Furthermore, we observed epigenetic changes within the Gpnmb locus where ATAC-seq peaks increased significantly. Of note, Gpnmb has been previously described as a biomarker for steatohepatitis43. Consistent with bulk RNA-seq results, this epigenetic change was accompanied by upregulation of Gpnmb gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 9d,f). However, this upregulation was restricted only to clusters 2 and 3, which expand proportionally under maternal obesity conditions. To investigate whether these distinct KC states are differentially regulated at the transcriptional level, we performed DEG analysis comparing the clusters (Supplementary Table 7), combined with DecoupleR transcription factor activity analysis. This revealed that KC states clustered by dietary condition rather than identity, indicating that persistent changes in transcription factor activity were driving the observed DEGs in HFDMCDLCD KCs (Fig. 4c). Transcription factor activity analysis identified HIF1α to be mainly active in clusters 1, 2 and 3 in the HFDMCDLCD condition. Transcription factors, such as Jun, Ets1 and Esr2, were more active in most HFDMCDLCD clusters, with PPARα and PPARγ showing increased activity across all HFDMCDLCD clusters (Fig. 4c). These findings suggest that, in addition to HIF1α, other persistent transcriptional changes stem from altered transcription factor activity in offspring born to obese mothers.

Next, we leveraged the snRNA-seq data to assess signalling pathways that are activated in HFDMCDLCD KCs using CellChat analysis. In line with the bulk RNA-seq data, KCs demonstrated increased intercellular communication via APOE and APOA1 signalling pathways under maternal obesity conditions (Extended Data Fig. 9g). Gene expression analyses confirmed upregulation of Apoe and Apoa1 in all HFDMCDLCD states (Fig. 4d), consistent with increased transcription factor activity of PPARα and PPARγ, which are known regulators of apolipoproteins44. In addition, ATAC-seq analysis revealed an increase in peaks at putative regulatory elements located upstream of the Apoe promoter in HFDMCDLCD cluster 3 compared with CDMCDLCD, which harbour PPARα and PPARγ–RXRα transcription factor-binding sides (Fig. 4e).

Together, our data show that maternal obesity induces persistent changes in KCs. Of note, we identified new KC states (clusters 2 and 3) that probably account for the immune-related signature observed in the bulk RNA-seq data. These clusters expand in response to maternal obesity and specifically upregulate inflammatory genes. Furthermore, the snRNA–ATAC-seq approach corroborates our findings from bulk RNA-seq and proteomics approaches, highlighting the significant upregulation of apolipoproteins in KCs.

To investigate whether apolipoproteins contribute to lipid accumulation in the liver, we utilized the hepatocyte live-imaging cell culture approach, adding APOE or APOA1 to the medium. As a positive control, we used tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which has been previously identified as a KC-derived driver of lipid storage in hepatocytes45. In all conditions, the LD540 signal intensity increased, with APOE inducing the highest lipid accumulation compared with control hepatocytes (Fig. 4f).

In summary, our findings provide evidence that HIF1α-dependent developmental programming by maternal obesity leads to the upregulation of apolipoproteins in adult KCs, which can induce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, thereby contributing to the onset of FLD.

This work supports the hypothesis that yolk sac-derived tissue-resident macrophages are cellular components within the concept of DOHaDs, as developmental perturbations of hepatic macrophages result in postnatal liver pathophysiology. This is in line with previous studies showing that microglia can contribute to neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders8,9,46,47,48. Our data indicate that continuous exposure to a maternal HFD during gestation induces a HIF1α-dependent metabolic switch in KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, detrimentally affecting adult hepatic lipid metabolism. Unlike most maternal immune activation studies, in which cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17a influence offspring development49,50, our model does not indicate a maternal immune activation phenotype or systemic inflammation. Instead, maternal metabolites and lipids probably cross the placenta and modulate macrophage function. For instance, stearic acid, enriched in obese mice, has been proposed to reprogram macrophages via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)9,51. An intriguing question for future research is to administer defined fatty acids to pregnant dams and trace their effect on fetal KC development in a HIF1α-dependent manner.

Using the LysMCre mouse model to delete Hif1a specifically in myeloid cells excludes developmental programming of oocytes, hepatocytes and their progenitors as primary driver of FLD, as the promotor controlling expression of the Cre recombinase only becomes active during early fetal macrophage differentiation1,52. However, indirect effects via inter-organ communication, such as adipose-derived signals, cannot be ruled out. Our double fate mapper model showed that KCs remain of yolk sac origin upon maternal obesity, contrasting with diet-induced FLD models in which bone marrow-derived cells replace KCs16,17,18. Thus, in accordance with DOHaDs, KCs can serve as intergenerational messengers that sense maternal-derived factors during gestation and convey this information into a long-lasting transcriptional program during adulthood. Our transcriptomic, epigenetic and metabolic analyses demonstrate that maternal obesity functionally programs KCs, promoting lipid accumulation in neighbouring hepatocytes via persistent transcriptional changes. KC depletion experiments further confirmed this: replenishment with monocyte-derived cells from animals that never experienced a HFD rescues the developmental programming effects, providing a potential cellular target for treating FLD caused by maternal obesity. Replenishment with monocytes from maternal obesity-experienced animals did not rescue the phenotype, suggesting that neonatal monocytes or HSPCs undergo developmental programming33,34. These findings highlight the resilience of the KC niche to maternal obesity-induced programming, as the origin of KC-like cells determines FLD pathogenesis.

A previous study has shown that upon a postnatal HFD, KCs secrete pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF, with TNF inducing lipid accumulation in hepatocytes45. By contrast, in maternal obesity-induced FLD, we observed no upregulation of these particular factors. Instead, genes associated with lipid metabolism (for example, Trem2, Tyrobp, Syk and Lpr1) were upregulated, partially resembling the phenotype of hepatic lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs)17. Recent work has also shown that TREM2+ LAMs expand during injury and can originate from both resident KCs and monocyte-derived macrophages53. In our model, however, LAM-like KCs remain of yolk sac origin, suggesting that functional adaptation to lipid-rich environments, rather than a change in cellular origin, drives their phenotype. This distinction highlights the unique nature of maternal obesity-induced FLD compared with postnatal HFD models. Notably, maternal obesity upregulates apolipoproteins such as APOE and APOA1 in a HIF1α-dependent manner, aligning with previous findings linking apolipoproteins with FLD54,55.

In summary, our study establishes KCs as active players in liver metabolism, demonstrating distinct responses to a maternal-derived versus postnatal diet-derived HFD. We showed that a maternal HFD during gestation programs KCs metabolically and transcriptionally in a HIF1α-dependent manner, leading to persistent changes that promote FLD. These findings offer a therapeutic time window to manipulate the metabolic status of KCs, and thereby prevent the development of FLD in the offspring.

All investigations concerning mouse work had local approval and all procedures conformed to the guidelines from Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on protecting animals used for scientific purposes. In detail, all animal experiments were conducted according to the German law of animal protection and in agreement with the approval of the local institutional animal care committee (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz (LANUV), North Rhine-Westphalia, Az 81-02.04.2019.A146 and Az 2024-A314). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with 12-h light–dark cycle, at 21 °C, 55% relative humidity, and with food and water provided ad libitum. Animals were euthanized using liver or heart perfusion after anaesthesia injection. C57BL/6JRcc was used as the WT strain. To generate the double fate mapper Tnfrsf11aCre (ref. 56); Rosa26LSL-YFP (JAX stock #006148)57; Ms4a3FlpO;Rosa26FSF-tdT (JAX stock #032864)58, we bred Tnfrsf11aCre/+;Rosa26FSF-tdT/FSF-tdT animals with Ms4a3FlpO;Rosa26LSL-YFP/LSL-YFP animals (see Extended Data Fig. 4a for description of the Ms4a3FlpO locus). KC-DTR (Clec4fDTR/+) mice have been previously described32. All mice were originally of the C57BL/6J background and crossed to C57BL/6Jrcc for 2–5 generations. To generate Hif1aflox/flox;LysMCre/+, the Hif1aflox/flox (JAX stock #007561)59 and LysMCre/+ (JAX stock #004781)37 were used (both kept on the C57BL/6J background after import). All lines were back-crossed to their respective WT line (C57BL/6J for LysMCre/+;Hif1aflox/flox and C57BL/6Jrcc for all other lines) once per year. Mice were genotyped according to protocols provided by JAX or donating researchers. For all experiments, male mice were analysed with the exception of the double fate mapper, where both male and female mice were used, and ex vivo-isolated hepatocytes, where only young female mice were used to assure a lean and metabolically healthy state.

For WT cohorts, 3–4-week-old C57BL/6JRcc female mice were put on a CD (sniff, E15748-047) for 2 weeks. Subsequently, female mice were separated into two groups and received either a HFD (sniff, E15742-347) or a CD for 8 weeks. For metabolic assessment, the HOMA-IR was used60. Glucose was measured using GlucoCheck GOLD with stripes (11864873 and 11864933), and insulin was measured via ELISA (EMINS, Thermo Fisher). Only mice with significantly higher HOMA-IR were used to generate offspring. Females were mated with males fed with a CD overnight. The day of vaginal plug formation was estimated as embryonic developmental day 0.5 (E0.5) post-coitum. Females were always placed back in their cages with a HFD after overnight mating. All offspring were cross-fostered to females on the respective diet. The litter size was standardized to a maximum of six pups per foster mother on the day of birth. In addition, whenever possible, litters from different biological mothers were cross-fostered to the same foster mother to ensure consistency and minimize maternal variability. Cross-fostering took place also between mothers on the same diet to exclude stress-mediated effects of cross-fostering. After 3 weeks of lactation at postnatal day 21 (P21), offspring were weaned into their post-weaning cage (CD or HFD). Here offspring from maternal lean and maternal obese groups were mixed to minimize effects caused by cage-specific microbiome differences. In addition, during the post-weaning diet, bedding stemming from cages with the same diet was mixed weekly between cages (typically 10–20 cages at any time) to further reduce cage-specific effects related to the microbiome.

Mice were euthanized and used in the experiment at weeks 11–13, unless otherwise stated.

Maternal obese KC-DTR male offspring were injected at P0 with 50 ng diphtheria toxin and injected at P1 through the temporal vein under ice-induced anaesthesia with 106 bone marrow monocytes and HSPCs isolated from Rosa26mTmG mice. Bone marrow monocytes and HSPCs were isolated as following: Rosa26mTmG mice were killed through cervical dislocation, and their tibias and femurs from the hindlimbs were freed. Bone marrow was flushed out with DMEM (Pan Biotech) and filtered through a 70-μm strainer on ice. Cells were then blocked with FACS buffer (0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS) containing 2% rat serum and stained with biotinylated antibodies (anti-Ly6G, CD19, CD3, Ter119, Nkp45 and F4/80) for 30 min at 4 °C. Monocytes and HSPCs were then negatively selected using MojoSort Streptavidin Nanobeads (BioLegend) following the manufacturer's manual.

Adult mice were anaesthetized and perfused with ice-cold PBS. P0 mice were killed by decapitation. For flow cytometry analysis of hepatic myeloid cells, 200–300 mg of adult or half of a P0 liver was collected, cut into small pieces and incubated in a digestion mix (PBS containing 1 mg ml−1 collagenase D (11088858001, Roche), 100 U ml−1 DNase I (DN25, Sigma-Aldrich), 2.4 mg ml−1 of dispase (17105041, Gibco) and 3% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C before mechanical disruption through a 100-μm filter. The cell suspension was diluted in 3 ml of FACS buffer (0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS) and centrifuged at 50g for 3 min to remove hepatocytes. Then, the supernatant containing myeloid cells was collected and centrifuged at 370g for 7 min at 4 °C. For bone marrow, one leg was isolated, and both the tibia and the femur were cleaned from surrounding tissues and cut at the ends. The bones were flushed with 5 ml of ice-cold FACS buffer. Cells were centrifuged at 370g for 7 min at 4 °C. Pellet was resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (155 mM NH4Cl, 12 mM NaHCO3 and 0.1 mM EDTA) and incubated for 3 min on ice. Then, 5 ml FACS buffer was added, cells were resuspended and centrifuged at 370g for 7 min at 4 °C. Cell pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer containing purified anti-CD16/32 and 2% rat serum (liver) or 2% rat serum only (bone marrow) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were immune-stained with antibody mixes for 30 min at 4 °C. The complete list of antibodies used can be found in Supplementary Table 8. Data were acquired with FACSymphony A5 (BD Biosciences) or LSRII and analysed in FlowJo Software. For sorting of KCs and hepatocytes, liver cell suspension was prepared as described above with the following modifications: first, 1 ml twice-concentrated digestion mix was used for tissue digestion; second, digestion was performed at room temperature and centrifugation at 50g for 3 min was omitted to retain hepatocytes; and last, all steps were performed with buffers containing 1 mM of flavopiridol (F3055, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were stained by antibody mixes and sorted using FACS ARIA III cell sorter (BD Biosciences) directly into 500 μl lysis buffer (79306, Qiagen). For KC metabolic flow cytometry assays, single-cell suspensions were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (1%) and rat serum (2%) in FACS buffer, followed by surface marker staining for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and then permeabilized for 15 min with PBS supplemented with 0.4% Triton X-100 (X100, Sigma-Aldrich). Intracellular staining was performed for 1 h at 4 °C. Intracellular antibodies were conjugated in-house using lightning-link conjugation kits (Abcam) as previously described26. Cells were analysed on an ID7000 7-laser Spectral Cell Analyzer (Sony Cooperation).

For neutral lipid staining, cryo-preserved liver blocks were cut at 10 µm thickness and dried for 1 h at room temperature. Lipid staining was performed using an Oil-red-O Stain Kit (O0625, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were then stained with haematoxylin for 5–10 min to visualize nuclei, rinsed with distilled water and mounted with Kaiser's glycerol gelatine (pre-heated at 55 °C; 6474.1, Carl Roth). Images were taken with an Axio Lab.A1 microscope (Zeiss). For ORO staining quantification, 2–10 images of each sample with a ×40 objective were taken and quantification was performed using QuPath software (v0.5.1). For haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, paraffin-embedded liver blocks were cut at 5 µm thickness and heated for 1 h at 65 °C before staining. Sections were deparaffinized by two steps of xylol and descending series of alcohol and rinsed in distilled water. Next, sections were stained with haematoxylin solution for 1.5 min and neutralized by running tap water, followed by alcoholic eosin staining for 2 min. Sections were then dehydrated by an ascending series of alcohol and two steps of xylol and mounted with Entellan (1.07961.0100, Millipore). Images were taken with the Axio Lab.A1 microscope. Quantification of droplet adiposity in liver cells in H&E-stained histological sections was performed manually using a light microscope without the support of digital imaging or software tools. From each section, 10 random high-power fields were selected at ×10 magnification to ensure a representative selection of liver parenchyma while avoiding areas of artefacts or tissue damage. Hepatocytes were analysed for the presence of lipid droplets. All hepatocytes in each selected field were counted and classified as either normal (without lipid droplets) or lipid laden (with lipid droplets recognizable as intracellular vacuoles). The percentage of lipid-laden hepatocytes was calculated for each field by dividing the number of hepatocytes with lipid droplets by the total number of hepatocytes in the field and multiplying the result by 100. The percentages of all analysed fields were averaged to obtain a representative value for each sample. For immunofluorescence staining, cryo-preserved liver blocks were cut at 10 µm thickness, dried for 1 h at room temperature and permeabilized with PBS-T (0.4% Triton X-100; X100, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, tissue was blocked with PBS-T containing 2% BSA (37525, Thermo Scientific) and 2% donkey serum (D9663, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by primary antibody staining overnight at 4 °C, and secondary antibodies hosted in donkey for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (42281, BioLegend). Immunofluorescence images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM Airyscan 880 microscope (Zeiss) and processed with Fiji61.

Livers were isolated from ice-cold PBS-perfused mice and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ten milligrams were homogenized in ddH2O using a Precellys homogenizer (Peqlab Biotechnology). For lipid extraction, 50 µl of the homogenate was added to 500 µl extraction mix (CHCl3:MeOH 1:5 containing the following internal standards: 210 pmol phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)(31:1), 396 pmol phosphatidylcholine (PC)(31:1), 98 pmol phosphatidylserine(31:1), 84 pmol phosphatidylinositol(34:0), 56 pmol phosphatidic acid(31:1), 51 pmol phosphatidylglycerol(28:0), 28 pmol cardiolipin(56:0), 39 pmol lysophosphatidic acid(17:0), 35 pmol lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)(17:1), 38 pmol lysophosphatidylethanolamine(17:0), 32 pmol ceramide(17:0)), 99 pmol sphingomyelin(17:0), 55 pmol glucosylceramide(12:0), 14 pmol monosialodihexosylganglioside(18:0-D3), 339 pmol triacylglycerol(50:1-d4), 111 pmol cholesteryl ester(17:1), 64 pmol diacylglycerol(31:1), 103 pmol monoacylglycerol(17:1), 724 pmol cholesterol(D6) and 45 pmol carnitine(15:0)) and subsequently sonicated for 2 min and centrifugated at 20,000g for 2 min. The supernatant was collected into a new tube, and 200 µl chloroform and 800 µl 1% AcOH water were added. The sample was shaken and centrifuged for 2 min at 20,000g. The upper aqueous phase was discarded and the lower phase was transferred into a new tube and evaporated in a speed vacuum concentrator (45 °C at 10 min). Spray buffer (500 µl of 8:5:1 2-propanol:MeOH:H2O and 10 mM ammonium acetate) was added to the sample and sonicated for 5 min, infused at 10 µl min−1 into a Thermo Q Exactive Plus spectrometer equipped with the heated electrospray ionization II ion source for direct infusion lipidomics. MS1 spectra (resolution of 280,000) were recorded in 100-m/z windows from 250 to 1,200 m/z (positive) and 200 to 1,700 m/z (negative) followed by recording tandem mass spectrometry spectra (resolution of 70,000) by data-independent acquisition in 1-m/z windows from 200 to 1,200 (positive) and 200 to 1,700 (negative) m/z. Raw files were converted to .mzml files and imported into and analysed by LipidXplorer software (v1.2.8.1)62 using custom mfql files to identify sample lipids and internal standards.

Raw measurements of the lipidome were quantified in relation to internal standards measured simultaneously on the same instrument. The resulting values were normalized by the amount of tissue to obtain measurements in pmol mg−1. All lipid species that remained constant across all samples were removed from the dataset. In addition, species belonging to the triacylglycerol class with odd numbers of double bonds were excluded, as they were unlikely to originate from mice. This resulted in a set of 19 lipid classes: cholesteryl ester, ceramide, diacylglycerol, dihexosylceramide, hexosylceramide, LPC, ether-linked LPC, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, monoacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, PC, ether-linked PC, PE, ether-linked PE, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, sphingomyelin, unsaturated fatty acyl tails of triacylglycerol (unsat) and saturated fatty acyl tails of triacylglycerol (sat). Following the selection process, the dataset consisted of 476 metabolites for C57BL/6Jrcc mice (69 dropped) and 443 metabolites for the HIF1α model (31 dropped). Within each sample, the species belonging to the same class were aggregated by calculating the mean. The results were then summarized by computing the mean per condition. Log2 fold changes were calculated by comparing each condition to the control condition CDMCDLCD. For each lipid class, the conditions were assessed for significant deviations from the control condition using the lm function in R. Subsequently, a hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on the resulting dataset, both row wise and column wise, based on the Euclidean distance with complete linkage. The colour legend for the HIF1α mouse model is not evenly spaced around zero. This deviation arose from significant changes with low-effect sizes. To still indicate the direction of change, the space around zero was adjusted accordingly. The colour histogram shown represents the entire set of lipid species, not just the selected species shown in the main figure. The value of 1 was added to the data before performing the logarithmic transformation (log2) and performing PCA.

The Immune Monitoring 48-Plex Mouse ProcartaPlex Panel (EPX480-20834-901, Invitrogen) was used. Of sera, 25 µl was thawed and analytes were evaluated using Luminex xMAP system. All reagents were prepared and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytokines that were below the detection threshold in more than 80% of the samples were not plotted.

The values displayed within the heatmap are log10 + 1 transformed and ordered by decreasing overall mean.

cDNA library for sequencing was prepared as described in the SMART-Seq2 protocol63. The mRNA was extracted and primed utilizing poly-T oligonucleotides and converted into cDNA by SMART reverse transcription. Pre-amplification was performed by SMART ISPCR, followed by fragmentation using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina), amplification and indexing. Library fragments were then selected by size (300–400 bp) and purified using SPRIBeads (Beckman-Coulter). The Agilent high-sensitivity D5000 assay was used to measure the size distribution of cDNA libraries on a Tapestation 4200 system (Agilent). Quantifying cDNA libraries was performed using a Qubit high-sensitivity dsDNA assay (Thermo Fisher). Sequencing was performed using a 75-bp single-end setup on the NextSeq500 system (Illumina), applying NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit (v2.5; Illumina). Library fragments were then selected by size (300–400 bp) and purified using SPRIBeads (Beckman-Coulter). The Agilent high-sensitivity D5000 assay was used to measure the size distribution of cDNA libraries on a Tapestation 4200 system (Agilent). The cDNA libraries were quantified using a high-sensitivity dsDNA assay (Qubit). To quantify the abundances of transcripts from the bulk RNA-seq data, Kallisto pseudo alignment was applied64.

The raw transcriptome files were prepared for Kallisto import to DESeq2 using the genecode annotation M16 (https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/release_M16.html) to correct for library size based on the provided average transcript length. Outliers (eight from the C57BL/6Jrcc dataset and three from the Hif1a dataset) were identified on the basis quality assessment and filtering of low-quality samples. The set of genes was further refined to include only protein-coding genes that were non-constant across all present samples. Low-expressed genes, defined as those with less than 10 counts in 25% of the samples, were also removed. PCA was performed on the variance-stabilized counts. DESeq2 (ref. 65) analysis was conducted to identify DEGs within each cell type. The default settings in DESeq2 were used. A gene was called differentially expressed if its corresponding Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value was less than 0.1 for the tested contrast. For the KC P0 DEGs subjected to transcription factor inference analysis, the absolute LFC threshold was set to 2. The DEGs were separated into two sets based on the sign of the LFC. Each set of DEGs was subjected to an over-representation analysis to identify enriched GO terms, HALLMARK pathways and KEGG pathways using the respective functions in clusterProfiler66. To reduce observed redundancy in the GO terms, the ‘simplify' function in clusterProfiler was used, which calculates the similarity among enriched terms based on their information content and selects a representative term with the lowest adjusted P value67. The universe for the over-representation analysis consisted of all genes used for the differential expression analysis. For the ligand–receptor analysis, DEGs with an absolute LFC greater than 2 in the KC set were subsetted to include ligands recorded in the CellTalk database68. For the hepatocyte dataset, all expressed genes (more than 10 counts in Hif1a-WT or Hif1a-KO HFDMCD conditions; not necessarily differentially expressed) were subsetted to include recorded receptors within the same database. Interactions between differentially expressed ligands from KCs and expressed receptors from hepatocytes were extracted from the CellTalk database and plotted. The order of ligands was based on their LFC from lowest to highest. A co-expression network analysis using hCoCena25 was conducted on the filtered and DESeq2 normalized counts, following the provided showcase Notebook25. hCoCena calculates pairwise correlations among the top most varying genes (the number needs to be user-specified) and constructs a network where vertices represent genes with at least one edge characterized by a correlation above a specified threshold. Here hCoCena was performed using the top 5,000 genes as input and all edges were kept with a correlation above 0.7. The resulting network, with 4,214 nodes and 286,853 edges, was then clustered using the Leiden algorithm69. Clustering was performed with 100 iterations. Each node that was advised to more than three clusters during the process was disregarded in the proceeding cluster analysis. The identified gene sets were summarized using Group Fold Change25 for each condition and displayed on a heatmap. Each cluster set was subjected to an over-representation analysis, with the hCoCena-input genes specified as the universe for testing. Manually selected terms from GO, KEGG and HALLMARK sets are displayed for each cluster to avoid term cluttering. For selected enriched terms, their intersection with the cluster genes was recovered, namely, ‘oxidative phosphorylation' with turquoise and lightgreen, ‘glycolysis' and ‘cell activation involved in immune response' with steelblue. The resulting set of genes was further manually reduced. The mean expression values for those intersectional genes were displayed and scaled across each condition. The columns were hierarchically clustered on the basis of the Euclidean distance with complete linkage. Transcription factor inference analysis was conducted using the CollecTRI38 framework, which integrates information from multiple sources, including RegNetwork70, ChEA3 (ref. 71), Pathway Commons72 and DoRothEA73. Within this analysis, a linear model was used to estimate the transcription factor activity. The model predicts the value of the DEGs solely based on the interaction weights between transcription factors and their respective target genes derived from CollecTRI. The final score was the t-value of the slope of the fitted model. A positive value indicates an active transcription factor. This analysis was conducted using decoupler's74 functionality.

Nuclei were isolated from approximately 50 mg of snap-frozen adult liver tissue to enable simultaneous snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, capturing both transcriptional profiles and chromatin accessibility. Nuclei were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Kit (1000283, 10X Genomics). In detail, snap-frozen liver tissue was first cut on dry-ice into small pieces and homogenized with a pestle in homogenization buffer containing 320 mM sucrose, 5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM Mg-acetate, 10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 0.2 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs), 1 mM flavopiridol and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (ITW Reagents) in nuclease-free water. Homogenate was then passed through a 70-μM cell strainer and mixed with equal volume of gradient medium containing 50% OptiPrep (StemCell Technologies), 5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM Mg-acetate, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (ITW Reagents) in nuclease-free water. Diluted homogenate was slowly laid atop a cushion (75% of the volume of diluted homogenate) containing 29% OptiPrep, 77.5 mM KCl, 15.5 mM MgCl2, 31 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 129.2 mM sucrose in UltraPure H2O and centrifuged with low acceleration and maximum deceleration at 10,000g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in 1X PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.2 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs) and 1 mM flavopiridol, stained with 7-AAD and purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using FACS ARIA III (BD Biosciences) for high-quality, monoploid and 7-AAD nuclei. For nuclei permeabilization, approximately 500,000 sorted nuclei were incubated for 2 min in a 0.1× lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.01% digitonin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% BSA and 1 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor, with 1 μM flavopiridol in nuclease-free water). Following permeabilization and washing steps, nuclei concentration was adjusted to 5,000 nuclei per microlitre in ice-cold 1× nuclei buffer (2000153/2000207, 10X Genomics) and were incubated in a transposition mix containing a transposase, allowing adapter sequences to be added to the ends of DNA fragments. Furthermore, 16,000 nuclei were used for analysis with the Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Kit (PN-1000230, 10X Genomics) and Gel Beads in Emulsion (GEMs) using the Chromium Next GEM Chip J Single Cell Kit. After GEM reverse transcription (GEM-RT) cleanup, pre-amplification of the sample was performed, producing material for both ATAC library construction and cDNA amplification for gene expression library construction. During the reverse transcription reaction, cDNA tagging was achieved with 16-nucleotide barcodes and 10-nucleotide molecular identifiers. The pre-amplified product was split into two aliquots: 40 μl for ATAC library construction and 35 μl for further cDNA amplification. For snRNA-seq library preparation, 25% of the total cDNA was used to generate gene expression (GEX) libraries. Libraries were prepared and sequenced according to the manufacturer's protocols: snATAC libraries used the 10X Genomics Single Index N Set, and snRNA-seq libraries used the Dual Index TT Set A. Pooled and barcoded libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 system with P3 flow cells, achieving an average depth of 30,000 reads per nucleus for both snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq libraries. The sequencing quality was assessed using FastQC (v0.12.1) executed within a containerized environment provided by biocontainers using Podman. All files passed initial quality assessment. Following assessment, Cell Ranger ARC (v2.0.0; 10X Genomics) was used for simultaneous alignment and quantification of both modalities. The cellranger-arc count pipeline was run according to the manufacturer's instructions using the 10X Genomics-provided reference dataset refdata-cellranger-arc-mm10-2020-A-2.0.0, which is based on the mm10 genome assembly and including introns. The automatically obtained quality assessment alerted for both conditions that the amount of valid ATAC barcodes was at 54% (ideally more than 80%). Despite the low proportion, both datasets were used because other critical ATAC quality metrics, such as fragment count and enrichment scores, met acceptable thresholds. Single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data were processed using mainly the Seurat and Signac packages in R. Both modalities were extracted from the 10X Genomics ‘filtered feature matrix file', in which count data were used for additional filtering of low-quality cells, before using MACS3 to perform the peak calling within the remaining cells to reduce computational time. Applied thresholds were: cells with RNA counts below 500, number of genes less than 200 or more than 2,500, and mitochondrial RNA content above 1% (as for single-nucleus sequencing, we expected none). Resulting peaks were also used for filtering of low-quality cells. Applied thresholds were: ATAC counts below 1,000, nucleosome signal more than 2 and transcription start site enrichment less than 1. In addition, peaks were removed that overlapped with non-standard chromosomes: genomic blacklist regions. The preprocessing led to 8,197 total cells for CDMCDLCD and 5,017 cells for HFDMCDLCD. Each RNA-seq dataset was pre-processed within each condition before integration using SCTransform, regressing out the percentage of mitochondrial DNA. The integration of RNA and ATAC data across conditions followed the outline from Kim et al.75. Accordingly, RNA data integration began with the selection of 3,000 integration features using SelectIntegrationFeatures in Seurat. The datasets were prepared for integration with PrepSCTIntegration, and integration anchors were identified using FindIntegrationAnchors with SCTransform (SCT) normalization. The anchors were then used to integrate the datasets across conditions via IntegrateData. ATAC count integration started by creating a feature matrix for each condition based on a unified peak set that was shared across conditions. Dimensionality reduction for ATAC data relied on latent semantic indexing, which included feature selection of most variable peaks, transformation of peak counts and singular value decomposition. To improve the integration, Harmony was applied (RunHarmony). Harmony aligns datasets by projecting them into a shared low-dimensional space while minimizing the effects of batch-specific biases. For the final integration across modalities, multimodal neighbours were identified by combining RNA-based PCA and ATAC-based Harmony embeddings (FindMultiModalNeighbors) across 50 dimensions for each modality, without the first dimension for Harmony, as commonly done, aiming for additional batch correction. Clusters were identified using the weighted nearest neighbour similarity graph (FindClusters) with a resolution of 0.5. This approach allowed the simultaneous integration of RNA and ATAC data for both conditions while leveraging the complementary information from both modalities. Cluster-specific marker genes were identified by calculating differential expression for each cluster using FindAllMarkers in Seurat. Markers were filtered based on minimum expression percentage (0.10), minimum differential expression percentage (0.20) and log fold-change threshold (0.20), retaining only positive markers. Cell-type annotation was based on the expression of a curated gene set within the identified markers. Subclustering was performed on the cells annotated as KCs from the integrated dataset. Again, multimodal neighbours were identified (FindMultiModalNeighbors) using PCA for RNA and Harmony for ATAC, followed by UMAP for dimensionality reduction (RunUMAP) and clustering (FindClusters), as done for the dataset using all cell types. Subclusters with fewer than 50 cells were excluded due to low numbers, and markers for each remaining cluster were characterized using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat with the number of neighbours set to 60. Subcluster characterization was based on the expression of a curated gene set within the identified markers. To analyse intercellular communication involving the differing KC subclusters to hepatocytes, a CellChat analysis was performed. The analysis followed CellChat instructions for comparisons and analysis of multiple datasets. Normalized RNA expression data were used to define communication networks between KC subclusters and other cell populations. Overexpressed genes and interactions were identified for each condition, identifying 1,366 (CDMCDLCD) and 1,458 (HFDMCDLCD) highly variable ligand–receptor pairs subsequently used for signalling inference. Communication probabilities were computed using the 10% truncated mean for calculating the gene expression per cell group. Interactions with fewer than ten participating cells were filtered out to ensure robustness. The KC-specific communication networks were compared across conditions using rankNet function. A paired Wilcoxon test was performed to determine whether there was a significant difference of the signalling information flow between two conditions. Potential activated transcription factors were investigated using the package decouplR. For the analysis, the transformed RNA-count data were subsetted to the union of DEGs between the KC subclusters. The resulting set was subjected to the unified linear model to identify potential regulators (transcription factors). Only regulators were tested, which had at least ten known targets among the union differentially expressed set. According to decouplR's vignette, the resulting score matrix, representing regulations strength, was scaled and centred. The 25% trimmed mean activity per cluster for each condition is displayed to provide a robust central tendency measure.

Metabolomics analysis was conducted using data obtained from Metabolon. The Metabolon platform performed preprocessing steps on the data, including imputation of missing values and natural log transformation. In summary, the raw peak area data were median scaled per metabolite and then normalized by the value of the extracted volume. It was further rescaled to have a median equal to 1. Missing values for each metabolite were imputed with the minimum value observed across all samples. Finally, a natural logarithm transformation was applied to the metabolomic data, as it typically exhibited a log-normal distribution. For the PCA, the data were subjected to batch correction based on the day of the experiment, which was identified as a significant source of variance in the initial PCA analysis. The identified effect was treated as a batch factor in the ComBat function of the sva package76 for batch correction. The corrected data were then used for PCA analysis. To identify metabolites with significant effects of diet, genotypes or their interaction on their respective levels, an ANOVA was performed. Specifically, a contrast77 was applied within the ANOVA to compare metabolite levels between maternal obese (HFDMCDLCD) and maternal lean (CDMCDLCD) conditions. The resulting set of 129 metabolites with significant raw P values was further analysed using Metaboanalyst (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/)78 for pathway over-representation analysis. The HMDB IDs provided by Metabolon were used as input, resulting in a reduction to 111 metabolites due to missing labels. Furthermore, mapping to Metaboanalyst failed for ten additional metabolites. Default parameters were used for all remaining settings, except for choosing Mus musculus (KEGG) as the pathway library and applying out-degree centrality as the topology analysis method.

Eight-to-ten-week-old chow diet-fed C57BL/6JRcc female mice were used to isolate hepatocytes. Therefore, a two-step collagenase liver perfusion was performed. First, 7 min after injecting heparin-sodium (Ratiopharm; 30 units per gram body weight), mice were anaesthetized with ketamine–xylazine. Next, a 26 G indwelling venous catheter (0.62 mm × 19 mm; 391379, BD Neoflon Pro) was inserted into the portal vein. Perfusion was initiated with 25 ml Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.5 mM EGTA (pH 7.4) at a rate of 2.5 ml min−1 using a peristaltic pump, and subsequently with 25 ml collagenase buffer (William's Medium E, P04-29510, Pan-Biotech) supplemented with 3.6 mM CaCl2, 0.1 U ml−1 collagenase NB46 (17465, Serva Electrophoresis) and 10 mM HEPES at 37 °C at a rate of 1.25 ml min−1. Liver cells were released by gentle swirling with forceps into 40 ml suspension medium (William's Medium E supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 units per millilitre penicillin and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin). Hepatocytes were pelleted at 50g for 3 min at room temperature. The pellet containing the hepatocytes was resuspended in fresh suspension medium and plated on collagen-coated 24-well plates for co-culture experiments with KCs at a density of 30,000 cells per well or on collagen-coated 96-well plates for factor screening experiments at a density of 5,000 cells per well. To ensure a viable hepatocyte culture, cells were pre-incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow for attachment. Thereafter, the medium was replaced with fresh suspension medium containing LD540 (0.02 µg ml−1) and vitamin C (1 µg ml−1) for live-cell imaging using the IncuCyte SX5 (Sartorius). To isolate KCs, 11–15-week-old mice were perfused with the same method as isolating hepatocytes but without the in vivo digestion step. After perfusion, liver was minced and digested in a digestion mix (PBS containing 1 mg ml−1 collagenase D, 100 U ml−1 DNase I, 2.4 mg ml−1 dispase and 3% FCS) for 30 min at 37 °C without agitation. Digested liver was further disrupted with gentle pipetting, filtered through a 100-µm cell strainer and centrifuged at 400g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellet was washed with ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA) and centrifuged at 50g for 3 min at 4 °C to remove hepatocytes. The supernatant was then further filtered and washed with FACS buffer to obtain a clean, single-cell suspension and centrifuged at 400g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was then blocked with 1% anti-mouse CD16/32 (101302, BioLegend) and 5% rat serum (C13SDZ, Bio-Rad) for 10 min at 4 °C followed by incubation with biotinylated CD11b antibody (101204, BioLegend) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed, incubated with pre-washed streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (480016, BioLegend), washed and enriched in a 12-well untreated cell-culture dish mounted atop a magnet. Enriched cells were abundantly washed in FACS buffer and subsequently counted using a Neubauer chamber. Cells (3 × 105) were plated onto a 13-mm diameter, untreated glass coverslip (VWR; co-culture experiments) or 2–4 × 106 cells onto an untreated glass slide (Fisher Scientific; proteomics experiments). Cells were attached for 2 h in macrophage medium (DMEM, containing 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 10% FBS and 1 mM sodium pyruvate) in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After attachment, cells were abundantly washed with PBS. Macrophages on coverslips were used for co-culture experiments as described below. Macrophages for proteomics experiments were scraped off in PBS, centrifuged at 400g at 4 °C for 5 min to obtain pellets, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and further processed for proteomics as described below.

For hepatocyte–KC co-culture experiments, a plastic ring (8 mm in height × 15 mm in diameter) was placed in each well of hepatocytes seeded as described above. A glass coverslip attached with approximately 3 × 104 KCs (resulted from initially seeded 3 × 105 CD11b magnet-enriched cells), isolated from either CDMCDLCD or HFDMCDLCD mice, was positioned upside-down on the plastic ring. LD540 was then added, and signal was recorded by live imaging hourly for 4 h in the IncuCyte SX5, with each mouse represented by multiple replicates and nine fields of view (FOVs) per well. For treatment of hepatocytes with APOE or APOA1, APOE (1 µg ml−1 recombinant mouse APOE; ab226314, Abcam) or APOA1 (2 µg ml−1 recombinant mouse APOA1; 50918-M08H, Sino Biological) was pre-incubated with hepatocyte medium at 37 °C for 30 min. The pre-incubated medium was then added to hepatocytes already containing 1 volume of hepatocyte medium. TNF (0.1 µg ml−1 recombinant mouse TNF; 130-101-688, Miltenyi)-treated hepatocytes were used as positive controls. Non-treated hepatocytes served as negative controls. For each mouse, three replicates were prepared, LD540 was then added and the signal was recorded by live imaging hourly for 4 h in the IncuCyte SX5, with four FOVs imaged per well. The LD540-integrated intensity was quantified by multiplying µm2 per FOV using the IncuCyte SX5 analysis software. A cell area filter was applied to ensure single-cell detection. Out-of-focus FOVs were excluded from analysis, as indicated by red labelling in the raw data spreadsheet. For co-culture data, the mean integrated LD540 signal per mouse was calculated following outlier removal by the interquartile range method. Statistical tests included the Shapiro–Wilk test for normality, Levene's test for variance homogeneity, and two-sample t-tests to compare CD versus HFD conditions at each time point. For screening data, mean LD540 measurements were averaged across replicates and normalized to the control measurement mean for each mouse after 3 h and 4 h in the co-culture experiment, and after 2 h in the screening assay.

KCs were isolated and pelleted as described above. Pelleted cells were thawed and lysed in urea lysis buffer (8 M urea and 50 mM Tris (pH8)), DNA was sheared with 28 U ml−1 benzonase (Sigma), and disulfide bridges were reduced and alkylated with 10 mM Bond-Breaker TCEP solution (Thermo) and 30 mM chloroacetamide. Non-dissolved cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000g for 10 min, and clean supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Protein concentrations were determined with the Pierce 660 nm Protein-Assay-kit (Thermo). Of protein input, 25 µg was used for digestion in 2 M urea (diluted with 50 mM Tris (pH 8)) with a trypsin–LysC mixture (1:50 (enzyme:protein)) at 800 rpm for 16 h. Protein digestion was stopped with 1% formic acid, peptides were desalted on in-house-produced SDB-RPS Stage Tips and loaded onto EvoTip Pure trap columns following the manufacturers' protocol.

A liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry system consisting of an Evosep One liquid chromatograph (Evosep) and a timsTOF Pro 2 mass spectrometer (Bruker) was used for peptide separation and acquisition. Reversed-phase separation was performed on an Aurora Elite analytical column (IonOpticks) using the 40 samples-per-day separation method with a 31-min gradient preprogrammed on the liquid chromatography system. Eluting peptides were on-line transferred into the mass spectrometry via a CaptiveSpray ionisation source operated at a constant voltage of 1.5 kV. We used the data-independent acquisition parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation mode with the TIMS analyser operating with 100-ms accumulation and ramping times and a 100% duty cycle. Peptide ranges were limited to a mass-to-charge range of 350–1,100 m/z and an ion mobility range of 0.63–1.45 Vs cm−2 with 12 pydiAID-optimized data-independent acquisition parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation windows of variable widths79. We increased collisional energies stepwise from 24 eV at 0.70 Vs cm−2 and 49 eV at 1.35 Vs cm−2 for peptide fragmentation. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository80 with the dataset identifier PXD058285. Spectral library prediction, peptide identification and protein quantification were performed in library-free mode using DIA-NN (v1.8.1)81. The SwissProt Mus musculus database was used for predicted spectral library (downloaded from UniProt: 2022-12-28). In silico digestion was set to trypsin as the digestion enzyme with a maximal one miss-cleavage and cysteine carbamidomethylation set as fixed modifications. Precursor peptides were filtered at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 1%. The match-between-runs option was enabled. Using the DIA-NN main output table, we performed protein group intensity normalizations with the MaxLFQ algorithm82 implemented in the DIA-NN R-package. Only proteotypic peptides were considered for quantification. Statistical analysis was performed in the Perseus software suite (v1.6.15)83. Protein group label-free quantification intensities were log2 transformed and filtered for protein groups with data completeness in at least one condition. Missing values were replaced by random value drawing from 1.8 standard deviations downshifted and 0.3 standard deviations broad normal distributions. Significantly regulated proteins between any conditions were identified by ANOVA multiple-sample testing (S0 = 0.5, FDR < 0.1 with 250 randomizations) and all proteins were z-score normalized. For visualization, the dataset was summarized by taking the mean over all samples per group, namely, WT and KO in maternal lean, as well as WT and KO in maternal obese. The summarized data were objected to k-means clustering using k = 6 to obtain groups of proteins with varying expression patterns across samples from which several interesting representatives were chosen to be highlighted.

Statistical assessment was performed with one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons method, the Kruskal–Wallis test, the unpaired Student's t-test, the Mann–Whitney test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test, depending on the dataset, and following an assessment of normality. R-studio and Prism were used for the statistical evaluation and visualization. Statistical significance was represented via the probability (P value) as follows: not significant (NS) > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001. All bar graphs represent mean values. In all of the aforementioned analyses, PCA was performed using the prcomp function in R on centred data. Significance levels were consistently set at P < 0.05. Raw P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate method and considered significant if the adjusted P < 0.1. The analysis was implemented using R (v4.2.0)84 and Bioconductor (v3.15)85. Detailed information about every package used, including all dependencies, along with their respective versions, can be found in the renv.lock file located in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/LeaSeep/MaternalObesity) generated with the renv package86.

Metrics details

Sexual reproduction relies on meiotic chromosome pairing to form bivalents, a process that is complicated in polyploids owing to the presence of multiple subgenomes1. Uneven ploidy mostly results in sterility due to unbalanced chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, pentaploid dogroses (Rosa sect. Caninae; 2n = 5x = 35) achieve stable sexual reproduction through a unique mechanism: 14 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted biparentally, while the remaining 21 chromosomes are maternally inherited as univalents2,3. Despite being studied for over a century, the role of centromeres in this process has remained unclear. Here we analyse haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies for three pentaploid dogroses. Subgenome phasing revealed a bivalent-forming subgenome with two highly homozygous chromosome sets and three divergent subgenomes lacking homologous partners, therefore explaining their meiotic behaviour. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny, phylogenetic relationships and centromere composition indicate that the subgenomes originated from two divergent clades of the genus Rosa. Pollen genome analysis shows that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins form bivalents, supporting multiple origins of dogroses and highlighting variation in subgenome contributions. We reveal that bivalent-forming centromeres are enriched with ATHILA retrotransposons, contrasting with larger tandem-repeat-based centromeres mainly found in univalents. This centromere structural bimodality possibly contributes to univalent drive during female meiosis. Our findings provide insights into the unique reproductive strategies of dogroses, advancing our understanding of genome evolution, centromere diversity and meiotic mechanisms in organisms with asymmetrical inheritance systems.

Whole-genome duplication or polyploidy is a frequent phenomenon across the phylogeny of land plants4. Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction, ensuring the reduction in genomic content in gametes through chromosome pairing and exchanges between non-sister chromatids, that is, crossovers5,6. Polyploidy often results from meiotic failure, that is, the generation of unreduced gametes, which poses challenges to meiotic chromosome pairing and the maintenance of sexual reproduction1,7. Thus, polyploids often skip sexual reproduction by promoting vegetative propagation8 or apomixis9. However, in many allopolyploids, in which distinct subgenomes come into contact through hybridization, recombination partners from homologous chromosomes (same parental subgenome) are preferred, while recombination between homoeologous chromosomes (different parental subgenomes) is suppressed10,11.

The genus Rosa, which comprises approximately 150 species, is a typical example of evolution through frequent polyploidy and hybridization events12, which is also reflected by the large variety of cultivated roses with a long breeding history that includes both processes. The genus comprises two major clades, the Rosa and allies clade and the Synstylae and allies clade with subg. Hulthemia, subg. Hesperhodos and sect. Pimpinellifoliae as the basalmost splits12,13. Available genomes from diploid roses of sect. Synstylae14,15,16 and sect. Rosa17 revealed high levels of synteny, enabling comparative studies in this taxonomically difficult genus. Studies on tetraploid cut roses (Rosa hybrida) undergoing regular meiosis have shown that most genomic markers were recombined freely from all four chromosome sets, but preferential recombination between chromosomes and even chromosome arms vary18,19.

Within the Synstylae clade, allopolyploid dogroses (Rosa sect. Caninae (DC.) Ser.) exhibit a unique reproductive strategy known as Canina meiosis, in which the selective chromosome pairing results in a mixed mode of inheritance—combining biparental transmission of bivalents and uniparental transmission of univalents within the same nucleus20,21. First observed in the early twentieth century, this mechanism is most common in pentaploid dogroses (2n = 5x = 35), in which the male and female parents contribute 7 and 28 chromosomes, respectively, to the zygote2,3,22,23. During meiosis, 14 chromosomes form 7 bivalents, while the other 21 chromosomes remain as univalents. Bivalent-forming chromosomes from two highly homozygous sets are transmitted to both sperm and egg cells, whereas univalents are inherited exclusively through the egg cell and excluded from pollen grains, restoring pentaploidy in the offspring through the fusion of haploid male and tetraploid female gametes24,25,26,27 (Fig. 1a). Despite extensive study, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying this asymmetric inheritance remain poorly understood.

a, The known sexual reproduction of the pentaploid R. canina (2n = 5x = 35). Different chromosome sets are represented by one chromosome each. During Canina meiosis2,3,22,23, two chromosome sets form bivalents (dark grey and red asterisks) during meiosis and are transmitted through both pollen and egg cells24,25,26. The remaining three sets form univalents (lighter grey) and are transmitted through the egg cell only24,25,26. Diakinesis of male meiosis I (n = 15) of R. canina is shown on the left. Scale bar, 10 µm. b, GENESPACE synteny and phylogenetic relationships of the five chromosome sets of R. canina and their close diploid relatives R. chinensis (sect. Synstylae) and R. rugosa (sect. Rosa) with a dated phylogenetic tree constructed using 16,372 orthologous genes on the left. Each colour indicates synteny to each R. chinensis chromosome, which was used as reference to name the R. canina chromosomes. c,d, Unrooted maximum-likelihood phylogenies of the homoeologous R. canina chromosomes and chromosomes from the respective linkage groups of the diploid species R. chinensis (sect. Synstylae) and R. rugosa (sect. Rosa) based on alignments of whole-chromosome sequences. The phylogeny of synteny group 1 chromosomes is shown in c. Synteny groups 2–7 are shown in d. Filled chromosomes refer to subgenomes of R. canina belonging to the Synstylae clade (violet/light blue) and the Rosa clade (dark/light orange). Chromosomes from the diploid roses are indicated by hatching. e, Synteny and rearrangement analyses (SyRI) of the R. canina genome assembly. Pairwise comparisons of the synteny of all R. canina subgenomes (S1_h1/S1_h2, S2, R3 and R4) are juxtaposed against the corresponding chromosomes (chr.) of R. chinensis and R. rugosa. Only synteny blocks and rearrangement blocks greater than 50 kb in length are shown.

Bivalent-forming and univalent chromosomes are thought to have originated from multiple ancient hybridization events28,29,30. Phylogenetic studies based on maternally inherited plastids suggest that dogroses are polyphyletic within the Synstylae clade, with subsects. Rubigineae and Caninae are separated by species exhibiting regular meiosis13,31,32,33. Cytogenetic evidence shows that bivalent-forming chromosomes in subsect. Caninae become univalents in subsect. Rubigineae and vice versa34,35. The rose-specific (peri)centromeric satellite repeat (CANR4) is notably enriched in dogrose univalents, possibly linking centromere expansion to their drive during female meiosis36,37. Although other uneven polyploid systems with hemisexual reproduction exist38,39,40, the meiosis observed in dogroses is unique among eukaryotes. However, the lack of genomic studies has hindered understanding of how centromere properties contribute to this enigmatic reproductive behaviour.

Here we present a high-quality haplotype-phased chromosome-scale assembly of the pentaploid genome of Rosa canina (subsect. Caninae) and compare it with another R. canina individual and R. agrestis (subsect. Rubigineae), both from the Darwin Tree of Life (DToL; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/). Subgenome-aware analyses revealed that dogroses are composed of four subgenomes with one subgenome being present in two highly homozygous haplotypes and the other three in only one. Targeted sequencing of rose-specific single-copy orthologues (SCOs) from pollen DNA, together with the analysis of synthetic F1 hybrids, confirmed that the two-copy subgenome is biparentally inherited and therefore forming bivalents, while 21 non-recombining univalents from three distinct subgenomes are exclusively inherited through the female germline. Our SCO-based phylogenetic analysis supports the multiple-origin nature of dogroses, as subgenomes from different evolutionary origins were found in pollen, that is, forming bivalents. We also identified a bimodal centromere architecture with small (retrotransposon ATHILA-based) and large (tandem repeat CANR4-based) centromeres. Notably, CANR4-based centromeres were prevalent in univalents, possibly contributing to their drive in asymmetric female meiosis. Our results therefore provide a valuable basis for studying the trade-offs between sexual and asexual reproduction within a single genome.

Although R. canina has been recognized as a pentaploid species (2n = 5x = 35) for decades, its genome has remained unresolved owing to its complex polyploid structure and hybrid origin. To address this, we assembled a de novo haplotype-resolved, chromosome-level genome using PacBio HiFi sequencing (23× coverage) and chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data (Supplementary Table 1). The total size of the assembled 35 pseudochromosomes is about 2.4 Gb, achieving 99.2% completeness in terms of gene content (Extended Data Fig. 1). This high-quality reference genome provides a critical resource for understanding R. canina's genetic features, asymmetric meiosis and hybridization.

All-to-all chromosome alignments revealed seven syntenic groups in R. canina, each consisting of five chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. 1). In each group, two chromosome sets consistently exhibited 99–100% similarity, indicating two haplotypes of the same subgenome, while the remaining three chromosome sets showed lower similarities (95–98%; Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1), which may derive from three different subgenomes. Phylogenetic analyses based on gene and chromosome data, using the diploid rose genomes of Rosa chinensis (sect. Synstylae)16 and Rosa rugosa (sect. Rosa; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) as references, revealed that two subgenomes are closely related to R. chinensis and were therefore designated ‘S', while the other two are more similar to R. rugosa (Fig. 1b–e) and were therefore designated ‘R'. The two highly similar Synstylae-like haplotypes were named S1_h1 and S1_h2, while the more divergent Synstylae-like chromosome set was named S2. The Rosa-like subgenomes were named R3 and R4, respectively. Moreover, using subgenome-specific k-mers41, we observed that chromosomes assigned to the same subgenome clustered together both in the k-mer heat map and the principal component analysis plot, confirming the correct assignment of the four primary subgenomes (S1, S2, R3 and R4; Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). These findings resolve the long-standing question regarding the identity of the five homoeologous chromosomes within each syntenic group.

To further validate the evolutionary relationships of the subgenomes in pentaploid R. canina, we conducted orthologous cluster analysis and genome-wide comparisons of synonymous substitution rates (Ks) between R. canina, R. chinensis and R. rugosa. These results were consistent with previous phasing assignments and confirmed the allopolyploid origin of R. canina (Supplementary Figs. 2–4). Structure-based pairwise chromosomal analysis across the subgenomes of R. canina and genomes of R. chinensis and R. rugosa revealed a strong conservation of synteny between the two haplotypes of the homozygous S1 subgenome (S1_h1/h2). By contrast, the S1 subgenome showed much lower synteny with the other three subgenomes (S2, R3, R4), which were characterized by large inversions, duplicated regions and translocations (Fig. 1e). Notably, the R3 and R4 subgenomes of R. canina exhibit greater synteny to the R. rugosa genome than to the other subgenomes of R. canina (Fig. 1e), supporting their origination from sect. Rosa35. Despite the distinct divergence and origins of four subgenomes, a comparison of R. canina chromosomes of all subgenomes against R. rugosa syntenic chromosomes revealed no evidence of differential fractionation (loss of one or the other copy of a duplicated gene; Supplementary Fig. 5). To detect differential evolutionary rates between subgenomes, we analysed the ratio of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitution rates and revealed, besides a few outliers, strong purifying selection across orthologous genes in all subgenomes (Supplementary Fig. 6). Together, these results suggest an absence of large-scale subgenome dominance.

We next took advantage of the recent HiFi and Hi-C sequencing datasets from the DToL (https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) for another R. canina accession (European Nucleotide Archive (ENA): PRJEB79802) and from Rosa agrestis (subsect. Rubigineae; ENA: PRJEB79880) to generate de novo pseudochromosomes (Supplementary Table 2). Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of synteny between our R. canina S27 genome and the DToL R. canina, both sharing the same subgenome composition (Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). The R. agrestis genome, also pentaploid with 35 pseudochromosomes, displayed a different subgenome composition, with two highly similar haplotypes for the R4 subgenome (R4_h1/h2) and only one copy of the S1 subgenome (Extended Data Fig. 3b–e and Supplementary Fig. 7c,d). Comparative subgenome phasing revealed a gradient of differentiation between the subgenomes of R. canina and R. agrestis. The S1 subgenomes of both species were the least differentiated and clustered together (Supplementary Fig. 8a). This was followed by the R4 subgenomes, which exhibited a slightly higher degree of differentiation compared with S1 (Supplementary Fig. 8b). The most pronounced differentiation was seen in the S2 and R3 subgenomes, which were distinctly separated in both species (Supplementary Fig. 8c,d). This pattern suggests that the subgenomes S2 and R3 are accumulating more divergence over time.

To trace the hybridization history of dogroses, we identified subgenome-specific long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) and estimated their insertion times in R. canina and R. agrestis to determine the timing of subgenome differentiation before hybridization. Notably, we observed a distinction in the median insertion times of LTR-RTs: the S1, S2 and R3 subgenomes in R. canina were estimated to have diverged around 0.7 million years ago (Ma), while the R4 subgenome was older, at approximately 1.2 Ma (median values, 95% confidence intervals; Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). In R. agrestis, the median insertion times for S1 and S2 (~0.7 Ma) and for R4 (~1.2 Ma) were the same as for R. canina, whereas a slightly older median insertion time was detected for the R3 subgenome (around 0.9 Ma; Extended Data Fig. 4c). These results suggest that the combination of S1, S2 and R3 subgenomes arose at different timepoints in R. canina and R. agrestis. This is further supported by the Ks-based divergence time estimation obtained from SCOs (Supplementary Fig. 6) and comparable findings from the high differentiation between their R3 subgenomes (Supplementary Fig. 8). Together, these findings suggest that modern dogroses originated through independent, stepwise hybridization events.

Only bivalent-forming chromosomes are able to segregate properly and produce viable haploid (1x) pollen in dogroses. We therefore used flow sorting to isolate pollen nuclei as a proxy to confirm which subgenomes are exclusively pollen-inherited and form bivalents in dogroses. We successfully collected around 200,000 generative nuclei from pollen samples (Fig. 2a) of 9 pentaploid dogrose accessions (including 3 accessions of R. canina, 2 of R. corymbifera, both subsect. Caninae; and 3 of R. rubiginosa, subsect. Rubigineae) and analysed them using single-copy orthologous nuclear locus target enrichment (Methods). This enabled us to create sample-specific reference sequences for each SCO locus. We mapped a total of 5,794 SCO sequences to the R. canina S27 genome and identified 7 major chromosome pairs, with most hits in R. canina pollen located on the S1_h1/h2 chromosomes (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 2). By contrast, R. rubiginosa pollen showed hits primarily on the R3 and R4 chromosomes (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 2). By leveraging dogrose pollen SCO mappings on the R. canina genome, we unambiguously identified seven pairs of bivalent-forming chromosomes across several dogrose species. Moreover, mapping SCO loci to the R. agrestis genome revealed that the R4_h1/h2 subgenome forms bivalents in this species (Extended Data Fig. 5a). These results confirm that bivalent-forming chromosomes in subsect. Caninae form univalents in subsect. Rubigineae and vice versa34,35.

Inset: an intact pollen grain after DAPI staining of both nucleus types. Scale bar, 10 μm. b, Genome-wide pollen SCO mapping of eight dogrose species (subsect. Caninae: three samples of R. canina and two samples of R. corymbifera; subsect. Rubigineae: three samples of R. rubiginosa) to the R. canina S27 genome. The bubble map represents chromosomal hits, which were selectively filtered to display loci with a single alternative hit. The size of the symbols corresponds to the mean counts of pollen SCOs mapped to each chromosomal pair, identifying seven pollen-inherited chromosomes from the S1 subgenome within the R. canina (subsect. Caninae) genome assembly. In R. rubiginosa (subsect. Rubigineae), pollen SCO mapped preferentially to the R3 and R4 subgenomes. c, Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of the genus Rosa based on SCO loci including those retrieved from chromosome-scale assemblies and all pollen samples.

The x axis shows the coverage histogram of the short reads from this species mapped to each R. canina subgenome. The y axis shows the probability densities. The hybrid revealed doubled coverage for R4, indicating the presence of two sets of R4 copies, biparentally inherited, while only one set of maternally inherited S1 was detected, confirming sexual reproduction and the subgenome's inheritance through male and female meiosis.

Next, we aligned SCO loci obtained from the R. canina S27, R. canina DToL and R. agrestis DToL subgenomes, along with pollen DNA from section Caninae and different diploid rose samples and outgroups. This resulted in 58 sequences, totalling 642,158 positions derived from 1,904 concatenated SCO loci. Subgenome-wise as well as chromosome-wise phylogenetic analysis delineated two large clades within the genus Rosa: the Synstylae clade and the Rosa clade, as well as the earlier splits of subg. Hulthemia (Rosa persica), subg. Hesperhodos (Rosa stellata) and sect. Pimpinellifoliae (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 3). The tree corroborates the allopolyploid origin of dogroses13,28,29,30. In R. canina (subsect. Caninae), the bivalent-forming subgenome (S1) and the univalent-forming subgenome S2 clustered in the Synstylae clade, while the univalent-forming subgenomes R3 and R4 were part of the Rosa clade, sister to the European species R. majalis. All of the subgenomes of R. agrestis grouped with the corresponding R. canina subgenome samples, supporting a common origin of individual subgenomes despite the high differentiation observed in S2 and R3 subgenomes (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8). However, the pollen SCO data from all R. rubiginosa samples grouped as sister to both R3 and R4 subgenomes from R. canina and R. agrestis, respectively, implying multiple origins of the bivalent-forming chromosomes in subsect. Rubigineae. Notably, the pollen SCO data from R. canina ‘CAN2' was sister to the univalent-forming subgenome S2, suggesting some intraspecific variation in the bivalent-forming subgenomes within R. canina (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 3), as indicated by variation in microsatellite alleles from bivalent-forming chromosomes in R. canina26. Supported by the respective clustering of bivalent-bearing pollen data from subsect. Caninae and subsect. Rubigineae, our data demonstrate an independent origin for the bivalent-forming subgenomes of dogroses and, consequently, the independent origins of asymmetric meiosis34,35. Furthermore, the finding that representatives of subsect. Caninae and subsect. Rubigineae (including the newly generated plastome assemblies for R. canina and R. agrestis) contain phylogenetically distant plastids from the Synstylae clade13,31,32,33 (Extended Data Fig. 5b) supports the hypothesis that two progenitors from the Synstylae clade formed reciprocal hybrids, which subsequently incorporated R genomes through pollen donors.

While haploid (1x) pollen nuclei are clearly a product of Canina meiosis (Fig. 2a,b), tetraploid (4x) sexually derived egg cells were inferred by the respected embryo/endosperm ratio in seeds (Fig. 2d). In sexually reproducing diploids with double fertilization of the egg cell and the polar nuclei, the endosperm/embryo ratio is 1.5 (3x endosperm/2x embryo; Extended Data Fig. 5c). However, in sexually reproducing 5x dogroses, the ratio was found to be 1.8, indicating a 9x endosperm and a 5x embryo (Fig. 2d), similar to previous findings42. To further check the reproduction mode of dogroses, we have investigated the genome composition of two synthetic hybrids obtained from controlled crossing experiments43. In the first cross, the female gamete came from R. canina (subsect. Caninae) and the male donor was R. rubiginosa (subsect. Rubigineae). As anticipated from the result of the Canina meiosis, the subgenome contribution in the hybrid was consistent with the expected 4x egg cell containing one copy of each S1/S2/R3/R4 subgenome from R. canina and a 1x pollen nucleus with the R4 subgenome from R. rubiginosa (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5d). In the second case, the female gamete came from R. rubiginosa and the male donor was R. corymbifera—a very close relative of R. canina44. Again, the hybrid showed the expected subgenome composition, consisting of a male haploid S1 subgenome and a female tetraploid S1/S2/R3/R4 subgenome (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). These results are in agreement with S1 and R4 being bivalent-forming subgenomes and confirm the 1x male versus 4x female gamete composition. Our findings further suggest that different subgenomes are potentially interexchangeable in hybridization events; however, hybrids in extant populations originated mostly from unreduced eggs suggesting some subsection-specific differentiation subgenomes, which might impact bivalent formation45.

To gain further insights into the subgenome differentiation of R. canina, we aimed to characterize its global repeat composition, both genome-wide and specifically at centromeres. The R. canina genome exhibited a very high content of LTR Ty1/Copia elements, which made up 40% of the total repeat content, compared with 23% of Ty3/Gypsy elements. Among the Ty1/Copia elements, the BIANCA family accounted for more than 45% of all annotated full-length LTR-RTs while, among the Ty3/Gypsy elements, RETAND and ATHILA were the largest classes found, comprising 10% and 8% of all annotated full-length LTR-RTs, respectively. Tandem repeats, that is, satellite DNA, were mainly composed of the (peri)centromeric CANR4 repeats15,20 and rDNA sequences (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Data 4). The repeat profile across the 35 chromosomes revealed prominent 2–3 Mb peaks of highly dense repeats probably corresponding to the centromeres (Fig. 3a).

Each dot coloured by its subgenome presents a centromere. The abundance of CENH3 was calculated by the sum of CENH3 ChIP–seq (log2[CENH3/H3]) signals on centromeres normalized to coverage. The R2 of the linear regression model is 0.84. The Spearman's rank correlation is 0.93. Note the high CENH3 enrichment for the cenLTR1-based centromere in Rca1_R4, which lacks CANR4 repeats. Source data are provided in Supplementary Data 15.

To validate the DNA sequences associated with functional centromeres, we developed an R. canina centromeric histone H3 (CENH3)-specific antibody and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq). Notably, our results revealed two main types of centromere composition—Ty3/Gypsy ATHILA and CANR4 satellite-based centromeres (Fig. 3a,b). Analysis of the centromere-wide repeat structures revealed that ATHILA-based centromeres were most frequent in the chromosomes of the S1 and R4 subgenomes, while larger CANR4-based centromeres were found across all chromosomes in the S2 and R3 subgenomes (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Fig. 10). CANR4 centromeric arrays were also found in 3 out of 7 syntenic groups (2, 4 and 5) of the S1_h1/h2 bivalent-forming chromosomes and in two R4 chromosomes, in which these arrays were frequently interrupted by ATHILA elements (Fig. 3a–c, Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 3). A similar centromeric sequence composition was observed in both R. canina and R. agrestis from DToL, despite considerable variation in sequence length (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12 and Supplementary Data 5–8). Further structural sequence analysis of the diploid relatives R. chinensis and R. rugosa revealed that CANR4 repeats are present in only four and three centromeric regions, respectively, while centrophilic ATHILA elements were found in all centromeres (Supplementary Data 9–11). Together, our results confirm the expansion and predominance of CANR4-based centromeres in exclusively maternally inherited univalent chromosomes in dogroses20.

Moreover, we identified two centromeres of R. canina S27 from the R4 subgenome (Rca1_R4 and Rca4_R4) that lack CANR4 repeats but exhibited high affinity for CENH3 in regions other than ATHILA elements. These two centromeres were characterized by the presence of several tandem-repeat sequences with very long monomers ranging from 1,425 to 2,596 bp. Detailed characterization of these tandem-repeat arrays has revealed that all of these sequences identified are probably derived from different centrophilic ATHILA elements, as they all share over 75% similarity with their LTR sequences and are therefore referred to cenLTR1–4 (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 13). Notably, the cenLTR arrays showed significantly higher CENH3 enrichment compared with neighbouring ATHILA elements, with the most pronounced enrichment observed in Rca1_R4, which contained a large array of cenLTR1 (235 kb; Extended Data Fig. 6). Although cenLTR arrays found in Rca4_R4 were shorter and characterized by less CENH3 enrichment compared with cenLTR1 in Rca1_R4, we found two different arrays of cenLTR2 and cenLTR3 with higher enrichment than neighbouring ATHILAs. Furthermore, the cenLTR1 monomer sequence showed over 85% similarity to the LTR sequences of ATHILAs in Rca4_R4; however, it was not found in tandem arrays in this chromosome (Supplementary Fig. 13). Notably, these cenLTR arrays were not detected in either of the DToL genome assemblies of R. canina or R. agrestis (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12), suggesting that the formation of these centromeric tandem repeat arrays is a very recent evolutionary event.

To investigate the epigenetic organization within centromeres, we analysed DNA methylation patterns across chromosome arms, scaling from the telomeres to the centromere midpoints. Methylation levels were generally elevated at centromeres across CpG, CHG and CHH contexts. However, DNA methylation was slightly reduced, particularly in CANR4-based centromeres (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 14). These findings suggest distinct methylation patterns in CANR4 centromeres compared with ATHILA-based centromeres. Indeed, ATHILA accumulation was less pronounced in the centromeres of univalents of S2 and R3 subgenomes, despite a few insertions being found within CANR4 centromeric arrays (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 14). Notably, ATHILA insertions in CANR4 arrays disrupted CENH3 binding, while ATHILA-based centromeres were smaller and showed a lower level of CENH3 association compared with CANR4-based centromeres (Fig. 3b–d, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 14). Frequent insertion of ATHILA elements into CANR4 arrays was also observed in R. agrestis and the diploid roses R. chinensis and R. rugosa (Supplementary Data 7–11). A similar disruption of centromere activity by centrophilic ATHILA has been recently found within Arabidopsis centromeres46,47.

We further observed a positive correlation between the amount of CANR4 repeats and CENH3 abundance along R. canina S27 centromeres (Fig. 3e). In fact, the total centromere length, as the measurement of the CENH3-binding regions per subgenome, confirmed that the S2 and R3 centromeres were larger compared with those of S1 and R4 (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 15 and Supplementary Data 5). Most CANR4-based centromeres showed increased levels of CENH3 accumulation compared with the CANR4-less ones. Notably, the centromere on Rca1_R4, which is mainly based on a cenLTR1 array (Extended Data Fig. 6), showed one of the highest enrichments for CENH3 among CANR4-less centromeres (Fig. 3e). Thus, tandem repeats bearing different monomer composition seem to accumulate high CENH3 levels in the R. canina centromeres.

CENH3 immunostaining of R. canina chromosomes revealed differences in the size of individual centromeres (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Video 1; n = 12). The size difference was further confirmed by immunostaining analysis of the kinetochore component KNL148 (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b; n = 23). Furthermore, in situ hybridization with probes for CANR4 and ATHILA on mitotic (n = 15) and meiotic (n = 18) chromosomes of R. canina confirmed the predominance of large CANR4 signals at the centromeres of univalents, while all bivalent and almost all univalents showed ATHILA centromeric signals (Extended Data Fig. 8c–k). In the diploids R. chinensis and R. rugosa, CANR4 centromeric signals were observed in only three pairs of chromosomes while, again, ATHILA was found in all centromeric regions (Extended Data Fig. 8l,m). Thus, the observed difference in the size of CENH3 centromeric signals is probably associated with the accumulation of CANR4 satellite repeats, supporting our ChIP–seq analysis (Fig. 3e). These results confirm the bimodal architecture of R. canina centromeres, which are preferentially ATHILA-based in bivalents and CANR4-based in univalents, with the caveat that our ChIP–seq experiment was performed using leaf tissue.

a, Centromeres on all chromosomes were detected by CENH3 protein in mitotic metaphase. Note the size difference in CENH3 signals among different chromosomes. b,c, Centromeric organization during early prophase I. d, The orientation of centromeres during the diakinesis stage. e, Metaphase I with univalents (U) surrounding the bivalents (B); the dashed line highlights the typical clustering of bivalents in the middle. f, Metaphase I, with all chromosomes organized in the equatorial plate initiating the segregation of homologous pairs (in the case of bivalents) and separation of sister chromatids (in the case of univalents). g,h, Early (g) and late (h) anaphase I shows early separation of bivalents, while sister chromatids of univalents usually lagging behind. i,j, During metaphase II (i) and anaphase II (j), two main spindles are formed, while lagged chromosomes are still attached to additional abnormal spindles (arrowheads). At anaphase II (j), sister centromeres of the bivalent-forming chromosomes finally segregate to form haploid gametes, while single chromatids from univalents lag behind and are eliminated. Experiments were independently repeated at least ten times with similar results to track all meiotic stages represented here. Scale bar, 5 µm (j).

Next, we investigated the behaviour of centromeres and spindle dynamics during male meiosis of R. canina. Our immunostaining analysis using antibodies against CENH3 and alpha-tubulin clarified the asymmetric distribution of chromosomes during meiosis. In early stages of male meiosis, both small and large centromeres were visible (Fig. 4b–d and Supplementary Videos 2–4; n = 31). At onset of metaphase I, we observed seven bivalents organized at the centre of the cell surrounded by 21 univalents (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Video 5; n = 31), a configuration that was first proposed over a century ago2,3,22,23. During this stage, microtubules facilitated the separation of the homologous pairs through bipolar attachment, while univalents also showed bipolar attachment (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Video 6; n = 31). In early and late anaphase I, homologous chromosomes migrated first, while single chromatids derived from univalents lagged behind (Fig. 4g,h and Supplementary Videos 7 and 8; n = 31). Notably, we observed two groups of univalents exhibiting different timing in sister-chromatid separation (Fig. 4g,h (arrows)). During metaphase and anaphase II, we frequently observed both normal and abnormal spindles, resulting from single chromatids lagging behind from anaphase I (Fig. 4i,j (arrowheads)). Homologous pairs derived from bivalents separated normally at end of anaphase II, forming haploid nuclei with seven chromosomes, while single chromatids from univalents lagged behind and were probably eliminated (Fig. 4i,j and Supplementary Videos 9 and 10; n = 31). Despite the apparent irregularities in male meiosis, viable pollen grains in R. canina (S27) were produced at a rate of approximately 20% (Supplementary Fig. 16a,b). Notably, while at the end of meiosis polyads are formed showing nuclei with varying number of centromere foci (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Video 11), the mature binucleate pollen grains seem to contain only a haploid vegetative (1n = 1x = 7 chromosomes) and generative (2n) nucleus, as confirmed by their genome size and composition (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 16c). This suggests that, despite meiotic irregularities, a selective mechanism ensures the formation of haploid pollen. Our findings highlight how the atypical centromere behaviour and spindle dynamics during male meiosis in R. canina deviates from canonical meiotic processes but can still result in viable pollen production.

By leveraging newly generated genome assemblies of dogroses, we shed light onto the long-standing century-old mystery of the unique Canina meiosis2,3,22,23. Through structural analysis of subgenomes and centromeres, combined with pollen-derived genomics and hybridization experiments, we demonstrate that the bivalent-forming subgenomes in dogroses evolved independently and exhibit distinct interaction patterns during meiosis (Fig. 5).

a, Reproduction mode and centromere evolution of the pentaploid dogroses. Dogroses of subsect. Caninae have two copies of the S1 subgenome, while dogroses of subsect. Rubigineae have two copies of the R4 subgenome. The S2 and R3 subgenomes are found as a single copy only. During meiosis in subsect. Caninae, the S1_h1/S1_h2 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted to both pollen and egg cells. The remaining univalent subgenomes (S2, R3 and R4) are transmitted by the egg cell only. By contrast, in subsect. Rubigineae, the R4_h1/R4_h2 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted to both pollen and egg cells, while the remaining univalent subgenomes S1, S2 and R3 are transmitted only by the egg cell. The analyses of centromeric sequence composition revealed a dominance in ATHILA LTRs in most of the bivalent-forming centromeres of S1 and R4 subgenomes. By contrast, larger CANR4-based centromeres were found in all chromosomes of the permanently univalent S2 and R3 subgenomes. b, The model for the origin of dogrose subsections. On the basis of the findings that representatives of subsect. Caninae and subsect. Rubigineae contain phylogenetic distant plastids from the Synstylae clade13,31,32,33 (Extended Data Fig. 5b), we propose that two progenitors of the Synstylae clade formed reciprocal hybrids and additionally incorporated R genomes through pollen donors. Subgenomes are represented by one chromosome. Synstylae subgenomes S1 (violet) and S2 (light blue) and Rosa clade subgenomes R3 (light orange) and R4 (dark orange) are shown.

The bimodal architecture of centromeres in R. canina is particularly intriguing when considered alongside its asymmetric female meiosis, in which univalent chromosomes are obligatorily transmitted through the egg cell3,49. The prevalence of CANR4 repeats in univalent centromeres could possibly link centromere expansion with their drive in female meiosis (Fig. 5a), a phenomenon in which larger centromeres are preferentially transmitted during meiosis37,50,51. The structural divergence and selective enrichment of CANR4 repeats in the centromeres of univalents may underpin their larger size, ensuring the preferential transmission of univalents through the egg cell and, therefore, maintaining the pentaploid genome structure. This may represent a rare case of an obligate drive mechanism, functioning in a ‘drive or die' manner to maximize the transmission of univalents. However, the occasional presence of ATHILA-based centromeres in some univalent chromosomes suggests that CANR4 expansion alone does not fully explain univalent drive. Furthermore, the structural divergence of centromeres seems also to influence their behaviour in male meiosis, as large CANR4-based centromeres in univalents could possibly promote bipolar orientation and premature chromatid separation in male meiosis. Notably, in Arabidopsis thaliana, bipolar orientation of univalents happens only when sister chromatid cohesion is defective52, but it appears to be more common in wheat univalents53. This observation contrasts with that of female meiosis, in which univalents seem to have monopolar orientation in dogroses3 (Supplementary Fig. 17). Thus, a potential role for sexual dimorphism in sister chromatid cohesion regulation could be part of the adaptations enabling Canina meiosis.

It is possible that the absence of a homologous pair (and therefore a competing centromere) in the obligatory univalents (S2 and R3 subgenomes) may facilitate the expansion of CANR4 repeats. By contrast, the S1 and R4 centromeres, which exist within a competitive pairing environment, experience counterbalancing forces that limit CANR4 accumulation (Fig. 5a). This is further supported by the absence of solely CANR4-based centromeres in diploid roses R. chinensis and R. rugosa. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence for the emergence of few tandem repeats originating from LTR sequences, which outcompete neighbouring ATHILA elements for CENH3 binding in two R4 univalent chromosomes (Rca1_R4 and Rca4_R4). These findings highlight the higher affinity of tandem repeats for centromere function in dogroses, further emphasizing the role of centromere composition in shaping meiotic behaviour. However, while the observed correlation is intriguing, we acknowledge that future studies will be essential to confirm whether the expansion of CANR4 in univalent centromeres is directly linked to their drive during female meiosis.

Despite the lack of recombination, univalent chromosomes retain functional protein-coding genes, as evidenced by high BUSCO completeness and the absence of differential selection pressures. This supports a relatively recent origin of modern dogroses and highlights the resilience of their polyploid genome. Phylogenetic analyses using pollen SCOs and maternally inherited plastid markers further corroborate the polyphyletic origin of dogroses13,31,32,33 with multiple hybridization events contributing to their evolutionary history (Fig. 5b). The distinct subgenome ratios observed in R. canina (3:2 Synstylae to Rosa) and R. agrestis (2:3 Synstylae to Rosa) underscore the complexity of their hybrid origins30,32. Pollen SCO data align with cytogenetic studies, indicating that bivalent-forming subgenomes in the subsections Caninae and Rubigineae are phylogenetically distant34,35. Moreover, multiple origins for R. canina are suggested, as the S1 subgenome clusters with five R. canina individuals, while the S2 subgenome clustered with another individual. This model aligns with reports of Canina-like meiosis arising spontaneously in hybrids of diploid sexual Synstylae species54, further highlighting the complex hybrid origin and evolutionary dynamics of dogroses.

For genome sequencing, we used the same individual of R. canina (S27), which has already been cytogenetically analysed34 (voucher: GLM12396) from a natural stand (WGS84: 51.1732° N; 14.6271° E; Weißenberg, Saxony, Germany). A vegetative runner was dug on 28 March 2022 and planted in a pot. Clones of the collected plant specimen were cultivated in a greenhouse at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Germany.

High molecular mass genomic DNA was isolated from leaves using the NucleoBond HMW DNA Kit (Macherey Nagel). A HiFi library was prepared according to the manual of the HiFi SMRTbell Libraries using SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences) with initial DNA fragmentation using Diagenode Megaruptor 3 and final library size binning into defined fractions by Blue Pippin with 0.75% agarose cassettes (Sage Science). The size distribution was again controlled by a Femto pulse system (Agilent). Size-selected libraries were then sequenced on the Sequel II device with a Binding Kit 2.0 and Sequel II Sequencing Kit 2.0 for 30 h using two SMRT cells (Pacific Biosciences). Moreover, a chromatin-capture library was prepared from 0.5 g of fresh-weight leaf material input. All treatments were performed according to the recommendations of the Dovetail Omni-C kit for plants (Dovetail Genomics). As a final step, an Illumina-compatible library was prepared (Dovetail) and paired-end 2 × 150 bp deep-sequenced on the HiSeq 3000 (Illumina) device. All libraries were sequenced at the Max Planck Genome Centre Cologne at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research.

A phased chromosome-level genome was assembled using the generated PacBio HiFi and Hi-C data. First, a phased primary assembly was obtained by running Hifiasm55 using 50 Gb of PacBio HiFi reads in combination with Dovetail Omni-C reads with the following command: hifiasm -o out.phased.asm.hic --h1 hic.R1.fastq.gz --h2 hic.R2.fastq.gz hifi.reads.fastq.gz. In the default diploid mode, we generated two sets of phased contigs. Each set was further scaffolded to the chromosome scale using Salsa256, followed by successive rounds of manual curation and rescaffolding. We then identified 14 and 21 pseudochromosomes, respectively.

We used Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologues (BUSCO, v.5.4.0)57 to evaluate the completeness of 35 chromosome-level scaffolds and for each of the four subgenomes. The lineage database used for running BUSCO was eudicots_odb10. The protein sequences were converted from the assembly using the GFF analysis toolkit AGAT: agat_sp_extract_sequences.pl -g annotation.gff -f genome.fasta -p --type cds -o protein.fasta. The k-mer-based tool Merqury (v.1.3)58 was used to estimate both the completeness and base quality of the chromosome assembly. The quality value of the chromosome assembly was greater than 66.6, and the quality value of each chromosome was at least 62. Read k-mers were built from HiFi sequences by Meryl (v1.3) with a k-mer size of 31 bp.

During the scaffolding step, we noted the absence of approximately 20 Mb (including the centromere) on chromosome Rca2_S1_h2. Further validation using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that this chromosome should indeed have a large array of CANR4, as found in its homologous chromosome Rca2_S1_h1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). We noted that this assembly error was probably generated by the presence of a small translocation found at the start of the missing region in Rca_S1_h2 compared with Rca_S1_h1. We further mapped the HiFi reads to the region present in Rca_S1_h1 and found robust evidence for the presence of five copies of this region in the genome. We then concluded that this region was incorrectly missing from the Hifiasm assembly due to its high degree of similarity between the S1_h1 and S1_h2 haplotypes. We therefore duplicated the Rca2_S1_h1 region (37265454–54065178 bp) and manually assigned it to the expected position on Rca_S1_h2 (from Rca2_S1_h2: 33518152 bp).

We also downloaded available data from the Darwin Tree of Life (DToL) project for another accession of R. canina (PRJEB79801) and for R. agrestis (PRJEB79880) and performed phased chromosome-level genome assemblies as described above. R. agrestis from DToL revealed two copies of the R4 subgenome; our previous studies suggested that some accessions of R. agrestis were of hybrid origin, which should then have two copies of S1 subgenome45,59.

k-mer analysis to estimate genome size was performed using jellyfish (v.2.3.0)60 and Genomescope (v.2.0)61. The pentaploidy of R. canina was further confirmed and analysed using Smudgeplot (v.0.2.5)61.

To clarify the maternal lineage of the allopolyploid R. canina (S27), we assembled the plastid genome of the sequenced individual. GetOrganelle (v.1.7.7.0)62 was used to de novo assemble the first draft of the plastid genome using 2× 150 bp Illumina short-read data (Sequence Read Archive (SRA): ERS1370372). This toolkit implements Bowtie 263 to initially find reads mapped to a plant chloroplast database and SPAdes64 for de novo assembly and iterative extension. During the assembly and iteration process, BLAST+65 was used to identify off-target contigs, which were then removed or trimmed. The resulting plastid genome was then used as a reference for mapping the original reads back using Geneious Prime v.2023.2.1 (Biomatters), allowing only mapping of paired reads mapped nearby with a minimum overlap of 75 bp and a minimum overlap identity of 98%. The results were manually examined and corrected where necessary.

The initial annotation of the chloroplast genome was performed using GeSeq (v.2.03)66. The annotation included the chloroplast inverted repeats (IRs), rps12 interspersed gene, protein-coding sequences, tRNAs and rRNAs using 55% identity as thresholds for annotation of proteins and 90% for DNA as well as RNAs. Furthermore, tRNAscan-SE (v.2.0.7)67 and Chloë (v.0.1.0)68 were used as additional annotators within GeSeq. The annotations were manually edited using Geneious Prime v.2023.2.1 (Biomatters). The presence of chloroplast genomes differing in the orientation of the single-copy units (large single-copy (LSC) region, small single-copy (SSC) region) was checked by selecting motifs from the border region of the IR and the single-copy units (LSC-trnH-GUG 5′-GGTTCAATTCCCGTCGTTC-3′ or LSC-rps19 5′-GTGACACGTTCACTGAAAAAA-3′ and IRb-rps19-rpl2-IGS 5′-AGACGAAGAAACAAATTCTAT-3′; SSC-ndhF 5′-TGTAATAATATAATAATTGAA-3′ or SSC-ycf1 5′-CGACCCTAAACGATGGAATCG-3′ and IRa-ycf1 5′-TTGAAAAACCCGTTGTAACTAT-3′), noting their relative orientation to each other on the same reads using SeqKit (v.2.6.1)69.

The assembled R. canina chloroplast genome had a length of 156,650 bp and a classical quadripartite structure (Supplementary Fig. 18): a LSC of 85,634 bp (~56.57% of the plastid genome), a SSC of 18,878 bp (~12.05%) and two IR regions of 26,069 bp (~16.64% each). Different isomers were found to differ in the orientation of the SSC and LSC (flip-flop configuration).

We computed a chloroplast phylogeny using 37 samples, including sequences downloaded from GenBank and newly assembled data (Supplementary Data 17). The alignment was performed with MAFFT70, and the phylogenetic tree was calculated using IQ-TREE71 with the following settings: -m MFP --con-tree --burnin 250 -B 1000 -T 36 --wbtl.

The assembled chromosomes were subjected to pairwise comparisons presented as dot plots using the Synteny Mapping and Analysis (SyMAP) tool72. Multiple alignments within the synteny groups comprising five R. canina chromosomes plus R. chinensis and R. rugosa assemblies were carried out in the CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC) using the ‘whole genome alignment' plugin with the following parameters: minimum initial seed length of 250; minimum alignment block length of 250. The aligned chromosomes were subjected to pairwise comparisons. The similarity values were calculated as the block fraction of the two genomes that were aligned (that is, the alignment percentage) or as the percentage of exactly matching nucleotides within the aligned blocks (the average nucleotide identity).

Multifasta files containing assembled short-read sequences of pollen SCO loci from eight different dogrose individuals (three samples of R. canina, two samples of R. corymbifera (subsect. Caninae) and three samples of R. rubiginosa (subsect. Rubigineae)) that were not sequenced by long reads (Supplementary Data 17) were used as queries to map them with the software BWA73 with the aln command to the R. canina chromosome assembly. From the sequence alignment map (.sam) file, those chromosome hits with only one alternative were filtered according to the ‘XA:Z:' flag using a Python script written by GPT-4 (ChatGPT Plus, OpenAI). A bubble map displaying the mean counts of chromosome pairs within different subsections was drawn with ggplot274.

Chromosome synteny was analysed with the Synteny and Rearrangement Identifier (SyRI)75. For this purpose, chromosomes of subgenomes S1_h1, S1_h2, S3, R3 and R4 were aligned against each other within each linkage group (Rca1–Rca7) by minimap276,77 using the following command: minimap2 -ax asm5 --eqx -t 16 genome1.fa genome2.fa | samtools sort -@8 > aln.sorted.bam. Moreover, subgenome S1 was also aligned with R. chinensis (NCBI: GCA_041222415)16 and R. canina subgenome R4 was aligned with R. rugosa (NCBI: GCA_958449725.1; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) to analyse its synteny. To keep all of the chromosomes arranged in the same order as R. canina and for better visualization, chromosomes 2, 5 and 7 of R. chinensis were inverted, and the chromosomes of R. rugosa were reordered to 6, 1 (inverted), 7, 5 (inverted), 2, 3 and 4, corresponding to chromosomes 1–7 in R. canina. SyRI was implemented for all of the aligned genome pairs using the following command: syri -c aln.sorted.bam -r genome1.fa -q genome2.fa -k -F B --nc 16. Visualization revealed only syntenic blocks over 50 kb, which was performed by plots: Python PLOTsr --sr rugosa_R4/syri.out --sr R4_R5/syri.out --sr R5_s3/syri.out –sr S3 _S2/syri.out --sr S2_S1/syri.out --sr S1_chinensis/syri.out --genomes genomes.txt -o out_50k.pdf -S 0.7 -W 10 -H 9 -f 10 --itx -s 50000.

Syntenic orthologues among the primary annotations of diploid strawberry Fragaria nilgerrensis78, R. chinensis16, R. rugosa (GCA_958449725.1, DToL; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) and the five sets of chromosomes of R. canina were inferred using the GENESPACE (v.1.2.3)79 pipeline with the default parameters. In brief, GENESPACE compares protein similarity scores into syntenic blocks using MCScanX80 and Orthofinder (v.2.5.4)81 to search for orthologues/paralogues within synteny constrained blocks. Syntenic blocks were used to query pairwise peptide differences among progenitor alleles, determine divergence among progenitor orthologues using R. chinensis syntenic anchors and search for specific orthogroups.

Synteny information was obtained using the SynMap tool on the CoGe platform82,83. Only genes within synteny blocks were considered, including not only gene pairs but also singleton genes in each genome that lost their counterpart in the other genome due to fractionation or other gene loss. The identification of syntelogues between species was performed using SynMap2 (https://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/SynMap2), which internally uses LAST for sequence alignments84, and then fractionation bias was analysed with FractBias85.

Protein-coding sequences (CDSs) were extracted for each R. canina subgenome according to coordinates from the gene structural annotation file using GffRead (v.0.12.6)86 and translated into amino acid sequences using the transeq command from EMBOSS87. Additional amino acid sequences and CDSs of R. rugosa (BioProject: PRJNA1061178; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/), R. chinensis (NCBI: GCF_002994745.2)14 and Fragaria vesca (NCBI: GCF_000184155.1)88 were downloaded. The CDS and amino acid sequences were validated, for example, for correct start codons or methionine as the first amino acid in the proteins, using Python scripts. The confirmed proteomes were subsequently analysed using OrthoFinder81 to identify common single-copy orthologues. According to the protein IDs, FASTA files for each orthologue gene containing five proteins of R. canina together with the three of outgroups were aligned with MAFFT (v.7.490)70. On the basis of the aligned proteins, corresponding CDSs were codon based aligned using PAL2NAL89 and DNA alignments were transformed into PHYLIP format. The PAML pipeline90 with yn00 was used in a looped pairwise mode over all PHYLIP files for each subgenome and outgroup to estimate the nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution rates, as well as their ratio (dN/dS = ω). The results based on the Yang–Nielsen91 method were extracted from PAML output files and combined using a Python script and graphical visualized with ggplot274 in the R environment92. To covert the relative evolutionary time (Timet) from yn00 into absolute divergence time (TMa) in millions of years ago (Ma), we used F. vesca as a fixed calibration point with its fossil record of 2.96 Ma (refs. 93,94). The relative divergence time Timet for each pairwise compared gene was multiplied with a scaling factor as follows:

All scripts were developed with the help of ChatGPT-4o (ChatGPT Plus, OpenAI).

We first generated whole-chromosome multiple alignments in synteny groups 1–7 using the Whole Genome Alignment tool in ClC workbench (Qiagen). The algorithm identifies seeds, that is, short stretches of nucleotide sequences that are shared between multiple genomes but not present multiple times in the same genome. These seeds were then extended using a HOXD scoring matrix, and the HOXD substitution score was combined with an adjustment term based on k-mer frequency to avoid spurious matches to repetitive regions in the genome95. The program parameters were as follows: minimum initial seed length, 250; minimum alignment blocks, 250; and mismatches in seeds, allowed. The chromosome phylogenies were constructed from multiple alignments using RAxML (v.8.2.12)96 with the GTRGAMMAI model. The diploid accessions were chromosome assemblies of R. chinensis16 and R. rugosa. For R. rugosa, the original chromosomes were renamed to fit the R. chinensis synteny.

We used SubPhaser41 (default parameters) to phase and partition the subgenomes of the pentaploid R. canina and R. agrestis by assigning chromosomes to subgenomes based on differential repetitive k-mers. These were assumed to have expanded during the period of independent evolution after divergence from the nearest common ancestor and before the stepwise hybridization events (the divergence–hybridization period). A subgenome is considered to be well phased when it displays distinct patterns of both differential k-mers and homoeologous chromosomes, confirming the presence of subgenome-specific features, as expected. As the S1_h1 and S1_h2 chromosomes represent haplotypes of the S1 genome, only the S1_h1 haplotype was used in the phasing analysis together with the sets of S2, R3 and R4 chromosomes.

LTR insertion times were calculated by Subphaser as follows: LTR-TRs were de novo detected using LTRharvest (v.1.6.1)97 and LTRfinder (v.1.07)98. To reduce false positives, TEsorter (v.1.3.0)99 was used to reconstruct the classification of LTR-RTs and further refine this classification. The subgenome-specific k-mer sequences were mapped to the LTR-RT sequences using a substring match procedure to identify the subgenome-specific LTR-RTs using the Fisher's exact test. Two LTRs of each subgenome-specific LTR-RT were retrieved and the nucleotide divergence was estimated using the Jukes–Cantor 1969 model. The insertion time (T) was calculated using the equation T  =  K/2r, where r  =  1.3 × 10–8 substitutions per year (default)100, and K represents the divergence of the LTRs from the LTR-RT.

To isolate the nuclei from embryo and endosperm tissue, nutlets from fruits of the sequenced individual of R. canina S27 (voucher: GLM12396) were first cracked with pliers. The embryo and endosperm were then carefully transferred into a droplet of nuclei isolation buffer (CyStain PI Absolute P; Sysmex-Partec) in a Petri dish and chopped with a sharp razorblade. After adding additional nuclei isolation buffer to a final volume of 500 µl, the nuclei suspensions were filtered through 50 µm disposable filters (CellTrics, Sysmex-Partec), stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to a final concentration of 1.5 µg ml−1 and stored on ice until use. The measurements were performed on a CyFlow Space flow cytometer (Sysmex-Partec) equipped with a high-power UV LED (365 nm).

To analyse the phylogenetic origin of the subgenomes of allopentaploid R. canina, we sampled 30 rose individuals of 24 diploid species across the genus Rosa. Thus, R. stellata (subgen. Hesperhodos), 10 species from sect. Synstylae, seven from sect. Rosa (Cinnamomeae, including sect. Carolinae), four from sect. Pimpinellifoliae and one individual of R. chinensis (sect. Chinensis) were sampled from the living collection of the Europa-Rosarium Sangerhausen. Moreover, one accession of R. majalis (sect. Rosa) was collected from the Botanical Garden Würzburg, and R. persica (subg. Hulthemia) from Botanical Garden Jena. Species were rechecked using their respective floras101,102,103, and the material was compared with available herbarium specimens available online (JSTOR Global Plants, https://plants.jstor.org/; Moscow Digital Herbarium, https://plant.depo.msu.ru). Herbarium vouchers were deposited in the Herbarium Senckenbergianum Görlitz (GLM; Supplementary Data 17).

To determine bivalent-forming genomes, we sampled pollen from several individuals of Rosa sect. Caninae (subsect. Caninae: three 5x R. canina, two 5x R. corymbifera; subsect. Vestitae: one 5x R. pseudoscabriuscula; subsect. Rubigineae: three 5x R. rubiginosa; Supplementary Data 17). We collected anthers from 50 to 100 freshly opened flowers under dry weather conditions in early May 2021 in the field, stored them in open glass for 1 day to allow the anthers to open and subsequently transferred them to a 50 ml tube. Owing to electrostatic attraction, the pollen deposited on the walls of the tube. Anthers were carefully removed, and the pollen powder was collected at the bottom of the tube by gentle centrifugation. The pollen powder was then tapped out over clean paper and transferred to tubes with the help of a spatula. This procedure was repeated three times. Pollen grains were stored in a refrigerator until use.

Nuclei of mature pollen grains were isolated by the filter bursting method104 using the nuclear isolation buffer as described previously105. Pollen grains were burst on the surface of a 20 μm disposable CellTrics filter (Sysmex-Partec). The resulting nuclear suspension was stained with propidium iodide (50 µg ml−1, PI) and run on a BD Influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Nuclear populations were identified in a dot plot showing the PI fluorescence signal (log scale) versus side scatter signal (SSC, log-scale). A sort gate was defined based on the corresponding fluorescence intensity (lin-scale) histogram. A total of 200,000 individual generative nuclei (volume, around 400 µl) were collected into a 1.5 ml reaction tube using the ‘1.0 Drop Pure' sorting mode of the BD FACS software (BD Biosciences). After adding 50 µl of 1× TE and 50 µl of NaN3, the nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation (1,000g for 10 min at 4 °C). Next, 300 µl of the supernatant was removed, and the nuclei with the remaining liquid were stored at −20 °C. The gating strategy to isolate generative nuclei of R. canina is presented in Supplementary Fig. 19.

DNA from diploid rose species was first extracted from 20 mg of silica-dried leaf tissue according to the ATMAB protocol106 and subsequently purified using the Mag-Bind Total Pure NGS Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Nocross) according to the manufacturer's manual. DNA from flow-sorted pollen nuclei was extracted using the Mag-Bind Plant DNA DS Kit with the modification that permanent but careful mixing was performed during binding and elution because the DNA quantities ranged from 37 ng to 236 ng. The DNA yield was quantified using the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

To analyse nuclear single-copy regions in rose genomes, we used published SCO tags107. The SCO tags were originally developed to be amplifiable by PCR and covered coding as well as non-coding regions. We used the 29,000 sequences from additional file 3 from ref. 107, which consisted of SCO tags of 17 rose species and seven outgroup species of the Rosaceae family. These sequences were filtered for uniqueness so that duplicates were removed and searched with BLAST in the R. chinensis haploid line genome (v.1.0)15. Owing to the structural gene model annotation of the R. chinensis genome, we were able to identify 923 full-length nuclear genes with single-copy characteristics. The target-capturing baits were designed by the Agilent bioinformatics service (I. Kisakesen, Agilent Technologies) and covered exons + UTRs with flanking regions and small introns of the selected genes in the R. chinensis genome. Finally, the target consisted of 5,794 sequences of different lengths (the shortest at 179 bp and the longest at 6,544 bp) named according to R. chinensis gene prediction and had a total size of 2 Mb (Supplementary Data 12). All target sequences were covered by 2× tiling with a total of 85,670 specific baits.

For target enrichment, we used the SureSelect XT HS2 DNA system with precapture pooling (Agilent Technologies) and target design as described above. For diploid roses, 200 ng of input DNA was used, and for pollen DNA, 36–200 ng of input DNA was sheared with a Bioruptor Pico sonication device (Diagenode) to a recommended fragment size of 180–250 bp. The Illumina short-read libraries were amplified for 9 cycles after adapter ligation, pooled for precapture to 16 samples and then postcapture library pools were amplified again with 12 cycles of PCR amplification. The library pools were sequenced in 150 bp paired-end mode on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system by Novogene with approximately 1 GB of data output per sample.

To analyse the ploidy of the samples, in vitro flow cytometry was performed on silica-dried leaflets according to a protocol described previously45 using R. arvensis (2n = 2x = 14) as an internal standard. The fluorescence intensity was measured using the CyFlow Ploidy Analyser (Sysmex Partec), and the data were analysed using Flowing Software v.2.5.1 (Turku Bioscience Centre). Each sample was measured three times with a minimum of 3,000 particles.

To estimate the ploidy of the samples in silico, we used K-Mer Counter (KMC) (v.3.1.1)108,109 to generate a k-mer database from FASTQ sequence files containing short-read data covering SCOs. The setting was a k-mer size of 21, a minimum count for a k-mer to be included of 1 and an upper limit for k-mer counts of 5,000. To avoid noise, KMC database reduction was performed using the transform operation with the L 30 and U 5000 settings. With smudgeplot61 analysis and its hetkzer operation, the coverages of the identified k-mer pairs were written to a ‘_coverages.tsv' file. A custom R script with ggplot274 and data.table packages92 was used to plot the distribution of frequencies of different SNP ratio classes. For each sample, the ploidy level was then estimated by visual inspection of the plots.

The raw SCO reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v.0.39)110 with the following settings: 2:30:8 LEADING:13 TRAILING:13 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:19 MINLEN:36. We updated the script from a previous study111 to run it with current package versions and used it for mapping, variant calling and sample-specific reference building. In brief, the trimmed short reads from the target enrichment sequencing were mapped against the SCO targets of the R. chinensis reference genome (5,794 sequences) using the BWA program73. Using SAMtools (v.1.16.1)112, the reads were sorted and indexed, and duplicates were removed. Notably, approximately 98% of trimmed reads were successfully mapped to the target. Hits with exactly one alternative mapping position were subsequently filtered. After mapping, the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (v.4.1.9.0)113 was used with the operation HaplotypeCaller114 for variant calling, BaseRecalibrator and ApplyBQSR were used to realign around SNPs and indels, and FastaAlternateReferenceMaker was used to create a sample-specific consensus sequence as a reference for each SCO locus in each sample. The provided ploidy level for the HaplotypeCaller was 2 (diploid) for both the pollen and diploid roses with regular meiosis, and the --max-alternate-alleles flag was set to 6, so that although the pollen is monoploid, it would be possible to call potential variances.

The SCO target was used as a query for a local search with BLAST+65 in our R. canina S27 genome assembly with a customized output table (-outfmt 6 qseqid sseqid pident length qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore) and additional in the DToL R. canina (PRJEB79801) and R. agrestis (PRJEB79880; https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) genomes also assembled by us (see below). Those SCO loci that had only five hits, one each on subgenomes S1_h1, S1_h2, S2, R3, R4 and R4_h1, R4_h2, R3, S2 and S1 for R. agrestis, respectively and within the same linkage group, were filtered and considered single copies. A main list of common single-copy loci for all three genomes was created to preserve the correct order and used to extract the filtered loci from the BLAST outputs with the grep command. The filtered BLAST output was then converted into a BED file containing the sequence coordinates using a bash script written with the help of GPT-4 (ChatGPT Plus, OpenAI). Using the BEDtools (v.2.30.0)115 command getfasta, sequences for each SCO locus were extracted from the R. canina genome assembly and written into a multifasta file. To obtain sequences with the same strand orientation, two locus lists were also created: one of the loci with a positive strand orientation and one with a negative-strand orientation. Loci with negative-strand orientation were identified by calculating the end coordinates minus the start coordinates and filtering according to negative values. According to both lists, the sequences were extracted and stored in two separate multi-FASTA files. Sequences with negative-strand orientation were reversed and complemented with SeqKit116 and combined with the positive strand-oriented SCO sequences in one fasta file. Finally, for each subgenome (S1_h1/S1_h2, S2, R3, R4 for R. canina and R4_h1/h2, R3, S2, S1 for R. agrestis), the extracted SCO sequences were concatenated in the same order according to the main locus list and written to subgenome-specific fasta sequences. The same procedure was used for the haploid genome assemblies of Rubus ideaus (GenBank: GCA_030142095.1)117 and three strawberry species, F. vesca subsp. vesca (GCA_000184155.1)88, Fragaria iinumae (GCA_009720345.1)118 and F. nilgerrensis (GCA_010134655.1)78 as outgroups. Moreover, the same single-copy loci considered in the genome assembly were extracted and concatenated in the same order with target enrichment samples from nine pollen samples and 30 leaf samples of 26 diploid rose species. The concatenated multilocus sequences were aligned using MAFFT (v.7.490)70. Finally, a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated by applying IQTREE71 with ModelFinder using the following settings: iqtree2 -s -m TEST --con-tree --burnin 250 -B 1000 -T 12 --wbtl. The tree figures were graphically finalized with MEGA X119 and Inkscape v.0.92.3 (2405546, 2018-03-11) software.

Synthetic hybrid R. canina (seed parent) × R. rubiginosa (pollen parent) (sample ID, D62b_2; SRA: SRR15033882) was a cross between R. canina (sample ID, D3b_2; SRA: SRR15033883) and R. rubiginosa (sample ID, D145b_2; SRA: SRR15033877), and the second synthetic hybrid R. rubiginosa (seed parent) × R. corymbifera (pollen parent) (sample ID, D166b_2; SRA: SRR15033879) was a cross between R. rubiginosa (D145b_2; SRA: SRR15033877) and R. corymbifera (sample ID, D81b_2; SRA: SRR15033881). These hybrids were originally produced by Wissemann and Hellwig43 and kept as a living plant in the Botanical Garden Gießen, Germany. Whole-genome short-read sequencing was performed for both hybrids and their parental plants. The mean coverage of the maternal plant (sample ID, D3b_2) is ~27×, and the paternal plant (sample ID, D145_b2) is ~27×. The hybrid's (sample ID, D62b_2) coverage is ~29×. The reciprocal hybrid (sample ID, D166_b2) has an average of ~30× coverage, whereas its paternal plant (sample ID, D81_b2) is ~19×.

The reads from these six samples were mapped to the S1 subgenome of our assembled R. canina, respectively, using bowtie2 (v.2.5.1)63 with the default parameters. Filtering was applied for all alignments with the same setup ‘samtools view -F 3340 --min-MQ 1'. The coverage of each sample was calculated by ‘bedtools coverage' (v.2.30.0) with a 100 kb window size. SNPs were called with the filtered alignments by bcftools (v.1.9)112. Specifically, ‘bcftools mpileup' ran first with the minimum mapping quality 1, then ‘bcftools call' ran with flags ‘--keep-alts --variants-only --multiallelic-caller'. In the end, only the unique SNPs in each parent were selected to calculate the SNP contribution in the hybrids.

Structural analysis of DNA sequences of whole chromosomes and centromere cuts were performed with ModDotPlot (v.0.9.0)120 using the default parameters. ModDotPlot is a dot plot visualization tool designed for large sequences and whole genomes. The method outputs an identity heat map by rapidly approximating the average nucleotide identity between pairwise combinations of genomic intervals.

The predicted gene model structures in the nuclear genome were annotated by applying the full-length chromosome sequences to Helixer121. Moreover, complete LTR retrotransposons were annotated with the DANTE and DANTE-LTR tools implemented in RepeatExplorer2122,123. R. canina short-read data (SRA: ERR1662939) were subjected to clustering analysis using the RepeatExplorer2 pipeline, and the output library of repeats was subsequently used to annotate the genome with the implemented RepeatMasker124. Tandem-repeat annotation and genome abundance estimation were performed using TAREAN and TideCluster implemented in RepeatExplorer2122.

Total mRNA was extracted from the leaf tissue of R. canina S27 using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA-Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The RNA-sequencing library was prepared with poly(A) enrichment and then sent for sequencing on the NextSeq 2000 platform with 2 × 150 bp mode, resulting in 33,594,132 reads. For a more accurate mapping of RNA sequences, the annotated tandem repeats and transposable elements were hard-masked from the genome. RNA alignment was done using hisat2 (v.2.1.0)125 with the flag --no-mixed. The output was then filtered by only allowing for tag NM:0 and minimum mapping quality 2. To count the transcripts number for each gene, we converted the masked genome to protein sequences based on Helixer121 structural annotation, and then functionally annotated the protein sequences by Mercator4 (v.7.0)126 with both Prot-scriber and Swissprot databases, then htseq-count (v.2.0.1)127 was applied to count the transcripts for all annotated proteins. The gene expression was analysed by DESeq2128. As the high homozygosity between the haplotypes of S1 subgenome, RNA reads were aligned to S1_h1, S2, S3, S4 genome, and the expression level of S1 was then halved (Supplementary Fig. 20 and Supplementary Table 4).

For detecting the functional centromeres of R. canina S27, we designed a specific polyclonal antibody against its CENH3 protein (ARVKHTAARKDRIKTARRQP-C, AB016310), synthetized by LifeTein with immunization in rabbits. The CENH3 gene of R. canina S27 was identified using BLASTP with the parameter ‘-evalue 1e-5 -qcov_hsp_perc 50' and the A. thaliana CENH3 protein HTR12 (AT1G01370) was used as the reference. The ChIP experiment was performed as described previously129 with a few modifications. Young leaves (around 2–5 g) of R. canina S27 were collected and cross-linked in 4% formaldehyde in 1× PBS on ice with vacuum infiltration applied for 30 min. The quenching was performed applying 1 M glycine in each sample followed by vacuum infiltration at room temperature for 15 min. The material was then macerated in liquid nitrogen and the chromatin was extracted. After extraction, the chromatin was sonicated for 30 min on a Bioruptor (Diagenode) until fragments of around 200–600 bp length were achieved (30 s on; 30 s off; in high mode). The sonicated chromatin was incubated over night at 4 °C with 1 µg of each polyclonal antibodies (anti-CENH3 specific for R. canina (LifeTein, AB016310) raised in rabbit and anti-histone H3 (Active Motif, 39064) raised in mouse). Samples with no addition of primary antibodies were also incubated as input control samples and at least two experimental replications were used for each ChIP combination. After incubation, protein beads (anti-rabbit: rProtein A Sepharose FastFlow 50% slurry; anti-mouse: rProtein G Sepharose FastFlow 50% slurry (GE Healthcare)) were washed and added to each complex protein–antibody and incubated for at least 2 h at 4 °C in slow rotation. The final recovered chromatin was eluted from the beads, followed by a de-cross-linking step and final DNA extraction. After quality control using the 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent Technologies), the samples were forwarded for 150 bp paired-end Illumina sequencing. For the analysis, the raw 150 bp paired-end reads were quality checked and then mapped to the R. canina haplotype phased reference genome using the default parameters in bowtie263. The BAM file was converted to bigwig using the bamCompare tool from deeptools2130, and then normalized to reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped. Peak calling was then performed using the MACS3 pipeline131 with the inclusion of the parameters --broad -g 1.9e+9. The plots showing the distribution of different genomic features per chromosome or specific region were constructed using pyGenomeTracks132. The ChIP–seq signals in metaplots to compare chromosome (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 14) and subgenome CENH3 enrichment (Fig. 3e) were calculated by bamCompare with parameters ‘--ignoreDuplicates --scaleFactorsMethod readCount --operation log2' to normalize the CENH3/H3 by read coverage.

Functional centromere regions in the genome assembly of R. canina S27 were annotated based on the detection of CENH3 peaks with MACS3 (see above). The total centromere length was then calculated by the interval between the 5′ and 3′ CENH3 peaks. After alignment to the annotated functional centromeres in R. canina S27, comparable centromeric regions were extracted from DToL R. canina and R. agrestis (https://www.darwintreeoflife.org). The repeat abundance of CANR4 satellite repeats and Ty3/Gypsy ATHILA retrotransposons in the predefined centromeric regions were determined in base pairs for each chromosome of the three investigated Rosa genomes (R. canina S27, R. canina DToL and R. agrestis DToL). To reduce data skewness the data were log-transformed. A Shapiro–Wilk normality test was used to check normal distribution of the data with R (v.4.3.3)92 (29 February 2024). A bivariate Bayesian generalized linear mixed model was implemented using the MCMCglmm package133. The model included pairing type (bivalent B, univalent U and univalent in R. canina but bivalent in R. agrestis Ub) as a fixed effect, while subgenome, genome, and synteny group were random effects, with an unstructured covariance structure (us(trait):random_effect) to account for correlations between response variables. MCMC settings included 100,000 iterations, with a 50,000 burn-in and a thinning interval of 50 and the family parameter was set according to ‘gaussian'. Data visualization was performed using the ggplot274, patchwork134, tidyr135 and dplyr136 packages (Supplementary Fig. 15; source data are available in Supplementary Data 13 and 16). The correlation of CANR4 size with CENH3 abundance (Fig. 3e) was calculated by Spearman's rank correlation as the Shapiro–Wilk normality test resulted in P ≪ 0.5. Linear regression model was fitted using the lm function in R (v.4.4.0), with multiple R2 value as 0.842 and adjusted R2 value as 0.836.

cenLTR sequences were primarily annotated as tandem repeats using TAREAN and TideCluster implemented in RepeatExplorer2122. Further sequence similarity with LTR retrotransposons was performed using the transfer annotation tool of Geneious Prime v.2025.0.2 (https://www.geneious.com) with a minimum sequence similarity threshold of 75%. Using a Geneious Prime plugin for ClustalO137, we performed alignments of consensus cenLTR sequences against the regions with the highest similarity found in the R. canina S27 genome, which all corresponded to different ATHILA elements on chromosomes Rca1_R4 and Rca4_R4. Consensus sequences of cenLTR1–4 are available in Supplementary Dataset 14.

To investigate the methylome of R. canina, we performed enzymatic methyl-sequencing (EM-seq). For this, we extracted genomic DNA from young leaves and the samples were then prepared for an Illumina-compatible library using the NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq Kit and further sequenced on the HiSeq 3000 device with paired-end orientation. We ended up with 68,632,618 pairs of 150 bp reads. EM-seq data were first aligned to the S1_h1, S2, R3, R4 combined subgenomes with Bismark (v.0.23.0) with the flag ‘--local' and duplications were removed by deduplicate_bismark. CpG-, CHG- and CHH-context methylations were then extracted by bismark_methylation_extractor (v.0.23.0). The output was converted to bedgraph by bismark2bedGraph (v.0.23.0) with the flag ‘-CX' activated for CHG and CHH contexts to visualize the methylations chromosome-wide and on the centromeres.

In the metaplots (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 14), all signals were smoothed by the spline.smooth function with spar 0.3 in R (v.4.4.0). CENH3 enrichment was calculated by CENH3 ChIP–seq (log2[CENH3/H3]) signal normalized by coverage. CENH3 enrichment, DNA methylations, ATHILA density and CANR4 were calculated in 50 kb adjacent windows and averaged by all chromosomes of the corresponding subgenome. All chromosome coordinates were scaled on the basis of their distance to centromere against the distance of centromere to telomere. Centromere position was defined on the basis of where the maximum CENH3 enrichment was located. Mitochondrial sequences were masked when computing the CENH3 enrichment. All signal values (y axis of metaplots) were scaled from 0 to 1 based on the global minimum to global maximum except for DNA methylations, for which the original percentage values were retained. The p- and q-arm values were averaged and mirrored.

For immunodetecting the centromeres of R. canina S27, we used polyclonal antibodies against CENH3 protein (see above) and kinetochore protein KNL1 (C-EDHFFGPVSPSFIRPGRLSD, AB015677-3) described previously48, also synthetized by LifeTein and raised in rabbits. To identify the microtubules, we used a commercial antibody against alpha-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T6199) with immunization in mouse. For analysing the distribution of these markers in mitotic cells, root tips were fixed after a pretreatment in 0.2 mM 8-hydroxyquinoline for 4 h at 18 °C. For meiotic stages, the young anthers were directly fixed with no previous antimitotic pretreatment. The immunodetection experiment was performed according to a previously published protocol138 with modifications to R. canina material. Young flower buds were collected on ice in buffer A (15 mM PIPES–NaOH, 80 mM KCl, 0.5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 80 mM sorbitol, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and next incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde in buffer A for 1 h under vacuum infiltration on ice. After the fixation, the samples were washed three times with buffer A and then digested in enzymatic solution containing 1% cellulase-onozuka, 1% cellulase, 1% pectolyase Y23, 1% cytohelicase, 1% macerozyme and 10% pectinase in citrate buffer for 1 h in a humid chamber at 37 °C. To remove the excess of enzymatic solution, the material was gently washed with buffer A and left on ice until the preparation of the slides. A couple of anthers were placed and dissected in a drop of buffer A on a 18 × 18 mm high-precision coverslips, a few μl of polyacrylamide solution (25 µl 15% polyacrylamide (Sigma-Aldrich, A3574) in buffer A plus 1.25 µl of 20% sodium sulfite and 1.25 µl of 20% ammonium persulfate) were added to the dissected anthers, quickly mixed and a second coverslip was put above the first making a sandwich gently squeezing the anthers with a needle to liberate the meiocytes. The sandwiches were allowed to dry for up to 1 h until complete polymerization. After this, the coverslips were carefully separated and incubated in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mM EDTA for at least 1 h, then more 2 h in blocking solution containing 3% BSA in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20. After this period, the primary antibodies were diluted in 1:500 (CENH3 and KNL1) and 1:200 (alpha-tubulin) ratios in blocking solution and applied on each sample, which were sequentially incubated at 4 °C for 48 h. After primary antibody incubation, primary antibodies were detected using secondary antibodies conjugated with specific fluorophores (Alexa Fluor 488 and Abberior StarRed and STAROrange for STED microscopy, also diluted in blocking solution in a proportion of 1:250) and incubated in a dark humid chamber at room temperature for at least 2 h. The material was then washed four to five times for 20 min each in 1× PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 and then mounted in SlowFade Gold medium containing DAPI. The slides were photographed using a super-resolution STED microscope (Abberior instrument facility line; https://abberior-instruments.com/) and posterior brightness and contrast adjustments were done in Photoshop.

For mitotic chromosome preparations, root tips and young flower buds from R. canina S27 plants cultivated in the greenhouse were collected and then fixed in methanol:acetic acid solution (3:1 (v/v)) for 2–24 h at room temperature and then kept at −20 °C until use. After fixation, the root tips were pretreated with an enzymatic solution of 2% cellulase R10-onozuka (Duchefa Bioquemie)/20% pectinase (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1 M citric acid for 40 min at 37 °C in a humid chamber and then squashed in a drop of LB01 buffer (15 mM Tris, 2 mM Na2EDTA, 80 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermine, 15 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5)) and, after frozen in liquid nitrogen, the coverslips were removed.

For meiotic chromosome preparations, the anthers of R. canina C1 (GLM-P-0181117) were dissected from fixed flower buds around 0.5 cm in length. Anthers were washed with 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 (PVP-40; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie) and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15–20 min, followed by enzymatic digestion overnight in a humid chamber at 4 °C in 1% (w/v) cellulase Onozuka R-10 (Serva), 0.2% (w/v) pectolyase Y-23 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5% (w/v) hemicellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5% (w/v) macerozyme R-10 (Duchefa Biochemie) dissolved in citric buffer (0.04 M citric acid and 0.06 M sodium citrate). The anthers were macerated on a slide, squashed in a drop of 70% acetic acid and fixed by freezing in liquid nitrogen.

For FISH experiments, a 22 bp oligo probe directly labelled with a Cy3 fluorophore at the 5′ terminus was designed, synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich and then used to detect the CANR4 satellite repeat (Cy3-5′-ACCCTAGAAGCAAGAAGTTTGG-3′) or an insert of the plasmid carrying the CANR4 dimer (GenBank MK069593) was used as a FISH probe20. For detection of the centromeric LTR ATHILA retrotransposon sequences, we designed a probe based on clustering analysis of Illumina reads (SRA: ERR1662939) using the RepeatExplorer2 pipeline. It was revealed that cluster 5 (CL5) contig contained Ty3/Gypsy/ATHILA sequences. The CL5 contig was used to design PCR primers amplifying a 180 bp product from R. canina genomic DNA. The primers were as follows: Rcan_centr_CL5_for: 5′- GCAAGCGCATAATTTAACC-3′ and Rcan-centr_CL5_rev: 5′-CAATCAAAAATATCCCCCC-3′. The PCR product was purified and cloned into the pDrive vector (Qiagen) and sequenced by the Sanger dideoxy method using the SP6 primer (Micosynth). Clone 11 was submitted to GenBank (PV030978). The inserts of plasmids were directly labelled in a nick translation reaction with Cy5 d-UTP or Cy3 d-UTP fluorochromes (Jena Bioscience) and used for FISH. To detect the 5S and 35S rDNA loci, the full-length 18S rRNA gene from tomato (GenBank: X51576.1) and the Pta71 clone from Triticum aestivum were used to detect the 35S rDNA region, while a 5S rDNA unit (B variant) from R. canina35 and the D2 clone from Lotus japonicus were used to detect the 5S rDNA locus. rDNA robes were directly labelled by Nick translation using Cy5 d-UTP (Jena Bioscience). The slides were prepared in accordance with the protocols described previously35,139. In brief, the slides were treated with pepsin solution (1 mg ml−1 diluted in 0.01 N HCl) for 30 min at 37 °C in a humid chamber, washed with 2× SSC (saline sodium citrate, pH 7.0) solution, post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed again with 2× SSC and then dried in 70% and 100% ethanol. After air drying for at least 30 min, the slides were denatured with hybridization mix (50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate and ~50 ng of each probe (15 μl per slide)) for 5 min at 75 °C and then incubated for at least 18 h at 37 °C. After hybridization, stringency washes were performed with 2× and 0.1× SSC solutions at 42 °C, achieving around 76% stringency. The slides were then washed at room temperature with 2 × SSC solution and mounted with DAPI in the antifade mounting medium Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).

Five mature and well open flowers were collected from the plant in the greenhouse. They were shaken above a microscope slide and their pollen was released on top of the slide. Then, 20 µl of Alexander staining solution (Morphisto, 13441.00250) was added and briefly mixed with the pollen by stirring with the pipette tip. A coverslip 24 × 40 mm was put on top of the mix. Pictures were taken with a Labscope microscope by Zeiss, using 10 × magnification. Five snapshots were counted with the help of the ZEN software.

(a) Hi-C map of 35 chromosome-level scaffolds. Each synteny group contains five chromosomes, which were ordered as S1_h1, S1_h2, S2, R3, and R4 in sequence. The vanished Hi-C signals of the first two chromosomes in each linkage group suggest the high homozygosity of S1_h1 and S1_h2 haplotypes. (b) GenomeScope2 21-mer distribution from HiFi sequences and genome size estimation confirmed the expected R. canina genome size, i.e., 5× 490 Mbp. 21-mer coverage is estimated as 23.5× coverage, consistent with read coverage (23×). The 4x peak at coverage 94 is less invisible, indicating two out of five haplotypes are highly similar. (c) Ploidy and genome structure inference based on 21-mer Smudgeplot analysis. A and B represent the number of heterozygous k-mers identified. Note the high amount of pentaploid heterozygous k-mer combinations AAAAB and AAABB. (d) BUSCO (Universal Single-Copy Orthologues) genes assessment results based on the annotated protein sequences of the pentaploid genome and each individual subgenome set. (e) HiFi k-mer multiplicity frequency by Merqury. The number in the plot legend and different colours indicate the copy numbers found in the assembly. (f) and (g) are Mercator4 statistics of gene contents based on its functional annotation on Rosa canina protein sequences. (f) Percentage of genes occupying a certain gene category. (g) Protein length distribution based on the deviation to category-specific reference lengths. Each bar represents the number of proteins having a certain length difference to the reference length of the corresponding Mercator4 category. The overall small deviation of gene lengths in R. canina comparing to Mercator reference genes indicate most annotated genes in R. canina are complete. (f) and (g) show the results for the subgenome S1 haplotype h1 only since the other three subgenomes show highly similar distribution.

(a) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (the horizontal colour bar at the top of the axis indicates to which subgenome the k-mer is specific; the vertical colour bar on the left of the axis indicates the subgenome to which the chromosome is assigned). The heatmap indicates the Z-scale relative abundance of k-mers. The larger the Z score is, the greater the relative abundance of a k-mer), and (b) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of differential 15-mers confirmed that the genome was successfully phased into four subgenomes based on clearly distinct patterns of both differential k-mers and homoeologous chromosomes. (c) Chromosomal characteristics. From the outer to inner circles (1–9): (1) subgenome assignments based on the k-means algorithm; (2) significant enrichment of subgenome-specific k-mers − the same colour as the subgenome indicates significant enrichment for those subgenome-specific k-mers − white areas are not significantly enriched; (3) normalized proportion (relative) of subgenome-specific k-mers; (4–7) count (absolute) of each subgenome-specific k-mer set; (8) density of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) − if the colour is consistent with the subgenome, it indicates that LTR-RTs are significantly enriched in those subgenome-specific k-mers; grey indicates nonspecific LTR-RTs; and (9) homoeologous blocks. All statistics (2–7) are computed in sliding windows of 1 Mb. Notably, the fraction of subgenome differentiation between the S1 and S2 subgenomes was restricted to proximal regions, likely representing their different centromere compositions. Whereas R3 and R4 subgenomes are clearly distinct from each other in their specific k-mer spectrum.

Pairwise comparisons of synteny of all R. canina subgenomes (S1_h1/S1_h2, S2, R3, and R4) and all R. agrestis subgenomes (S1, S2, R3, and R4_h1/R4_h2) juxtaposed against the corresponding chromosomes of R. chinensis (sect. Synstylae) and R. rugosa (sect. Rosa). Note that only synteny blocks and rearrangement blocks greater than 50 kb in length are shown here. (c) GENESPACE synteny and phylogenetic relationships of the five chromosome sets of our R. canina assembly, R. agrestis from DToL and their close relatives R. chinensis and R. rugosa. Chromosomes are normalized by number of genes. (d–e) Unrooted Maximum Likelihood phylogenies of the homoeologous R. canina and R. agrestis chromosomes and chromosomes from the respective syntenic groups of the diploid species R. chinensis and R. rugosa based on multiple alignments of whole chromosome sequences. The upper panel (d) exemplarily depicts the phylogeny of chromosomes of synteny group 1. Synteny groups 2 − 7 are presented in (e). Filled chromosomes refer to subgenomes of R. canina belonging to the Synstylae clade (violet/light blue) and Rosa clade (dark/light orange). Chromosomes from R. agrestis are marked with hatched white filling, while the diploid roses are marked with black hatched filling.

The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are marked in the upper right corner to predict the insertion time boundaries of LTR-RTs on the subgenome for R. canina (a), R. canina DToL (b) and R. agrestis DToL (c). The colours of the subgenomes are consistent throughout the Fig. panels.

(a) Genome-wide distribution of pollen SCOs from pollen of eigth dogrose species (subsect. Caninae: three samples of R. canina, two samples of R. corymbifera; subsect. Rubigineae three samples of R. rubiginosa) from two subsections in the R. agrestis genome assembly from DToL. The bubble map represents chromosomal hits from the SAM file output, which were selectively filtered to display loci with a single alternative hit. The size of the symbols corresponds to the mean count of pollen SCOs mapped to each chromosomal pair, identifying seven bivalent chromosome pairs within the R. agrestis (subsect. Rubigineae) genome assembly and seven different pairs in which R. rubiginosa (subsect. Rubigineae) pollen SCO mapped. (b) Plastome phylogeny of the genus Rosa. Maximum Likelihood phylogeny of the genus Rosa retrieved from plastome sequences obtained in this study and those available in Genbank (Supplementary Table 4). All nodes which were not supported by 100% bootstrap are indicated by dashed lines. (c) Representative histogram of flow cytometric measurements of nuclei isolated from nutlets of the sexual diploid R. rugosa to determine the endosperm/embryo ratios. The observed endosperm/embryo ratio 1.5, fits to the expectation of 3x endosperm and a 2x embryo originated by sexual reproduction including endosperm fertilization. Please note that the gain of the fluorescence was adjusted to position the embryo peak at channel 100. For a better visualization of the endosperm peak the scale of the Y-axis was manually adjusted to 200 counts (red rectangles). Em1: embryo G0/G1, Em2: embryo G2, En: endosperm G0/G1. (d) The parental SNP ratios detected in each subgenome of the hybrid R. canina × R. rubiginosa (Sample ID: D62b_2). SNPs were called by aligning short reads to our assembled R. canina (S27) S1_h1. The y-axis displays the proportion of SNPs in each subgenome. For instance, ~62% SNPs detected in the alignments to S1 subgenome are the same as the maternal R. canina (Sample ID: D3b_2), while only around 5% SNPs are from the paternal R. rubiginosa (Sample ID: D145_b2), indicating the S1 subgenome of the hybrid was supposed to be contributed by the maternal parent. Overall, the hybrid subgenome S1, S2, and R3 are all from maternal parent R. canina, while one R4 subgenome is from maternal R. canina and the other R4 is contributed by paternal R. rubiginosa. So, the subgenome composition of the hybrid should be S1, S2, R3, R4_h1/h2. (e) Assessment of the parental genomes contribution of a synthetic hybrid between R. rubiginosa (female donor) and R. corymbifera (male donor), confirming the sexual reproduction and subgenome's inheritance trough male and female meiosis. Note, that R. corymbifera belongs to subsect. Caninae and is a very close relative of R. canina and so it has two copies of S1 subgenome. (f) The parental SNP ratios detected in each subgenome of the hybrid R. rubiginosa × R. corymbifera (Sample ID: D166b_2). The plot interpretation is the same as (d).

(b) Close up visualization of the cenLTR array and insertion of an ATHILA inside the cenLTR array. (c) Alignment of the cenLTR consensus sequence with the LTR sequence from the inserted ATHILA element showing over 75% sequence similarity.

Metaplot of CENH3 enrichment, DNA methylation, and centromeric elements—ATHILA and CANR4 density—per subgenome. CENH3 enrichment marked in dark red was calculated by CENH3 ChIP-seq (log2 CENH3/H3) signal normalized by coverage. DNA methylations have three contexts with CpG marked in black, CHG maked in dark grey, and CHH marked in light grey. ATHILA (yolk yellow) and CANR4 (magenta) were presented by their density. All signals were calculated in 50 kb adjacent windows. All chromosome coordinates were scaled based on their distance to centromere against the distance of centromere (CEN) to telomere (TEL). Centromere position (CEN) was defined by where maximum CENH3 enrichment was located. All signal values (y-axis) were scaled from 0 to 1 by global minimum to global maximum except for DNA methylations, which retained the original percentage values. The p- and q-arm values were averaged and mirrored. Please note the higher CENH3 association with CANR4-based centromeres compared with ATHILA-based centromeres.

(a–b) Immunodetection of the KNL1 protein (in red) at all centromeres of R. canina revealed a differential distribution, with the presence of large and small centromeres, as shown in more detail in the upper and lower insets (a). (c–d) Distribution of the centromeric satellite repeats CANR4 (in magenta) and 5S rDNA (in cyan) in the R. canina miotic chromosomes, while the CANR4 repeat is present at the centromeres of a set of chromosomes. The 5S rDNA is located at the pericentromeric regions of chr1, insets in c and d highlight the pericentromeric location of 5S loci (right) and a weak CANR4 signal (left). (e–h) Distribution of the CANR4 repeat in meiotic diakinesis, revealing its distribution mostly in univalents according (e and f), while the pattern of 5S and 35S rDNA (g and h) (cyan and yellow, respectively) hybridized to three sites, two of which were located near 35S sites on a bivalent (inset in h) corresponding to the Rca3_S1_h1/h2 chromosomes as found in our assembly annotation. Week signals are highlighted in the insets present in g and h. (i–m) FISH with CANR4 and ATHILA on a diakinesis of R. canina (i–k) and mitotic cells of R. chinensis (l) and R. rugosa (m). Asterisks in i–k point to bivalent-forming chromosomes. The experiments for this set of data were repeated at least 10 times and independently presenting similar results. Scale bar = 5 µm.

(a) A single polyad showing at least two nuclei with seven CENH3 signals (arrowheads), while several other nuclei show irregular number of centromeric foci. (b–d) Different Z-stacks of three polyads showing few nuclei with seven centromeric foci, while several other smaller nuclei are formed with irregular number of centromeres. Immunostaining experiments were repeated independently at least ten times outputting similar results. Scale bars = 10 µm.

Metrics details

Each spring, billions of Bogong moths escape hot conditions across southeast Australia by migrating up to 1,000 km to a place that they have never previously visited—a limited number of cool caves in the Australian Alps, historically used for aestivating over summer1,2. At the beginning of autumn, the same individuals make a return migration to their breeding grounds to reproduce and die. Here we show that Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby navigating in their inherited migratory direction towards their distant goal. By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator3,4,5, we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth's known magnetic sense4), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions. Visual interneurons in different regions of the moth's brain responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation, firing maximally when the moth was headed southwards. Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth's magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination.

The Bogong moth (Agrotis infusa; Fig. 1a) is an iconic and threatened migratory insect endemic to Australia. During the austral spring, newly eclosed Bogong moths make a highly directed migration of up to 1,000 km to a geographically restricted assemblage of high alpine caves in the extreme southeast of the country (Fig. 1b), a place that they have never previously visited. After 3–4 months of dormancy (aestivation; Fig. 1c), the same individuals return to their breeding grounds during autumn to reproduce, after which they die1,2. We have recently shown4 that these moths steer flight during the long-distance phase6 of their migration by sensing the Earth's magnetic field and correlating its inherent directional information with one or more visual landmarks, potentially using these landmarks as temporary orientation beacons along the route. However, exactly which natural visual features are used by Bogong moths for navigation remains unclear. A dark feature on the nocturnal horizon, one or more stars, or the moon are all possible cues. In the austral night sky, the constellations of stars and the bright Milky Way are particularly prominent and have excellent potential as reliable navigational cues7,8. Their predictable celestial positions over the course of each night make stellar cues useful for determining an arbitrary compass direction for short-range orientation (for example, for dung beetles9,10,11 and cricket frogs12) and as a geographically relevant compass for long-range navigation (for example, for birds13,14, humans15,16 and possibly seals17). However, to our knowledge, no invertebrate is currently known to use the stars for discerning specific geographical directions (that is, a direction relative to north) for directed long-range navigation to a distant goal. Here we show that moths have this ability and use the stars as a compass during the long-distance phase6 of their migration to determine and follow an inherited migratory bearing, reversing this bearing when the season changes. Moreover, we show that visual interneurons in the moth's brain are tuned to specific orientations of the night sky, suggesting their involvement in a stellar compass network.

Narendra, from ref. 2. b, Adult moths migrate from their breeding grounds in various regions of southeast Australia to the Australian Alps during spring (green arrows), where they aestivate in cool alpine caves over summer, and return to the breeding grounds in autumn (purple arrows). At the breeding grounds, they mate, lay eggs and die. Immature stages develop underground during the winter. The red dot indicates the experimental site at Adaminaby. Scale bar, 500 km. c, Around 16,000 moths per m2 aestivate on the walls of specific caves in the Australian Alps for up to 4 months before making the return migration. Inset: close-up image of the moths.

Using a light trap located at Mount Selwyn, about 70 km north-northeast of the main alpine aestivation sites in southeast New South Wales, we captured migrating Bogong moths departing northwards during their autumn return migration (Fig. 1b). Captured moths were transferred to our nearby experimental site and tethered and flown within a modified Mouritsen–Frost flight simulator3,4,5 that continuously measured the instantaneous orientations of vigorously flying moths that were free to turn in any azimuthal direction (details of the simulator, the tethering and the criteria used to select moths for analysis are provided in the Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1). To test whether Bogong moths fly in their inherited migratory directions under natural night skies, two transparent ultraviolet (UV)-transmissive non-magnetic cylindrical flight simulator arenas were placed on an open hilltop (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Moths tethered within the arena had a full view of the surrounding landscape (meadows, trees and hills) as well as of the entire dome of the night sky. They also experienced the natural geomagnetic field.

If Bogong moths use the stars for maintaining a geographically specific, inherited migratory heading, they need to deal with the seasonal differences in the appearance of the stars (Fig. 3a), as well as with the nightly movements of the stars across the sky that result from the rotation of the Earth. Such movements substantially shift and rotate the stripe of the Milky Way and the positions of the stars as the night progresses, therefore creating a potential problem for migrating animals that rely on them to navigate a straight course. Early during the night (20:49 ± 17 min), under a cloudless autumn starry sky with a waxing gibbous half-full moon, moths flown in the two arenas were significantly oriented northward, in their expected migratory direction (Fig. 2a; n = 95, α = 5°). When tested 3 h later (23:42 ± 17 min), when the stars and the moon had shifted substantially (and the sky was still cloudless), the same cohort of moths (which had been swapped between arenas to eliminate landmarks as possible cues) retained their northward orientation (Fig. 2b; n = 95, α = 355°), with their earlier and later mean orientation directions being indistinguishable (likelihood-ratio test on population means for all 95 moths, early versus late: χ2 = 2.663, d.f. = 1, P = 0.103). If one exclusively considers moths that were highly oriented both earlier and later in the evening (r > 0.8 in both trials: 35 out of 95 moths), this finding is only reinforced (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Thus, Bogong moths not only orient in their expected migratory direction under natural night skies, but they also do so despite the nightly movements of the stars and moon.

a,b, The orientation directions of 95 migratory moths (blue vectors) under a cloudless autumn night sky (Adaminaby, over 3 nights at the end of March 2023), early in the evening (a; 20:49 ± 17 min, α = 5°, 95% confidence interval = 22°, R* = 3.981, P = 4.23 × 10−20) and again 3 h later when the half-moon and stars had substantially shifted their positions (b; 23:42 ± 17 min, α = 355°, 95% confidence interval = 42°, R* = 2.677, P = 5.76 × 10−9). Sunset occurred at 19:00 ± 4 min. Moths were tethered in a clear cylindrical UV-transmissive Perspex arena with a full view of the sky and the surrounding landscape. c, The orientation directions of 44 migratory moths (blue vectors) under a completely overcast autumn night sky (Adaminaby, end of March 2023) at 21.30 ± 18 min (α = 13°, 95% confidence interval = 30°, R* = 2.828, P = 7.56 × 10−10). Each red mean vector (MV) in a–c results from weighting the mean directions and mean directedness (vector lengths) of all of the individual moths. Statistical analysis was performed using one-sided Moore's modified Rayleigh test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; corrected P = 4.23 × 10−20 (a), 5.76 × 10−9 (b) and 7.56 × 10−10 (c) (Methods). The direction and directedness of mean vectors is given by α and R*, respectively. The dashed circles show the required R* value for statistical significance: P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively for increasing radius. The red radial dashes show the 95% confidence intervals. gN, geographical north; mN, magnetic north. Sky images in a and b, Stellarium.

Source data

The dim pattern of polarized light18 associated with the moon is also a potential compass cue. Lunar polarized light is used by nocturnal dung beetles for straight-line orientation19 but, when the moon is absent, they instead revert to the Milky Way, and are disoriented when the sky is obscured by clouds9. However, substantial migrations of Bogong moths also occur around the new moon (E.W. and B.F., unpublished data), implying that, if polarized light is used as a compass cue, it is not essential.

Notably, on nights on which the moon and stars were obscured by heavy cloud, Bogong moths were still oriented in a northward direction (Fig. 2c; n = 44, α = 13°), with a mean orientation direction that was not significantly different to either of the two mean directions (Fig. 2a,b) recorded on clear nights (likelihood-ratio tests comparing mean orientation direction in Fig. 2c with those in Fig. 2a,c: χ2 = 0.007 and 0.242, d.f. = 1, P = 0.935 and 0.886, respectively). Thus, even when the stars and moon are unavailable, Bogong moths can still navigate in their inherited migratory direction, strongly suggesting reliance on the only known remaining compass cue—the Earth's magnetic field.

The most parsimonious explanation for these results is that, in overcast conditions, Bogong moths rely on the geomagnetic field as their compass for navigation, which raises the critical question of whether Bogong moths use a stellar compass at all.

To investigate whether Bogong moths use a stellar compass, we captured Bogong moths at Mount Selwyn that were migrating roughly southwards into the Australian Alps in spring and back northward during autumn (Fig. 1b). Moths were transferred to a purpose-built dark ferromagnetic-free laboratory at our field site and tethered and flown in a flight simulator (details of the laboratory are provided in the Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1c–i). The simulator arena was placed at the centre of a three-axis Helmholtz coil system that was used to null (that is, remove) the Earth's magnetic field and therefore disable the influence of the moth's magnetic sense. Moths were subjected to a natural clear moonless austral night sky (matching the date and time of the experiment) projected at natural intensity onto a flat screen placed on top of the dark-walled arena (Fig. 3a) and their flights were recorded for 5 min.

Under naturally oriented night skies (geographical north 0°; Fig. 3a) and in the absence of a magnetic field, moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions4 during two springs and two autumns in 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 3c): roughly southwards in spring (n = 70, mean vector direction α = 168°) and north-northwest in autumn (n = 54, α = 341°). Under the natural sky stimulus rotated by 180° (arena-centric geographical north now at 180°), the moths flew in almost exactly the opposite direction (Fig. 3d), turning by 187° in spring (n = 68, α = 355°) and by 174° in autumn (n = 56, α = 167°). When the stars of the natural sky were randomly distributed (identical light intensity, no directional information: Fig. 3b), moths were disoriented in both seasons (spring: Fig. 3e, n = 58; autumn: Fig. 3f, n = 49). Full statistics are provided in Extended Data Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 1. Moth flight directions during spring and autumn, and under rotated and unrotated skies in either season, were significantly different (Mardia–Watson–Wheeler tests; Extended Data Fig. 2g). These results show that Bogong moths can use the distribution of stars within the austral night sky alone as a navigational compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby determining their required migratory direction, during both their southward spring migration and their northward autumn migration. When these stars were rearranged randomly, this ability disappears. Apart from humans15,16 and several night-migratory songbirds6,13,14, to our knowledge, no other animal is known to use the stars to navigate in a specific geographical direction. Birds use the centre of stellar rotation to determine north or south6,13,14 and, if Bogong moths do the same, this might explain their ability to hold an inherited migratory course despite the nightly movements of the stars (Fig. 2a,b). Alternatively, Bogong moths might possess a time-compensated star compass that can account for the predictable movements of the stars, analogous to the time-compensated sun compass of Monarch butterflies3. However, exactly which aspects of the starry sky are used by Bogong moths remains to be determined.

In summary, our behavioural results demonstrate that Bogong moths, like night-migratory birds20, use a stellar compass and a geomagnetic compass and, like birds6,21, remain oriented in their inherited migratory direction when at least one is available, either the natural stars alone (Fig. 3c,d) or the Earth's magnetic field alone (Fig. 2c). When neither cue is available the moths are disoriented (Fig. 3e,f).

To explore the neural basis of the Bogong moth's stellar compass, we recorded intracellularly from visual neurons in three regions of the Bogong moth brain22,23: the optic lobe, the central complex (CX; the insect navigation centre24) and the lateral accessory lobes (LAL; the steering centre25). We measured neural responses to the same stimuli that induced behavioural responses in our laboratory flight experiments (dorsal starry sky, nulled magnetic field). Restrained moths were mounted in the apparatus with an eastward orientation relative to the initial starry sky. During experiments, we rotated the sky through 360° from this starting point. Impaled neurons (n = 28) revealed a peak spiking frequency at a specific sky rotation angle φmax (that is, at a specific compass direction of the moth; Fig. 4a). Their responses fell into four physiological categories: (1) unimodally excited; (2) unimodally inhibited; (3) rotation-direction-selective unimodal; or (4) rotation-direction-selective bimodal (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3). While unimodal neurons showed a single activity peak (maximal excitation or maximal inhibition), bimodal neurons showed two peaks separated by approximately 180°. Responses of neurons in categories 1 and 2 were largely insensitive to movement direction, with clockwise and anticlockwise sky rotations leading to similar responses. By contrast, category 3 and 4 neurons responded differently to clockwise and anticlockwise rotations. Despite the diversity of response types, φmax was consistent across repetitions, with the majority of cells having a tuning variability of 20° or less (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Figs. 4–6). However, when randomized stars (Fig. 3b) were rotated as a control, cells failed to show tuning (Figs. 4e and 5b). As the control shares local contrast and motion cues, its inability to drive the recorded neurons suggests that these neurons are not simply movement detectors but are tuned to features present in the natural starry sky.

a, Examples of general response categories (1–4) for 360° clockwise (CW; grey curves) and anticlockwise (CCW; purple curves) night sky stimulus rotations (mean ± s.d. tuning curves show spike impulses (imp) per s). In the moth's reference frame, flying under a natural (stationary) sky, 0° = 360° indicates that it is heading north; 90° indicates that it is heading east; 180° indicates that it is heading south; and 270° indicates that it is heading west. φmax is defined at the top (red dashed line). The horizontal dashed lines show the pre-stimulation response level. b, The φmax for all cells (note that bimodal cells have two φmax ≈ 180° apart; separate plots for all four cell categories are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3). The red vector gives the mean φmax (α) and the vector length (r) for all 18 unimodal cells (one-sided Rayleigh test, spring and autumn pooled, P = 0.00319; 95% confidence limits (black straight lines), ±35°). The dashed circles show the required r value for statistical significance: P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively for increasing radius. Unimodal cells fire maximally when moths head southwards (171° ± 35°) under natural skies (irrespective of season). c, The variability in φmax for successive clockwise (average 9°) or anticlockwise (average 10°) sky rotations in individual cells. d, φmax for dot and bar control stimuli in a subset of unimodal and bimodal cells (autumn 2020). The empty circles show the second φmax for bimodal cells. The bottom row shows the angular difference between the cell φmax for dot/bar stimuli and its starry sky φmax (quoted ± angular limits, dashed lines). e, The response SNR for different stimuli (grey dots, included data; black dots, outliers). For the box plots, the box limits show the 25th to 75th percentiles, the centre line shows the median value, and the whiskers extend to 1.5 × interquartile range. The SNR is the maximum response during sky rotation (that is at φ = φmax) divided by the standard error before rotation. Statistical analysis was performed using two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests; *P = 0.052, ***P = 0.00011. Sky/control data: 2018, 2019 and 2020; dot/bar data, 2020.

To further test the selectivity of these responses, a subset of six cells was also stimulated with artificial compass cues (of natural intensity) that mimicked aspects of the Milky Way (Fig. 4d): its brightest region around the Carina nebula (revolving dot) and its stripe-like shape (rotating bar). All but one of the cells responded to both cues (dot, n = 6; bar, n = 5) and these qualitatively resembled their response to the starry sky, with similar azimuthal tuning (deviations from starry sky φmax were clustered around 0° across neurons; Fig. 4d). Whereas the maximum deviation from the starry sky φmax was larger for the dot (52°) than the bar (15°), the responses to the bar were weaker than those to the starry sky or the dot (Fig. 4e). Thus, the bar more closely reflected the cell's azimuthal tuning to the starry sky, while the dot reflected its response strength. This suggests that these neurons are suited to encode at least two features of the starry sky: the extended shape of the Milky Way and its brightest region around the Carina nebula.

Notably, across the entire population of unimodal cells, φmax values consistently clustered in the Southern Hemisphere, independent of recording season or response type (Fig. 4b; n = 18, α = 171° ± 35°). Thus, in the reference frame of a Bogong moth flying under a natural (stationary) sky, unimodal cells fire maximally when moths head southwards (irrespective of season: a Mardia–Watson–Wheeler test indicates that the spring and autumn mean φmax values do not significantly differ: P > 0.2). Notably, head direction cells recorded in the medial pallium of fledgling shearwater chicks show a similar behaviour—all fire maximally when the chick's head is directed towards magnetic north (even though the chick will eventually fly due south on its inaugural migration)26. In fixed quiescent Monarch butterflies, CX neurons recorded extracellularly in response to a rotating ‘sun' stimulus (a bright green LED at 30° elevation), also revealed narrow φmax tuning27. However, when allowed to fly and receive self-motion cues this tuning disappeared, revealing dependence on behavioural state27. As our Bogong moths were likewise fixed and quiescent, we cannot rule out that the narrow φmax tuning we report is also due to behavioural state.

The functional diversity of neurons also corresponded to a morphological diversity. Of the 28 neurons that responded to our stimuli, we anatomically identified 11 cells by intracellular tracer injections (Fig. 5a). The identified neurons were distributed across all three brain regions targeted in our recordings: the optic lobes, the CX and the LAL. While the optic lobe is responsible for primary visual processing, the CX is a higher-order integration centre for spatial orientation, navigation and action selection28,29. The LAL is the major output target of the CX and generates steering commands to downstream motor circuits25. For visually guided migration in Bogong moths, all three brain regions are therefore expected to have key roles in processing visual compass cues and transforming these signals into steering commands. While the optic lobe neurons showed sharply tuned responses with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the responses of the two CX neurons that we held long enough to record from were less pronounced (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Figs. 4 and 7; cell 181122_003), indicating that visual stimulation alone is insufficient to fully drive these cells. The three anatomically identified category 4 (bimodal) cells localized to the LAL and the ventrolateral and ventromedial protocerebrum—their direction-selective responses are suggestive of a potential role in steering. The six identified category 1 and 2 (unimodal) cells localized to the optic lobe and CX, locations that are more concerned with early-stage sensory processing (optic lobe) and heading encoding (CX).

Although we obtained only a sparse sample of neurons, and despite the constraints of in vivo intracellular electrophysiology, our data nonetheless demonstrate that information from the starry sky is encoded in the moth's brain. While these neurons are located in brain regions that are known to analyse multiple navigational cues in other insects24, surprisingly, our identified cell types have not previously been described in analyses of insect compass pathways24 or head-direction circuits30 (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 7). Further work is clearly required to understand these neural circuits in detail, and whether their properties vary with behavioural state.

Our results indicate that a stellar compass is sufficient on its own to guide Bogong moths during their migration, and this may become useful if the geomagnetic field becomes perturbed by a magnetic storm or by local magnetic anomalies31 (which are admittedly not strong in southeast Australia, and typically alter field strength by only a few per cent). Under natural conditions, a geomagnetic compass is also sufficient if the stars become obscured by cloud. When neither cue is available, moths are disoriented. Moreover, we have also shown that Bogong moths possess previously undescribed neurons in the navigational centres of the brain that respond to a specific orientation of the night sky. Notably, these neurons are all tuned to a common azimuth, firing maximally when the moth is heading southwards, irrespective of season (Fig. 4b).

Newly eclosed Bogong moths therefore rely on stellar and geomagnetic compass cues to target a distant and restricted geographical region they have never previously visited (during spring), relying on the same global cues for the reverse migration (during autumn). For Bogong moths, how these cues are interpreted to determine the desired migratory heading depends on three spatiotemporal factors: the moth's geographical origin (different breeding populations across southeast Australia migrate in different directions to reach the same target), the season (moths migrate towards the mountains in spring and return to the breeding grounds in autumn) and the time of night (stellar positions change due to Earth's rotation). As in other insects24, to move in a desired (migratory) heading direction, Bogong moths must first establish their current heading (for example, using global compass cues), compute the angular difference between their current and desired headings and, depending on geographical location, season and time of night, generate a steering command that turns the moth to its required migratory direction. While head direction is well understood to be encoded by the CX24,30,32, our understanding of how desired heading is encoded is only now emerging33,34. However, consistent with data from flies28,34,35,36,37, bees38 and Monarch butterflies33, the computation of desired migratory heading in Bogong moths could well take place in the fan-shaped body of the CX. Indeed, our identification of starry sky responses in a fan-shaped body input neuron (Fig. 5a) supports this notion. However, exactly how the fan-shaped body of Bogong moths accounts for geographical location, season and time of night to generate a desired migratory heading remains unclear.

The question remains of what aspects of a moonless austral night sky might be useful as compass cues for Bogong moths. Humans15,16 and birds6,13,14 can use individual stars, or constellations of stars, as compass cues for distinguishing specific geographical directions, but it remains unclear how many of the brightest stars are discernible by the moth's small compound eyes. However, the Milky Way—which, in the Southern Hemisphere, is a bright extended stripe of light that becomes brightest somewhere in the southern half of the sky7,10—is very likely visible to Bogong moths39, as also suggested by our physiological results (Fig. 4). Its shape and celestial position at any time of night are predictable from one night to the next throughout each migratory season, and its rotation around the South Celestial Pole over any single night retains the brightest parts of the Milky Way (including the Carina nebula) somewhere in the southern half of the sky, but not consistently due south. Exactly where the brightest parts are located depends on season and time of night and can vary from southeast (Figs. 2a and 3b) to almost due west (Fig. 3a). Thus, a simple phototactic mechanism, with Bogong moths orienting towards the brightest parts of the sky in spring and away from them in autumn, seems unlikely. Furthermore, the presence of a bright moon in different parts of the sky would severely disrupt such a mechanism. However, Bogong moths orient in their inherited migratory direction even when the moon is present (Fig. 2a,b).

Notably, the Southern Hemisphere Milky Way is used to determine an arbitrary compass direction for short-range orientation in ball-rolling dung beetles7,9,10, not for distinguishing a specific geographical direction to travel towards a distant goal, but as a visual guide to keep a straight bearing for a few minutes in any random (goalless) direction. A straight trajectory is the safest for taking the beetle away from the furious competition of the dung heap. By contrast, Bogong moths, navigate long distances over many nights towards a distant destination they have never previously visited and therefore require a global compass to distinguish and hold their specific, inherited, geographical migratory heading. While the Earth's magnetic field certainly acts as one such compass4 (Fig. 2c), the southern night sky clearly acts as another, with each of these compasses probably taking over from the other when the salience of either diminishes or fails (Figs. 2c and 3c,d). However, exactly which celestial features are used for the stellar compass, whether the common directional tuning of stellar compass neurons has any role in the computation of desired heading, and how stellar, magnetic and any other hitherto unknown sensory cues en route are behaviourally and neurally integrated for robust navigation (including how and whether they are calibrated against each other40), all remain enticing topics for future research.

Bogong moths (A. infusa) of both sexes were caught in the wild during their autumn and spring migrations (2019 and 2018) using a LepiLED insect light (www.gunnarbrehm.de), or a vertical beam search light (model GT175, Ammon Luminaire Company), placed in front of a white sheet suspended between two trees. Almost all of the animals were caught near the Mount Selwyn Snowfields (southeast New South Wales, Australia: 35.914° S, 148.444° E; elevation, 1,600 m), which is approximately 70 km north-northeast of the nearest aestivation cave in the Main Range of the New South Wales Alps. Thus, to reach these caves in spring, these moths (a tiny subset of all moths travelling to the mountains in a multitude of directions from across southeast Australia) would be expected to fly south-southwest in spring, and returning moths might be expected to travel north-northeast in autumn (which agrees with our behavioural results). A few animals were also caught near Thredbo (Dead Horse Gap, southeast New South Wales, Australia: 36.524° S, 148.260° E, elevation 1,580 m). These moths were used for electrophysiology only. Each captured moth was transferred to its own plastic container to isolate it from influence by other moths. After capture, moths were transported to the testing site Glenhare, a rural property near Adaminaby New South Wales (36.040° S, 148.864° E; elevation, 1,250 m), fed with 20% honey solution (in water) and stored in a cool and sheltered place (exposed to the natural light cycle) to recover from stress induced by capture.

A purpose-built ferromagnetic-free laboratory located at Glenhare, Adaminaby (built on a concrete slab reinforced with fibreglass and constructed entirely from non-magnetic materials) housed the indoor behavioural and electrophysiological experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Each experimental apparatus (behaviour and electrophysiology) has its own dedicated earth separated from the mains earth (through a 6-mm thick, 30-mm wide and 12-m long copper strap dug into the ground below the concrete slab). Background levels of radio-frequency disturbances at this rural site are extraordinarily low4. All of the experiments were performed on dark-adapted moths in darkness at night (beginning at least 1 h after sunset). Darkness was achieved with black-out blinds (to remove residual starlight and moonlight from outside) and dark cloth around the experimental apparatus (to shield from the minimal stray light emitted from the equipment).

The non-magnetic electrophysiological apparatus (such as table and animal mounts; Extended Data Fig. 1f,g) was constructed from Thorlabs aluminium optomechanical components using high-grade stainless-steel fasteners. Vibration isolation between the aluminium pillar legs and the aluminium bread board table (on which the moth and manipulators were mounted) was provided by four high-grade stainless steel Stillpoints Ultra 6 (with Ultra base) isolators (Stillpoints). The moth was mounted (see below) onto a pillar attached to the bread board table, and a custom-built non-magnetic Sensapex piezo micromanipulator (Sensapex Oy, Oulu), also attached to the pillar, was used to move and advance a glass microelectrode. A removable circular UV-transmissive Perspex disc (diameter, 250 mm; thickness, 5 mm), covered in a layer of UV-transmissive diffusing paper (Lee Filters 251 1/4 white diffuser) and mounted 127 mm above the moth, was used for projection of celestial visual stimuli (see below). The electrophysiological apparatus was placed at the centre of a computer-controlled, double-wrapped41 three-axis (3D) Helmholtz coil system custom built in aluminium and copper (University of Oldenburg workshop; outer coil diameters; x, 900 mm; y, 835 mm; z, 775 mm) to create a nulled magnetic field (Extended Data Fig. 8) around the experimental moth. These coils were mounted onto the experimental table holding the moth and manipulators. The coil systems were powered by constant-current power supplies (Kepco, BOP 50-2M) and the current running through the coil systems was controlled through High-Speed USB Carriers (USB-9162, National Instruments) and custom-written codes in MATLAB (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks). Further details were reported previously3,4. Before each experimental session, Meda FVM-400 magnetometer measurements ensured that the magnetic field was nulled within the apparatus (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

The non-magnetic behavioural apparatus (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i) consisted of a modified Mouritsen–Frost flight simulator3,4,5,42 used to record the virtual flight path of tethered migratory Bogong moths. In brief, each flight simulator consisted of a cylindrical Perspex arena (diameter, 50 cm; height, 35 cm) placed vertically onto an aluminium table with a clear Perspex top within a 3D Helmholtz coil system (as described above, but with coil outer dimensions: x, 1,245 mm; y, 1,300 mm; z, 780 mm). Again, the nulled magnetic field conditions within the coils were carefully monitored using the Meda FVM-400 magnetometer (Extended Data Fig. 8a). The arena walls were covered with two layers of black felt. An optical encoder (E4T Miniature Optical Kit, US Digital) was mounted in the middle of a UV-transmissive Perspex disc (diameter, 50 cm; thickness, 0.5 cm), which was placed on top of the arena like a lid. A layer of UV-transmissive diffusing paper (Lee Filters 251 1/4 white diffuser) was placed on top of the disc (and served as a screen for dorsal projection of celestial stimuli; see below). A fine vertical tungsten rod (the encoder shaft: diameter, 0.5 mm; length, 153 mm), inserted into the axial centre of the optical encoder, extended downwards into the arena and allowed the attachment of tethered flying moths (see below). We used the encoder manufacturer's software (USB1 Digital Explorer 1.07, US Digital) to continuously record the moth's heading relative to geographical north (gN), therefore allowing us to reconstruct the moth's virtual flight path in the presence of celestial visual cues. An LED projector (ASUS S1 Mobile), neutral density (ND) filters (optical density between 4 and 5 log units) and a mirror placed at 45° under the Perspex tabletop were used to project a dim moving (10 mm s−1) pattern of optic flow onto a screen (Lee Filters 251 1/4 white diffusing paper) placed beneath the arena and therefore below the tethered flying moth (Extended Data Fig. 1d). The direction of the optic flow was controlled by custom written software (M. York), which coupled the encoder system (USB1 or USB4 encoder data acquisition USB device, US Digital) through a feedback loop. Thus, the optic flow would always move from head to tail below the moth, instantaneously changing direction as the moth changed direction. The mean radiance of the optic flow at the location of the performing moth was 2.06 ± 0.19 × 109 photons cm−2 s−1 sr−1.

A natural moonless starry austral night sky, in both the electrophysiological and the behavioural rigs, was projected using a downward pointing projector (behavioural rig: LED projector ASUS S1 Mobile; electrophysiological rig: Sony MP-CL1A laser projector; spectra of both projectors are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9d). Each projector was mounted sufficiently high above the moth in each rig to provide clear and correctly sized dorsal images of the night sky. To avoid unwanted stray light, each projector was housed in a custom-built 3D-printed plastic box featuring an opening in front of the lens and ventilation slits above the projector.

The free software Stellarium43 was used to simulate the moonless starry night sky over Canberra (about 80 km from Adaminaby as the crow flies) at 21:30 on four respective dates: 1 October 2018 (spring 2018), 21 March 2018 (autumn 2018), 21 October 2019 (spring 2019) and 27 February 2019 (autumn 2019). Screenshots (screen resolution 7,480 × 720 pixels) of these simulated starry skies were taken, cut in a circular shape using CorelDRAW X5 and saved as PNG files (300 dpi) to create the stimulus images (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Subtended at the moth, celestial images projected onto the circular screens in each rig (see above) provided 160° (behavioural rig) and 100° (electrophysiological rig) fields of view of the starry night sky centred on the zenith. Celestial images contained grey level values ranging from 4 (darkest) to 255 (brightest, on a scale of 0–255), with an average grey level of 62. The quality of the night sky provided by these images was comparable to that provided by the natural rural night sky at Glenhare (as measured with a Unihedron Sky Quality Metre; Extended Data Table 1). Before each experiment, the PNG files were opened using IrfanView64 on a PC using a screen resolution of 1,280 × 720 pixels. The PC was connected through an HDMI cable to the projector. The projected size of the circular sky matched the diameter of the circular screen in each rig.

Before each experiment, we ensured that the projection was centred accurately and that its light intensity was reduced to starlight levels using ND filters (the behavioural rig is shown in Extended Data Fig. 9b). In the case of the electrophysiological rig, two 1.2 log unit ND filters were inserted into the light path to dim the image to starlight levels (Extended Data Fig. 9c). The projection of the starry sky was initially set to its natural orientation relative to geographical north or flipped along its vertical and horizontal axes to test the moths under a 180° rotated sky.

As the projectors did not emit UV light, we installed a custom-made LED-ring (built by T. McIntyre; diameter, 120 mm; inner diameter, 50 mm) featuring eight UV LEDs (LED370E Ultra Bright Deep Violet LED, Thorlabs) in front of the projector. The brightness of the LED-ring was controlled using custom written software using MATLAB (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks) and several layers of ND filters that were fixed in front of the LED-ring to bring the UV intensity into a quasi-natural range (the behavioural rig is shown in Extended Data Fig. 9d).

Upward light intensity and spectrum measurements of the starry night sky were made underneath the projection screen in each rig with the probe located at the position of the moth (Extended Data Fig. 9b–d). The light metre used was a calibrated Ocean Optics QE65PRO Spectrometer (Ocean Optics).

To create randomized starry skies for experiments in autumn 2018 and spring 2018, the positions of all individual pixels of the natural night sky stimulus image were reassigned randomly to new positions, and the resulting randomized images were likewise saved as PNG files (Extended Data Fig. 9a). These featureless stellar conditions provided an identical stimulation intensity but provided no celestial spatial information. The randomized starry skies used during spring and autumn 2019 were improved by randomizing groups of pixels containing individual stars, therefore retaining the stars but removing spatial variations in the night sky (such as the Milky Way) that could be used for orientation (again maintaining identical intensity). Here, the stimulus image (of autumn 2019) was subdivided into squares with a size of 13 × 13 pixels, as the brightest star in the image had roughly these dimensions. The positions of these squares were now randomly reassigned and the resulting image was saved as a PNG file. A final improved randomized stimulus (used during spring 2019) was generated from the test stimulus by randomizing the positions of the individual visible stars. This was achieved by first detecting the position and size of each star in the test stimulus using a multiscale Laplacian of a Gaussian convolution of a greyscale version of the test stimulus, followed by local maxima detection. The resulting spatial information was then used to extract and save the image of each star from the natural night sky stimulus, before replacing them on a new background image, with a uniform colour and intensity equal to that of the mean of all pixels in the test stimulus that were not part of a star. This way, the location of the stars on the randomized image could be drawn from any desired distribution. In this case, a uniform distribution was used for the location of all but the brightest star, which was placed in the centre of the image.

To test the selectivity of central brain visual neurons to various parts of the Milky Way during electrophysiological experiments, we stimulated cells with artificial compass cues that, like the starry sky stimulus, filled the projection screen above the moth (Fig. 4d). These cues mimicked aspects of the autumn Milky Way: its brightest region around the Carina nebula (revolving dot) and its stripe-like shape (rotating bar). The bar length and width were chosen to mimic the main stripe of our natural Milky Way stimulus. The intensities of these artificial stimuli were also adjusted to provide a good mimic of the intensities of the stars and the dark background sky in our natural stimulus (see above) and had the same mean grey level (61 ± 1 for values between 0 to 255, darkest to brightest).

Two ferromagnetic-free Mouritsen–Frost flight simulators (of the same type used in the laboratory) were placed on a hilltop at Glenhare and used to record the heading directions of tethered migratory Bogong moths experiencing the full local surrounding landscape and the entire dome of the natural sky. To achieve this, each flight simulator arena consisted of a transparent UV-transmissive Perspex cylinder (again with diameter, 50 cm; height, 35 cm), placed vertically onto an aluminium table (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). The table top was also made of transparent Perspex. The two flight simulators (and their tables) were placed around 15 m apart. A tethered moth was connected to an optical encoder suspended at the centre of the open top end of each arena by a thin horizontal UV-transmissive Perspex arm. The two arenas were controlled from computers that were operated from within a black light-tight cubical tent that was placed midway between the two arenas, approximately 7 m from each. The tent was therefore a landscape feature that the moths could potentially see during their tethered flights.

Most behavioural procedures used in this study have been previously described4,5. Before attachment of tethering stalks, moths were chilled in a freezer for 5–10 min to immobilize them. The scales on the moth's dorsal thorax were removed by suction using a micro-vacuum pump (custom built by B.F.). Afterwards a thin vertical tungsten stalk (which is ferromagnetic free), fashioned at its end to create a small circular footplate, was glued to the dorsal thorax using contact cement while being restrained by a weighted-down plastic mesh. Moths were tested on the day of stalk attachment.

Shortly before sunset, UV-transmissive Perspex boxes holding individual stalked moths were placed onto an elevated outdoor location and provided with a clear view of the western sky and the setting sun (and the skylight polarization pattern), in case these cues were important for calibrating compass mechanisms (as found for the magnetic compass of birds44,45,46). After sunset, the moths could also see the stars (and the celestial rotation).

For tethering within the behavioural arena (performed in dim red light to maintain a dark-adapted visual state), the arena lid holding the optical encoder was lifted and the tungsten stalk of a vigorously flying moth (held with medical forceps) was attached to the bottom end of the encoder shaft through a 1.5 cm length of thin rubber intravenous medical tubing that connected the stalk to the shaft (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Once the arena lid was returned to the arena, this coupling enabled the moth to rotate freely around its yaw axis and choose any flight direction. Once the moth was mounted in the arena, it was gently pointed manually towards geographical north. The heading direction count was then reset, the moth was released and the optical encoder was enabled to register the flight heading direction of the moth under a given night sky condition (projected on the arena lid) at a sampling rate of 5 Hz (and a horizontal resolution of 3°). Each moth was tested for exactly 5 min in each stimulus condition.

Moths chosen for analysis were required to fulfil three ante hoc criteria, two before the experiment and one during the experiment: (1) the tethering stalk was perfectly vertical; (2) wing flapping was vigorous and its amplitude was large and equal for both wings (indicating that the contact cement had not interfered with the wings); and (3) that the moth flew continuously for the full 5 min. For the last criterion, if a moth stopped flying, the arena was gently tapped in order to stimulate the moth to continue flight behaviour. A moth that stopped flying four times was rejected and the recording aborted. For the field seasons of spring 2018 and 2019, as well for Autumn 2019, the percentages of moths that were aborted due to failing to meet these criteria were 2 out of 59 or 3.4% (Spring 2018), 25 out of 137 or 18.3% (Spring 2019), and 35 out of 76 or 46.1% (Autumn 2019). The high rejection rate during Autumn 2019 may have been due to the unusually wet and cold weather that occurred during this season. Moths often behave erratically on rainy or stormy nights, and even on days before and after such nights.

The same behavioural methods (and criteria) that were used indoors were also used outdoors. The goal of these experiments was to understand how migratory Bogong moths deal with natural skies (in particular the nightly movements of the stars and moon, as well as cloud cover) while experiencing a normal geomagnetic field and the local surrounding landscape under natural illumination. Experiments were performed under clear starry skies during autumn 2023 (over three nights during the last week of March), as well as at two times of night, to test whether the migratory orientations of moths were affected by the nightly movements of the stars and moon (which was approximately half-full): (1) between 20:32 and 21:06 (about 1.5 h after sunset), and (2) between 23:25 and 23:59. The same moths were used for orientation measurements at both times, and moths that were flown in one arena at the earlier time (and saw the black tent on their eastern side) were flown in the other arena at the later time (and now saw the black tent on their western side) and vice versa. Moreover, there was a stand of trees close to the arena on the eastern side of the tent, and single trees close to the arena on the western side of the tent. Thus, other panoramic landmarks (apart from the tent) differed markedly in their spatial positions from within the two arenas. Between earlier and later experiments, tethered moths were kept isolated and in the dark in a suitcase that was warmed with hot water bottles. Experiments were also carried out on a fourth completely overcast night that totally covered the stars and moon (between 21:12 and 21:48).

To maximize the success rate of the demanding intracellular recordings during the short migratory season, these experiments were performed both in the afternoon and during the natural nocturnal flight time of the moths. For afternoon experiments, we removed the two 1.2 log unit ND filters in front of the projector lens (as described above) to generate a starry sky projection around 250 times brighter than the one used at night (to account for the circadian-rhythm-induced light-adapted state of the moths). For night experiments, the ND filters were reinserted. No obvious differences were found in results obtained in the two situations. The moths were mounted onto a custom-made 3D-printed animal holder and immobilized using wax. The antennae were fixed to the front of the head with a drop of wax, and a square piece of cuticle was removed from the head capsule to expose the brain. The neural sheath was digested with Pronase (Sigma-Aldrich) for about 30 s and then carefully washed. It was then removed using a pair of fine forceps. A second small hole was cut into the cuticle above the proboscis muscle and a chlorinated silver wire was inserted into this muscle to serve as reference electrode.

Glass electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass on a P-97 Flaming-Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument), and had a typical resistance of 50–100 MΩ. The electrode tip was filled with Neurobiotin solution (4% Neurobiotin in 1 M KCl, Vector Laboratories), and the remainder of the electrode was filled with 1 M KCl. Electrodes were moved into position with a non-magnetic Sensapex micromanipulator. Signals were amplified using a BA-03X intracellular amplifier and headstage (NPI Electronic), and were then digitized using a CED Micro 1401-3 (Cambridge Electronic Design) and recorded with Spike2 software (v.8.03, Cambridge Electronic Design). Stimulus control signals from MATLAB (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks) were simultaneously recorded in Spike2. During the recording, the brain was kept hydrated through regular application of moth ringer solution47.

Moths were mounted under starry skies that were naturally oriented before sky rotation (that is, had the same orientation as the stars outside the laboratory). In earlier experiments, the initial heading orientation of the mounted moth was north relative to the stars and, in later experiments, the initial heading orientation south; however, greatest ease of access to the brain was eventually found for an eastward heading. The action potential spike trains obtained for a 360° rotation of the sky were corrected according to the initial heading orientation of the moth so that spike trains obtained across all experiments were comparable (with a correction angle of 0° applied for an initial northward orientation, 90° for an eastward orientation and 180° for southward orientation). Impaled cells were stimulated with dorsally projected images of the natural starry night sky, or control images of randomized stars (see above). Cells were also stimulated with bars and dots that mimicked different parts of the Milky Way (see above). All of these projected images (natural and randomized stars, artificial Milky Way stimuli) were rotated 360° at 30° s−1 to 45° s−1, with a 2 s break between clockwise and anticlockwise rotations, using custom-written MATLAB code (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks). Between rotations, a neutral grey background image was presented that had the same average grey value as the starry sky/control images.

We targeted an area of the central brain in which we expected to find both CX and lateral complex neurons, as well as optic lobe neurons traversing the brain in the posterior optic tract. Neurons that clearly did not respond to an initial sky rotation were immediately discarded and no recording was saved. 79 neurons were assessed as potentially responding to the stimulus and, of these, 28 (35%) met the inclusion criteria of a unimodal or bimodal response profile. The remaining 51 neurons were classified as uniform in their response to stellar rotation (that is, showed no obvious response) and were therefore excluded from the analysis.

After recording from a suitable cell, a positive current (range: 1–3 nA for 3 min) was applied to the electrode to inject Neurobiotin into the cell. The electrode was then removed and the brain was dissected out of the head capsule. Brains were fixed in 4 °C overnight in paraformaldehyde solution (4% PFA in phosphate buffer) and then washed in 0.1 M PBS (4 times for 15 min). During washing, the retinas were removed. Brains were then incubated with streptavidin–Cy5 (Jackson Immuno Research, 1:1,000 in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 3 days and kept in the dark from this point onwards. After incubation, the brains were washed in PBS-Triton X-100 (6 times for 20 min) and PBS (2 times for 20 min) and then dehydrated in an increasing ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90%, 95% and twice at 100%). Brains were then transferred to a fresh mixture of methylsalicylate and ethanol (1:1) and, after 15 min, were left to clear in 100% methylsalicylate for 75 min. The cleared brains were mounted in Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mounting media between two coverslips and left to dry for at least 2 days.

Brain samples were scanned with the 633 nm laser of a Leica SP8 confocal microscope and viewed with a ×20 oil-immersion objective (Leica Microsystems). For optimal resolution, the scan settings were set to 1,024 × 1,024 pixels, 12-bit pixel depth, 3 times line accumulation and 400 lines per s in the photon-counting mode of the hybrid detector. Neurons and relevant neuropils were then reconstructed in Amira v.5.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and registered into the Bogong moth standard brain22,23.

The data used for the analyses described below are available online48. As there were no statistical differences in results obtained from male and female moths, the results were pooled.

The behavioural analysis used in this study has been previously described4,5. As mentioned above, the encoder software (USB1 Digital Explorer v.1.07, US Digital) recorded the instantaneous heading directions of a tethered flying moth every 200 ms (5 Hz) and saved these values in a text file. We used custom-written MATLAB code (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks) to visualize the virtual flight paths of all tested moths and calculated a mean orientation vector based on each virtual flight path. Each vector for each moth in the circular plots (Fig. 3c–f) encodes the mean orientation direction of a moth's individual recorded flight path as well as its r value (that is, length, or directedness, of the flight path vector). To take advantage of the extra information in our data arising from the fact that the flight trajectories of moths not only had a mean direction (as used for a classic Rayleigh test49) but also a mean directedness (vector length), we used the circular statistics software Oriana (v.4 (2011), KCS) and Excel (Microsoft Office 2019, Microsoft) to apply a one-sided Moore's modified Rayleigh test4,50,51 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (Supplementary Table 1). The R* value encodes the directedness of a population of tested moths and reveals the likelihood that the combined flight direction of these moths—each with its own direction and directedness—differs significantly from random.

To confirm that the two distributions of moth flight directions were significantly different between naturally oriented and 180°-rotated night sky conditions, as well as significantly different between spring and autumn for any single sky condition (Fig. 3c–f), a Mardia–Watson–Wheeler test49 (Oriana) was used (Extended Data Fig. 2g).

The statistical procedures used for data collected outdoors were the same as those used for data collected indoors, with the exception that a likelihood-ratio test52 was used to test whether mean orientation directions for moth populations flown under two different clear natural sky conditions (earlier and later in the evening) were significantly different from each other (Fig. 2a,b). We did this by fitting maximum-likelihood distributions to the mean orientation directions for each trial, using the circular statistics package circular53 in R v.3.6.1 (www.r-project.org). In a similar manner, we determined the likelihood that the moth population flown under overcast conditions (Fig. 2c) had the same mean direction as either of the two populations flown under clear skies, in this case testing whether the means of the two different populations differed significantly.

Moreover, for the cohort of 95 moths flown under clear skies earlier and later in the evening (Fig. 2a,b), we used the mean orientation direction of each moth flown earlier (Fig. 2a), subtracted from the mean direction for the same moth flown later (Fig. 2b), and tested whether the mean angular differences were significantly different from zero (no change in heading). As the moth cohort was clearly less oriented later in the evening (possibly due to fatigue), we made this analysis by separating moths into three groups (Extended Data Fig. 2): (1) those that were well-oriented throughout the night (r > 0.8, both earlier and later in the evening, 35 out of 95 moths); (2) those that were well-oriented in only one trial (typically r > 0.8 earlier and r < 0.8 later, 42 out of 95 moths), and those that were less well-oriented throughout the evening (0.2 < r < 0.8 in both trials, 18 out of 95 moths). This analysis revealed that moths that were well oriented throughout the night (group 1) showed no change in heading, while those that were less-well oriented (groups 2 and 3) showed a westward drift later in the evening (Extended Data Fig. 2). However, this drift was not sufficient (in either direction or directedness) to significantly alter the mean direction of the population as a whole from earlier to later in the evening (Fig. 2a,b).

Spike train data were analysed using custom-written code in MATLAB (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks). Circular statistical analysis was performed in R (v.3.6.1; www.r-project.org) using the circular maximum-likelihood estimation package (CircMLE54). Responses were classified as unimodal (models M2A, M2B or M2C in the R-library CircMLE) or bimodal (models M4A or M4B) based on the Akaike information criterion. Only responses that were classified as unimodal (models M2A, M2B or M2C in the R-library CircMLE, based on the Akaike information criterion) were analysed further with respect to the half-width of the rotation tuning curve, the SNR and the variability of the response.

For cells that responded to night sky rotation (rotation angle φ) with an increase in spiking activity (which became maximal at the sky rotation angle φmax), the bootstrapped interquartile range of the unimodal part of the response distribution was taken to be an estimator of the half-width of the rotation tuning curve (φ range for 50% maximal response or greater). For cells that responded with a decrease in spiking activity, von Mises and mixed-von Mises distributions did not appropriately reflect this inhibition. Instead, the responses of these neurons were binned at 1° intervals and low-pass filtered, and the width at half-maximum was then determined in MATLAB (v.2019a and 2022b, MathWorks). The signal-to-noise ratio SNR was calculated in MATLAB as the ratio between the maximum response during night sky rotation (which occurs at a rotation angle φ = φmax), and the s.e.m. before the night sky rotation started. This was calculated for each stimulus rotation separately. To obtain an estimate of the reliability of a given cell's response to repeated rotations of the night sky, the mean preferred stimulus rotation angle (φmax) was calculated as the circular mean for each individual night sky rotation. We then used the circular s.d.55 of the mean angle across all rotations as an estimate for the variability in the response.

Behavioural data under natural clear starry skies (Fig. 2a,b) were obtained in independent experiments over three separate nights (with new moths used each night). Behavioural data under natural overcast skies (Fig. 2c) were obtained during only a single night. Behavioural data under projected starry skies generated using Stellarium (Fig. 3c–f) were obtained in independent experiments run over several nights with each night's cohort of moths used only once. These experiments were repeated with the same results over two separate spring and autumn seasons (2018 and 2019). Thus, all of these experiments deal with biological replicates. Sample sizes were based on the availability of moths, with at least 40 moths (and as many as 70) being used for each experiment. Experiments were conducted without blinding and without a specific randomization protocol (apart from the random selection of moths used as replicates). Intracellular electrophysiological recordings (Fig. 4) and dye injections (Fig. 5) were obtained from single visual cells in the brain that were subjected to rotations of a projected starry sky (generated using Stellarium). Since each recording (and subsequent dye injection) was a unique observation, replication was not possible. This is due to the stochastic nature of intracellular recordings—single neurons were penetrated randomly from target brain regions that contain many thousands of cells.

a, The two transparent hilltop arenas (sitting on their aluminium tables) seen on either side of the black tent enclosing the experimenters and the computers. b, A close-up of one of the arenas seen in a. Photographs Hui Chen. c, Our new Australian lab, built of entirely non-magnetic materials (to eliminate magnetic artefacts), at Adaminaby. The laboratory occupies 50 m2, has two separate rooms (one for the electrophysiology rig, and one for the behavioural rig) and sits on a concrete slab. Each rig has its own earth separated from the mains earth (provided by a 6 mm thick, 30 mm wide and 12 m long copper strap dug into the ground below the concrete slab). d, The flight arena, with a flying moth (circled) tethered to an optical encoder that tracks changes in the moth's heading direction (relative to North). The flying moth is free to turn in any direction, and the encoder thus records its virtual flight trajectory over time. The floor of the arena displays an optic flow pattern of starlight-intensity (here brightly shown in order to see it) which always moves from head to tail as the moth turns, inducing it to fly. e, The tethering arrangement. f,g, The non-magnetic electrophysiology rig for recording the responses of compass cells in the moth's brain in response to precise magnetic and visual stimulation. The rig is enclosed within Helmholtz coils (f) to precisely control the direction and inclination of the Earth's magnetic field (or to null the magnetic field, as in the experiments described here), and a projector and screen (g) create natural images of the starry night sky above the moth. The moth is mounted horizontally on a stand beneath the projection screen and an electrode is inserted into its central brain. h,i, The non-magnetic behavioural rig for monitoring the trajectories of tethered flying moths. The flight arena, again enclosed within Helmholtz coils, receives an image of the starry night sky on a projection screen installed above the moth (i), from a projector mounted above the coils (h).

a–c, Orientation directions under a cloudless autumn night sky earlier and later in the evening (data from Fig. 2a,b). d–f, Change in mean population heading (Δα) from earlier to later in the evening. a,d, Individual moths that were well-oriented in both trials (r > 0.8 in both trials, n = 35) retained the same heading (a), exhibiting no change in direction between trials. At a population level, the pattern of changes (d) was not significantly different from 0° (χ2 = 0.428, d.f. = 1, p = 0.5131, Δα = 7.64°E). b,e, Moths that were well-oriented in only one of the two trials (r > 0.8 in either trial, n = 42), typically earlier in the evening, started the evening with a population mean heading similar to those that were well-oriented throughout the night (left panels in a and b), but drifted to the West later in the evening (b, right panel), a drift (e) that was significantly different from 0° (χ2 = 7.454, d.f. = 1, p = 0.0063, Δα = 67.77°W). c,f, For moths less well-oriented throughout the night (r < 0.8 in both trials, n = 18) there was no significant population level orientation (c), and no significant population-level difference (f) from a 0° heading change (χ2 = 1.769, d.f. = 1, p = 0.1835, Δα = 89.17°W). Nonetheless, the mean headings, despite lacking significance, were similar to those of the moths in b. a–c, Direction and directedness of MV given by α and R* value, respectively.

One-sided Moore's modified Rayleigh tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons – corrected p-values: 1.72 × 10−11 (earlier) and 2.76 × 10−8 (later) in a; 2.46 × 10−12 (earlier) and 5.57 × 10−3 (later) in b; 0.426 (earlier) and 1.000 (later) in c. d–f, Red arrow: the bias-corrected mean vector for the maximum-likelihood distribution of heading changes; Dashed circle: required r value for statistical significance: p < 0.05; Red arc: 95% confidence intervals (CI95) of the mean angle across heading changes (numerical simulation). One-sided likelihood-ratio tests52 adjusted within each dataset (from a, b and c) using the Benjamini-Hochberg method56. g, Mardia-Watson-Wheeler tests for determining whether populations of moth directions (n) in different seasons and under different skies (as presented in Fig. 3c,d) were significantly different from each other (if so, p is small). 0° is the natural starry sky orientation and 180° is the starry sky rotated by 180°.

φmax values were derived from neural responses to a rotating starry sky stimulus, subdivided into response type and seasons.

a,b, The Helmholtz coil system was used to compensate the local geomagnetic field and create a “nulled” or near-zero magnetic field (NZMF) within the two experimental rigs. The typical variation of the magnetic field strength, shown as nanotesla (nT) over time (s), for the duration of a typical behavioural experiment (300 s). This measurement was made at the position of the moth (position 0 in d). The three-component vector (X, Y, Z: red, green and purple lines respectively) of the field was measured 6 times over 300 s to obtain X, Y and Z traces. These six traces were averaged to give the mean magnetic field strength for each component (X, Y and Z) and the standard deviation (shaded areas around the mean). c,d, To control that the central area of the arena (where tethered moths flew) had a nulled magnetic field, the magnetometer probe was positioned at the arena centre (position 0 in c) and moved outwards in 1 cm steps along 4 directions (coloured arrows in d) relative to geographic North (gN) and the strengths of the X, Y, and Z field components were measured at each position. These field strengths were less than 100 nT a radius of 4 cm from the coil centre (dashed yellow line and circle in c and d) in all four directions (bar colours in c correspond to direction colours in d). Since the wingspan radius of a Bogong moth is about 2.5 cm (dashed brown line and circle in c and d), this indicates that the entire moth experienced a magnetic field strength substantially less than 100 nT, effectively a “nulled field” (which can be compared to the external local magnetic field strength of around 58,500 nT).

a, Stellarium images of the austral starry night sky (and randomized sky) used during the spring and autumn migratory seasons in 2018 and 2019. Geographic North (gN) is upwards in each image. Randomized skies in 2018 were created by randomizing pixels (insets), whereas those in 2019 were improved by randomizing stars (see Methods). b,c, Brightness distributions of natural starry skies and randomized skies projected onto a screen above the moth in the behavioural (b) and electrophysiological rigs (c). The probe of a spectrometer (Ocean Optics QE65 PRO, see Methods), equipped with a collimating lens (25° field of view), was positioned at the same location as the moth and systematically pointed at the projected sky in different directions (0–360° in 30° steps) relative to geographic North. The radiance (photons/cm²/sec/sr) was measured from the screen in each direction in (5 measurements per position): mean radiance is shown as a function of measurement direction (green squares = spring projection, magenta squares = autumn projection, blue squares = randomized projection). Error bars give standard deviations. Note that the brightest areas of the autumn and spring projections were respectively located south-easterly and westerly. d. The spectra of the projectors used in the behavioural (left) and electrophysiological rigs (right), measured using the Ocean Optics QE65 PRO spectrometer. For the projector in the behavioural rig, a ring of UV LEDs was used to create a quasi-realistic spectrum (see Methods). Note that for this spectrum the noise level is relatively high since we used all the neutral density filters normally used during an experiment.

The underlying population-level statistics for each population of moths tested in each season during 2018 and 2019 under seasonally appropriate naturalistic projected night skies at 0° (natural orientation) or rotated 180°, or under randomized starry night skies (which form the basis of the results shown in Fig. 3).

Metrics details

Climate change threatens global food systems1, but the extent to which adaptation will reduce losses remains unknown and controversial2. Even within the well-studied context of US agriculture, some analyses argue that adaptation will be widespread and climate damages small3,4, whereas others conclude that adaptation will be limited and losses severe5,6. Scenario-based analyses indicate that adaptation should have notable consequences on global agricultural productivity7,8,9, but there has been no systematic study of how extensively real-world producers actually adapt at the global scale. Here we empirically estimate the impact of global producer adaptations using longitudinal data on six staple crops spanning 12,658 regions, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories. We estimate that global production declines 5.5 × 1014 kcal annually per 1 °C global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise (120 kcal per person per day or 4.4% of recommended consumption per 1 °C; P < 0.001). We project that adaptation and income growth alleviate 23% of global losses in 2050 and 34% at the end of the century (6% and 12%, respectively; moderate-emissions scenario), but substantial residual losses remain for all staples except rice. In contrast to analyses of other outcomes that project the greatest damages to the global poor10,11, we find that global impacts are dominated by losses to modern-day breadbaskets with favourable climates and limited present adaptation, although losses in low-income regions losses are also substantial. These results indicate a scale of innovation, cropland expansion or further adaptation that might be necessary to ensure food security in a changing climate.

Disruptions of the global food system owing to climate change threaten human well-being12,13,14 and social stability10,15, but researchers lack a complete understanding of the magnitude and structure of potential impacts on food systems globally2,16. It is known that changes to the climate will alter the distribution of weather experienced across the planet17 and that biophysical processes in agricultural systems will respond5,7,8. However, the degree to which humans around the world will effectively adapt their agricultural practices in reaction to these changes remains unknown2,3,8,9. For this reason, existing global projections have been unable to account for the adoption rates and efficacy of producer adaptations7,8,18 and it remains unresolved whether the compensatory responses of producers are likely to overcome the challenges posed by climate change4,19.

Here we develop a unified empirical approach to measure the effect of climate change on staple crop production, accounting for the costs, benefits and adoption rates of producer adaptations as they are observed in practice around the world. We study one of the most comprehensive samples of subnational crop yields ever assembled, representing two-thirds of global cropped calorie production, which allows our results to be globally representative. Using high-resolution data from populations across diverse contexts allows us to understand the real-world response of producers to weather events, changes in climate and economic development. We then apply our empirical results to project probabilistic global climate change impacts on yields that account for environmental changes, biophysical processes and the compensatory responses of producers.

Previous analyses using process-based models have provided crucial insights about the potential impacts of climate change on global food systems and have enabled decades of progress in agronomic modelling7,8,9,18. These models explicitly characterize the biophysical processes that generate yields (for example, root depth, evapotranspiration, light utilization) and are calibrated to precisely managed experimental fields7,18, thereby providing detailed insight into the agronomic mechanisms by which climatic changes influence yields. However, these models generally assume that producers optimize yields subject to decision rules formed through modeller expert judgement (for example, ‘no adaptation' or ‘optimal varietal switching'7,18) in contrast to observing the decisions made by producers on the ground16,20,21. These decision rules describe what is theoretically possible but might not reflect actual conditions across diverse socioeconomic contexts, which are influenced by financial constraints, market failures and human error, along with other factors (Methods). Furthermore, because global process-based models are parameterized on the basis of data from scientifically managed experimental fields, concerns have been raised about their ability to represent actual producer decisions in diverse and resource-constrained contexts16,20,21.

To address these challenges, we develop an econometric approach that simultaneously captures the combined impact of biophysical crop responses and producer decision-making. In place of modeller-prescribed adaptation scenarios, our approach empirically recovers the effect of actual adaptations undertaken in response to diverse climatic and economic conditions faced by producers. This reduced-form approach does not attempt the difficult task of identifying and modelling each individual mechanism through which these adaptations occur. Instead, we measure the total impact of adaptive adjustments in response to the climate (for example, changing varietals, altering cultivation windows, adjusting fertilizer) without modelling intermediary processes explicitly (Methods and Supplementary Information, section B). We apply these measurements—which capture the extent, intensity and efficacy of real-world producer adaptations as a function of local climates and economic conditions—in simulations of future crop production under climate change and economic development. The key assumption underlying our approach is that producers facing similar climates, incomes and irrigation infrastructure make similar management decisions, which allows us to estimate the effects of producer decisions, which we do not observe. The weakness of our approach is that, if producers facing similar contexts are not comparable, then our estimates of producer adaptation may be biased (Methods and Supplementary Information, section B).

Previous empirical work has demonstrated how reduced-form econometric approaches can be calibrated to producer behaviour in specific regions2,5,11,22,23, such as maize producers in the USA5. Follow-up work demonstrated that this approach is complementary to, rather than a replacement for, detailed process-based models8,9,20,23,24,25. We build on the literature analysing the variation of weather responses with local climate as an indicator of adaptation4,19,26,27, making use of the method for capturing the benefits of adaptation in ref. 28 and accounting for adaptation costs based on ref. 29. Our work here represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first global analysis of staple crops that: (1) accounts for observed adaptation behaviour and how it varies globally; (2) uses these results to generate global projections of climate impacts on yields over the twenty-first century; and (3) transforms these projections into an empirically derived ‘damage function' that links changes in global calorie production to changes in GMST (ΔGMST). The scale and scope of our projections are comparable with global gridded process-based models, such as those underlying the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP)7. However, unlike those models, our analysis is based on globally representative data and accounts for the adoption rates and efficacy of adaptive behaviours that producers choose to undertake in practice across diverse environmental and economic contexts (for example, varietal switching and optimization of inputs such as fertilizer or irrigation intensity; see Supplementary Information, section B).

We make four contributions that address key challenges when projecting global impacts of climate change on agriculture. First, we assemble one of the largest datasets of subnational crop production available (Ray et al.30 analyse the only comparable dataset we are aware of, containing “~13,500 political units” and four crops, but have not made their data public), covering 12,658 subnational administrative units from 54 countries for six staple crops spanning diverse local climates and socioeconomic contexts (Fig. 1a–c,e, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Second, we systematically select from many correlated aspects of weather affecting crop biophysical processes which have been separately studied2. In our models of crop biophysical processes, we endeavour to ‘let the data speak' and select from this broad set of weather variables using cross-validation over our rich panel data, an approach commonly used in machine learning (Supplementary Information, section C, Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Third, we estimate the degree of producer adaptation, which has been widely debated2,3,4,5,6,19,22,31. Following previous research, we use climate summary statistics (such as average temperature, average rainfall; see bars in Fig. 1d,f) to identify similarly adapted subpopulations4,5,26,28,29,31,32 (Extended Data Figs. 1b, 3 and 4, Methods and Supplementary Information, section D). However, we select crop-specific measures of climate by means of cross-validation (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Further, we account for both the costs29 and the benefits of local adaptations (Methods and Supplementary Information, section H); failing to account for costs overstates the value of adaptation19. Fourth, our model allows for differences in resource access (for example, fertilizer, technology, insurance and credit markets or labour markets) to influence patterns of food production (Methods). This is particularly important in projections, as future economic development is likely to alter agricultural practices in ways that could make agriculture more resilient or vulnerable to weather33.

Region-specific and crop-specific impacts are projected to evolve in the future based on changes to economic conditions (for example, GDP per capita) and climate (for example, average temperature), reflecting economic development and adaptation. a, Fraction of cropped area observed in our subnational administrative data, for example, regions spanning North, Central and South America. b, Example inset regions surrounding Lucas do Rio Verde municipality (black outline) in Mato Grosso state, Brazil. c, Time series of maize yield administrative data from Lucas do Rio Verde. d, Empirically estimated relationship between daily temperature and log maize yields (shaded region: 95% confidence interval) conditional on other factors that include rainfall, climate and access to inputs and technology (Methods).

Example regions depicted from top to bottom are: Iroquois County, Illinois, USA; La Barca municipality in Jalisco, Mexico; and Lucas do Rio Verde in Mato Grosso, Brazil. e, As in a but for an example region of Asia. f, As in d but for the response of rice to daily temperature in Dongbao district in Hubei, China, the cities of Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu, India, and Sulawesi Utara, Indonesia. g, Expected exceedance degree days over 30 °C projected for each of 24,378 regions in 2090 in a high-emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). Exceedance degree day projections (and other variables) from each model are combined with econometric results, such as d and f, to project crop-specific climate impacts that account for adaptation.

Because our data span climatic zones around the world, we are able to empirically measure how adaptive practices in different climates mediate the influence of environmental conditions (Fig. 1d,f and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). This ‘reduced-form' approach does not provide the granular detail contained in process-based models but it does account for the net consequence of nearly all climate-associated adaptive actions available to producers, without requiring that each is explicitly modelled or observed22. For example, our approach accounts for adaptive actions such as selecting a varietal with an earlier harvest date to avoid late-season heat exposure, adjusting typical fertilizer use conditional on socioeconomic conditions and adjusting typical irrigation water use conditional on access to irrigation, along with many other available adaptive measures. Notably, our approach does not account for altering the area planted to a given crop (that is, crop switching, although we do account for this in our valuation of climate impacts) and shifting the planting date outside present growing season windows (although we do account for varietal selections with earlier harvest dates).

Our final global model for each crop is high dimensional, nonlinear and dependent on the underlying economic and climatic characteristics of each location—but nonetheless fully interpretable. Each crop model includes several measures of weather that are all interacted with several measures of climate, as well as income and possibly irrigation (Extended Data Fig. 1c). This approach allows yields in a given year and location to be computed by (1) weather in that location–year, which is an argument to (2) a location–year function determined by crop-specific measures of climate, income and irrigation. The resulting models are relatively parsimonious compared with global process-based models7,8 because the influence of many other factors not explicitly included in the model (for example, soil type and quality) is captured non-parametrically (Methods and Supplementary Information, section B). However, these parsimonious models are skilful. Our model outperforms process-based model benchmarks globally across crops and regionally over 81% of crop–country pairs (Supplementary Information, section F and Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). Furthermore, in a ground-truth exercise, our model reproduces variation in local yields (R2 values from 0.63 (cassava) to 0.88 (rice); Extended Data Fig. 5), including over localized regions in our data representing both high and low values of average yields and cropping intensity (Extended Data Fig. 6).

We project climate impacts to yields across 24,378 global administrative regions until the end of the century. Projections include a high-emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5; Figs. 1g and 2) and a moderate-emissions scenario (RCP 4.5; Extended Data Fig. 7), each matched to two socioeconomic scenarios, in each of 33 climate models and model surrogates that represent the full range of climate sensitivities (Methods). We account for statistical uncertainty through 1,920 Monte Carlo simulations per crop, following refs. 28,29,34 (Methods).

We report results based on where crops are cultivated today, noting that our approach also allows us to estimate theoretical impacts for a crop in locations in which it is not cultivated at present (Supplementary Fig. 7).

The projected effects of climate change on crop yields vary around the world (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). Regions exhibit different initial climates and socioeconomic conditions and they experience different changes in temperature, precipitation and incomes. These in turn alter the environmental factors crops are exposed to and the adaptive decisions of producers. Our projections are deviations from local baseline yield trends, which have historically been positive30,35 and will probably remain generally positive (see the ‘Conclusions and discussion' section).

First, for all crops, temperature changes (through degree days and minimum temperature for rice and wheat) generally dominate the sign of local projected impacts. Precipitation strongly influences inter-annual variability in yields—which is important to producers, consumers and government planners—but does not generally drive overall trends. Global patterns in yield losses reflect the nonlinear response of crops to temperatures, with increasing extreme heat depressing yields and reductions in cold days increasing yields. Adaptive responses to rising average temperature moderate losses to extreme heat (for example, Extended Data Fig. 3a), consistent with producers taking protective measures in response to temperature extremes that are expected19. However, benefits from these protective measures are partially offset by decreased yield gains during moderate temperatures. The trade-off between temperature resilience and average yield has been documented and is understood to reflect physiological compromises across varietals19,36, although its potential global impact on future food production has not been previously demonstrated or quantified.

A second general pattern across several crops applies to equatorial regions of the world with high rainfall, including central Africa, Southeast Asia and South America. In these regions, the benefits of moderate temperatures are amplified by increasing levels of precipitation, driven by an intensifying water cycle37. Although rising temperatures may ultimately reduce yields in these regions, the benefits of high rainfall in these regions partially offset those effects.

Under a high-emissions scenario, our projected end-of-century maize yield losses are severe (about −40%) in the grain belt of the USA, Eastern China, Central Asia, Southern Africa and the Middle East (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). Losses in South America and Central Africa are more moderate (about −15%), mitigated in part by high levels of precipitation and increasing long-run precipitation (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Impacts in Europe vary with latitude, from +10% gains in the north to −40% losses along the Mediterranean. Gains in theoretical yield potentials occur in many northern regions in which maize is not widely grown (Supplementary Fig. 7).

The spatial distribution of soybean yield impacts is similar in structure to maize, although magnitudes are accentuated (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 7b and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11); for example, about −50% in the USA and about +20% in wet regions of Brazil under a high-emissions scenario.

High-emissions rice yield impacts are mixed in India and Southeast Asia, which lead global rice production, with small gains and losses throughout these regions. This regional result is broadly consistent with earlier work1. In the remaining rice-growing regions, central estimates are generally negative, with magnitudes in Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Central Asia exceeding −50% (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11).

Wheat losses are notably consistent across the main wheat-growing regions, with high-emissions yield losses of −15% to −25% in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Africa and South America and −30% to −40% in China, Russia, the USA and Canada (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). There are notable exceptions to these global patterns: wheat-growing regions of Western China exhibit both gains and losses, whereas wheat-growing regions of Northern India exhibit some of the most severe projected losses across the globe.

Cassava is projected to have uniformly negative projected impacts in nearly all regions in which it is grown at present, with the largest losses in Sub-Saharan Africa (−40% on average under a high-emissions scenario). Although cassava does not make up a large portion of global agricultural revenues, it is an important subsistence crop in low-income and middle-income countries. Thus, these yield losses may be a substantial future threat to the nutritional intake of the global poor (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 7e and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11).

Sorghum losses are widespread in almost all of the main regions in which it is grown at present: North America (−40%), South Asia (including India) (−10%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (−25%). Projected gains emerge in Western Europe (+28%) and Northern China (+3%) (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 7f and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11).

We compute aggregated global yield impacts based on the present distribution of global croplands, accounting for adaptation benefits and costs (Fig. 3a). For all crops except rice, we estimate that warming will likely reduce global yields by 2050 (probability of loss ranges from 0.701 (sorghum) to 0.946 (wheat), high-emissions scenario) after accounting for both statistical and climate model uncertainty. Central estimates for global end-of-century losses under the high-emissions/moderate-emissions scenarios (RCP 8.5/RCP 4.5) are −27.8%/−12.0% (P = 0.258/0.308) for maize, −6.0%/−1.1% (P = 0.477/0.475) for rice, −35.6%/−22.4% (P = 0.185/0.206) for soybean, −29.8%/−12.8% (P = 0.179/0.248) for cassava, −21.7%/−5.9% (P = 0.329/0.417) for sorghum and −28.2%/−13.5% (P = 0.038/0.058) for wheat. End-of-century uncertainty ranges may be substantial, with the largest 90% credible range for rice (q5 = −58.6%; q95 = 109.4%; RCP 8.5) and the narrowest range for wheat (q5 = −20.7%; q95 = −10.4%; RCP 4.5). These ranges allow for moderate likelihood that the impact of high emissions on global yields is positive for rice (probability = 0.477), maize (probability = 0.258), cassava (probability = 0.179) and sorghum (probability = 0.329) or more negative than −30% for rice (probability = 0.240), maize (probability = 0.417), sorghum (probability = 0.410), wheat (probability = 0.535), soybean (probability = 0.560) and cassava (probability = 0.481).

Bottom panel shows the distribution of warming under each RCP across 33 climate models and model surrogates (Supplementary Information, section G).

Projected log(yield) impacts for panels a–c winsorized at the top and bottom 1% of the impacts distribution over all region–GCM–years, by RCP–crop, then converted to percentages.

Although the impact of heat on yields is nonlinear and pronounced for many crops (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4), global aggregate yields are not driven downward most strongly by the hottest regions of the world. Accounting for adaptation, we find that the middle 50% of regions with moderate average temperatures tend to suffer the largest yield losses (Fig. 3b). This is largely because hotter locations are already more adapted to heat, so further warming has a reduced impact, whereas cold locations benefit from warming. Furthermore, high average rainfall, prevalent in many hot locations, is linked to increased gains from moderate warming (Extended Data Figs. 3b and 4b). This finding underscores the importance of accounting for real-world patterns of differentiated adaptation in global-scale analyses.

Our projections suggest that changes in global yields affect populations around the world unequally. We estimate that total calorie production is generally affected more heavily by climate change in regions that are richer today (Fig. 3c), along with the lowest-income decile owing to its reliance on cassava. We estimate average losses of 28% in the lowest-income decile but more moderated losses of roughly 18% across deciles 2–8. In the highest-income deciles, average losses increase to 29% (ninth) and 41% (top). This result is partially because lower-income populations tend to live in hotter climates, in which present adaptation rates are higher, and in the tropics, in which high average precipitation reduces warming impacts (Fig. 3b). This has important implications for global damages, as high-income regions include many of the world's breadbaskets. Because relative yield losses are greatest in regions in which modern agriculture is concentrated, they have amplified influence on global caloric production under climate change.

We combine our projections across all six crops to estimate the total potential impact of warming on global caloric production (Methods and Supplementary Information, sections B and K). Following the approach in refs. 28,29,34, we index lost calorie production against ΔGMST for each climate model. We recover a damage function describing the joint distribution of ΔGMST and lost calorie production for these six staple crops in each 5-year moving window of the twenty-first century (Fig. 3d). We estimate that the magnitude of impacts to present croplands increases nearly linearly at a rate of −5.54 × 1014 kcal (P < 0.001, 95% credible interval −5.63 to −5.44 × 1014 kcal) of calorie production per +1 °C in GMST in 2100 (see Supplementary Fig. 21 for other decades), amounting to approximately −121 kcal per day per 1 °C per person based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3 (SSP3) 2100 global population projections, or −4.4% of present per capita recommended consumption per 1 °C. (For example, warming of 4 °C in GMST in 2100 would correspond to a loss of about 17.6% of present per capita recommended consumption).

In contrast to previous global analyses7,8, projections here account for producer adaptation rates that reflect observed behaviour. We find that accounting for climate adaptation, its costs and rising incomes have substantial impact on high-emissions projections for all crops and regions (Table 1). We estimate that development and adaptive adjustments reduce global calorie impacts (relative to a ‘no adaptation' scenario) by roughly 23% in 2050 (column 1a versus 1b, Table 1, 6% for moderate emissions) and 34% at the end of the century (column 2a versus 2b, 12% for moderate emissions), owing to the growing extent of adjustment under greater climatic change. The relative impact of adaptation is largest for rice (79% reduction of end-of-century impacts, 86% for moderate emissions) and smallest for wheat (statistically unchanged) (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). Adaptation and development exacerbate average wheat losses from climate change (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Tables 10 and 11) because wheat producers are observed to take on further weather-related risk as GDP per capita rises (Supplementary Information, section G), resulting in small losses from adaptation and development for Europe and Oceania (Table 1). By contrast, the largest regional benefits of adaptation accrue to South America (61% reduction of end-of-century impacts, 23% for moderate emissions), mostly from maize and soybean adaptation gains. Our results indicate that producer adaptations are likely to have strong influence over climate change impacts to agriculture, highlighting the critical importance of accounting for these adaptations; however, our central estimates for the overall impact of climate change on potential production of staples remain negative and meaningful, even accounting for the net effects of adaptation. Substantial uncertainty persists in these estimates, originating from both econometric uncertainty and climate model uncertainty, such that overall risks should be assessed across the full range of projected impacts.

The above results do not account for CO2 fertilization, which is challenging to measure empirically. However, we adjust our results post-estimation to incorporate CO2 fertilization using previous estimates9 (Methods and Supplementary Information, section J). Adjusting for CO2 fertilization does not qualitatively alter the structure of our findings (Supplementary Figs. 13–18) but it does reduce the central estimate for end-of-century yield losses by 5.0– 9.5 percentage points (Fig. 3a) and increases the likelihood of positive aggregate effects. We do not account for the decreased crop nutrient content that might result from CO2 fertilization38.

Losses to future global yields can be incorporated into present-day climate policy, for example, by computing the net present value of future economic harms that result from the present emission of an extra ton of CO2, a value known as the social cost of carbon (SCC). We compute a component of the SCC—a ‘partial SCC'—that results from changes in global yields by integrating these projections into the Data-driven Spatial Climate Impact Model (DSCIM) developed in refs. 28,29 (Methods and Supplementary Information, section K). We assign country-specific average prices to total calorie production (Supplementary Fig. 20), allowing producers to intensify/reduce production to meet demand in their market at increasing marginal cost (Methods, Supplementary Information, section K, and Supplementary Fig. 19). In general, aggregate yield losses under climate change harm consumers as caloric consumption is lower and prices are higher; producers are also harmed by production losses, but these may be offset by gains from higher prices. In all scenarios, our approach implicitly allows the spatial distribution of within-crop varietals to adjust optimally within present cropped locations (Extended Data Fig. 1, Methods and Supplementary Information, section B). In some further scenarios, we deflate these estimates to account for the roles of crop switching and international trade, which might cause the spatial distribution of planting areas to shift (Methods and Supplementary Information, section K).

Across different modelling assumptions, the partial SCC for the crops we study ranges from $0.99 per ton of CO2 (5% constant discounting; adjusted for flexible crop switching, movement of cropped land and international trade; moderately elastic demand and supply; frictionless trade within countries; RCP 8.5) to $49.48 per ton (Ramsey discounting39; crop type and land distributions mirror present day; moderately elastic demand and supply; frictionless trade within countries; RCP 8.5). See Extended Data Table 3 and Supplementary Table 13 for all partial SCC estimates.

Our analysis of staple crops is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to quantify the adaptations of real-world producers to climate around the world and to apply these measurements to projections of global agricultural damages from climate change. Our econometric results complement a well-developed literature from process-based models that resolve the underlying mechanics of crop production and some important forms of adaptation but which take producer decision rules as exogenous7,8,18,20. Our results indicate a substantial and statistically significant rate at which ΔGMST reduces the ability of present global food systems to produce calories, net of adaptation. However, in the absence of adaptation, we project that agricultural outcomes would be materially worse.

Our findings indicate that projected consumption losses tend not to be evenly distributed across global populations. Wealthy regions of the world more easily absorb grain price shocks. In poor regions of the world, food shortages and associated price shocks may be more destabilizing. This suggests that future modelling efforts would benefit from representing realistic costs and benefits of adaptation, imperfect information and other aspects of producer decision-making. We expect that these changes would lead to projections of climate impacts to agriculture that are less optimistic than those assuming agronomically optimal management7 and more optimistic than models that do not model adaptation at all2.

A key finding is that global populations exhibit extensive adaptation to climate already, especially in relatively low income and hot regions of the world—with the exception of the world's poorest, who depend heavily on cassava and face higher potential losses (Fig. 3b,c, Supplementary Information, section I.3 and Supplementary Fig. 9). We also observe that breadbaskets of the world, in which the climate is moderate, exhibit more limited adaptation at present. Because such a large fraction of agricultural production is concentrated in these wealthy-but-low-adaption regions, they dominate projections of global calorie production, generating much of the global food security risk we document. This result is consistent with earlier regional findings that US crop systems are optimized for high average yields but not robustness to climatic changes36 and that projected maize losses in Sub-Saharan Africa are largest in the most productive and climatically moderate countries, whereas countries with hotter present-day climates have lower historical yields and smaller projected yield losses40.

Our projection of productivity declines under climate change contrasts with process-based model results that are calibrated to experimental farms, use researcher-defined adaptation rules and generally tend to indicate productivity gains globally (ref. 8 is an important exception). For example, ensemble mean projections of AgMIP process-based models indicate end-of-century productivity gains for maize (+1.3%, RCP 8.5), wheat (+9.9%), soybean (+15.3%) and rice (+23.3%)7. These differ substantially from the generally negative impacts we predict, with central end-of-century estimates that range from −35.6% (soybean) to −6.0% (rice) (Supplementary Table 10; RCP 8.5), although both sets of projections exhibit large uncertainties. A comparison of model skill over historical data suggests that the statistical approach of this paper outperforms the AgMIP ensemble across crops and locations (Extended Data Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Information, section F) and accurately captures observed variation in local yields (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6 and Supplementary Information, section F). These differences highlight the importance of using globally representative data and accounting for empirically measured rates of adaptive behaviours in projections of climate change damages. Unlike process-based crop models, our estimates do not provide insight about the agronomic mechanisms through which climatic changes influence future yields. Such insight is useful in guiding agricultural innovation and, indeed, process-based models are used at present in a Genotype by Environment by Management (GxExM) framework to target crop science research about future climate stresses41,42,43,44. The work we present underscores the urgency and importance of such crop technology developments and the importance of ensuring access to adaptive technologies by global producers broadly.

Future producer adaptation to climate change may differ from the historically observed patterns we recover. For example, technological breakthroughs, such as the industrial fixation of nitrogen, transformed what is understood about the limit of global productivity. However, the repeatability and penetration of these innovations has been uneven and perhaps should be interpreted cautiously—for example, synthetic fertilizers remain incompletely deployed despite their invention long ago45 and progress towards heat tolerance for some staple crops has stalled46. Furthermore, to the extent that these advances are correlated with income, our projections implicitly account for them. Notably, innovation has contributed positively to average yield trends in many regions30,35, which will probably continue into the future in some form. Our projected yield impacts should therefore be interpreted as deviations from a future trend in average yields that is driven by other factors, including innovation. Indeed, our findings provide a sense of the scale required of such innovations to maintain global food security.

Finally, our monetization of agricultural damages from climate change is limited, as it does not capture the impact of all future changes, such as linkages between climate change, food availability and social instability10,15. Nonetheless, synthesizing the complex global response of agriculture into a partial SCC is an important step towards representing these damages in climate policies47. Comparison of our partial SCC with existing estimates provides context for these findings. The Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution (FUND) model reports a partial SCC for agriculture of −$2.70 per ton CO2 (ref. 48) using a 3% discount rate (that is, warming improves global welfare through agriculture). Because this value relies on older (pre-2000) studies for calibration49, Moore et al.9 construct a revised estimate based on a meta-analysis of previous estimates8, mostly from process-based models. Inserting these projections into a computable general equilibrium model for 16 regions, Moore et al.9 estimate a partial SCC of $13.05 per ton (adjusted to the USD in 2023), opposite in sign from the original FUND partial SCC. Because this estimate is derived from process-based models, it does not account for observed rates of producer-level adaptation and it is two to five times larger than the range of our comparable estimates, $3.08–$6.84 (3% discount rate; Extended Data Table 3), that do account for autonomous adaptation. We note that, in a recent paper50, researchers incorporate the Moore et al.9 results directly into the Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) integrated assessment model and find that climate damages to the agricultural sector increase to $84. The discussion of that paper focuses on other aspects of the analysis and does not detail why this estimate changed. Also, neither Moore et al.9 nor this study account for non-staple crops or livestock, an important area for future work, and neither estimate accounts for the unequal impact of crop losses on the global poor (Fig. 3c), for whom lost agricultural revenues and/or consumption may be particularly damaging10,14,15. In continuing work51, we seek to more fairly represent these unequal costs in global estimates of monetized damages.

This section provides an overview of the data and methods used to estimate the relation between agricultural yields and variation in weather, accounting for adaptation to climate and economic development.

Subnational yields, production and harvested area, primarily at the second administrative level, were collected from the statistical offices of 54 countries (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). This includes data that were generously shared for Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand52 and Zambia53. This yields a dataset for 6 crops in 12,658 locations (41,186 location–crop pairs) spanning up to 137 years. Wheat varietals, when not identified in the data, were manually assigned to spring or winter wheat based on ancillary country-specific data (Supplementary Table 6). All growing season definitions are from ref. 54 and held fixed. Detailed information is provided in Supplementary Information, section A.

The main weather dataset used in this analysis is the Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset (GMFD v1)55. Data are available on a 0.25° × 0.25°-resolution grid from 1948 to 2010. We obtain daily maximum and minimum temperatures and daily total precipitation for all grid cells globally. These data provide surface temperature and precipitation information using a combination of observations and reanalysis, which is downscaled and bias-corrected using several station-based observational datasets to remove biases in monthly temperature and precipitation.

We use the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) Global Daily Downscaled Projections (GDDP) dataset for future projections of climate change. This comprises 21 climate projections, which are downscaled to 0.25° × 0.25° resolution56 from global climate model (GCM) runs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive57. NEX-GDDP uses GMFD55 and quantile mapping to adjust the GCM outputs (means and variances) in historical and future time periods so that the systemic bias of the GCMs is removed. In contrast to other approaches58, NEX-GDDP does not assume a common distribution shape between observed (GMFD) and GCM data. However, NEX-GDDP only assumes that GMFD (versus GCM) variances are correct, which other approaches58 do not require. Climate is projected under emissions from Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) up to 2100 (refs. 59,60), although the NEX-GDDP outputs of some models lack precipitation data past 2098, so that the ‘end of the century' in this paper is the year 2098. The CMIP5 ensemble of GCMs is not a systematic sample of possible futures. To provide an ensemble of climate projections with a probability distribution of GMSTs consistent with that estimated by a probabilistic simple climate model, we use the method outlined in ref. 61 to assign probabilistic weights to climate projections. A full list of models and their weights is given in Supplementary Table 9. For a more complete description, see ref. 29.

We obtain national and subnational income data for 1,503 administrative regions from 83 countries from ref. 62. Data are provided by ref. 62 at the state/province level for each country. We use these subnational data to allocate national GDP data from the Penn World Tables (PWT) database (https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/) under the assumption that the within-country distributions of GDP recorded in ref. 62 are accurate, but the exact levels may not be. Using these data, we construct a consistent panel of subnational incomes for all areas in our crop dataset that sum to the national GDP from the PWT database for all countries in the sample.

Future projections of national incomes are derived from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ENV-Growth model63 and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) GDP model64, as part of the ‘socioeconomic conditions' of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)65. These are the only models that provide GDP per capita projections for a wide range of countries in the SSP database. The SSPs propose a set of plausible scenarios of socioeconomic development over the twenty-first century in the absence of climate impacts and policy. Data are interpolated to annual frequency and downscaled following ref. 29.

We obtain data on the area equipped for irrigation from AQUASTAT of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)66. These data are a single cross-section centred around the year 2000 at 0.08° × 0.08° resolution and we hold the values fixed in climate projections. (Increases in incomes and heat exposure may drive increases in future irrigation, whereas aquifer and reservoir drawdown may drive decreases in future irrigation).

We develop a reduced-form approach to modelling crop yields and producer adaptation, allowing us to recover plausibly causal effects of weather on yields based on data from real-world farms, without having to observe all of the biophysical processes in a given crop that mediate these effects. The approach allows us to account for the total costs and benefits of numerous real-world adaptive adjustments that producers undertake, without requiring that we observe or model each adjustment explicitly. This approach builds on ideas and techniques developed in refs. 4,19,26,27, using the method for capturing the benefits of adaptation in ref. 28 and accounting for its costs based on the revealed preference approach in ref. 29. Following common practice in the literature2, our implementation also allows our model to recover local, micro level and instantaneous nonlinear effects of environmental conditions, even though outcome data are only observed at more aggregate spatial scales and temporal frequencies28,31.

We apply cross-validation techniques common in machine learning but adapted for model selection in a causal inference context. Our approach has three stages: (1) we remove variation that is associated with non-parametric controls to condition out the influence of unobservables; (2) we apply cross-validation to this residualized data to select weather measures; and (3) we again apply cross-validation, modifying the model chosen in the previous step to select dimensions of climate that matter for adaptation. We perform the sequence (1)–(3) for each of the six crops separately to identify the most suitable model for each crop. Having selected and fitted an empirical model that accounts for weather and adaptation, we then apply the model in projections of climate change impacts. Each of these steps is detailed below.

A large number of candidate weather variables are constructed from raw weather data based on previous literature5,67,68,69,70,71. We assemble variables that previous analyses report were influential for at least one crop, although individual variables might not ultimately be included in the specification for all or any crops. All weather transformations were conducted at the pixel level using daily data before aggregation, unless otherwise specified. Encoding pixel-by-day weather data after nonlinear transformations allows a high degree of flexibility in how local daily weather conditions can have an instantaneous and nonlinear impact on crops28,31. This means that even short periods of environmental stress are resolved and captured by these variables and the model. Degree day terms were constructed following ref. 5, with kink points selected for each crop by a tenfold cross-validation search over potential kinks. Growing-season-phase precipitation was summed within month by grid cell and then transformed70. Construction of vapour pressure deficit followed ref. 69. The count of rain days was calculated by grid cell as days with positive precipitation68. Extreme rain was identified by constructing the 1980–2010 rainfall distribution for each grid cell in the GMFD daily precipitation data and aggregating the amount of rainfall or number of days of rainfall in excess of the 95th percentile of this distribution68. Count of extreme rain days was measured following extreme rain except grid cell days were counted instead of summed within grid cell68. Drought was defined as a binary indicator over administrative unit growing season precipitation, using a tenfold cross-validation search over percentile cut-offs in the administrative unit growing season total precipitation distribution, largely following ref. 71 (final cut-offs ranged from the 8th to 25th percentiles). Minimum temperatures were calculated as the average of daily grid cell minimum temperatures within each month, following ref. 67. For all weather terms, weighting and aggregation to administrative units were done as described in ref. 29 with cropped area weights from ref. 54. See Supplementary Information, section D and Supplementary Tables 2–5 for full details on the construction of each weather variable.

We first select non-parametric controls for unobservable factors to isolate plausibly random variation in our set of weather measures5,22,31. Specifically, we use administrative unit i (typically county), fixed effects \({\mu }_{i}\), absorbing time-invariant confounds such as soil quality; country–year fixed effects \({\rho }_{ct}\), absorbing country-by-year price and trade policy confounds; and state or province quadratic time trends \({h}_{s}(t)\), absorbing slow-moving, local confounds such as the diffusion of new technologies or local variation in prices (equation (1), Supplementary equations (B.12) and (D.1)–(D.6)). We separately partial out the variation in yields yit and the vector of regressors xit on these non-parametric controls (Supplementary Information, section B), leaving us with residual variation \({\widetilde{y}}_{it}\) and \({\widetilde{{\bf{x}}}}_{it}\) for our cross-validation procedures.

We implement cross-validation over ten random folds to systematically evaluate the importance for yields of the broad range of weather measures previously described in the literature. Each potential model is required to have at least one temperature term and one moisture term. (Temperature and precipitation are known to be correlated, so causal effects estimation of one without controlling for the other is vulnerable to bias5. Vapour pressure deficit was treated as a moisture term. Note: these terms may affect moisture demand and/or soil moisture supply). Weather terms are each interacted with a fixed set of covariates: growing season average daily maximum temperature (‘long-run temperature', \(\overline{T}\)), growing season average monthly precipitation (‘long-run precipitation', \(\bar{P}\)), log(GDPpc) (‘income', \(\bar{I}\)) and the share of cropped area equipped for irrigation (‘irrigation', \(R\)). This ensures that weather variable selection occurs using models that are at least as flexible as those selected after the second cross-validation step, without having to simultaneously explore the full set of potential combinations of weather measures and covariate interactions (which would number 103,904 separate models). In selecting a candidate set of weather terms over which to study adaptation, we seek to optimize over parsimony and explanatory power, selecting a high-performing model in which additional weather terms do not individually contribute substantial fit gains (see Supplementary Tables 7 and 8).

Not all weather terms can be reliably projected by climate models72,73,74 and models containing these candidate variables were explored in the cross-validation procedure (Extended Data Fig. 2) but ultimately excluded in projections of climate change because they could not be projected with reasonably high confidence. Overall, this procedure evaluates the out-of-sample (OOS) performance of candidate models that include all combinations of weather variables that we draw from the literature and allows for varying degrees of nonlinearity (Fig. 1, Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2 and Supplementary Information, sections B–D).

In our second cross-validation step, we select a set of covariate interactions for which covariates reflect the factors that mediate producer adaptation actions4,19,26,27,75,76 (equation (B.7)). We take as given the set of weather parameters selected from the first step, allowing for interactions between weather variables and income, irrigation, \(\bar{T}\), \(\bar{P}\) and/or \(\bar{T}\times \bar{P}\). Further, we allow for the nonlinear precipitation response to vary over phases of the growing season or to be constant over the growing season, with ‘phases' of the growing season defined by a systematic model search (Supplementary Table 4). Finally, we also allow for interaction terms between degree day responses and monthly precipitation.

Accounting for mediating effects of income and irrigation is important because access to resources alters producer actions through several channels—such as access to technology77,78,79,80,81, insurance and credit markets77,80,82,83, inputs such as fertilizer77,84 or labour markets77,79,81 or information85. Notably, this minimizes confounding in our estimates, as resources and climate tend to be correlated (for example, poorer nations tend to be located in the tropics86) and it allows our model to capture that climate and income jointly determine yields87. Further, this allows us to project future changes associated with economic development.

In this step, we use cross-validation with ten folds over random blocks of data grouped by state/province. Here the test of model performance is the ability to model yields for a set of states or provinces that are held out of the data. This matches one of the intended uses of our interaction surface, which is to model the heterogeneous response of yields to weather for locations with no yield data available.

In our climate projections, long-run average precipitation (\(\bar{P}\)) values range more than 17 standard deviations outside the mean in our historical data. To prevent extrapolating adaptation behaviour to \(\bar{P}\) values far outside our data, we imposed a single-knot linear spline in \(\bar{P}\) for each weather measure (\({z}_{a}(\bar{{P}_{i}})\), \({z}_{b}(\bar{{P}_{i}})\) and \({z}_{c}(\bar{{P}_{i}})\) below). These knots were chosen using a within-R2 search over knot locations (Supplementary Information, section D). See Supplementary Information, sections B–D for further estimation details.

The final maize specification is:

with

in which yit is log(yields) in administrative unit i in year t, \({{\rm{DD}}}_{it}^{8-31}\) represents degree days from 8 °C to 31 °C, which is interacted with each of average growing season daily maximum temperature (\({\bar{T}}_{i}\)), splines in average growing season total precipitation (\({z}_{[\cdot ]}({\bar{P}}_{i})\)), the interaction between \({\bar{T}}_{i}\) and \({z}_{[\cdot ]}({\bar{P}}_{i})\), average log(GDPpc) (Ii) and area equipped for irrigation (Ri). The remaining weather terms have similar interactions. prcp_phase[j]it represents monthly precipitation summed within growing-season-phase j, for j ∈ {1, 2, 3}. μi, hs(t) and ρct are as described previously. Standard errors of all estimated parameters allow for the correlated nature of yields (and weather) across space and over time. Specifically, we estimate cluster-robust standard errors88, which allow arbitrary correlations across observations over time within first-level administrative units (that is, autocorrelations within and between counties within a given state) and across all observations within a given country–year. See ref. 31 for a discussion of this issue in this context. Note that the terms in equation (1) reflect rows (weather variables) and columns (mediating variables) illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1b. See Supplementary Information, section D, for full details of the final model specification for each crop.

We note that the overall fit of the above empirical model to the historical data is high, with an R2 of 0.85 for maize. For reference, the seminal analysis of maize by Schlenker and Roberts5 report a model R2 of 0.77 when modelling yields for only the Eastern United States, for which data quality is high relative to much of the globe and the underlying patterns of producer behaviour are probably more homogeneous across locations.

We are able to empirically observe the benefits of adaptive management among producing regions because adaptation decisions have costs19,26. If adaptations were free, then we would expect all regions to use uniform management practices and varieties using only the most climate-resilient technology available, as this strategy would convey benefits at no cost19,29. To capture the full impact of climate change on agricultural systems, it is therefore essential that these costs of adaptation are accounted for, as well as adaptation benefits, as these costs would not be incurred in the absence of climate change.

We cannot observe these costs directly but they can be inferred under the assumption that profit-maximizing producers undertake adaptations for which the benefits exceed costs, but not those for which costs exceed benefits29. This is referred to as a ‘revealed preference' approach and is widely used in economics research89. Specifically, we follow the approach developed in ref. 29 to track these costs for each crop and in each region until 2100 (see Supplementary Information, section H, for a derivation, Supplementary Fig. 6 for intuition and Supplementry equations (H.6) and (H.7) for a detailed example). We follow ref. 19 and deduct these costs from yield changes to develop a complete measure of climate change impacts29. Thus, our projections of climate change impacts on yields should be interpreted as capturing both the costs and the benefits of voluntary producer adaptations in each location.

Intuitively, consider the term \({\gamma }_{6}{\bar{T}}_{i}\) in equation (1), through which long-run average temperature in region i (\({\bar{T}}_{i}\)) modulates the negative effect of extreme heat shocks (\({{\rm{DD}}}_{it}^{31+}\)) on yields. A 1 °C increase in \({\bar{T}}_{i}\) flattens the negative extreme heat slope by γ6 log points per extreme heat degree day—a benefit of adaptation in hotter climates. If a producer in this example expects ten extreme heat degree days during the growing season, then the expected adaptation benefit for a 1 °C increase in \({\bar{T}}_{i}\) would be 10 × γ6 log points of yields. This benefit must not be costless, otherwise producers would have already adapted away all extreme heat yield losses. We thus infer marginal adaptation costs as equal to the marginal adaptation benefits that we estimate (an implication of assuming that producers maximize profits; see Supplementary Information, section H for details).

Many correlated aspects of weather affecting crop biophysical processes have been separately studied2,5,36,67,68,69,70,71,101,102,103 and we evaluate which are important drivers of the biophysical processes affecting yields of each crop. We use cross-validation to evaluate more than 8,000 candidate empirical models across all six crops, for which each model predicts residual changes in historical crop yields using a different combination of weather variables proposed by previous studies5,67,68,69,70,71. On the basis of OOS performance, we find that nonlinear degree days are the most important determinant of yields, on average across crops, by a considerable margin (Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2). Degree days increases model OOS fit (Supplementary Table 7) across crops by 51.7% on average (relative to the second-best model), with the largest gain for sorghum (101.6%, a doubling of model OOS fit) and the smallest gains for rice and cassava (9.1% and 9.4%). In general, exposure to cool daily temperatures (<9 °C for wheat and <29–31 °C for all other crops) modestly increase yields, whereas daily temperatures above these thresholds cause sharp declines in yields; for example, lowering end-of-season maize yields by −5% for each day that shifts from a 25 °C to a 40 °C day (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3). This finding generalizes previous results from the USA (for example, see ref. 5) globally and across crops.

Seasonal precipitation is the second most important determinant of yields across all crops, to the exclusion of a wide range of other candidate weather variables put forward in the literature (Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2). Nonlinear measures of seasonal precipitation increase model OOS fit across crops by 14.5%, with the largest gains for rice and maize (22.8% and 22.2%) and the smallest gains for wheat, soybean and sorghum (7.8%, 9.2% and 9.4%; Supplementary Table 8). Across crops, increasing seasonal monthly precipitation raises yields on average 0.2% per mm at low rainfall levels (<100 mm per month), has little effect at intermediate levels (250–300 mm per month) and reduces yields −0.6% per mm at higher levels (>400 mm per month; Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4).

In contrast to reports from individual empirical studies (for example, refs. 67,68,69,71), we find that monthly average minimum temperatures (tmin), vapour pressure deficit, drought, the count of rain days, the count of extreme rain days and the amount of extreme rain generally only contribute modest gains to yield model fits (average % gains in OOS fit range from 1.2% to 3.6% excluding drought for cassava, discussed below). Minimum temperatures are important predictors for rice and wheat yields but not other crops (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8).

There are exceptions for individual crops. Cassava yields are generally insensitive to weather overall (the maximum OOS variance predicted is 2.3%), motivating its cultivation in contexts in which the climate is not conducive to other staple crops that are more sensitive104. We find that growing season drought is the most important factor for predicting cassava yields (24.0% gain in variance predicted; Supplementary Table 7). Drought is also important for rice yields, as is the count of rain days (6.4% and 8.0% gain in variance predicted; Supplementary Table 7). The count of rain days is also moderately important for maize yields (6.6% gain in variance predicted; Supplementary Table 7). Taken together, these results indicate the importance of nuanced projections of future precipitation distributions for a restricted set of global staple crops.

We find that producers adapt to higher temperatures such that, across crops and around the world, yields are systematically less sensitive to daily temperature and generally more sensitive to seasonal precipitation in locations that are hotter on average (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs. 1b, 3a,e and 4a,e). Similarly, yields are less responsive to temperature and more responsive to precipitation in locations that are drier on average (Extended Data Figs. 1b, 3b,f and 4b,f). Because climate-associated adaptations influence numerous—possibly correlated—aspects of weather–crop responses, we estimate the mediating influence of all dimensions of climate simultaneously on all dimensions of weather for each crop, generating a multidimensional function describing these interacting relationships (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). This function serves as the basis for projecting adaptation to climate change (Methods and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5) and has not been previously represented in global process-based models7,8.

We also find that rising incomes enable producers to respond to environmental conditions in important but varied ways, thereby mediating the effects of different climates. For example, maize and sorghum yields become more sensitive to temperature as incomes rise, whereas rice and cassava become less sensitive (Extended Data Figs. 1b and 3c). These differences could be because of differences in how access to improved technologies, infrastructure, banking and credit or insurance77,78,80,82 influence producer strategies77,83. Notably, however, we find that higher incomes and access to irrigation are associated with greater resilience to precipitation extremes across all crops (Extended Data Figs. 1b, 3g and 4g), consistent with access to improved irrigation technologies increasing with income77,80.

We integrate our econometric results with the DSCIM28,29 to develop projections and partial SCC estimates (Supplementary Information, section K.5). Calculations were conducted as described in refs. 28,29, over 24,378 geographically granular regions, 33 climate models and 1,920 Monte Carlo draws of statistical uncertainty per crop. Following ref. 29, we project the impacts of climate change net of adaptation and its costs, relative to a counterfactual in which incomes grow but the climate is held fixed. Projections in percentage terms represent weighted averages of log yield estimates, converted to percentages. Crop impacts are aggregated over space using cropped area weights (Supplementary Information, section A), over climate models using surrogate model mixed ensemble61 weights (Supplementary Table 9) and over crops using calorie weights90. Yield gains from CO2 fertilization are difficult to empirically quantify91,92,93,94 but we adjust our projections to incorporate CO2 fertilization using previous estimates9. Yield projections are robust to restricting future weather projections to be bound within the support of the historical data (Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Fig. 12). See Supplementary Information, section G for full details of the projection methodology.

To calculate a partial SCC, we must value climate-induced changes in yields for both producers and consumers (Supplementary Figs. 19 and 21). Our approach to this valuation follows ref. 95 and models consumers and producers of calories with constant elasticity of demand and supply, drawing elasticities from the literature95,96,97. We allow for frictionless crop trade within country but do not allow for trade between countries. We test sensitivity to this assumption by allowing frictionless trade between countries within continents and throughout the globe. We consider the potential impacts of crop switching, shifting of cropped areas and international trade by drawing on the previous model-based literature75,98,99,100. In calculating the SCC, we follow ref. 28 to calculate results for constant discount rates (2%, 2.5%, 3%, 5%) and refs. 28,47 for Ramsey discounting (ρ = 0, η = 2). See Supplementary Information, section K, for full details of the valuation methodology.

A challenge to this analysis is the limited way in which future resource access has been projected105, that is, relying on standardized scenarios contained in the SSPs65. Numerous types of resources probably influence how staple crops are managed. However, we restricted our analysis to consider only the mediating effects of income and irrigation. We treat income as a proxy measure for access to resources associated with economic development, such as fertilizer or extension services. These variables are intentionally omitted from regression models so that their influence will be captured by the income variable, allowing them to be represented in standard socioeconomic projections for which income is projected and available to us, but these other variables are not65. Mediating effects of irrigation are accounted for explicitly because they are influential and irrigation presence is dependent on groundwater geology, local topography and surface water flows, which are not well captured by income nor climate measures. An important area for future work is to develop projections of irrigation for use in crop yield projections.

Another challenge is that our measures of climate used to estimate adaptation are cross-sectional; thus, correlations between climate and omitted variables that determine the shape of the yield–weather response could potentially bias our estimates of adaptation. If such correlations exist, they might be regional in nature or otherwise only affect limited subsamples of our data. As a partial test of this possibility, we examine non-parametric estimates of the association between climate and temperature sensitivity and find that the associations we rely on are systematic throughout the data (Supplementary Fig. 3). This suggests that any unknown omitted variable would have to be consistently correlated with climate throughout our sample to influence our analysis.

We are able to account for some, but not all, potential shifts in crop growing seasons under future climate change. Our parameterization of adaptation implicitly captures effects of shifting the harvest date earlier in the growing season (for example, to avoid late-season heat exposure; see Supplementary Information, section B). However, we cannot capture the effects of planting dates that may shift to a period before the start of our growing season windows nor can we capture crop switching in our yield models (although we do capture it in the valuation of impacts; see Supplementary Information, section K). We note that such shifts may not depend only on temperatures but also on rainfall quantity and timing, which are not yet well modelled by existing GCMs72,73,74. These are forms of adaptation that some process-based models explicitly include7,8,9,18,106,107,108. Furthermore, unlike process-based models, our reduced-form approach by design does not capture the agronomic mechanisms by which climatic changes influence future yields. Such mechanistic insights can be used to guide crop research in expectation of future climate stresses41,42,43,44, highlighting an important trade-off in the two methodological approaches (Supplementary Information, section B.1).

For precipitation effects, we do not project some extreme precipitation effects because these precipitation extremes are not well captured by the existing suite of GCMs72,73,74. We highlight this as an area of need for future research from the climate modelling community, with potentially important implications for our further understanding of climate change impacts to global food security.

Also, we note that our valuation of agricultural damages from climate change and the partial SCC only accounts for the crops in our sample, which account for a large share of global calories but a smaller share of total agricultural revenues. The present analysis does not include effects of climate change on other sources of agricultural revenue, such as livestock, citruses and other specialty crops. We look to future work to incorporate these output categories.

For each staple crop, cross-validation is used to first select key weather variables that influence yields (rows) and then applied to select mediating variables that capture adaptation or resource access (columns). Each selected mediating variable interacts with each selected weather variable. All observations are residualized before model selection, to remove cross-sectional and time series confounders. All candidates models are tested for each crop; a and b illustrate the process only for maize. a, First step: cross-validation is used to select weather variables that influence maize (see Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3 for all crops). Top panel (blue) shows the unconditional distribution of OOS root-mean-squared error (RMSE) for all candidate models. Subsequent rows show pairs of conditional distributions that partition the sample. Green distributions depict model performance for all model permutations that include the indicated weather variable; grey distributions represent all model permutations that exclude the weather variable. Vertical lines indicate average values for each distribution. Strongly non-overlapping distributions indicate that models including the weather variable systematically tend to outperform those that exclude it. Fully overlapping distributions indicate that the indicated weather variable used to stratify models does not improve model fit. Weather terms with black stars were retained in the maize model. b, Second step: using cross-validation to select mediating variables that capture adaptation to climate (for example, average temperature) or resource access (for example, GDP per capita). Candidate mediating variables are all interacted with weather variables from a. Sub-panels depict the mediating influence of the these factors (columns) on the response to weather variables (rows). Grey panels indicate pairs of variables that are not selected for the final model. Colours indicate a weather response that is empirically recovered for a lower (blue) or upper (red) tercile, although actual model specifications are continuous interactions. All coefficients and interactions are estimated simultaneously from a single joint model. Standard errors robust88 to autocorrelation over time within first-level administrative units (for example, states) and across all units within country–year. c, Similar to b but indicating weather-mediating variable pairs selected in the final model (white squares) for each crop.

The top row shows the kernel density of model OOS root-mean-squared error values for each crop; subsequent rows show conditional densities for each weather term. Pink represents all model permutations including the given weather term; grey represents all model permutations excluding the given term. Black bars indicate the average fit difference from including the term and red stars indicate significance (P < 0.05, t-test). Weather terms with black stars were carried forward to the next cross-validation procedure. The bottom four rows represent weather terms that cannot be reliably projected by existing climate models72,73,74.

Empirically estimated temperature and precipitation response surfaces, by crop and by adaptation parameter. Columns are crops, rows are adaptation parameters (covariates). Yellow: all covariates evaluated at the sample mean; blue: covariate of interest evaluated at its lower tercile; red: covariate of interest evaluated at its upper tercile. Note that the top panel includes an extra column for rice (tmin). Also note that cassava does not include irrigation in the model, thus no irrigation interaction effects are plotted for this crop. Standard errors robust88 to correlated shocks within state over space and time and within country–year. See Extended Data Fig. 4 for wheat.

Empirically estimated temperature and precipitation response surface for wheat, by adaptation parameter. Columns are seasons, rows are adaptation parameters (covariates). Yellow: all covariates evaluated at the sample mean; blue: covariate of interest evaluated at its lower tercile; red: covariate of interest evaluated at its upper tercile. Standard errors robust88 to correlated shocks within state over space and time and within country–year.

Crop yields observed in our data (‘Observed') versus those predicted by our model when dropping country–year fixed effects from estimation (‘Fitted'). The dotted red line is the y = x line; perfect fitted values would lie on this line. The distribution of fitted values around this line indicates that our modelled yields are, on average, unbiased. Fitted yields in levels converted from logs accounting for the non-zero expectation of the log error term. Data winsorized at the 99th percentile for visual clarity. Horizontal banding in some plots associated with known data issues in some countries.

Comparison of modelled versus observed yields for many regions of the world. Red dots are observed values, blue dots are modelled values. Rows are crops. Column 1 plots data for the region with average yield at the 95th percentile of yields in the data (by crop), column 2 the 95th percentile of cropped area, column 3 the 5th percentile of yields and column 4 the 5th percentile of cropped area. Yields originally modelled in logs and converted to levels accounting for the non-zero expectation of the exponentiated error term. 95% confidence intervals are asymmetric owing to conversion to levels and top-coded in some cases for visual clarity. The y-axis scale is consistent within crop (rows).

Metrics details

All contemporary Eurasians trace most of their ancestry to a small population that dispersed out of Africa about 50,000 years ago (ka)1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa10,11,12,13,14,15. These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000 years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70 ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50 ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success.

Genetic evidence, including patterns of interbreeding with Eurasian hominins, indicates that all contemporary human populations outside Africa derive most of their ancestry from a worldwide expansion that began approximately 50 ka (refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). However, the fossil record shows that earlier dispersals also occurred10,11,12,13,14,15,16. These dispersals out of Africa probably took place during repeated humid episodes within the Saharo-Arabian arid belt, most notably during the Last Interglacial, approximately 125 ka (refs. 10,17). An important question, therefore, concerns why these earlier dispersals were not successful enough to contribute any detectable genetic ancestry of non-African populations today, with early Homo sapiens failing to establish long-term viable populations in areas beyond Africa.

Researchers have proposed a range of explanations for the late dispersal of modern humans from Africa. Studies have considered that abrupt climate change in Africa18 and large shifts in human cognition, technology and subsistence permitted the development of new ‘niche-broadening' innovations, such as the distinctly human ability to communicate symbolically or develop projectile weaponry19,20,21,22,23. However, complex weaponry has now been shown to have notable time depth in Africa24,25 and recurrent markers of symbolic behaviour are present at least during Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS 5, 130–71 ka) in both Africa26,27,28,29,30 and Southwest Asia29,30. By around 60 ka, the Middle Stone Age/Middle Palaeolithic archaeological record of Northeast Africa and neighbouring regions of Southwest Asia had become rather generic31,32, with no particularly notable, regionally specific shared characteristics. More broadly, the African archaeological record features complex, nonlinear trajectories of cultural change33,34. These often include long periods of stasis punctuated by relatively brief pulses of innovation in different African regions35,36,37,38,39,40,41 thousands of years before the advent of Eurasian founder populations10,42. Large, cumulative changes in the archaeological record also post-date the 60–50-ka time frame10, suggesting that the success of modern human founding populations in Eurasia did not rest on a particular widespread technological innovation or sudden increased cognitive capacity43. More recent studies have focused on a variety of interrelated explanations rooted in demography. In particular, the apparent geographic expansion of Middle Stone Age archaeological sites in Africa 125–50 ka has been considered to reflect a possible growth in population coupled with an expansion inside Africa of an ancestry similar to the major expansion wave1,44,45,46. This population expansion is also thought to include greater population density47 and increases in connectivity through long-distance social networks48, all of which may have acted as ‘push' factors. Building on quantitative studies of niche changes associated with hominin species49, and with particular Middle Stone Age lithic industries22, the spatial patterning of sites has also been used to suggest a uniquely human adaptation to a ‘generalist–specialist' niche50. However, none of these hypotheses have been quantitatively assessed on a continental scale and few have been examined in terms of the predictions of suitable theoretical models, risking a proliferation of post-hoc explanations51,52. Because human expansion within and out of Africa can be linked to expansions in niche breadth under an ideal free distribution53 model, we explored successful out of Africa in terms of expansions of the human niche. As population densities increase, human settlement in more challenging environments becomes profitable. Under such conditions, in which the critical population mass required for successful out of Africa movements is reached and the ecological resilience of humans increases, expansions can occur54,55.

Here we specifically test whether the niche of Pleistocene H. sapiens expanded or contracted within Africa before major dispersals out of the continent. We define niche as the ensemble of bioclimatic factors determining where the species can survive and reproduce56. To answer this question, we build on previous studies22,57,58,59,60 and use a SDM approach61 to measure changes in the breadth of the Pleistocene human niche within Africa. Our results, tested against two different sets of palaeoenvironmental simulations62,63,64, formally demonstrate that human niche expansion precedes and coincides with successful later dispersal out of Africa.

To reconstruct the human niche in Africa over time, we took a pan-African approach and assembled a comprehensive and curated database of radiometrically dated Pleistocene occupation layers from archaeological sites in the time frame 120–14 ka, excluding any site with an age uncertainty greater than 20,000 years (see Methods for details on the choice of sites and Supplementary Table 1 for sites included here). For each retained occupation layer (Fig. 1), which represents a confirmed presence, we then extracted reconstructed palaeoclimatic variables and biomes62 (based on vegetation simulations with the BIOME4 model) associated with the location and date for a total of 479 radiometrically dated occurrences. We focused on five bioclimatic and vegetation variables that seemed to be the most informative to reconstruct habitat suitability based on our data (see Methods): (1) leaf area index (LAI); (2) temperature annual range (BIO 7); (3) mean temperature of the wettest quarter (BIO 8); (4) mean temperature of the warmest quarter (BIO 10); and (5) precipitation of the wettest quarter (BIO 16). Because of the limited amount of data for each specific biome, the vegetation simulations from BIOME4 were combined into three main classes: forest, savannah and desert (see Methods and Supplementary Table 4). We used two sets of palaeoclimatic simulations based on: (1) the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3 (ref. 62)), with results presented in the main text, and (2) the Transient Community Earth System Model (PCESM63,64), with results shown in Extended Data Fig. 8a. Although the two sets of simulations have a high degree of correlation, the magnitude in fluctuations for both temperature and precipitation differs through time and space (Extended Data Fig. 8a); despite these discrepancies, all of the key results are qualitatively robust to the palaeoclimate model used.

To reconstruct the human niche over time, we used a SDM approach fitted to the five bioclimatic variables. Biome classes were not used as inputs for the SDMs but only to characterize the environment of cells predicted as habitable by the models. Conventionally, niche changes are tested by fitting SDMs to different time periods and comparing the inferred niches. However, data for Pleistocene humans are very sparse and it would not be possible to create several time slices with enough occurrences. Instead, we use generalized additive models (GAMs) to fit the full time series as a single dataset65. With this approach, it is possible to formally test for changes in the niche over time by comparing a GAM in which the effect of each environmental variable in predicting occurrences is constant through time (fixed-niche GAM) against a GAM in which the effect is allowed to vary (changing-niche GAM; formally, by fitting an interaction between each predictor and time; see Methods).

The number of dated archaeological layers in our dataset varies with time, with an increase in abundance towards more recent periods (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This pattern probably results from increased chances of preservation in the more recent past, thus constituting a form of sampling bias that could distort the results. To avoid such a bias, we randomly subsampled the observations to generate a homogeneous distribution in the number of occurrences through time (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We repeated this process 100 times to generate several ‘standard-effort datasets' to explore the stochastic effect of such subsampling (Fig. 2). We took into account the chronological uncertainty associated with each radiometric date as follows: in each of these datasets, we associated each occurrence with a date sampled from its whole available chronological range (following a normal distribution around the mean). Finally, for each standard-effort dataset, we then quantified the background distribution of the climate variables against the occurrences, sampling 200 random locations matched in time for each occurrence. Next, we fitted a fixed-niche GAM and a changing-niche GAM to each set of standard-effort occurrences coupled with the associated pseudo-absence points, giving us 100 repeats of our analysis. Formal model comparisons using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) strongly supported the changing-niche GAM in 91 of 100 repeats (see Methods). To understand the changes in the niche detected by the model, we combined repeats into an ensemble66; specifically, we combined repeats with the AIC supporting a changing-niche GAM and a Boyce continuous index (BCI; a measure of goodness of fit for presence-only data)67 larger than 0.7 and investigated changes over time. We also created an ensemble from the repeats with AIC < 2 (hence not substantially supporting a changing-niche model) using the fixed-niche GAMs, which provides us with a null model of the changes owing to climatic fluctuations over time in the absence of any niche change. A qualitatively similar pattern can be observed on the same analyses performed using the PCESM palaeoclimatic simulations63.

To handle chronological uncertainty of archaeological layers, we resampled dates from the appropriate ranges: the saturation of the points indicates the number of resamples that were attributed to a given location for each MIS (darker points come from layers with low uncertainty for which most dates fall within the same MIS; lighter points represent layers with high uncertainty for which resamples are spread among several MISs). Details of the resampling approach and chronological subdivisions within MIS 4, MIS 3 and MIS 2 are described in Methods.

The ensemble of changing-niche GAMs showed a substantial increase in the habitable geographic range of Pleistocene humans within Africa over time (Fig. 3). The most notable increase was in West, Central and North Africa beginning roughly 70 ka at the onset of MIS 4. This large increase in geographic range around 70 ka was followed by a range expansion encompassing most of Africa beginning about 29 ka, during MIS 2 (Fig. 3). These changes were the result of niche expansion, as the fixed-niche GAM predicted a relatively stable and extensive inhabitation of the whole continent (Extended Data Fig. 2). Qualitatively similar results were obtained performing the same analyses with the PCESM climate simulations (Extended Data Figs. 8b and 10).

Mean ensemble; see Methods. Yellow represents unsuitable areas and the purple colours represent increased suitability from lighter to darker shades. These are calculated as total, peripheral and core areas, encompassing 99%, 95% and 90% of archaeological occurrences, respectively. The maps for each MIS are produced by calculating the mean of the habitat suitability for each individual cell within the time slices of interest. Chronological subdivisions of MIS 4, MIS 3 and MIS 2 are described in the Methods. The climate used is that of Beyer et al.62 with added Heinrich events. See Extended Data Fig. 8b for equivalent results using PCESM63,64.

To better understand the relationship between these changes in geographic range and the realized niche breadth as defined by the ensemble of changing-niche GAMs (Fig. 4a), we investigated the changes in niche breadth for each biome class under both the changing-niche and the fixed-niche models. We created a principal component analysis of the environmental variables used in the GAMs, pooling over all time steps, to generate a synthetic 2D space that describes climatic variability over the period of interest. For each time step, we then measured the area of a kernel fitted over the locations that were predicted as suitable by the respective model in each biome class (Fig. 4b). We also explored the interaction plots (that is, the partial effects of the interaction between each bioclimatic variable and time) of the ensemble of changing-niche GAMs (Extended Data Fig. 3) to understand the exact changes in the niche, as these represent the (theoretical) full niche and are not affected by the availability of different climatic conditions. Figure 4b shows the size of the realized niche for each biome within Africa, allowing the relationship between humans and climate to change (changing-niche model), whereas Extended Data Fig. 4 compares (for both palaeoclimatic simulations used) this pattern with the plot assuming this relationship to be constant (fixed-niche model). As a result, the latter represents how human distribution would have changed only following climatic fluctuations.

a, Homo sapiens suitable habitat (combined core and peripheral areas) subdivided by biome class (desert, savannah and forest). b, Climatic niche area through time. The niche area is calculated on the plot of the first two principal components of the climatic variables by estimating the 2D 99% kernel encompassing the suitable cells (combined core and peripheral areas) for each biome class. Equivalent results using PCESM63,64 are shown in Extended Data Fig. 4a.

As shown in Fig. 4b, after fluctuations around a relatively stable level up to MIS 5a, the potential use of savannah and forest started to increase steadily between MIS 5a and MIS 4. The increase was not linked to an increase in availability of those habitats, as it was not reproduced by the fixed-niche GAM (see Extended Data Fig. 4a for an equivalent plot to Fig. 4b). Rather, use of areas in which the wettest quarter was both warmer (BIO 8) and had greater precipitation (BIO 16; see Extended Data Fig. 3) increased, thus expanding the niche progressively into the forests. The use of deserts was more variable, in part because of fluctuations in the degree of aridity of deserts available. During wetter periods, we found an increase in the niche space of deserts that were suitable for human habitation, as they were less extreme in their climatic characteristics. We observe this effect in the reconstructed realized niche area of the fixed-niche GAM, in which changes through time are only linked to climatic changes affecting available climate conditions (see Extended Data Fig. 4a). The key difference between the changing-niche and fixed-niche GAMs is that, in the former, after a peak during early MIS 5a owing to more favourable climate, deserts remain in greater use than during previous, less favourable dips. This stable expansion into the desert is then maintained until MIS 3, when we see another progressive increase in the use of desert habitats. This was not seen in the fixed-niche GAM. Mechanistically, the increased use of deserts was underpinned by an increased use of regions with larger annual temperature ranges (BIO 7 in Extended Data Fig. 3) and a progressive increase in the ability to survive in areas with low LAI (that is, with sparse vegetation; LAI in Extended Data Fig. 3). Although slightly muted, the same patterns were observed when repeating the analyses using the biome classes based on PCESM64 (Extended Data Figs. 4b and 9).

Our results show that the human niche progressively expanded to include more habitat types beginning around 70 ka and that this expansion peaked at about 50 ka, coinciding with successful dispersals out of Africa. A second expansion was observed starting approximately 29 ka; by MIS 2, humans occupied all African regions and ecosystems, with terminal Pleistocene societies engaging with a range of new behaviours, including semi-sedentism68, evidence of persistent macroscale social networking69 and increased territoriality and interpersonal violence70. Our findings are consistent using two different and independently developed sets of palaeoenvironmental simulations. The expansion of the human niche beginning around 70 ka in Africa is driven by a gradual increase in human preference for forest and desert biomes, allowing them to expand into regions that were previously rarely populated: (1) forests of West Africa, (2) forests of Central Africa and, eventually, (3) arid Saharan regions and semi-arid Sahelian regions of North Africa. This increased ability to adapt to new habitats, ranging from the extremes of equatorial forests to arid deserts, would have allowed these populations of humans the ecological flexibility to tackle a range of new environmental conditions encountered during the expansion out of Africa, allowing them to succeed where earlier migrations out of Africa had previously faltered. The expansion of the human niche in Africa starting around 70 ka, therefore, offers an explanation for the successful worldwide expansion of human populations about 50 ka and is consistent with predictions informed by the ideal free distribution about the consequences of population expansions.

These results also offer insights into changes in the archaeological record between approximately 70 and 50 ka, a time when diverse regions feature distinctive cultural trajectories (see Supplementary Information). In particular, ecosystem engineering through widespread burning71, water storage technology72,73 and expanded diet breadth74 have been previously documented in Africa broadly within this time frame and slightly before. These findings may reflect behavioural preconditions and manifestations of the expansion of the human niche into new habitats. It is important to stress that our pan-African results do not imply a unique, unified process over the whole continent. It is indeed more likely that it is linked to a few specific cultural complexes. More research must be carried out to unravel what drove the changes that we observe.

We emphasize that, although we document a niche expansion, this does not necessarily reflect an increase in overall population size and it may not be possible to distinguish between the effects of population size increase versus increases in density within reduced niche space47. For example, the new human niche in arid regions was unlikely to have sustained large or stable population sizes owing to low carrying capacity75. Instead, the expansion of the human niche indicates that humans were able to move among several habitats and locations, probably increasing the encounter rate between different groups over time. If this were the case, it may explain why the constellation of features that define humans today became fixed in individuals between 100 and 50 ka (ref. 42). It would also provide independent support for the hypothesis that there could have been an expansion inside Africa of an ancestry that is similar to the one that expanded into Eurasia after about 60 ka (refs. 44,45).

The period roughly 70–50 ka is climatically complex. Although the Heinrich Event 6 brings an overall cooler and drier spell owing to the weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation76, the magnitude of this effect differs across regions of Africa. Notably, the proxy record points to repeated shifts between dry and wet spells77, with suggestions of a broader humid period that might have affected a large part of the continent following Heinrich Event 6 (ref. 78). Our runs of HadCM3 (combining Beyer et al.62 and Armstrong et al.79) capture this temporal and spatial heterogeneity (Extended Data Fig. 8a); in PCESM63,64, which does not explicitly include Heinrich Event 6, the pattern is more muted (Extended Data Fig. 8a). The impact of Heinrich Event 6 for human evolution has mostly been framed in terms of its role in dispersals out of Africa. It has been argued that the aridification of Northern and Eastern Africa might have acted as a push event favouring migrations of humans out of Africa80; however, it should also be noted that, because of the cooling effect and its heterogeneous impact, this period potentially provided corridors that might have favoured movement out of the continent81. A similar argument can be made for the onset of MIS 2 around 29 ka, when a period of heterogeneous aridification prompted a further move into more arid habitats. Given our results, it is plausible that the instability of climate in these periods might have favoured the evolution of a broader niche in humans, further enhancing their ability to cope with the diverse habitats that distinguish the genus Homo64.

By modelling the human niche within Africa from 120 to 14 ka, we show that successful expansion into Eurasia and the long-term establishment of populations there were part of a process that fundamentally started within Africa. Essentially, we document the inception of an unquestionably African process originating 70 ka that has resulted in today's unparalleled human ecological plasticity. Our results, therefore, provide a new basis for understanding and investigating our species' global dispersal.

Coordinates of archaeological sites are essential for SDMs, as these models are built on the accurate input of spatial occurrence/presence data. Chronometrically dated archaeological layers are also necessary for linking occurrences to the appropriate local climate simulations used in SDMs. Radiometric dating methods provide age estimations before present that are measured on the basis of physical and chemical changes that occur over time82. Radiocarbon (14C), uranium–thorium (U-Th or U-series), optically stimulated luminescence, thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance—among others—are dating methods that provide age estimates in calendar years before present83. In cases in which the age of an archaeological layer was estimated only by non-radiometric methods, it was excluded from subsequent analyses. Non-radiometric dating methods include biochronology, typology and palaeomagnetism. If an archaeological layer was not dated, it was likewise excluded from subsequent analyses. Following the removal of archaeological layers that were not subjected to radiometric dating techniques, further limits were placed on archaeological occurrences included in distribution models and niche area calculations. Any occurrence was excluded if the minimum age subtracted from the maximum age was greater than 20,000 years. These efforts resulted in a database (Supplementary Table 1) with archaeological layers that have: (1) published coordinates; (2) radiometric dates; (3) an age error range less than or equal to 20,000 years; and (4) mean age ≤120,000 and ≥14,000 years. Archaeological sites and layers were compiled from peer-reviewed journals and books published before 5 May 2021. The Role of Culture in Early Expansions of Humans (ROCEEH) has been integrating archaeological, palaeoanthropological, palaeontological and palaeobotanical information into the ROCEEH Out of Africa Database (ROAD) since 2009 (ref. 84). As of May 2021, the team has compiled information on more than 2,000 localities and more than 12,000 assemblages in Africa and Eurasia dated between three million and 20,000 years before present. The information in ROAD is structured into localities (sites) with dated layers that contain assemblages of finds, including artefacts, human fossils, palaeofauna and plant remains, and bibliographic sources. For this study, A.W.K. and M.W. queried ROAD to create a list of archaeological localities in Africa dating between about 500,000 and 10,000 years and reviewed the output for accuracy. The output also included the ages of the layers, as well as radiometric dating results.

In our database of archaeological sites, all radiocarbon dates were entered as uncalibrated ages, with the exception of Haua Fteah, for which modelled and calibrated 14C radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence/electron spin resonance ages were entered from Douka et al.85. If a single archaeological layer was dated with both 14C and further chronometric dating methods, the uncalibrated radiocarbon ages were entered in a separate column from the extra radiometric dating methods. For all uncalibrated 14C ages entered in our database, a basic IntCal20 (ref. 86) calibration for Northern Hemisphere archaeological localities and a basic SHCal20 calibration for Southern Hemisphere archaeological localities was completed using the rcarbon R package87. The calibrated 14C ages were then used to determine the mean age and age error ranges were calculated to the level of 1σ. If an archaeological layer was dated with 14C and further methods, our calibrated 14C mean age and 1σ error were then combined with the mean age and error range of the other methods to find the mean age used in our models. Note that we did not calibrate 14C ages using marine calibration curves (Marine20 (ref. 88)), nor did we calculate ΔR values for marine carbonates (but see Reimer and Reimer89 for calculation of ΔR for paired marine and terrestrial dates). Marine calibration curves and ΔR values were not included in our 14C calibration for two reasons: (1) for many 14C ages, it is unknown whether dated samples are marine or terrestrial shell and (2) ΔR values are determined regionally based on the nearest samples in the ΔR database but, for much of Africa, the sampling coverage is low. We also did not subtract 180 years before calibration from 14C ages obtained from ostrich eggshell90 (as 180 years is too short a time span to change our models that run in 1,000-year or 2,000-year intervals), nor did we set the northernmost limit for Southern Hemisphere calibration at the Intertropical Convergence Zone, as this boundary is recommended only when seasonal variations are known91. Instead, we set the boundary between Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere calibration at the equator, as seasonal variations are unknown for most of the archaeological sites included in the present study. Extended Data Fig. 5 shows the differences between the calibration applied in the present study, opposite hemisphere calibration that was not applied and marine calibration that was not applied. In all cases, the possible dates based on different approaches to calibration fall within a relatively narrow range that would lead, at most, to moving a site to the adjacent 2-ka time window and would have a minimal effect on the local climate assigned to that occurrence. Supplementary Table 2 shows the number assigned to each archaeological site name and layer for Extended Data Fig. 5, as well as uncalibrated ages and errors, calibrated ages and 1σ errors that were used in the present study and calibrated ages and 1σ errors that were not used in the present study.

To better visualize how the patterns change through time, and better compare different periods, in our figures, we subdivided MIS stages 4, 3 and 2 to create roughly equal time periods. We subdivided MIS stages 5, 4, 3 and 2 following δ18O peaks and lows from Cohen and Gibbard92. We subdivided MIS 5 into MIS 5e (120–116 ka), MIS 5d (116–104 ka), MIS 5c (104–94 ka), MIS 5b (94–85 ka) and MIS 5a (84–71 ka); MIS 4 was subdivided into early (71–64 ka) and late (64–57 ka); MIS 3 was subdivided into early (57–47 ka), middle (47–39 ka) and late (39–29 ka); and MIS 2 was subdivided into early (29–23 ka) and late (23–15 ka).

The palaeoclimatic reconstructions from Beyer et al.62 do not include water hosing to simulate Heinrich events. To include them, we considered simulations from Armstrong et al.79 (although the reference cited focuses on the Northern Hemisphere, the associated simulations of the global circulation model are available on BRIDGE93). In those simulations, Dansgaard–Oeschger and Heinrich events are imposed as a spatial fingerprint with time-varying amplitude to match temperature reconstruction from Greenland ice cores. The spatial fingerprint itself was derived from a freshwater hosing simulation during the Last Glacial Maximum using HadCM3B-M2.1 (ref. 79). As the two runs use slightly different boundary conditions, we computed anomalies for monthly temperature and precipitation between the time slices of interest (that is, with Heinrich events simulated by water hosing) and the simulations for the present, and then added those anomalies to the simulations from the present used by Beyer et al.62, working at the original coarse resolution of HadCM3. We then bias-corrected and downscaled those time slices using the same approach as Beyer et al.62, thus creating a coherent dataset, and recomputed BIOCLIM variables and ran the BIOME4 global vegetation model, modified to include water hosing and Heinrich events. At the end, we had 17 BIOCLIM variables available (BIO 2 and BIO 3 could not be computed as they are based on daily rather than monthly summaries) and two vegetation variables (net primary productivity and LAI).

Variable selection was performed using the R package tidysdm94. The palaeoclimatic reconstructions (Beyer et al.62 with added Heinrich events; see section above) were stored as a netCDF file and were accessed using the R package pastclim95 (dataset = “custom”). We defined which variables to use for our analyses using the equivalent of the plot_pres_vs_bg() and dist_pres_vs_bg() functions in tidysdm94. We used an older version of the function tidysdm::plot_pres_vs_bg() to create a violin plot comparing the distribution over the variable space of the occurrences versus a representative sample of the background. The latter was obtained by randomly drawing 10,000 points from each time slice over the whole area and period considered (Extended Data Fig. 6a). The variables for which humans seemed to occupy the climatic space differently from what was available in the environment suggest non-random use of the variable itself, supporting the idea that they would be more meaningful to reconstruct the distribution of the species (see, for reference, the function tidysdm::dist_pres_vs_bg()). Finally, among these informative variables, we extracted a set of variables that showed a correlation among each other below a threshold of 0.8 (Extended Data Fig. 6b), leaving: LAI, temperature annual range (BIO 7), mean temperature of the wettest quarter (BIO 8), mean temperature of the warmest quarter (BIO 10) and precipitation of the wettest quarter (BIO 16).

Each radiometric date is associated with a specific chronological uncertainty, expressed as a range (most likely date and plus/minus). To take into account such uncertainty, we performed our analyses as follows. We created 100 independent datasets: for each of them, the spatial coordinates of all occurrences (= radiometrically dated archaeological layer) were associated to an age that was resampled from the whole chronological range of the date. Such sampling was performed following a truncated normal distribution identified by the mean and the plus/minus as 2σ (ref. 96).

When looking at the number of our occurrences through time (as exemplified by their mean age shown in Extended Data Fig. 1a), there is a marked increase in the number of layers observed through time. This pattern is most likely the result of a combination of an increasing number of human occupations through time, a conservation bias (with more recent traces of occupation being more likely to have survived than older ones) and the differential use of the available radiometric dating techniques (for example, 14C is only available up to around 50 ka). To account for all of these factors, each of the resampled datasets was randomly subsampled to generate a homogeneous distribution in the number of occurrences available through time (thus giving us constant sampling effort through time) using the following procedure. We identified that, at 78 ka, there is a boundary between an older period with a low number of occurrences (on average between zero and eight per time slice, varying on the basis of the chronological resampling) and a more recent period in which there is much more data available. For each resampling, we then subset each time slice from the more recent period to the number of occurrences observed in a randomly sampled older time slice (Extended Data Fig. 1).

To adequately represent the existing climatic space (that is, background) in our SDMs, each of these resulting, constant-effort datasets was coupled with a random sampling, for each observation, of 200 random locations matched by time. This resulted in n = 100 datasets (= ‘repeats') of randomly sampled and dated occurrences and differently sampled background points. We independently repeated our analyses for each of these datasets, thus accounting for the stochasticity of resolving the time uncertainty, the sampling biases and the choice of background points. From this stage, all analyses were repeated independently using two sets of palaeoclimatic simulations: Beyer et al.62 with Heinrich events and PCESM63,64.

We then used GAMs (mgcv package in R (ref. 97)) to fit two possible models: a ‘changing-niche' model that included interactions of each environmental variable with time (fitted as tensor products) and a ‘fixed-niche' model that included the environmental variables as covariates but lacking interactions with time65. Thus, for the fixed-niche model, the mgcv GAM formula is

gam(obs~ti(bio07, k=4) + ti(bio08, k=4) + ti(bio10, k=4) +

      ti(bio16, k=4) + ti(lai, k=4),

     data=data, family='binomial')

Here human presence/absence (obs) is modelled as the sum of five nonlinear functions (of the four bioclimatic variables and LAI). Each function ti() denotes a tensor product smooth term created using thin plate regression splines, in which each spline is composed of k=4 basis functions. family='binomial' indicates that the response variable (obs) follows a binomial distribution and the link function is the logit function. data denotes the R data frame containing the response and predictor variables.

For the changing-niche model, we have

gam(obs~ti(bio07, k=4) + ti(bio08, k=4) + ti(bio10, k=4) +

      ti(bio16, k=4) + ti(lai, k=4) + ti(time_bp, k=4) +

      ti(time_bp, bio07, k=4) + ti(time_bp, bio08, k=4) +

      ti(time_bp, bio10, k=4)+ ti(time_bp, bio16, k=4) +

      ti(time_bp, lai, k=4),

       data=data, family='binomial')

This model uses an extra five bivariate functions, each of which includes time before present (time_bp) as a second argument, as well as the relevant bioclimatic variable or LAI. Note that both models use bioclimatic and LAI values corresponding to the time and location of the human presence data (obs), but only the second model considers nonlinear interactions between the bioclimatic and LAI variables with time, whereas the first model only includes a univariate time function term. For a formal definition of the univariate and bivariate thin place regression splines, ti(x) and ti(t,x), respectively, we refer readers to Wood98 (specifically section 2, starting on page 1,026, as well as subsection 2.1 ‘Nesting and ANOVA decomposition' on page 1,028, which provides a rationale for how the models are compared). A comprehensive description of how GAMs are fitted in mgcv is given by Wood97.

For all GAMs, we set k = 4 as the maximum threshold for the degrees of freedom of the splines; this value provides a reasonable compromise between allowing the relationship to change through time but avoiding excessive overfitting99.

For each repeat, we performed standard checks on the residuals of the models using the DHARMa package in R (ref. 100), including the following tests: Kolmogorov–Smirnov for correct distribution, dispersion and outliers. Kolmogorov–Smirnov deviation was significant for six repeats in the changing-niche model (numbers 1, 4, 24, 37, 52 and 56) and five repeats for the fixed-niche model (numbers 1, 4, 24, 37 and 56). Outlier test deviation was significant for eight repeats of the changing-niche model (numbers 25, 38, 67, 69, 74, 78, 85 and 95) and 11 for the fixed-niche model (numbers 18, 24, 25, 30, 38, 67, 74, 77, 78, 85 and 95). All other tests and repeats were non-significant. Visual inspection of these deviations revealed that they were mostly capturing patterns of very small magnitude owing to the high power associated with the large size of the datasets (as a result of the large number of background points) and thus were judged not to affect an analysis. A comparison of models with outliers and models without outliers showed that the model effects were qualitatively similar, thus confirming that the outliers were not leading to artefactual conclusions. We also tested for spatial autocorrelation in the residuals calculating Moran's I (ref. 101) with the same package. Moran's I values were statistically significant (P-value < 0.05) but negligible (<0.01 on a scale between 0 and 1) in all cases (Supplementary Table 3).

For each repeat, we compared the fixed-niche and changing-niche models using the AIC and found strong support for the latter in all cases (Extended Data Fig. 7a). We then evaluated the fit of the changing-niche models with the BCI102, which is specifically designed to be used with presence-only data, setting an acceptance threshold of Pearson's correlation coefficient > 0.7 (ref. 67) (Extended Data Fig. 7b).

To achieve more robust predictions66, we calculated the mean and median ensembles across the 100 repeats in the following way. We selected only repeats that had an AIC > 2, hence strongly supporting the changing-niche model (91/100 for Beyer et al.62 with Heinrich events, 95/100 for PCESM63,64; Extended Data Fig. 7a). From them, we kept only repeats with a BCI > 0.7 (which accounted for 70% for Beyer et al.62 with Heinrich events and 55% for PCESM63,64; Extended Data Fig. 7b). From this selection of repeats, we created four ensembles (two for each palaeoclimatic model) by computing the mean and median of the predictions. Then, to estimate the goodness of fit of each ensemble, we computed the mean and median of the BCI estimated for each of their individual repeats (note that each repeat had a different set of occurrences and background points as a result of the random resampling).

As the mean ensemble performed better than the one based on the median, it was used to visualize how the potential distribution of humans changed through time. To incorporate the uncertainty associated with the model, the predicted probabilities of occurrence were transformed into binary (presence or absence) using three different thresholds. The first one (darkest colour in Fig. 3) represents the minimum predicted area encompassing 90% of our occurrences and identifies the ‘core area' suitable for humans (that is, the space most likely occupied). We similarly plotted a ‘peripheral area' encompassing 95% and the ‘total area' encompassing 99% of occurrences. This was done using a modified version of the function ecospat.mpa() from the ecospat R package103, in which no rounding of the digit is performed. To better visualize how the reconstructed potential distribution changed through time, we calculated for each climatic period the mean of the projections from the individual time slides. A similar procedure has been applied to the fixed-niche models, (using only the repeats with AIC < 2), for which the equivalent of Fig. 3 is available as Extended Data Fig. 2).

To visualize the changing impact of different BIO variables through time in the niche-changing model, we used the function draw.gam() from the R package gratia104 following Leonardi et al.65. This function plots the interactions between time and each of the BIO variables. The result is a heat map with time represented on the x axis and the values of the variable of interest on the y axis. Within the plot, the surface colour (‘partial effect') shows the effect on the probability of occurrence: red means an increased and blue a decreased probability compared with what would be expected on the basis of the mean value of other variables (the black lines are isoclines to aid reading the changes in the surface). We created partial effect surfaces for all repeats included in each ensemble and then plotted the mean surface, which captures consistent signals across all randomized sets of background points (Extended Data Fig. 3 for Beyer et al.62 with added Heinrich events and Extended Data Fig. 9 for PCESM63,64).

The analyses described in this section were performed on the regions combining the core and peripheral areas (that is, dark and medium purple in Fig. 3; from now on: suitable habitat). For each time slice, we subdivided the suitable habitat into three different classes of biomes (forest, savannah and desert) based on BIOME4 (ref. 62) reconstructions. Ideally, we would have done it for the finer subdivisions provided by the original model, but the limited number of occurrences in the archaeological record prevents us from performing any formal analysis at this disaggregated level (for example, we only have two points for tropical rainforest). The list of biomes included in each class can be found in Supplementary Table 4. We then aggregated the results by MIS by keeping for each cell the most common biome class within the given period (Fig. 4a).

To visualize how much of the suitable area falls into each biome class (Fig. 4b), we performed the following steps. First, we summarized the five BIO climatic variables by computing the first two principal components, pooling all land cells for all of the time steps (that is, creating a principal component analysis that represents the full climatic space of Africa for the whole period considered in this research). Then, in that 2D space, for each biome class and time step, we calculated the area covered by the 2D kernel that includes 99% of the suitable cells (core and peripheral areas) within that biome class105. We repeated this procedure separately for the changing-niche and fixed-niche models, which are presented in Extended Data Fig. 4).

To correct for the potential biases linked to the specific palaeoclimatic simulations used, we repeated the whole set of analyses described (excluding the standard checks on the residuals and the calculation of Moran's I) with the PCESM63,64 climatic simulations. The AIC and BCI are comparable with the analyses presented here (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), as are the patterns in the response surfaces of the GAMs, in which we consistently observe a change during MIS 4 (Extended Data Fig. 9). Projections of the fixed-niche and changing-niche models and results of the biome analyses are available as Extended Data Figs. 8b, 4 and 10).

The cartographic representation of Africa in Fig. 1 was originally developed on QGIS 3.22 Białowieża with WGS 84 projection. Geolocated archaeological layers were superimposed and colour-coded on the basis of chronology (Fig. 1a). Overlapping sites in Fig. 1a were stacked in ascending chronological order, with older sites overlapping younger sites. A map with archaeological occurrence/layer density per square kilometre (Fig. 1b) was developed using an automated density cluster function on QGIS 3.22 Białowieża. The resulting cartographic representations were exported as .svg format and composed on Adobe Illustrator 2025. Figures 2, 3 and 4 originated as .svg files from R. Cartographic panels were processed in Adobe Photoshop 2023 and subsequently designed and composed using Adobe Illustrator 2023.

a, Histogram of archaeological occurrences (in ka), using the mean age of each layer. b, Histogram of resampled occurrences through time (in ka) (100 resamples per layer).

The core (90% of occurrences), peripheral (95% of occurrences) and total area (99% occurrences) are shown.

Homo sapiens resampled occurrences are shown as grey dots (overlapping points are shown in darker shades based on their number). The partial effects of the GAMs (z axis, colour shading) show the interaction between the variable of interest (y axis) and time (x axis). Here we present the mean values of the partial effects plots over 100 repeats. The red shading represents favourable variable space (used more than expected by chance given the availability in the whole continent) and blue represents less favourable variable space. The y variables used in the GAMs are: temperature annual range (BIO 7), mean temperature of the wettest quarter (BIO 8), mean temperature of the warmest quarter (BIO 10), precipitation of the wettest quarter (BIO 16) and LAI.

The lower-left triangle shows the scatter plot between pairs of variables. The upper-right triangle contains the numerical values of the cross-correlations, with bigger sizes corresponding to larger distance from 0. The asterisks in each cell represent the level of significance of the corresponding value.

A, Histogram of delta AIC between the fixed-niche versus changing-niche model in the 100 repeats.

B, BCI for the changing-niche model. The BCI has only been calculated on the repeats having an AIC ≥ 2, hence supporting the changing-niche model. These have been used to build the ensembles. a, Beyer et al.57 with added Heinrich events, 91 repeats with AIC ≥ 2; among them, 70% (64) have BCI ≥ 0.7. b, PCESM58,59, 95 repeats with AIC ≥ 2; among them, 55% (52) have BCI ≥ 0.7.

Could the signals be coming from particles previously unknown to physics? 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Strange signals from outer space are constantly reaching Earth, hailing from sources like pulsars, quasars, and supernovas. In Antarctica, a signal like this recently seemed to materialize out of nowhere, but it wasn't coming from the sky above—instead, it was coming from the depths of the ocean.

Two decades ago, far above the vast expanse of ice and snow, instruments aboard the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment (now retired) were picking up radio waves from cosmic rays shooting through the atmosphere. When those rays collide with particles in said atmosphere, they scatter into secondary particles—a hundred of which pass right through our bodies every second without our realizing it. By detecting these particles, ANITA was giving insight into distant cosmic events. But then, things got weird.

ANITA detected anomalous signals coming from below the horizon, at unusually sharp angles some 30 degrees below the icy surface. What appeared to be radio pulses had to have somehow penetrated thousands of miles of rock that they should have been absorbed by. How these ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) pulses could have been detected at all was a mystery. Physicist Stephanie Wissel of Penn State University, who had been scouring ANITA data for signals from neutrinos (which are already mysterious subatomic particles) had never seen anything remotely like it. 

“Given the difficulties in interpreting the anomalous ANITA events, they have attracted a lot of attention,” Wissel and her researcher team said in a study recently published in Physical Review Letters. “Theoretical interpretations involving [exotic physics] have been put forward invoking new particles that induce upward-going showers in the atmosphere.”

The researchers thought it was possible that the signal could have been coming from those elusive neutrinos, which are blasted out by objects and phenomena that generate extreme amounts of energy. Most neutrinos interact with nothing, but tau neutrinos will interact with ice. This flavor of neutrino is associated with the tau lepton, another subatomic particle that starts to decay after it is released from ice, losing energy as it breaks down. Tau neutrino decay ends up giving off signals known as air showers, and the electromagnetic radiation released by these showers is detectable by a radio antenna such as ANITA's. But, despite that, the signal turned out not to be coming from neutrinos or tau neutrinos.

Whatever was creating these signals was incongruent with computer simulations and mathematical models of both cosmic rays and hypothetical upward air showers, and the signals themselves were unlike anything detectors similar to ANITA—such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and Pierre Auger Observatory—had ever seen. The signals didn't even fit into the Standard Model of Particle Physics, which describes how matter is made up of subatomic particles. They could only be called anomalous. 

“The results of this search do not support the interpretation that the anomalous pulses detected […] were caused by air showers sourced from particle interactions or decays, such as by decays of upward-going taus, the latter being the basis of proposed explanations based on physics beyond the Standard Model,” the researchers said.

Could the signals be coming from particles previously unknown to physics? Possibly. They might also, however, be from neutrinos that went undetected. Wissel is now working on ANITA's successor—the larger and more sensitive PUEO neutrino detector. Maybe this anomaly will tell us something we would have never otherwise imagined.

Once in a while, scientific research resembles detective work. Researchers head into the field with a hypothesis and high hopes of finding specific results, but sometimes, there's a twist in the story that requires a deeper dive into the data.

That was the case for the University of Colorado Boulder researchers who led a field campaign in an agricultural region of Oklahoma. Using a high-tech instrument to measure how aerosol particles form and grow in the atmosphere, they stumbled upon something unexpected: the first-ever airborne measurements of Medium Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (MCCPs), a kind of toxic organic pollutant, in the Western Hemisphere. Their results published today in ACS Environmental Au.

"It's very exciting as a scientist to find something unexpected like this that we weren't looking for," said Daniel Katz, CU Boulder chemistry PhD student and lead author of the study. "We're starting to learn more about this toxic, organic pollutant that we know is out there, and which we need to understand better."

MCCPs are currently under consideration for regulation by the Stockholm Convention, a global treaty to protect human health from long-standing and widespread chemicals. While the toxic pollutants have been measured in Antarctica and Asia, researchers haven't been sure how to document them in the Western Hemisphere's atmosphere until now.

MCCPs are used in fluids for metal working and in the construction of PVC and textiles. They are often found in wastewater and as a result, can end up in biosolid fertilizer, also called sewage sludge, which is created when liquid is removed from wastewater in a treatment plant. In Oklahoma, researchers suspect the MCCPs they identified came from biosolid fertilizer in the fields near where they set up their instrument.

"When sewage sludges are spread across the fields, those toxic compounds could be released into the air," Katz said. "We can't show directly that that's happening, but we think it's a reasonable way that they could be winding up in the air. Sewage sludge fertilizers have been shown to release similar compounds."

MCCPs little cousins, Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (SCCPs), are currently regulated by the Stockholm Convention, and since 2009, by the EPA here in the United States. Regulation came after studies found the toxic pollutants, which travel far and last a long time in the atmosphere, were harmful to human health. But researchers hypothesize that the regulation of SCCPs may have increased MCCPs in the environment.

"We always have these unintended consequences of regulation, where you regulate something, and then there's still a need for the products that those were in," said Ellie Browne, CU Boulder chemistry professor, CIRES Fellow, and co-author of the study. "So they get replaced by something."

Measurement of aerosols led to a new and surprising discovery

Using a nitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometer, which allows scientists to identify chemical compounds in the air, the team measured air at the agricultural site 24 hours a day for one month. As Katz cataloged the data, he documented the different isotopic patterns in the compounds. The compounds measured by the team had distinct patterns, and he noticed new patterns that he immediately identified as different from the known chemical compounds. With some additional research, he identified them as chlorinated paraffins found in MCCPs.

Katz says the makeup of MCCPs are similar to PFAS, long-lasting toxic chemicals that break down slowly over time. Known as "forever chemicals," their presence in soils recently led the Oklahoma Senate to ban biosolid fertilizer.

Now that researchers know how to measure MCCPs, the next step might be to measure the pollutants at different times throughout the year to understand how levels change each season. Many unknowns surrounding MCCPs remain, and there's much more to learn about their environmental impacts.

"We identified them, but we still don't know exactly what they do when they are in the atmosphere, and they need to be investigated further," Katz said. "I think it's important that we continue to have governmental agencies that are capable of evaluating the science and regulating these chemicals as necessary for public health and safety."

A patch containing tens of millions of microscopic nanoneedles could soon replace traditional biopsies, scientists have found.

The patch offers a painless and less invasive alternative for millions of patients worldwide who undergo biopsies each year to detect and monitor diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.

Biopsies are among the most common diagnostic procedures worldwide, performed millions of times every year to detect diseases. However, they are invasive, can cause pain and complications, and can deter patients from seeking early diagnosis or follow-up tests. Traditional biopsies also remove small pieces of tissue, limiting how often and how comprehensively doctors can analyse diseased organs like the brain.

Now, scientists at King's College London have developed a nanoneedle patch that painlessly collects molecular information from tissues without removing or damaging them. This could allow healthcare teams to monitor disease in real time and perform multiple, repeatable tests from the same area - something impossible with standard biopsies.

Because the nanoneedles are 1,000 times thinner than a human hair and do not remove tissue, they cause no pain or damage, making the process less painful for patients compared to standard biopsies. For many, this could mean earlier diagnosis and more regular monitoring, transforming how diseases are tracked and treated.

Dr Ciro Chiappini, who led the research published today in Nature Nanotechnology, said: "We have been working on nanoneedles for twelve years, but this is our most exciting development yet. It opens a world of possibilities for people with brain cancer, Alzheimer's, and for advancing personalised medicine. It will allow scientists - and eventually clinicians - to study disease in real time like never before."

The patch is covered in tens of millions of nanoneedles. In preclinical studies, the team applied the patch to brain cancer tissue taken from human biopsies and mouse models. The nanoneedles extracted molecular 'fingerprints' -- including lipids, proteins, and mRNAs -- from cells, without removing or harming the tissue.

The tissue imprint is then analysed using mass spectrometry and artificial intelligence, giving healthcare teams detailed insights into whether a tumour is present, how it is responding to treatment, and how disease is progressing at the cellular level.

Dr Chiappini said: "This approach provides multidimensional molecular information from different types of cells within the same tissue. Traditional biopsies simply cannot do that. And because the process does not destroy the tissue, we can sample the same tissue multiple times, which was previously impossible."

This technology could be used during brain surgery to help surgeons make faster, more precise decisions. For example, by applying the patch to a suspicious area, results could be obtained within 20 minutes and guide real-time decisions about removing cancerous tissue.

Made using the same manufacturing techniques as computer chips, the nanoneedles can be integrated into common medical devices such as bandages, endoscopes and contact lenses.

Dr Chippani added: "This could be the beginning of the end for painful biopsies. Our technology opens up new ways to diagnose and monitor disease safely and painlessly - helping doctors and patients make better, faster decisions."

The breakthrough was possible through close collaboration across nanoengineering, clinical oncology, cell biology, and artificial intelligence -- each field bringing essential tools and perspectives that, together, unlocked a new approach to non-invasive diagnostics.

The study was supported by the European Research Council through its flagship Starting Grant programme, Wellcome Leap, and UKRI's EPSRC and MRC, which enabled acquisition of key analytical instrumentation.

Mysterious Link between Earth's Magnetism and Oxygen Baffles Scientists

The strength of Earth's magnetic field and the amount of oxygen in its atmosphere seem to be correlated—and scientists want to know why

The strength of Earth's magnetic field seems to rise and fall hand-in-hand with the abundance of oxygen in its atmosphere, a study of geological records spanning the last half billion years has found.

Explaining the link could help to reveal fundamental trends in the evolution of life on Earth — and could show astronomers the most promising places to look for signs of complex life on other planets. But it is so far unclear whether Earth's magnetism plays direct a role in keeping oxygen levels high — and sustaining animal life — or whether both are influenced by a third, unidentified mechanism.

Nature; Source: “Strong Link between Earth's Oxygen Level and Geomagnetic Dipole Revealed since the Last 540 Million Years,” by Weija Kuang et al., in Science Advances, Vol. 11, No. 24; June 13, 2025

“We don't really have a good explanation for it,” says Benjamin Mills, a biogeochemist at the University of Leeds, UK, and co-author of the study, published in Science Advances on 13 June. But the study suggests “some potential causes that are exciting and potentially testable”, says Aubrey Zerkle, a biogeochemist at the University of St Andrews, UK.

Knowing how Earth's deep interior could influence the evolution of the atmosphere is “critical to understanding what makes our planet habitable”, says Richard Bono, a geophysicist at Florida State University in Tallahassee who has helped to compile long-term records of geomagnetism.

Oxygen is the main component of Earth's crust and mantle. But molecular oxygen only began to slowly accumulate in the atmosphere after organisms that produce oxygen through photosynthesis began to evolve, around 2.5 billion years ago. And only in the current aeon, covering the last 540 million years or so, has it reached concentrations that are breathable by most animals.

There is no direct way to measure the composition of the atmosphere in the deep past, but geochemists can use indirect clues to reconstruct oxygen levels starting in the Cambrian period, which began around 540 million years ago. For example, oxygen concentration “has a strong relationship with how easy it is to start and maintain wildfires,” says Mills, and the frequency of large wildfires can be worked out by looking at ancient charcoal deposits, among other factors.

Geophysicists can also reconstruct how the strength and direction of the geomagnetic field has varied across even longer stretches of Earth's history, by studying rocks produced by ancient volcanic eruptions. That's because magnetic crystals that form in the solidifying lava align themselves with the field, acting like tiny compasses frozen in time.

To put these two long records side-by-side and compare them, Mills teamed up with geophysicists Weijia Kuang and Ravi Kopparapu, both at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, and with exobiologist Joshua Krissansen-Totton at the University of Washington in Seattle. The authors found a strong correlation — both oxygen levels and geomagnetic intensity have increased over the past million years, and some of the major spikes or drops in both measures occur in the same geological eras (see ‘Long-term trends').

The paper discusses some possible reasons for the correlation. Earth's magnetic field is known to have a protective effect on the upper atmosphere because it deflects solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the Sun that would otherwise cause oxygen and other gases to slowly escape into space. But the team calculated that the loss of oxygen caused by a drastic weakening of the field would still be small compared to the amounts generated by photosynthesis — or to those consumed by other organisms and by geological cycles in which elements are exchanged between the atmosphere, crust and the mantle.

“We don't necessarily think that the magnetic field impacts cycling directly, but it may be a result of the same processes,” says Mills. Over hundreds of millions of years, tectonic motions have repeatedly formed supercontinents, and have subsequently broken them up — releasing vast amounts of nutrients that in turn spurred massive blooms of oxygen-producing algae in Earth's oceans. Tectonics are driven by the slow churn of Earth's mantle, the region between crust and core. This churning could also have impacted the liquid outer core, where the geomagnetic field is produced, says Kuang.

“If things like the spreading rate [of the oceanic crust] influence the magnetic field, the tectonic cycle could be driving oxygenation — but also the magnetic field,” Mills says.

Sanja Panovska, a geophysicist at the Helmholtz Centre for Geoscience in Potsdam, Germany, says that the study is convincing, but it introduces more questions than it answers. “The authors mention a lot of hypotheses, but they are not put to the test in this paper.”

Nevertheless, the discovery could feed into a long-standing debate on whether a strong magnetic field is essential for complex life to evolve on a planet. “It's very expensive to observe exoplanets, and you need to choose which ones to observe,” says Mills. “What this kind of work would inform is the kind of places you'd look.”

Metrics details

The origin of pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, is poorly understood, owing to the temporal and morphological gaps that separate them from their closest non-flying relatives, the lagerpetids. Although both groups coexisted during the Late Triassic, their limited sympatry is currently unexplained, indicating that ecological partitioning, potentially linked to palaeoclimate, influenced their early evolution. Here we analysed pterosauromorph (pterosaur + lagerpetid) palaeobiogeography using phylogeny-based probabilistic methods and integrating fossil occurrences with palaeoclimate data. Our results reveal distinct climatic preferences and dispersal histories: lagerpetids tolerated a broader range of conditions, including arid belts, enabling a widespread distribution from the Middle to early Late Triassic. Conversely, pterosaurs preferred wetter environments, resulting in a patchier geographical distribution that expanded only as humidity increased in the Late Triassic, probably following the Carnian Pluvial Event. This major environmental disturbance, potentially driven by changes in CO2-related thermal constraints and/or palaeogeography, appears to have had a key role in shaping early pterosauromorph evolution by promoting spatial segregation and distinct climatic niche occupation.

Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight, more than 60 million years before the earliest birds. However, our understanding of early pterosaur evolution is hindered by the major temporal and anatomical gaps between these highly modified flying reptiles and their closest terrestrial relatives1,2. The fossil record of pterosaurs and their kin is notoriously incomplete3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 (Supplementary Fig. 1), and fundamental aspects of their early evolution, such as the timing, area, ecological settings of their initial radiation and palaeobiology (for example, growth dynamics and climate preferences1,12,13), are still poorly understood compared with other contemporaneous archosaur groups such as dinosaurs14,15,16.

Recent phylogenetic studies, descriptions of new taxa and detailed reevaluations of historically described specimens have renewed interest in pterosaur origin, ancestry and early evolution. This work overturned previous hypotheses of pterosaur relationships, demonstrating that lagerpetids were the closest relatives of pterosaurs, uniting these two groups in the clade Pterosauromorpha2,11,17,18,19. All known lagerpetids are non-flighted forms, whereas all known pterosaurs are volant. This new phylogenetic hypothesis substantially reduces temporal and anatomical gaps between Pterosauria and other avemetatarsalians (pterosaurs, dinosaurs and their closest relatives)2,11,18,19. Consequently, the origin of Pterosauria is now minimally constrained to an interval of ~10–15 million years between the Ladinian and early Norian intervals of the Triassic Period2,11,18,20. The past decade of research has also provided a wider sample of Triassic pterosauromorph specimens from more localities across the globe and a better understanding of their phylogenetic relationships1,2,11,17,18,19,20 and stratigraphic occurrences. These advances offer the chance to investigate early pterosauromorph macroevolution quantitatively (for example, ref. 11), by uncovering potential abiotic factors that might have influenced their diversification, as hinted at by the stratigraphic occurrence and disjunct palaeogeographical distributions of lagerpetids and pterosaurs through the Triassic18.

Sympatric occurrences of lagerpetids and pterosaurs were limited during their ~20-million-year overlap in the Norian and Rhaetian (Fig. 1). Lagerpetids are found in continental fluviolacustrine deposits on at least four current continents and maintained a wide latitudinal and geographic spread throughout most of their evolutionary history11,17,18,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34 (late Ladinian to late Rhaetian, 237–201 Ma; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Conversely, the earliest body fossils of unambiguous pterosaurs are middle Norian in age and found in a restricted low-latitude belt, primarily, but not exclusively, in marine formations that were deposited around the margins of Tethys1,12,35,36,37. From the late Norian onwards, pterosaurs spread to higher latitudes and in a much broader array of habitats1,3,8,12,38,39,40,41,42. This could suggest that lagerpetids and pterosaurs occupied fundamentally different ecological, environmental or climatic niches. Investigating pterosauromorph distribution in time and space combined with environmental data allows a new opportunity to answer several long-standing key questions in palaeontology: how did Triassic climate change affect pterosaur and avemetatarsalian evolution? What climatic regimes and environments did vertebrate flight first evolve in? And why are early pterosaur fossils so rare, and where might we find more of them?

We investigated these questions using a holistic approach that integrates novel fossil occurrence data, comprehensively sampled phylogenies, climatic niche modelling and palaeobiogeography. Our aims are (1) to assess and quantify the potential for latitudinal dispersal of Triassic lagerpetids and pterosaurs and to compare it with that of other contemporaneous groups; (2) to investigate climatic preferences of pterosauromorphs; and (3) to quantify and map habitat suitability for pterosaurs and their closest relatives during the Middle to Late Triassic. Furthermore, our results allow us to estimate the ancestral area of origin and hypothetical distribution and dispersal of pterosauromorphs across Pangaea during the Middle Triassic to early Late Triassic—the undersampled time interval in which their origin probably unfolded—to propose testable hypotheses regarding their early biogeography and its potential influence on their evolution and to identify potential target areas for future fieldwork.

Our palaeobiogeographic analysis suggests that lagerpetids—and pterosauromorphs as a whole—probably originated in southwestern Pangaea (that is, modern South America), whereas the origin of pterosaurs was predicted at low latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (Extended Data Fig. 1), consistent with previous studies8,11. Note that this and the following results are based on phylogenetic data, which, in light of the biases and incompleteness of the fossil record may simplify what are probably more complex scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The pterosauromorph dispersal inertia curve maintains a consistently high Δ-log likelihood (that is, lower but constant dispersal) across the Ladinian–early Norian interval (Fig. 2a). In other words, the dispersal of lagerpetids (the only pterosauromorphs present at that time) across climatic barriers was constant but more constrained than that of dinosaurs (and avemetatarsalians as a whole). Dinosaurs experienced relatively stronger barriers to dispersal in the Ladinian–early Carnian and late Norian–Rhaetian, interrupted by a ‘release phase' (that is, increased levels of dispersal) during the middle–late Carnian14 (Fig. 2a). The middle Norian–Rhaetian segment of the pterosauromorph curve shows an increase in Δ-log likelihood, potentially indicating a reduced crossing of barriers through this interval (Fig. 2a). This section of the curve is primarily, if not exclusively, influenced by the addition of pterosaurs (Methods). The pattern of reduced dispersal is surprising given that Triassic pterosaurs were volant and many are found in low-latitude areas (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). A similar pattern (that is, increase in species richness and drop in dispersal) could be achieved by few intermittent crossings of the barriers, which are unlikely to alter the dispersal pattern, followed by cladogenesis within the same geographical area, which will not affect the dispersal through barriers. Nevertheless, as emphasized in the Methods, the importance of this segment of the curve remains uncertain. As pterosaurs could fly and were presumably less constrained by physical barriers, their likelihood for dispersal may have left a less clear phylogenetic signature compared with their non-flying close relatives.

J., Jurassic; E. Tr., Early Triassic; I., Induan; Olenek., Olenekian.

A complementary way to decipher the latitudinal dispersion of different groups is by quantifying dispersal events in each clade through time11 (Fig. 2b,c). This shows that lagerpetids dispersed consistently throughout their evolutionary history (Anisian–Rhaetian). The lagerpetid curve for accumulated latitudinal dispersion is high both in absolute (Fig. 2b) and corrected values (Fig. 2c). These curves maintain a plateau throughout the Carnian and Norian and decrease only in the Rhaetian, when the taxonomic diversity of the group declines. This pattern is similar to that of silesaurids (Discussion), contrary to the results of Müller et al.11, whose lagerpetid curve peaked after the Carnian and was more similar to that of dinosaurs. This inconsistency is caused by (1) the pruning by Müller et al.11 of key lagerpetids (Kongonaphon kely and PVSJ 883) from their dataset, which reduced the number of branches and dispersal events in the Anisian–Carnian interval, thus lowering that part of the curve; and (2) the different strategy of Müller et al.11 of incorporating uncertain biogeographical values at internal nodes, which led them to discard the dispersal events at these particular nodes. The accumulated latitudinal dispersal of pterosaurs peaks immediately after their appearance in the middle Norian and maintains a high profile throughout the Norian and Rhaetian11 (Fig. 2b,c). The abrupt and pronounced Norian peak in the pterosaur curve may underscore the inherent ease of dispersal for these flying reptiles compared with their land-bound counterparts.

Statistical comparisons reveal that pterosaurs and lagerpetids occupied different climatic niche spaces during their temporal overlap in the Late Triassic (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 1; pairwise permutation multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), P = 0.0127). During the Norian and Rhaetian, lagerpetids occupied areas characterized by warmer temperatures and drier conditions and with less pronounced seasonal excursions in temperatures (Fig. 3b–d). Comparatively, pterosaurs occurred in areas that were distinctly cooler and seasonally more variable (Fig. 3b,d and Extended Data Table 1; P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Both lagerpetids and pterosaurs occupied areas with similar values of mean annual precipitation (MAP; Fig. 3c and Extended Data Tables 1 and 2; P > 0.05), although a majority of lagerpetids occupied drier areas (Fig. 3c). Pterosaurs occurred across a wide range of values for annual precipitation and seasonal variation in precipitation (Fig. 3c,e). The palaeoclimate niche occupation of lagerpetids was not constant over time (Fig. 3f). Specifically, Ladinian and Carnian lagerpetids (that is, Kongonaphon, Ixalerpeton, Lagerpeton and PVSJ 883) are found in high-latitude areas in southern Gondwana that were on average colder and withstood higher seasonal fluctuations in temperatures than their Norian and Rhaetian counterparts (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 1; pairwise permutation MANOVA, P = 0.012). This pattern is not entirely surprising considering the palaeogeographical occurrence of Ladinian and Carnian lagerpetids compared with their younger counterparts. Most Norian–Rhaetian occurrences are, in fact, found at lower latitudes that were characterized by higher temperatures and smaller seasonal fluctuations in temperature (Fig. 3b,d and Extended Data Table 1; P < 0.001), with the exception of Faxinalipterus and Dromomeron gigas, which were found in the southern part of Pangaea, in geographical areas and palaeoclimatic regimes broadly similar to those of their pre-Norian predecessors (Discussion, Figs. 1 and 3f and Supplementary Fig. 1). As a result, lagerpetids as a whole occupied an overlapping (pairwise permutation MANOVA, P = 0.098; Extended Data Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1) but broader palaeoclimate niche than pterosaurs, probably related to their higher tolerance for warmer, more seasonal (temperature-wise) and tendentially drier conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Extended Data Tables 1 and 2).

Climatic suitability offers a route to interpret the palaeobiogeographical distributions of early pterosauromorph body fossils and allows us to identify areas of suitable habitable space in fossil-depleted intervals. It provides a coarse, but useful, representation of their hypothetical fundamental niches (Fig. 3) in geographic space (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3). The temporal and spatial biases that control the early pterosaur fossil record epitomize the challenges faced in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of their evolutionary history and geographic distribution (Supplementary Fig. 1). Nevertheless, a probabilistic macroecological approach can provide insights on their climatic preferences and potential habitable areas, predicting potential geographic ranges for pterosaurs and lagerpetids based on climatic suitability. The distribution of areas of high suitability of pterosaurs and lagerperids appear broadly complementary. However, pterosaur potential distribution is patchier overall with lower habitability in continental interior areas (that is, arid regions) compared with the more widely distributed of lagerpetids. Although pre-Norian pterosaur body fossils have yet to be recovered, ecological niche modelling indicates the presence of potential suitable habitable space for hypothetical early pterosaurs that was unevenly spread at low tropical latitudes during the Ladinian (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3), compared with the occupation of higher, more temperate latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and broader and more continuous suitable space occupation in the southwestern tropics, for lagerpetids (Fig. 4). Habitat suitability modelling also indicates a marked extension of habitable pterosaur space towards the coastlines of Northern Tethys in the Carnian–early Norian (Fig. 4), alongside a reduction of suitable continental zones, emphasizing their climatic preference for the more temperate and wetter environments (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). By contrast, lagerpetids display a distinct Carnian pattern, maintaining a more homogeneous latitudinal occupation but with decreasing habitat suitability along the southern margin of the northern Tethys gulf, while simultaneously exhibiting an increasingly higher preference towards the southwestern tropics and reaching slightly higher latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig. 4). During the Norian (our ‘training stage'; Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3), pterosaurs (now represented by body fossils) were widely distributed in coastal, wet, tropical and low-latitude areas (Figs. 1 and 4). This is accompanied by the continuing patterns of reduction in suitable continental interior areas, except alongside the palaeoequatorial belt (broadly corresponding to the Chinle and Dockum basins) where favourable conditions for the group are maintained. Overall, in the Norian and Rhaetian, areas of pterosaur high climatic suitability occur at broad latitudes, extending from the northern margin of the Tethys to northern Australia and central South America (that is, southern Brazil and northern Argentina). Low suitability is recorded at high latitudes outside the tropics and in what is now equatorial Africa, Antarctica, Oceania and northeastern Eurasia and continental interiors (for example, modern Brazil and Canada–USA border). This pattern is broadly maintained through the late Norian and Rhaetian with an expansion of high suitable zones along the eastern margin of Pangaea (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). By contrast, lagerpetid suitability habitats are maintained throughout the Norian–Rhaetian interval with the addition of the western palaeoequatorial belt (that is, Chinle and Dockum basins) and northwestern Africa.

Note that the pre-Rhaetian suitability maps are modelled predictions because, so far, there is no Ladinian–Carnian fossil record of pterosaurs.

Triassic pterosauromorph distribution suggests that pterosaurs and lagerpetids had distinct and divergent early evolutionary histories, with regard to biogeography and dispersal. Lagerpetids achieved a wide latitudinal distribution soon after their first appearance (predominantly in southern Pangaea) and maintained a presence at high and low latitudes, globally, throughout their evolutionary history10,11,18 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The clade's dispersal across climatic barriers remained low and constant through time (Fig. 2), with our results suggesting that lagerpetids had a broad tolerance for a range of different climatic conditions, for example, higher thermal tolerances and/or other behavioural strategies to deal with high temperatures. By contrast, the earliest pterosaurs are found in low-latitude lacustrine and fluvial beds of the Chinle and Dockum basins during the early and middle Norian and more predominantly (but not exclusively) in coastal habitats of the northern Tethyan region3 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). However, within a few million years, pterosaurs are then found worldwide in remarkable variety of environments including many beyond low-latitudinal coastal regions, as shown by Arcticodactylus from fluvial deposits in Greenland (Fleming Fjord Formation, Norian–Rhaetian)38, Caelestiventus from the deserts of southwestern USA (Nugget Sandstone, upper Norian–Hettangian)41 and Pachagnathus and Yelaphomte from Argentina (Quebrada del Barro Formation, upper Norian–lower Rhaetian)20. In line with this clade's dramatic peak of dispersal in the middle Norian (Fig. 2), it is possible that these younger pterosaur occurrences are evidence of the clade's first dispersals outside of its hypothesized low-latitude ancestral area. As such, these occurrences might represent successive invasions of diverse habitats following a climatically driven ecological release (see below), rather than evidence of ancestral preference. The hypothesis of a rapid global spread8 from low latitudes finds support in (1) the phylogenetic predominance of low-latitude taxa closer to the root of the clade (2) and the ~6-million-year gap between the earliest identifiable pterosaurs in the fossil record (that is, SMU 69125, and PEFO 45782 from the early Norian of the southwestern USA) and the first occurrences of pterosaurs outside the palaeotropics (that is, Pachagnathus, Yelaphomte and Arcticodactylus from Greenland and South America).

The stratigraphic and biogeographical distribution of lagerpetids and pterosaurs, and any other group, is the result of prominent interaction of biotic and abiotic factors. The palaeoclimatically informed phylogeographic model and spatially explicit ecological niche models we generated offer an explanation for the above-mentioned biogeographical patterns. First, our climate-based principal component analysis (PCA) shows that, in the Norian–Rhaetian, lagerpetids and pterosaurs had statistically distinct climate preferences (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Table 1). Lagerpetids occupied a broad climatic niche and are found to inhabit pronoucedly warmer (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Table 1) and drier (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Table 1) localities than those yielding Triassic pterosaurs. The occurrence of lagerpetids under varied climatic conditions suggests a remarkable ecological versatility, which may have enabled their more continuous distribution across different latitudes (Fig. 4). By contrast, early pterosaurs exhibit a patchier distribution, particularly in terms of mean annual and seasonal temperatures (Fig. 3d,e). Pterosaur distribution may indicate a narrower, more specialized climatic preference and/or that these suitable conditions were initially limited to equatorial areas. Nevertheless, suitable conditions for pterosaurs are found globally, although in discontinuous patches, and less frequently in continental interiors, in the late Norian–Rhaetian (Fig. 4b,d), in accordance with the pattern of quantified latitudinal dispersal and increased geographical spread in the fossil record (Fig. 1). Another possibility is that, during this early stage of pterosaur evolutionary history, perhaps owing to initially constrained flight capabilities and/or partial confinement to arboreal environments1 (for example, to protect from predation and thermal stress or abundant food supply), their biogeography was constrained by the distribution of the canopy habitat they inhabited. As more suitable areas became available by the Norian (Fig. 4), pterosaurs may have dispersed latitudinally, benefiting from potentially increased suitable habitats. However, their climatic preferences might have resulted in a sparse and locally restricted distribution, a possibility confirmed by their modelled, patchily distributed suitable areas. This aspect could potentially be attributed to their limited capabilities for long-distance aerial dispersal and/or a stage that was still partially confined to arboreal environments. This unique ecology could account for the relatively high dispersal inertia observed in pterosaur lineages (Fig. 2a) and more pronounced latitudinal dispersion towards the latest Triassic (Fig. 2b,c) (that is, endemic dispersion within climatic blocks). Our combined analyses suggest that changes in the distribution and extension of climatically suitable areas throughout the Triassic are congruent with latitudinal dispersal patterns, demonstrating limited geographical overlap between lagerpetids and pterosaurs. This may exemplify the intricate interplay between climatic conditions and habitat, as well as the development of diverse pterosauromorph ecological niches, that probably acted on the spatiotemporal distribution of this clade. Paradoxically, pterosaurs survived the end-Triassic mass extinction but lagerpetids did not, despite pterosaurs occupying a patchier, narrower climatic niche and having a more restricted geographic distribution than lagerpetids before this event. This suggests that other factors such as the ability to fly might have played important roles in the differential survivorship of these two clades during this extinction.

Historically, the evolution of powered flight in vertebrates (that is, pterosaurs and bats43,44) has resulted in a geologically instantaneous and geographically widespread distribution; however, until recently, a lack of early pterosaur fossils prevented any assessment into whether the evolution of a volant vertebrate leads to a predictable biogeographic outcome. Now, efforts to understand the timing and place of pterosaur origin have increased in concert with recent discoveries. A literal reading of the Triassic pterosaurs record suggests that the group originated at low latitudes in northern Pangaea. This hypothesis is supported both by the early-diverging phylogenetic positions of European taxa8 and by the oldest occurrence of indeterminate specimens of this group in the early–middle part of the Norian in the southwestern USA. However, it is worth noting that, while there is probably a genuine biogeographical signal in these observations, they could also reflect severe sampling biases4,5,6. We can now explore this issue by combining the results of our analyses to provide a potential model that incorporates the biogeographical and climatic circumstances around this event. However, we must first address the absence of Middle Triassic–early Late Triassic pterosaurs from the fossil record.

The most recent divergence time estimates based on pterosauromorph phylogenetic relationships constrain pterosaur origin to a 10–15-million-year interval that extends across the Ladinian–early Norian2. However, while an Early Triassic or Middle Triassic origin for pterosaurs cannot be excluded, no body or trace fossils are known before the Norian1,8,12. Most of the earliest pterosaurs have been found in black shale lithologies in mid-latitudes from the middle Norian Alpine arch (that is, Italy, Austria and Germany). Similar facies are found in the same geographical area throughout the Anisian–Carnian interval, but despite the high potential for exceptional preservation at these localities, pre-Norian pterosaurs have yet to be found (or are currently unrecognized) from well-sampled Middle Triassic and early Late Triassic Lagerstätten not only in this region (for example, Monte San Giorgio, late Anisian–late Ladinian, Italy and Switzerland; upper Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk and lower Keuper, Anisian–Carnian, in Germany and equivalent beds in central Europe; Lunz, early Carnian, Austria) but also worldwide (Yangjuan, Anisian, China; Digxiao, Ladinian, China; Xinpu, Carnian, China; Raibl, early Carnian, Italy; Madygan, Ladinian–Carnian, Kyrgyzstan)9,12, even after decades of extensive sampling. Similarly, the absence of pterosaurs remains unexplained in the lower part of the Newark Supergroup in North America (that is, Lockatong Formation and Cow Branch Formation, lower Norian), which has yielded the fragile remains of gliding reptiles such as Icarosaurus and Mecistotrachelos, among others45,46.

Ecological niche modelling offers a potential explanation for pterosaur absences in these localities. Our analyses suggest that many of these areas were climatically unsuitable for pterosaurs before the Norian (Fig. 4). For instance, the northern margin of the Tethys Ocean was climatically poorly suitable for pterosaurs until the late Carnian (Fig. 4). This could support the idea that pterosaurs originated shortly before their first appearance in the fossil record and/or that pterosaurs originated earlier, and elsewhere, but did not have a global distribution until later in the Norian1,12. However, while our model does not necessarily support a pre-Norian origin of the group in the Tethyan region, it provides an additional explanation for their earlier absence from this area and time interval. Specifically, our results suggest that there is potential for pre-Norian and early-Norian pterosaurs to be found elsewhere, in areas identified as habitable in our palaeoclimatically informed suitability models (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3). Our niche models suggest that it might have been possible for pterosaurs to occur in the late Middle Triassic (Anisian–Ladinian) deposits of the southwest USA (upper Moenkopi Formation of Arizona and New Mexico), Morocco (members T3–T4 of the Timezgadiouine Formation, Argana Basin), India (Yerrapalli Formation), China (Xingyi fauna), Tanzania (Lifua Member of the Manda Beds), Brazil (lower Santa Maria Supersequence) and potentially southern and central Europe (for example, Dont Formation, Italy; Vellberg Formation, Germany). Suitable areas during the Carnian include the southwestern USA (for example, lower Otischalkian beds in the Dockum Group of Texas and New Mexico), Brazil (middle Santa Maria Formation), Argentina (Chañares Formation and lower Ischigualasto Formation), India (Tiki Formation and Maleri Formation), Madagascar (Isalo II/Makay Formation), continental Europe (Krasiejów locality, Poland), the lower Norian beds of the southwestern USA (upper Otischalkian and lowermost Adamanian beds of the Chinle Formation and Dockum Group, Arizona, Texas and New Mexico) and the basins of the Newark Supergroup, among others. In addition to these areas, the South China block shows high climatic suitability throughout the Anisian–early Norian. The upper portion of the Anisian–Carnian Guanling Formation (Panxian Fauna, Guanling Biota) also has high climatic suitability to yield pterosaur fossils, although the fossil record of its marine fauna shows limited terrestrial influence.

These results carry the caveat of known biases in the pterosaur fossil record4,5,6,9 (Supplementary Information) but provide testable hypotheses for future targeted fieldwork. While these formations were deposited in areas of high climatic suitability for pterosaurs, their geological characteristics might not have been suitable for preserving their fossils. As noted previously, many Triassic pterosaurs are preferentially preserved in black shale units1,12, although partial skeletons and individual bones have been more commonly recovered from fluvial, alluvial and desert depositional environments more recently20,38,41. Accordingly, among the above-mentioned formations, we particularly emphasize target lithologies representative of palaeoenvironments with known high preservation potential, particularly microvertebrate bonebeds, as these facies have the highest chance to preserve the small, fragile body fossils of Triassic pterosaurs. Articulated or associated skeletons comprise nearly all Triassic pterosaur occurrences, suggesting that their record in deposits where bones are recovered as disassociated and isolated elements (for example, microvertebrate bonebeds) may be underrepresented due to a lack of recognizable diagnostic features in collected skeletal elements from these settings.

Our study examines the historical palaeobiogeography of pterosaurs and their close relatives, lagerpetids, which together comprise pterosauromorphs. We identify climatic limits shaping the distribution of Triassic pterosauromorphs. Although multiple factors probably contributed to the distribution of these groups, the broad climatic adaptability and wide latitudinal spread of lagerpetids suggest ecological versatility, which allowed members of this group to thrive in localities with considerably warmer conditions than those yielding Triassic pterosaur remains. By contrast, early pterosaurs had a more constrained distribution in terms of mean annual and seasonal temperatures, favouring wetter areas that became more common after the Carnian, enabling their spread during the latest Triassic.

Our study independently aligns with the hypothesis suggesting that pterosaurs became widespread soon after their likely origin in the Middle Triassic–Late Triassic2. Furthermore, the modelled Carnian–early Norian pterosaur climatic niche would probably be found in temperate and wet conditions typical of tropical, near-coastal low-to-middle-latitude depositional environments. In emphasizing the complex interplay between climatic conditions, habitat and the development of diverse ecological niches, our study contributes valuable insights into the evolution and distribution of pterosaurs and their close relatives.

To explore the phylo-palaeobiogeography of Triassic pterosauromorphs, we implemented complementary analyses based on two recently published studies to (1) assess the degree to which pterosauromorphs dispersed across climatic barriers compared with other avemetatarsalian clades (following ref. 14) and (2) quantify the latitudinal dispersion of lagerpetids and pterosaurs alongside that of other avemetatarsalians (following ref. 11). To better compare the results of these analyses, which drew on different datasets, we assembled and tip-dated an avemetatarsalian supertree (Extended Data Fig. 1). This grafts the dinosaur tree topology recovered by ref. 14 into a randomly selected most parsimonious tree of Archosauromorpha from ref. 11. We then manually incorporated the dinosaurian and silesaurid taxa present in the latter dataset but not the former. This strategy allowed us to retain the entire pterosauromorph sample included in ref. 11, which is the most comprehensive available for this group. Each taxon in this newly assembled dataset was then scored for two different sets of geographical areas (see below). This was deemed necessary because the two above-mentioned studies were designed using distinct geographical frameworks (see details below). Overall, these operations improved the sampling of the selected avemetatarsalian groups and allowed more meaningful comparisons between the two sets of biogeographical analyses. Our analyses cover the Ladinian–Rhaetian interval, but the taxonomic sample includes Jurassic species, enabling consideration of all potential dispersal events nested in the Triassic.

Griffin et al.14 demonstrated the limited impact of changing archosaur topology in their results. However, their tree did not include a broad sample of lagerpetids and pterosaurs, so here we focus on the impact that different pterosauromorph tree topologies could have on our results. In Pterosauromorpha, the relationships within Pterosauria are relatively well established, so the topology here adopted corresponds to the strict consensus from ref. 11 and derivative analyses. Conversely, the relationships within Lagerpetidae are not well resolved, and it is not possible to produce a fully resolved strict consensus topology. However, for the purpose of our biogeographical analyses, this does not matter because the alternance of ‘Laurasian' and ‘Gondwanan' areas of origin at the tips is broadly maintained: a South American taxon (that is, Faxinalipterus) is consistently found at the earliest diverging branch, followed by Scleromochlus, from Europe. Further up the tree, a minority of North America taxa (that is, Dromomeron romeri and Dromomeron gregorii) are found nested within a majority of South American species. Our choice of using a randomly selected tree following ref. 14 is thus justified because the patterns of geographical areas at the tips of the tree are broadly stable and the patterns of potential of latitudinal dispersion and accumulated latitudinal dispersion are not affected by the taxon order of the tips (Supplementary Information).

First, we implemented an event-based quantitative analysis that aimed to assess the potential for pterosauromorph latitudinal dispersal during the waxing and waning of climatic barriers, following the methodology of ref. 14. Griffin et al.14 originally developed this method to test “whether the early phylogenetic history of dinosaurs retains a signal for restricted dispersal” (p. 317). Here, we applied the protocol to pterosauromorphs, which were sparsely represented in the latter study. We limit our interpretation of the pterosauromorph curve to the Ladinian–Carnian portion of the whole interval, where the signal is driven primarily by lagerpetids, because we cannot be sure to what extent our model is applicable to volant taxa, as pterosaurs affect the Carnian–Rhaetian portion of the results.

We implemented this analysis following the methodology of Griffin et al.14. First, we scored each taxon in the newly assembled dataset for one of five geographical regions: eastern Laurasia, western Laurasia, equatorial belt, northern Gondwana or southern Gondwana. These regions were selected because of the biogeographical importance of their boundaries throughout the Ladinian–Rhaetian (our interval of interest), namely, an arid belt in low-latitude southern Pangaea47 and, less relevant to the time interval of our study, the Hispanic Corridor and Viking Strait48,49. Second, we extended the lower boundary of the analyses to include the Ladinian stage to include the complete stratigraphic range of lagerpetids. We then implemented a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) model on the time-calibrated phylogeny under maximum likelihood. To simulate the waxing and waning of arid climatic barriers to dispersal, we adopted distinct rate matrices of dispersal across selected geographical areas and tested their occurrence across the whole interval. The Δ-likelihood is a measure of how strongly the dispersal pattern is supported at any time: in other words, a more negative Δ indicates dispersal/waning of climatic barriers. The Δ measures how much dispersal is occurring by imposing a penalty when the climate barrier is crossed. Thus, the Δ will be more negative when more organisms (lineages) are dispersing when barriers are present. Conversely, a Δ closer to zero indicates strong barriers to dispersal, or that the crossing of barriers was sporadic and largely followed by cladogenesis. Overall, this model uses the phylogeny of different avemetatarsalian groups to test whether, and when, climatic barriers affected the dispersal of each group, particularly lagerpetids, during the Ladinian–Rhaetian.

We also quantified the latitudinal dispersal of each avemetatarsalian group, following the methodology of Müller et al.11. Differing from that study, we decided against pruning the lagerpetids Kongonaphon kely and PVSJ 883 to enhance completeness. The stratigraphic and palaeobiogeographical occurrences of these taxa are of paramount importance for our analyses, and we believe that the benefits of their inclusion outweigh the uncertainties in their phylogenetic positions. Specifically, Kongonaphon kely is not only the stratigraphically oldest lagerpetid but also the only member of this clade from this region of Gondwana (Madagascar, representing the Indian subcontinent + Madagascar continental area). Similarly, we retained the unnamed taxon PVSJ 883, from the late Carnian of Argentina10,16, because its occurrence suggests a dispersal event that would otherwise be ignored.

To run the analyses, we used the same tip-dated supertree of Avemetatarsalia as discussed above. This time, each taxon in the dataset was assigned to one of eight discrete geographic areas (that is, western North America, eastern North America, Brazil, Argentina, Europe + Russia, South Africa, and Indian subcontinent + Madagascar) among the ten determined by Button et al.50. The quantification of dispersal events relies on reconstructing ancestral states at internal nodes. This was achieved using the R package BioGeoBEARS51 v.1.1.2 in R v.4.3.1 (ref. 52), using different likelihood-based palaeobiogeographic models: DEC, dispersal vicariance analysis likelihood (LIKEDIVA) and BAYAREALIKE. Only the simple DEC model was used for subsequent calculations to avoid long-distance palaeolatitudinal jumps in the latitudinal dispersion calculations14 following Müller et al.11, and for meaningful comparison with the first analysis that is also based on DEC14 for the same reason. However, we notice that, in our comparisons of biogeographical models, ‘+j' models are better supported (Supplementary Table 1). This may suggest a more complex biogeographic history in which (aerial?) dispersal rather than vicariance may have been the dominating phenomenon (expected in flying animals) in early pterosaur macroevolution.

Because the main barriers preventing dispersion in the Middle to Late Triassic were arid latitudinal belts at mid-to-low latitudes47, we quantified the accumulated amount of latitudinal dispersal of lagerpetids and pterosaurs separately and compared them with those of other avemetatarsalian clades (silesaurids and dinosaurs).

First, we counted the number of dispersal events across the tree by identifying those branches with different geographical values at their nodes (or tips). The latitudes of well-known avemetatarsalian-bearing localities were adopted as proxies for the broader geographic area and used to calculate the latitudinal extent of dispersion events. The localities we used are the same as those in Müller et al.11: Otis Chalk Quarries (western North America, palaeolatitude 6.9° N); New Haven County (eastern North America, 16.2° N); Buriol site (Brazil, palaeolatitude 39.7° S); Quebrada del Puma site (Argentina, palaeolatitude 40.6° S); Lombardia (Europe + Russia, palaeolatitude 27.1° N); Free State (South Africa, 42.8° S); and Manda (Indian subcontinent, palaeolatitude 53.7° S). Unlike ref. 11, we did not discard uncertain nodes but instead averaged the latitudinal values of different areas when an overwhelming signal was not computed. Only events that started (but did not necessarily end) in the Triassic were included in the final analyses.

The total amount of latitudinal dispersion (measured in degrees) for each clade was then calculated and plotted across the Anisian–Rhaetian through 1-million-year-long bins (Fig. 2b) and subsequently averaged by the number of dispersal events in each interval (Fig. 2c). These calculations were done using a slight modification of the R codes provided by Müller et al.11 (see ‘Code availability' section).

To explore the palaeoclimatic niches occupied by pterosauromorph lineages, we compiled a locality-based dataset of all Triassic lagerpetid and pterosaur occurrences. This integrated a literature search with unpublished fieldwork data (20+ years in the southwestern USA in Arizona, Texas and New Mexico)3,11,17,20,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,40,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74 (see ‘Dataset_pterosauromorphs_R1.xls' in Supplementary Data 1). Unique occurrence data were recorded for each specimen in our dataset. Unnamed and/or undescribed specimens were examined in person and included to increase the data available for our palaeoclimate niche analyses. This sampling strategy means that the datasets for the palaeobiogeographic and climate analyses are independent (that is, the first relies on phylogeny and the second on occurrence data), but all taxa present in the former are also included in the latter. This strategy recognizes the value of including undescribed or indeterminate lagerpetid and pterosaur specimens, which provide fundamental information on the distributions of their respective clades, even if they cannot be included in phylogenetic analyses. The lagerpetids included in the palaeoclimate niche analyses but excluded from the phylogenetic framework (and, hence, the palaeobiogeographic analyses) are: the indeterminate lagerpetids (NMMMNH P-80469, PEFO 44476 and PEFO 50545) from, respectively, NMMNH L-149 in the Los Esteros Member of the Santa Rosa Formation of New Mexico (Otischalkian holochronozone, lower Norian)64, PFV 456 (Thunderstorm Ridge) in the Blue Mesa Member (Adamanian holochronozone, middle Norian)34 and PFV 215 (Zuni Well Mound) in the Petrified Forest Member (Revueltian holochronozone, upper Norian)34 of the Chinle Formation of Petrified Forest National Park and multiple representatives of the genus Dromomeron from 13 distinct localities in the southwestern USA30,31,34,59,60,61,62,67 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). Similarly, the pterosaurs that are present in the palaeoclimate analysis but could not be included in the phylogenetic dataset are Arcticodactylus from Greenland38,40, which is currently under investigation68; three unnamed pterosaurs from the southwestern USA, including an undescribed pterosaur (tentatively referred to as Eudimorphodon sp.) from the ‘Kalgary localities' (approximately upper Carnian–lower Norian) of the Tecovas Formation of the Dockum Group3,69 and fig. 9.5 in ref. 70, two undescribed pterosaurs from the Chinle Formation of Petrified Forest National Park, one (PEFO 45782) from PFV 456 (Thunderstorm Ridge) in the Blue Mesa Member (Adamanian holochronozone, middle Norian, ~220 Mya (refs. 73,74)); and an undescribed pterosaur (PEFO 53384) from the Owl Rock Member (Apachean holochronozone, late Norian)71. Finally, MCSNB 8950 is an unnamed taxon from the Argilliti di Riva di Solto Formation of northern Italy (upper Norian), which was previously referred to Eudimorphodon ranzi72 but is now thought to be an unnamed new genus12.

However, because the resolution of the general circulation (palaeoclimatic) models is 1° × 1° (~111 km2) (see below), we consider only one locality if more than one specimen was found in a radius smaller than 111 km, unless they yielded different taxa (for example, the pterosaur localities in northern Italy). The occurrence of taxa with uncertain stratigraphic ranges covering multiple time bins was considered present in each of the relevant bins. This resulted in a summarized dataset of 54 occurrences (24 pterosaur and 30 lagerpetid entries; Supplementary Data 1).

To explore whether palaeoclimatic conditions influenced the biogeographic distributions of pterosaurs and lagerpetids, we integrated occurrence data for these groups with outputs from a general circulation (palaeoclimate) model. The values extracted from these models show a good match with the estimates from geochemical, sedimentological and biological proxies at the basin level and broader scales (for example, see refs. 75,76 for a detailed study of the palaeoclimate of the Chañares–Los Rastros–Ischigualasto Triassic succession). The accuracy and evaluation of general circulation (palaeoclimate) model outputs are further discussed in the Supplementary Information. Palaeoclimate model simulations used a recent version of the coupled Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Model and HadCM3L77 (specifically HadCM3L-M2.1aD), following the nomenclature in the work of Malanoski et al.78), including the modifications described by Judd et al.79. The model has a resolution of 3.75° longitude × 2.5° latitude in the atmosphere and ocean, with 19 hybrid levels in the atmosphere and 20 vertical levels in the ocean with equations solved on the Arakawa B-grid. Atmospheric subgrid scale processes such as convection are parameterized as they cannot be resolved at the resolution of the model. The ocean model is based on the model of Valdes et al.80 and is a full primitive equation, three-dimensional model of the ocean. A second-order numerical scheme is used along with centred advection to remove nonlinear instabilities. Flux adjustments (such as artificial heat and salinity adjustments in the ocean model to prevent the model drifting to unrealistic values) are not required in this model81, which is crucial for long palaeoclimate simulations. Sea ice is calculated on a zero-layer model with partial sea ice coverage possible, with a consistent salinity assumed for ice. Because geological data recording land surface vegetation for Triassic stages are uncertain and globally sparse, we use a version of the model that includes the dynamical vegetation model TRIFFID (Top-Down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics) and land surface scheme MOSES 2.1a (ref. 82). TRIFFID predicts the distribution and properties of global vegetation based on plant functional types (PFTs), in the form of fractional coverage (and, thus, PFT coexistence) within a grid cell, and is, in turn, based on competition equations based on the climate tolerance of five PFTs. The HadCM3L model demonstrates high performance at reproducing the modern-day climate79 and has been used for an array of pre-Quaternary palaeoclimate experiments79,83,84. Palaeoclimate experiments typically require on the order of hundreds of years to reach a near-surface quasi-equilibrium state (but many thousands of years for the deep ocean79,80) as well as true climate equilibrium. Relatively low-resolution global climate models such as HadCM3L are relatively computationally expensive, allowing near-fully equilibrated simulations of climate to be undertaken that would not be possible with higher-resolution, more complex models85.

Seven model simulations with Ladinian (239.54 Ma), ‘early' Carnian (233.6 Ma), ‘late' Carnian (232 Ma), ‘early' Norian (227 Ma), ‘middle' Norian (222.4 Ma), ‘late' Norian (217.8 Ma) and Rhaetian (204.9 Ma) were carried out using stage-specific boundary conditions (topography, bathymetry, solar luminosity, continental ice and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2)). Stage-specific realistic carbon dioxide concentrations were chosen on the basis of proxy-CO2 (Ladinian, 1,034 ppm; ‘early' Carnian, 1,492 ppm; ‘late' Carnian, 1,614 ppm; ‘early' Norian, 2,059 ppm; ‘middle' Norian, 1,810 ppm; ‘late' Norian, 1,481 ppm; and Rhaetian, 1,503 ppm) reconstructions from ref. 86, and the solar constant was based on ref. 87. The orography and bathymetry were derived from palaeogeographic digital elevation models, produced by ref. 88 as part of the PALEOMAP project (see ref. 79 for more details). Each stage-specific digital elevation model is interpolated from a 1° × 1° grid onto the model 3.75° × 2.5° grid. Similarly, land ice is also transformed onto the model grid assuming a simple parabolic shape to estimate the ice sheet height (m). Surface soil conditions were set at a uniform medium loam everywhere because stage-specific soil parameters during the Triassic are not globally known. All other boundary conditions (such as orbital parameters, aerosol concentrations and so on) are held constant at preindustrial values. The simulations were carried out for a total of over 10,000 years. By the end of the simulations, (1) the globally and volume-integrated annual mean ocean temperature trend is less than 1 °C per 1,000 years; (2) trends in surface air temperature are less than 0.3 °C per 1,000 years; and (3) net energy balance at the top of the atmosphere, averaged over a 100-year period at the end of the simulation, is less than 0.25 W m−2. Climatological means were produced from the last 100 years of each simulation. All these simulations are identical to the ‘Scotese07' simulations described in ref. 78 and the ‘model 2' simulations of ref. 79. The climate predicted by the model is compared with proxy indicators of climate in the Supplementary Information. The outputs from the simulations are available at https://www.paleo.bristol.ac.uk/ummodel/scripts/html_bridge/scotese_07.html.

To explore the climatic conditions occupied by pterosauromorphs during the Late Triassic, multivariate statistical tests were used and summary statistic plots were constructed. This approach is commonly used in modern ecology89,90,91,92,93 and, in the past decade, has become more common in studies pertaining to the fossil record of both invertebrate94,95,96,97,98,99 and vertebrate groups15,16,73,100. Accordingly, each taxon was assigned climate variables based on the mean values for their stratigraphic age and geographic locations (namely, mean annual temperature (MAT), MAP, seasonal variation in temperature and seasonal variation in precipitation; Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). Taxa spanning two geological stages (n = 8) were assigned the mean of the variables for both stages and assigned single, averaged, stratigraphic occurrence. To quantify ‘palaeoclimatic niche space' for each taxon, we followed the procedure outlined in ref. 16. Obtaining information on species' fundamental niches from the fossil record is challenging: therefore, the term ‘palaeoclimatic niche' as used here refers to an approximation of the realized climatic niche of the fossil taxa (that is, the set of climatic conditions occupied by a taxon16). A PCA was performed using the prcomp() function in R v.4.4.2 (ref. 52), which included the scaling argument so that variables were scaled to have unit variance before the analysis took place. A non-parametric MANOVA was performed to statistically compare the distribution of the two groups using the R package RVAideMemoire89. Raincloud plots displaying both box plots (depicting the distributions of the palaeoclimate data within the taxonomic groups) and frequency distributions were constructed to examine the range of individual palaeoclimatic conditions occupied by both groups. To statistically compare the distributions between both groups, pairwise comparisons were performed in R using Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann–Whitney) tests. These specific statistical tests were chosen because the palaeoclimate variable data do not conform to the assumptions of a normal distribution, which was determined through probability plots (for example, quartile–quartile plots) and Shapiro–Wilk tests.

To assess the climatic suitability of these taxa, we implemented the DOMAIN algorithm100 through the R package ‘dismo'101, which is an ecological niche modelling tool using the Gower distance metric to assess climatic suitability. The DOMAIN algorithm quantifies the disparity between the climatic conditions of map pixels and the nearest species observation within the n-dimensional environmental space, diverging from geographic proximity. Although this model is generally classified as a coarse niche modelling technique102,103,104,105, it offers the advantage of straightforward implementation and minimal assumptions, which are necessary due to the paucity of the pterosauromorph fossil record. Given the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of our dataset, coupled with our exclusive focus on producing suitability maps based solely on climate, and the low number of occurrences in our datasets, we favoured this simplistic modelling approach over more recently introduced ecological niche and habitat suitability modelling techniques, including those previously used by our team in prior works101,102,103,104,105, where the associated limitations and assumptions are also addressed. We furthermore calibrated the model on a compound occurrence dataset that maximizes the geographic spread for each of the subclades, centring on the best sampled interval (the middle–late Norian, 218 Ma) and including palaeobiogeographic outliers from the Carnian (Lagerpetidae) and throughout the full duration of the Norian for pterosaurs, projecting these models into more refined climatic simulations (eight time slices from the Ladinian to the Rhaetian). MAT (°C) and MAP (mm per year) are the variables used for the habitat suitability modelling.

Astronomers from the University of Hawaiʻi's Institute for Astronomy (IfA) have discovered the most energetic cosmic explosions yet discovered, naming the new class of events “extreme nuclear transients” (ENTs). These extraordinary phenomena occur when massive stars—at least three times heavier than our Sun—are torn apart after wandering too close to a supermassive black hole. Their disruption releases vast amounts of energy visible across enormous distances. The team's findings were recently detailed in the journal Science Advances.

"We've observed stars getting ripped apart as tidal disruption events for over a decade, but these ENTs are different beasts, reaching brightnesses nearly ten times more than what we typically see," said Jason Hinkle, who led the study as the final piece of his doctoral research at IfA. “Not only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions.”

The immense luminosities and energies of these ENTs are truly unprecedented. The most energetic ENT studied, named Gaia18cdj, emitted an astonishing 25 times more energy than the most energetic supernovae known. While typical supernovae emit as much energy in just one year as the Sun does in its 10 billion-year lifetime, ENTs radiate the energy of 100 Suns over a single year.

ENTs were first uncovered when Hinkle began a systematic search of public transient surveys for long-lived flares emanating from the centers of galaxies. He identified two unusual flares in data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission that brightened over a timescale much longer than known transients and without characteristics common to known transients.

"Gaia doesn't tell you what a transient is, just that something changed in brightness," said Hinkle. "But when I saw these smooth, long-lived flares from the centers of distant galaxies, I knew we were looking at something unusual."

The discovery launched a multi-year follow-up campaign to figure out what these sources were. With help from UH's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, the W. M. Keck Observatory, and other telescopes across the globe, the team gathered data across the electromagnetic spectrum. Because ENTs evolve slowly over several years, capturing their full story took patience and persistence. Recently, a third event with similar properties was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility and reported independently by two teams, adding strong support that ENTs are a distinct new class of extreme astrophysical events.

The authors determined these extraordinary events could not be supernovae because they release far more energy than any known stellar explosion. The sheer energy budget, combined with their smooth and prolonged light curves, firmly pointed to an alternative mechanism: accretion onto a supermassive black hole.

However, ENTs differ significantly from normal black hole accretion which typically shows irregular and unpredictable changes in brightness. The smooth and long-lived flares of ENTs indicated a distinct physical process—the gradual accretion of a disrupted star by a supermassive black hole.

Benjamin Shappee, Associate Professor at IfA and study co-author, emphasized the implications: "ENTs provide a valuable new tool for studying massive black holes in distant galaxies. Because they're so bright, we can see them across vast cosmic distances—and in astronomy, looking far away means looking back in time. By observing these prolonged flares, we gain insights into black hole growth when the universe was half its current age when galaxies were happening places—forming stars and feeding their supermassive black holes 10 times more vigorously than they do today."

The rarity of ENTs, occurring at least 10 million times less frequently than supernovae, makes their detection challenging and dependent on sustained monitoring of the cosmos. Future observatories like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and NASA's Roman Space Telescope promise to uncover many more of these spectacular events, revolutionizing our understanding of black hole activity in the distant, early universe.

"These ENTs don't just mark the dramatic end of a massive star's life. They illuminate the processes responsible for growing the largest black holes in the universe," concluded Hinkle.

Sandia National Laboratories has joined a new partnership aimed at helping the United States regain its leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.

While the U.S. was considered a powerhouse in chip production in the 1990s, fabricating more than 35% of the world's semiconductors, that share has since dropped to 12%. Today, the U.S. manufactures none of the world's most advanced chips which power technologies like smartphones, owned by 71% of the world's population, as well as self-driving cars, quantum computers, and artificial intelligence-powered devices and programs.

Sandia hopes to help change that. It recently became the first national lab to join the U.S. National Semiconductor Technology Center. The NSTC was established under the CHIPS and Science Act to accelerate innovation and address some of the country's most pressing technology challenges.

"We have pioneered the way for other labs to join," said Mary Monson, Sandia's senior manager of Technology Partnerships and Business Development. "The CHIPS Act has brought the band back together, you could say. By including the national labs, U.S. companies, and academia, it's really a force multiplier."

Sandia has a long history of contributing to the semiconductor industry through research and development partnerships, its Microsystems Engineering, Science and Applications facility known as MESA, and its advanced cleanrooms for developing next-generation technologies. Through its NSTC partnerships, Sandia hopes to strengthen U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and research and development, enhance national security production, and foster the innovation of new technologies that sets the nation apart globally.

"The big goal is to strengthen capabilities. Industry is moving fast, so we are keeping abreast of everything happening and incorporating what will help us deliver more efficiently on our national security mission. It's about looking at innovative ways of partnering and expediting the process," Monson said.

The urgency of the effort is evident. The pandemic provided a perfect example, as car lots were left bare and manufacturers sat idle, waiting for chips to be produced to build new vehicles.

"An average car contains 1,400 chips and electric vehicles use more than 3,000," said Rick McCormick, Sandia's senior scientist for semiconductor technology strategy. McCormick is helping lead Sandia's new role. "Other nations around the globe are investing more than $300 billion to be leaders in semiconductor manufacturing. The U.S. CHIPS Act is our way of 'keeping up with the Joneses.' One goal is for the U.S. to have more than 25% of the global capacity for state-of-the-art chips by 2032."

Sandia is positioned to play a key role in creating the chips of the future.

"More than $12 billion in research and development spending is planned under CHIPS, including a $3 billion program to create an ecosystem for packaging assemblies of chiplets," McCormick said. "These chiplets communicate at low energy and high speed as if they were a large expensive chip."

Modern commercial AI processors use this approach, and Sandia's resources and partnerships can help expand access to small companies and national security applications. MESA already fabricates high-reliability chiplet assembly products for the stockpile and nonproliferation applications.

McCormick said Sandia could also play a major role in training the workforce of the future. The government has invested billions of dollars in new factories, all of which need to be staffed by STEM students.

"There is a potential crisis looming," McCormick said. "The Semiconductor Industry Association anticipates that the U.S. will need 60,000 to 70,000 more workers, so we need to help engage the STEM workforce. That effort will also help Sandia bolster its staffing pipeline."

As part of its membership, Sandia will offer access to some of its facilities to other NSTC members, fostering collaboration and partnerships. Tech transfer is a core part of Sandia's missions, and this initiative will build on that by helping private partners increase their stake in the industry while enabling Sandia to build on its own mission.

"We will be helping develop suppliers and strengthen our capabilities," Monson said. "We are a government resource for semiconductor knowledge. We are in this evolving landscape and have a front row seat to what it will look like over the next 20 years. We are helping support technology and strengthening our national security capabilities and mission delivery."

A giant, strong-jawed salamander once tunneled through ancient Tennessee soil.

And thanks to a fossil unearthed near East Tennessee State University, scientists now better understand how it helped shape Appalachian amphibian diversity.

The giant plethodontid salamander now joins the remarkable roster of fossils from the Gray Fossil Site & Museum.

The findings appeared in the journal Historical Biology, authored by a team of researchers from the Gray Fossil Site & Museum and ETSU: Assistant Collections Manager Davis Gunnin, Director and Professor of Geosciences Dr. Blaine Schubert, Head Curator and Associate Professor of Geosciences Dr. Joshua Samuels, Museum Specialist Keila Bredehoeft and Assistant Collections Manager Shay Maden.

"Our researchers are not only uncovering ancient life, they are modeling the kind of collaboration and curiosity that define ETSU," said Dr. Joe Bidwell, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. "This exciting find underscores the vital role our university plays in preserving and exploring Appalachia's deep natural history."

Today, Southern Appalachian forests are renowned for their diversity and abundance of salamander species, especially lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae. Tennessee alone is home to more than 50 different salamanders - one in eight of all living salamander species.

Dusky salamanders, common in Appalachian Mountain streams, likely evolved from burrowing ancestors, relatives of Alabama's Red Hills salamander, a large, underground-dwelling species with a worm-like body and small limbs. Their explosive diversification began around 12 million years ago, shaping much of the region's salamander diversity today.

Dynamognathus robertsoni, the powerful, long-extinct salamander recently discovered at the site, had a bite to match its name. Roughly 16 inches long, it ranked among the largest salamanders ever to crawl across the region's ancient forests.

"Finding something that looks like a Red Hills salamander here in East Tennessee was a bit of a surprise," Gunnin said. "Today they're only found in a few counties in southern Alabama, and researchers thought of them as a highly specialized dead-end lineage not particularly relevant to the evolution of the dusky salamanders. Discovery of Dynamognathus robertsoni here in Southern Appalachia shows that these types of relatively large, burrowing salamanders were once more widespread in eastern North America and may have had a profound impact on the evolution of Appalachian salamander communities."

Dynamognathus robertsoni is "the largest plethodontid salamander and one of the largest terrestrial salamanders in the world," Gunnin said. Dusky salamanders in the Appalachians today reach only seven inches long at their largest.

Researchers believe predators like this one may have driven the rapid evolution of Appalachian stream-dwelling salamanders, highlighting the region's key role in salamander diversification.

"The warmer climate in Tennessee 5 million years ago, followed by cooling during the Pleistocene Ice Ages, may have restricted large, burrowing salamanders to lower latitudes, like southern Alabama, where the Red Hills salamander lives today," said Samuels.

Maden explained the naming of this new salamander.

"This group of salamanders has unusual cranial anatomy that gives them a strong bite force, so the genus name - Dynamognathus - Greek for 'powerful jaw,' is given to highlight the great size and power of the salamander compared to its living relatives," said Maden.

The species name robertsoni honors longtime Gray Fossil Site volunteer Wayne Robertson, who discovered the first specimen of the new salamander and has personally sifted through more than 50 tons of fossil-bearing sediment since 2000.

From volunteers and students to staff to faculty, the ETSU Gray Fossil Site & Museum is represented by a dynamic team of lifelong learners and is one of the many reasons ETSU is the flagship institution of Appalachia.

"The latest salamander publication is a testament to this teamwork and search for answers," said Schubert. "When Davis Gunnin, the lead author, began volunteering at the museum as a teenager with an interest in fossil salamanders, I was thrilled, because this region is known for its salamander diversity today, and we know so little about their fossil record. Thus, the possibility of finding something exciting seemed imminent."

The man who prosecutors have charged with assassinating Melissa Hortman, a Democratic Minnesota state representative, and her husband Mark Hortman, once said in a sermon that his religious awakening came when he was 17 years old, working next to a man who “talked about God all of the time” at a vegetable canning factory.

Over the next four decades of alleged shooter Vance Boelter's life, while working in the food industry, local government, and private security, his religious worldview appeared to incorporate fringe theological ideas that are often associated with so-called charismatic Christianity and Christian Nationalism, a movement that's captured the American religious right, has been seen as a key driver behind the January 6 Capitol riot, and currently enjoys an outsized influence on current Trump administration personnel and policy.

Charismatic Christianity is a broad movement of evangelical Christians who are associated with belief in modern supernatural experiences, like speaking in tongues, divine healing and prophesy. Independent Charismatic Christians seek to exert influence over all aspects of life, from culture to politics. Independent Charismatic Christianity, which encompasses the “NAR,” or New Apostolic Reformation, has been described as the bedrock of Christian nationalism. NAR is an extreme Christian supremacist network that aims to dismantle the secular state, which it sees as demonic, and transform its institutions in accordance with Christian law.

Experts tell WIRED that there are several links from the suspect's religious background to Christian nationalism that could explain why he allegedly targeted lawmakers and pro-abortion advocates. WIRED has also confirmed that the suspect attended a bible school in Dallas that was attended by several controversial figures from the world of Christian nationalism.

“Vance Boelter, from everything I have read and heard, would clearly be a Christian nationalist,” claims Michael Emerson, the Baker Institute's Chavanne Fellow in religion and public policy at Rice University. “He found the perspectives and policies of the liberal left egregious, viewing such people and their work as anti-Christian and anti-God. They were harming the vision of a truly Christian identity and nation.”

WIRED previously reported that the 57-year-old alleged shooter has been affiliated with at least one evangelical organization, serving for a time as the president of Revoformation Ministries. A version of the ministry's website captured in 2011 carries a biography in which he is said to have been ordained in 1993. According to a tax filing reviewed by WIRED, he ran the ministry with his wife.

He moonlighted as a religious pastor part of Pentecostal congregations, and participated in missions preaching around the world, including in Gaza and the West Bank, according to an archived website for Revoformation. He also gave several sermons in the Democratic Republic of Congo in recent years.

“Many churches in America didn't listen to Jesus,” the alleged shooter said in a 2023 sermon in the Democratic Republic of Congo viewed by WIRED. “And the enemy, the devil, comes through and rips everything apart. The churches are so messed up, they don't know abortion is wrong, many churches.” In other sermons, the alleged shooter talked about the LGBTQ community, saying, “There's people, especially in America, they don't know what sex they are. They don't know their sexual orientation. They're confused … The enemy has gotten so far into their mind and their soul.”

The alleged shooter also said “God is going to raise up apostles and prophets in America” in one of the sermons. It's that language in particular, experts tell WIRED, that connects him to the world of charismatic Christianity.

“Everything that I've seen indicates that he's charismatic,” says Matthew Taylor, senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Baltimore and author of The Violent Take It by Force: The Christian Movement That Is Threatening Our Democracy. “The supernatural, talking about the gifts of the holy spirit, while using a very pentecostal style of discourse in his preaching.”

Abortion in the independent charismatic Christian movement is often characterized as a demonic practice. Police say the car that the alleged shooter abandoned contained a lengthy hit list of Democratic lawmakers, abortion providers, and outspoken abortion advocates in the state. Charismatic Christians often talk about abortion in terms of “child sacrifice to demons,” says Taylor.

“I don't think it's hard to see how someone could get radicalized around that language,” he alleges.

The alleged shooter's now-deleted Facebook profile also showed that he had “liked” a page for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy organization known for its hardline stances against abortion and LGBTQ rights. “This signals at least a right-wing anti-abortion conviction,” says Taylor.

David Carlson, who has known the alleged shooter since fourth grade and described the 57-year-old as his best friend, told reporters that the alleged shooter was a Trump supporter, “very conservative,” and would be offended if anyone suggested otherwise. (In the aftermath of the shooting, however, far-right influencers including people like Elon Musk sought to blame leftists and the Deep State.)

It's likely, according to Taylor, that the alleged shooter's theological ideas were rooted in his time at the Christ for the Nations Institute, a charismatic Bible college in Dallas, Texas he claimed to spend some time at, according to a biography on the archived Revoformation website. Taylor claims that a number of prominent figures in the independent charismatic Christian movement have deep ties to or attended the institute.

Dutch Sheets, a NAR pastor who popularized the “Appeal to Heaven” flag waved by Christian nationalists and rioters on January 6, 2021, graduated from the institute in 1978, and worked as an adjunct professor therein the late 1980s and early 1990s; he later briefly returned as an instructor in 2012. Cindy Jacobs, an avid supporter of Trump who has been described as one of the most influential prophets in America, settled in Dallas in the 1980s, and according to Taylor, was regularly on the institute's campus lecturing or guest-teaching. The suspected shooter was enrolled at the Institute from 1988 to 1990, which means he could have overlapped with some of those figures.

When WIRED contacted the Institute, they directed our query to a statement saying it “unequivocally rejects, denounces, and condemns any and all forms of violence and extremism, be it politically, racially, religiously or otherwise motivated.” The statement also said that they were “aghast and horrified” that an alumnus of an Institute was a suspect in the Minnesota shootings. “This is not who we are. This is not what we teach.” Jacobs and Sheets did not respond to requests for comment.

Journalist Jeff Sharlet, in an essay published to his Substack called “Scenes from a Slow Civil War” following the Minnesota shootings, recalls a recent visit to the institute where he saw a quote by the school's founder printed in the lobby: “Everyone ought to pray at least one violent prayer each day.” (In its statement, the Institute said the slogan had been misinterpreted: “By “violent prayer,” they say, the founder “meant that a Christian's prayer-life should be intense, fervent, and passionate, not passive and lukewarm.)

Although independent charismatic Christians don't directly call for adherents to take matters into their own hands, they do see themselves as soldiers in the primordial battle of “spiritual warfare,” where demonic forces can only be overcome by prayer and carrying out God's will. “This binary good versus evil worldview transforms democratic politics into a deadly version of the board game Risk, where geographic territory, institutions, and leaders have come under the sway of Satan,” says Robert Jones, president and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute. “They are not political opponents or neighbors with whom we disagree; they are literally the instruments of evil.”

“The logic is straightforward,” says Emerson. “If Christian nationalism is to be realized, those of different faiths or no faith do not belong. They either must be converted, silenced, or expelled.”

And Taylor notes that, for example, “the people who participated in J6 were overwhelmingly in [Christian] charismatics; they would say they were doing God's will” because “God had revealed that Donald Trump was anointed for another term.”

The alleged shooter, too, may have seen himself as one of those soldiers. According to a criminal complaint filed Monday, Boelter texted his family after the killings, writing “Dad went to war last night..I don't wanna say more because I don't wanna implicate anybody.”

The suspect was captured late Sunday. In an affidavit filed after the arrest, police say he disguised himself in a rubber mask, wore a police uniform complete with a badge and a taser, and drove a car that had been customized to look like a local police cruiser. In addition to allegedly shooting and killing Hortman and her husband early Saturday morning, he also allegedly shot state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette Hoffman. Hoffman and his wife Yvette survived despite being shot multiple times.

Bang & Olufsen is the epitome of the luxury brand of high-end headphones, the firm that reflects both perfect design and celestial sound. Even Apple, with its much-lauded AirPods Max, tends to sell its flagship for approximately half the price of Bang & Olufsen's flagship – at least so far.

Amazon is having a final sale on the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95 in black, and it's a rare opportunity to get one of the greatest active noise-canceling headphones out there: For fans of the highest quality audio available, this special deal lowers the price from a whopping $1,250 to just $639 which is an incredibly “affordable” price for a product so high in quality.

Priced at this level, the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95 is within reach for many more people and it's well worth learning about what sets these headphones apart. The Beoplay H95 is designed to deliver outstanding sound but also an experience that's as luxurious as it is practical. With up to 38 hours of playtime on a single charge (even with active noise cancellation switched on), these headphones are built for long listening sessions.

There is a customized 40mm titanium driver and neodymium magnets in each ear cup which is designed to provide accurate, strong and immersive sound. The result is an earful of listening that's full, rich and emotionally involving with a level of clarity that brings your favorite tunes to life. The headphones also feature Bang & Olufsen's new adaptive active noise cancellation technology which allows you to block out the world and tune in to your tunes.

The ear cushions are made of lamb skin leather and memory foam for a soft, comforting feel even on long use. The headband is made from titanium which gives it strength but also flexibility and the fold-up style makes these headphones easy to carry and transport with you wherever you may be. The included hardcase is lined with matching textile for rugged protection of your headphones and accessories in transit.

The Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95 is a masterwork of sound engineering and design, now so cheap that it's inescapable.

There's nothing quite as frustrating as trying to work or multitask on a cramped laptop screen. Whether you're crunching numbers in Excel, editing photos, or just want to stream a video while keeping an eye on your inbox, a second screen can make all the difference. And not just any second screen: this 18.5-inch portable monitor on sale at Amazon is a true game-changer.

Whereas the majority of portable monitors top out at about 15 inches, this one comes in an XXL format that is notable for its dimensions and functionality. It's compact, transportable, and large enough to make a substantial difference in your productivity. Currently, Amazon has this incredible portable monitor on sale for an all-time low price of only $119, a full 40% discount from its standard price of $199.

See at Amazon

The 18.5-inch laptop portable monitor is designed for anyone who needs extra screen real estate in mind: Its Full HD 1080P IPS display offers vibrant colors and sharp images, due to a 1920×1080 resolution and a 2000:1 contrast ratio. With 100% sRGB color gamut and 178-degree viewing angle, you get an immersive view that's easy on the eyes. The monitor also comes equipped with eye-care tech that filters out blue light so that your eyes remain relaxed and reducing fatigue when used for extended use.

The biggest advantage of this portable monitor is perhaps its size, and it is compact enough to take around anywhere. At 18.5 inches, it's significantly larger than most portable displays which average about 15 inches. That additional real estate makes a huge difference when editing spreadsheets, cutting up files on Photoshop or jumping between apps.

The monitor features multiple modes of display like duplicate mode, extend mode, and second screen only mode, which gives you the flexibility to use it according to your needs. There is also a 3.5mm audio output which enables you to connect speakers to enjoy an even better sound experience. The included smart case is made of sturdy PU magnetic material which protects the screen from scratches and can also be used as a stand for easy positioning. For added flexibility, the screen is VESA mountable with standard-sized 75x75mm holes at the back for wall or arm bracket mounting.

The monitor has two USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port so you can connect it to pretty much any PC, laptop, smartphone, and gaming console like the Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation. Keep in mind, however, that if the USB-C port on your device is not USB 3.1 or Thunderbolt 3 compatible, it will power the monitor but not have a signal.

If you've been thinking about adding a second screen to your setup, now is the perfect time to act.

OpenAI researchers say they've discovered hidden features inside AI models that correspond to misaligned “personas,” according to new research published by the company on Wednesday.

By looking at an AI model's internal representations — the numbers that dictate how an AI model responds, which often seem completely incoherent to humans — OpenAI researchers were able to find patterns that lit up when a model misbehaved. 

The researchers found one such feature that corresponded to toxic behavior in an AI model's responses —meaning the AI model would give misaligned responses, such as lying to users or making irresponsible suggestions.

The researchers discovered they were able to turn toxicity up or down by adjusting the feature.

OpenAI's latest research gives the company a better understanding of the factors that can make AI models act unsafely, and thus, could help them develop safer AI models. OpenAI could potentially use the patterns they've found to better detect misalignment in production AI models, according to OpenAI interpretability researcher Dan Mossing.

“We are hopeful that the tools we've learned — like this ability to reduce a complicated phenomenon to a simple mathematical operation — will help us understand model generalization in other places as well,” said Mossing in an interview with TechCrunch.

AI researchers know how to improve AI models, but confusingly, they don't fully understand how AI models arrive at their answers — Anthropic's Chris Olah often remarks that AI models are grown more than they are built. OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic are investing more in interpretability research — a field that tries to crack open the black box of how AI models work — to address this issue.

A recent study from Oxford AI research scientist Owain Evans raised new questions about how AI models generalize. The research found that OpenAI's models could be fine-tuned on insecure code and would then display malicious behaviors across a variety of domains, such as trying to trick a user into sharing their password. The phenomenon is known as emergent misalignment, and Evans' study inspired OpenAI to explore this further.

But in the process of studying emergent misalignment, OpenAI says it stumbled into features inside AI models that seem to play a large role in controlling behavior. Mossing says these patterns are reminiscent of internal brain activity in humans, in which certain neurons correlate to moods or behaviors.

“When Dan and team first presented this in a research meeting, I was like, ‘Wow, you guys found it,'” said Tejal Patwardhan, an OpenAI frontier evaluations researcher, in an interview with TechCrunch. “You found like, an internal neural activation that shows these personas and that you can actually steer to make the model more aligned.”

Some features OpenAI found correlate to sarcasm in AI model responses, whereas other features correlate to more toxic responses in which an AI model acts as a cartoonish, evil villain. OpenAI's researchers say these features can change drastically during the fine-tuning process.

Notably, OpenAI researchers said that when emergent misalignment occurred, it was possible to steer the model back toward good behavior by fine-tuning the model on just a few hundred examples of secure code.

OpenAI's latest research builds on the previous work Anthropic has done on interpretability and alignment. In 2024, Anthropic released research that tried to map the inner workings of AI models, trying to pin down and label various features that were responsible for different concepts.

Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are making the case that there's real value in understanding how AI models work, and not just making them better. However, there's a long way to go to fully understand modern AI models.

Google has continally abused trust on ethics and on accuracy.Yes, it would be nice if there was a button you could push to ask any question and get a simple answer. No, we are not there yet. No, there are no shortcuts in life. You have to go to a source and evaluate its information and its trustworthiness in its own context otherwise you are not meeting your responsibility of diligence.

The US Supreme Court's conservative majority on Wednesday upheld the state of Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors.

In a 6–3 decision in United States v. Skrmetti, the justices found that Tennessee's law is not unconstitutional. The central issue of the case was whether Tennessee's ban violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which states that the government cannot discriminate against individuals based on their race, gender, or other characteristics. The ruling does not affect states where gender-affirming care for youth remains legal, but establishes the precedent that states can ban this kind of treatment.

The lawsuit was brought to the court by three transgender teenagers and their parents, as well as a doctor, with the Biden administration's Department of Justice joining the plaintiffs. They argued that the Tennessee law discriminates based on sex and gender status by denying medical care to transgender youth that is available to other minors. This is the first case the Supreme Court has taken up on the issue of gender-affirming care for minors.

Gender-affirming care includes a variety of medical services meant to help align a person's body more closely with their gender identity. It can include hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and surgeries.

Tennessee enacted its law in 2023, which prohibits health care providers from prescribing medication or offering gender-affirming surgical procedures to minors whose gender identities are different from their assigned sex at birth. The law excludes procedures that address congenital defects or physical injuries, as well as gender-affirming medical care for minors whose gender identity conforms with their designated sex at birth. It means, for instance, that a cisgender boy with gynecomastia, a hormonal condition that causes enlarged male breast tissue, could receive medication or undergo surgery to remove breast tissue to conform to their gender identity, but a transgender individual could not receive the same treatment for gender dysmorphia.

Today's Supreme Court ruling, delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts, maintains that Tennessee's law is not discriminatory because it “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to any minor to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence, regardless of the minor's sex.” According to the justices, the Tennessee law does not exclude any individual from medical treatments based on their transgender status. “Rather, it removes one set of diagnoses—gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, and gender incongruence—from the range of treatable conditions,” the ruling says.

Since 2021, more than two dozen states have adopted laws or policies that prohibit or severely limit gender-affirming care for people under the age of 18. Many of those states also penalize health care practitioners for providing or offering this type of care to minors. According to the health policy nonprofit KFF, 40 percent of trans youth between the ages of 13 and 17 live in a state that has enacted a policy against gender-affirming care.

Though several states were facing legal challenges to their bans, today's Supreme Court decision means those laws will likely remain intact.

Leading medical organizations—including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the World Health Organization—support access to gender-affirming care for transgender and gender-diverse youth, which they say is backed by scientific evidence. One study from 2022 surveyed nearly 12,000 transgender and nonbinary youth aged 13 to 24 and found that those who received gender-affirming hormone therapy had lower rates of depression, thoughts of suicide, and attempted suicide than those who had not received hormone therapy.

“Today's Supreme Court decision is a devastating blow to transgender youth and the families who love them,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, an organization that promotes LGBTQ+ civil rights, in a statement. “Families may now have to make the heartbreaking choice to leave their state or split their families, or take on extensive financial burdens, in order to ensure that their kids can access medically necessary care.”

Every spring in the Southern Hemisphere, Bogong moths migrate up to 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) from southeast Australia to spend the summer in cool caves in the Australian Alps. At the beginning of the fall, they fly back to their breeding grounds and die. Each moth undertakes the two-way journey only once in its life—so how does it know where it's going?

A team led by David Dreyer, a visiting research fellow in sensory biology at Lund University, suggests that Bogong moths may use the starry sky—among other tools—to navigate in the right direction. If this proves to be true, Dreyer and his colleagues claim it would make the Australian Bogong moth the first known invertebrate to “use the stars for discerning specific geographical directions (that is, a direction relative to north) for directed long-range navigation to a distant goal,” the team wrote in a new study, published today in the journal Nature.

In 2018, the same researchers suggested that Bogong moths reach their destinations by both sensing Earth's magnetic field and by using unknown visual landmarks. In fact, as noted by a Nature News and Views article, some animals rely on several different navigational methods. To test whether the night sky plays a role in guiding the moths, the team captured the insects at the start of their migration and placed them in a planetarium-like simulator.

“By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator, we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth's known magnetic sense), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions,” the researchers explained in the study.

As ancient seafarers would attest, the predictable positions of stars make them a reliable navigational tool. Nonetheless, scientists have previously documented only some night-migratory birds using starlight to find a specific geographical direction. Dung Beetles use the stars to travel in a straight line, but they are not migratory insects—they're not using stellar cues for long-distance travel like birds and Bogong moths do.

By analyzing the moth's brain, the scientists also demonstrated that neurons linked to vision “responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation,” showing the greatest activity “when the moth was headed southwards.” In other words, their brains appear to be wired to pick up on stellar cues.

However, the parts of the starry sky that moths specifically rely on for directions remain a mystery, especially since it is unclear whether moths can even see individual stars. The researchers theorize that the moths can likely see the Milky Way, while constellations, the Moon, and potentially dark features on the horizon might also serve as reliable navigational cues.

Ultimately, the study builds on the team's previous research by further illuminating the Bogong moth's directional toolkit. “Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth's magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination,” the researchers concluded.

The next time intense solar activity causes GPS blackouts, I bet we'll all be wishing we were Bogong moths.

The Israel-linked hacker group known as Predatory Sparrow has carried out some of the most disruptive and destructive cyberattacks in history, twice disabling thousands of gas station payment systems across Iran and once even setting a steel mill in the country on fire. Now, in the midst of a new war unfolding between the two countries, they appear to be bent on burning Iran's financial system.

Predatory Sparrow, which often goes by its Farsi name, Gonjeshke Darande, in an effort to appear as a homegrown hacktivist organization, announced in a post on on its X account Wednesday that it had targeted the Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex, accusing the exchange of enabling sanctions violations and terrorist financing on behalf of the Iranian regime. According to cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic, the hackers destroyed more than $90 million in Nobitex holdings, a rare instance of hackers burning crypto assets rather than stealing them.

“These cyberattacks are the result of Nobitex being a key regime tool for financing terrorism and violating sanctions,” the hackers posted to X. “Associating with regime terror financing and sanction violation infrastructure puts your assets at risk.”

The incident follows another Predatory Sparrow attack on Iran's finance system on Wednesday, in which the same group targeted Iran's Sepah bank, claiming to have destroyed “all” the bank's data in retaliation for its associations with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and posting documents that appeared to show agreements between the bank and the Iranian military. “Caution: Associating with the regime's instruments for evading sanctions and financing its ballistic missiles and nuclear program is bad for your long-term financial health,” the hackers wrote. “Who's next?”

Sepah Bank's website was offline yesterday but appeared to be working again today. The bank didn't respond to WIRED's request for comment. Nobitex's website was offline today and the company couldn't be reached for comment.

As is often in the case in the fog of an unfolding war and its accompanying cyberattacks, what effects Predatory Sparrow's cyberattacks have had remain unclear. But Hamid Kashfi, an Iranian cybersecurity researcher living in Sweden and the founder of the cybersecurity firm DarkCell, says he has heard from contacts in Iran that Sepah's online banking and ATMs have been offline since the attacks began, causing widespread disruption to civilians' ability to access their funds. “There has been a lot of collateral damage,” Kashfi says. “It just seems to be straight up causing damage and chaos. I can't think of what other logic would be behind it. Yes, they provide services to the military. But they do for millions of regular joes and civilians as well.”

In the Nobitex attack, blockchain analysis reveals some of the details of Predatory Sparrow's sabotage: According to Elliptic, the eight-figure sum stolen from the exchange was moved to a series of crypto addresses that all started with variations on the phrase “FuckIRGCterrorists.” Those so-called “vanity” addresses typically can't be created in any way that offers control or recovery of funds held there, so Elliptic concludes that moving funds to those addresses was instead a pointed method of destroying the money. “The hackers clearly have political rather than financial motivations,” says Tom Robinson, Elliptic's cofounder. “The crypto they stole has effectively been burned.”

Elliptic also confirmed in its blog post about the attack that crypto tracing shows Nobitex does in fact have links with sanctioned IRGC operatives, Hamas, Yemen's Houthi rebels, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group. “It's also an act of sabotage, by attacking a financial institution that was pivotal in Iran's use of cryptocurrency to evade sanctions,” Robinson says.

Predatory Sparrow has long been one of the most aggressive cyberwarfare-focused groups in the world. The hackers, who are widely believed to have links to Israel's military or intelligence agencies, have for years targeted Iran with an intermittent barrage of carefully planned attacks on the country's critical infrastructure. The group has targeted Iran's railways with data-destroying attacks and twice disabled payment systems at thousands of Iranian gas stations, triggering nationwide fuel shortages. In 2022, it carried out perhaps the most physically destructive cyberattack in history, hijacking industrial control systems at the Khouzestan steel mill to cause a massive vat of molten steel to spill onto the floor, setting the plant on fire and nearly burning staff there alive, as shown in the group's own video of the attack posted to its YouTube account.

Exactly why Predatory Sparrow has now turned its attention to Iran's financial sector—whether because it sees those financial institutions as the most consequential or merely because its banks and crypto exchanges were vulnerable enough to offer a target of opportunity—remains unclear for now, says John Hultquist, chief analyst on Google's threat intelligence group and a longtime tracker of Predatory Sparrow's attacks. Almost any conflict, he notes, now includes cyberattacks from hacktivists or state-sponsored hackers. But the entry of Predatory Sparrow in particular into this war suggests there may yet be more to come, with serious consequences.

“This actor is very serious and very capable, and that's what separates them from many of the operations that we'll probably see in the coming weeks or months,” Hultquist says. “A lot of actors are going to make threats. This is one that can follow through on those threats.”

Iran's largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, said Wednesday that it was hacked and funds have been drained from its hot wallet.

In a statement on its website translated by TechCrunch, Nobitex said it detected unauthorized access to its infrastructure and hot wallet, in which the company stores a portion of its customers' cryptocurrency. The company said it was investigating the incident, and that its website and app would be unavailable for the foreseeable future.

Public records show the hackers stole at least $90 million of the company's assets over multiple transactions. Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic said the hackers “burned” the stolen funds by sending the crypto to inaccessible wallets, effectively taking the money out of circulation.

Nobitex has more than 10 million customers, according to an archived copy of Nobitex's website from last week.

Pro-Israel hacking group Predatory Sparrow (also known in Farsi as “Gonjeshke Darande”) took credit for the cyberattack. In a post on X, the group said it targeted Nobitex for allegedly financing terrorism for the Iranian regime and evading international sanctions.

A day earlier, the hacking group also claimed responsibility for a hack on Iran's Bank Sepah resulting in widespread outages at ATMs across the country.

News of the cyberattacks comes as Israel and Iran attack each other's cities. It's not clear who is behind Predatory Sparrow, which first appeared in 2021, but the hacking group has targeted Iranian organizations with destructive cyberattacks in the past, and broadly appears aligned with Israeli interests. 

Iranian news outlet IRIB said Tuesday that amid the ongoing military conflict, Israel had “launched a massive cyber war against [Iran's] digital infrastructure to disrupt the process of providing services.”

This project shattered our expectations.

Researchers from the Lincoln Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are showing the world that there are still plenty of new innovations to come in the world of 3D printing. We've reviewed really fun 3D printers like the Cocoa Press that 3D prints chocolate, but this is the first time we've seen anyone 3D print with glass.

When making things out of glass the usual way (sans 3D printer), there's a need for extremely high temperatures to not only shape the glass but also anneal the final creation. The thought of parsing hot material like molten glass through a machine sounds unreasonable to manage, and that's because it is. That's why the team at MIT developed a new technique that allows the team to produce glass structures at a much lower temperature.

According to the MIT team, their new technique makes it possible to print things out of glass that would otherwise be impossible to create using traditional means. They hope that the new development makes it easier for people to manufacture a wide variety of glass devices, giving examples like high-temperature electronic components and microfluidic systems.

The team refers to the glass-based filament as an inorganic composite glass, while the overall process is known as low-temperature additive manufacturing. This material apparently resolves stability concerns found in other filaments while still allowing for flexibility when it comes to structural versatility.

This inorganic composite glass is made of inorganic materials, with nanoparticles and silicate solution confirmed by the team as part of those materials. Once the glass filament has been printed, it's placed in an oil bath where the temperature is then raised to 250°C. An organic solvent is then used to clean any residue from the print.

We don't expect to see glass filament on the shelves anytime soon, but it's exciting to know this possibility is out there and being actively pursued. In the meantime, we'll stick to what we know best—3D printers that print plastic and chocolate.

Being part of the Anker group, eufy has quickly become a leader in value and quality when it comes to home appliances. Their robotic vacuums are especially impressive, offering excellent value for money and performance that rivals much pricier competitors. Directly competing with the likes of Ecovacs, iRobot, and Roborock, eufy consistently introduces products that are extremely capable but also much lower in price.

Right now, eufy is offering  a record-low price on its 11S Max robot vacuum which can be had for only $159, a brand new all-time low and an astonishing 43% discount off its original $279 list price. This is the perfect opportunity to say goodbye to tedious manual cleaning and bulky upright vacuums that drain your time and energy.

See at Amazon

For less than the cost of a high-end upright cleaner, you get a robot cleaner that deftly handles hard floors, medium-pile carpets and whatever else you can imagine. The eufy 11S Max is also Amazon top robot vacuum best-seller, and at this price point, it's not surprising to see why.

At a height of only 2.85 inches, it is able to pass under furniture and into crevices that other models cannot. That involves a deeper cleaning throughout your entire house without lifting up furniture or getting down on your hands and knees to reach hard spots. Quiet as a mouse but amazingly powerful, the 11S Max can be run at any time of day or night.

With a runtime of 100 minutes using a single battery, it can clean large spaces without interruption. This comes in handy for open floor plans or houses with many rooms. The BoostIQ technology of the vacuum changes suction power within 1.5 seconds automatically and provides optimal cleaning experience on any flooring. Regardless of what you have (hardwood, tiles, or medium-pile carpet), the eufy 11S Max adapts to provide you with the best results.

The eufy 11S Max features an anti-scratch tempered glass top cover which provides the device with a wonderful aesthetic appeal and also protects it from the usual wear and tear of day-to-day usage. Its infrared sensors enable it to move around objects and fall detection technology prevents it from rolling down the stairs or off the edge of a table.

Unlike some of the more premium models, it doesn't feature Wi-Fi or smartphone connectivity: All is controlled through the remote control included with it or through the controls on the device itself. Sure, that entails not being able to use your phone to tell your vacuum what to do but it also entails no tricky setup or connectivity issues to worry about.

With its price now at an all-time low, there's never been a more ideal time to purchase a robot vacuum.

HDR needs to be embraced 'from day one, not as an afterthought,' seems like sage advice.

Mario Kart World on the Switch 2 is guilty of implementing ‘fake HDR,' according to recent heated reactions by a number of TechTubers. We are well aware of social media rage farming, but a coolly considered, in-depth new technical blog by Alexander Mejia, agrees that Mario Kart World was developed using “an SDR-first content pipeline with a last-minute HDR tonemap that limits the color and dynamic range.” Mejia is probably one of the leading authorities on creating HDR visual experiences, based on his experience in delivering “the world-leading Dolby Vision HDR experience to Xbox Series X and Unreal Engine.”

In fairness, the developers of Mario Kart World have set themselves up for this stinging criticism, as the flagship launch title is marketed with boasts of it supporting 4K resolution at 60FPS refresh with HDR visuals (4K60 HDR for short). However, “Mario Kart World reveals that even the highest caliber of developers aren't taking HDR seriously,” reckons Mejia.

That tripping up over HDR isn't uncommon, though. Rather, Mejia admits that “If you're finding it tricky to make your game's HDR look right, you're not alone.” The most important thing to do, to make the most of the HDR capabilities present in most TVs and monitors sold in the 2020s, is “embracing HDR from day one, not as an afterthought,” suggests the HDR pipeline consulting expert.

If you are curious about how Mejia captured, reviewed, and assessed the Mario Kart World on Switch 2, he shares the full details of his hardware and capture path, the procedure, and tips for home users wishing to achieve similar insight.

Moving on to the findings, the HDR expert's images, charts, and stats make the HDR quality deficiencies in Mario Kart World glaringly obvious. A particularly stark result comes from image brightness peak measurement. “Nintendo's own test image peaks at only ~500 nits even if you set 10,000 nits peak brightness,” noted Mejia. “Not a good sign that they took HDR seriously.”

Also, it was observed that, even if the console brightness is cranked to 10,000 nits, “captured peaks in game never exceed ~950 nits.” That's quite a discrepancy. It is also quite a shame, given the game art's colorful and bright style being chained to an SDR-like color space (likely Rec.709), making no use of the extended color gamut afforded by the Rec.2020 standard.

Above: Both Godfall Ultimate Edition on XBOX Series X (left), and Mario Kart World on Nintendo Switch 2 (right) are captured in HDR, with 10,000 nits max brightness.

To conclude, Mejia repeats the sentiment from some of the tastiest quotes we have included above. In short, it looks like even the best developers are not taking HDR seriously, seem to follow an SDR-first workflow, and are thus squandering the possibilities of modern consoles and TVs (or monitors).

The HDR expert finishes up by cannily touting his studio consultancy, offering help with “HDR first rendering pipelines, Dolby Vision integration, and dynamic tone-mapping strategies.” Keep that in mind as you ponder his findings.

The U.S. military recently announced that four executives from some of the top tech companies in Silicon Valley have joined the Army Reserve as direct-commissioned officers. The move is part of a push to speed up the adoption of technology in the military, but as the news outlet Task & Purpose points out, it's pretty unusual.

The Army said in a press release that the four executives are Shyam Sankar, CTO at Palantir; Andrew Bosworth, CTO at Meta; Kevin Weil, Chief Product Officer of OpenAI; and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab and former Chief Research Officer for OpenAI.

The four men are being commissioned at the high rank of lieutenant colonel as part of a program called Detachment 201: The Army's Executive Innovation Corps. As Task & Purpose notes, the men will get to skip the usual process of taking a Direct Commissioning Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, and they won't need to complete the Army Fitness Test.

The Army didn't respond to questions emailed Tuesday but said in a statement published on its website that, “Their swearing-in is just the start of a bigger mission to inspire more tech pros to serve without leaving their careers, showing the next generation how to make a difference in uniform.” Their role in the Army Reserve is to “work on targeted projects to help guide rapid and scalable tech solutions to complex problems,” as the Army puts it.

The new reservists will serve for about 120 hours a year, according to the Wall Street Journal, and will have a lot of flexibility to work remotely. They'll work on helping the Army acquire more commercial tech, though it's not clear how conflict-of-interest issues will be enforced, given the fact that the people all work for companies that would conceivably be selling their wares to the military. In theory, they won't be sharing information with their companies or “participating in projects that could provide them or their companies with financial gain,” according to the Journal.

Silicon Valley has always benefited greatly from ties to the U.S. military. Silicon Valley companies were bringing in $5 billion annually from defense contracts during the Reagan administration, something that the average person may not remember about the 1980s. But it's always been an uneasy alliance for consumer-facing tech companies, especially over recent decades.

That's all changing, according to many folks who align more with President Donald Trump, who was once considered a shameful person to represent in polite company. As Andrew Bosworth, the CTO at Meta, who is joining the Army Reserves, told the Wall Street Journal, “There's a lot of patriotism that has been under the covers that I think is coming to light in the Valley.”

Bosworth and his buddies can be a bit more open about their goals now that Trumpism has been more normalized in the president's second term. But they also run the risk of hitching their wagons—and the reputation of the companies they represent—to a president who's famous for acting recklessly. After all, this is the guy who just a couple of days ago told Tehran, a city of 10 million people, to evacuate and is heavily suggesting he's going to get the U.S. into war with Iran.

Some people may think that's a good thing, and at the very least, it might be a wise business decision for some firm like Palantir to hope for war. But OpenAI and Meta have a lot of products that depend on buy-in from the general public. And we've seen guys like Elon Musk take huge hits to their bottom lines after attaching themselves to Trumpism. And with Trump at the helm, any association with the Army is bound to be perilous in a time of war. We all saw the viral videos of Trump's parade, right?

AI texture decompression promises better image quality, lower resource usage

Nvidia's Blackwell architecture touts support for a raft of AI-powered "neural rendering" features. Among the more interesting of these is neural texture compression, or NTC. As developers pursue more realistic gaming experiences, texture sizes have also grown, creating more pressure on limited hardware resources like VRAM. An enthusiast has now demoed texture compression tech in action on both Nvidia and Intel test systems, demonstrating massive improvements in compression, a feature that will ultimately allow developers to do more with less VRAM, or to enable more features within the same GPU memory capacity.

NTC promises to greatly reduce texture sizes on disk and in memory and to improve the image quality of rendered scenes compared to the block-based texture compression techniques widely used today. It allows developers to use a small neural network optimized for each material in a scene to decompress those textures.

To enable neural rendering features like these, Nvidia, Microsoft, and other vendors have worked together to create a DirectX feature called Cooperative Vectors that gives developers fine-grained access to the matrix acceleration engines in modern Nvidia, Intel, and AMD GPUs. (Nvidia calls these Tensor Cores, Intel calls them XMX engines, and AMD calls them AI Accelerators).

NTC hasn't appeared in a shipping game yet, but the pieces are coming together. A new video from YouTuber Compusemble shows that an NTC-powered future could be a bright one. Compusemble walks us through two practical demonstrations of NTC: one from Intel and the other from Nvidia.

Intel's demo shows a walking T-Rex. The textures decompressed via NTC for this example are visibly crisper and sharper relative to those using the block compression method commonly employed today. The results from NTC look much closer to the native, uncompressed texture.

At least on Compusemble's system, which includes an RTX 5090, the average pass time required increases from 0.045ms to 0.111ms at 4K, or an increase of 2.5x. Even so, that's a tiny portion of the overall frame time.

Dramatically, NTC without Cooperative Vectors enabled requires a shocking 5.7 ms of pass time, demonstrating that Cooperative Vectors and matrix engines are essential for this technique to be practical.

Nvidia's demo shows the benefits of NTC for VRAM usage. Uncompressed, the textures for the flight helmet in this demo occupy 272 MB. Block compression reduces that to 98 MB, but NTC provides a further dramatic reduction to 11.37 MB.

As with Intel's dinosaur demo, there's a small computational cost to enabling NTC, but that tradeoff seems well worth it in exchange for the more efficient usage of fixed resources that the technique enables.

Overall, these demos show that neural texture compression could have dramatic and exciting benefits for developers and gamers, whether that's reducing VRAM pressure for a given scene or increasing the visual complexity possible within a set amount of resources. We hope developers begin taking advantage of this technique soon.

Scoring a huge deal on Apple's top-rated AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds is a matter of timing. There's a 32% off deal that drops on Amazon which brings the price of these state of the art earbuds down to just $169, but you have to keep a sharp eye out for it. Or, better yet, we can just tell you when it's back. Like right now.

This $80 price drop on the AirPods Pro 2 hadn't been around for the past month before now, but with the exception of the small Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2024 window when the AirPods Pro 2 dropped to a record low $154, this elusive $169 deal is the lowest price on Apple's best-ever AirPods since they were released in April 2024.

See at Amazon

What's earned the AirPods Pro 2 that stellar 4.6-star rating from nearly 30,000 Amazon reviewers, and all of those professional reviews calling them Apple's best AirPods yet? Start with the new H2 chip that drives all of the many great features of the AirPods Pro 2. The state of the art H2 processor makes it all possible: the adaptive noice cancellation that intelligently detects the noise level of your surroundings, the transparency mode that lets in enough of your surroundings to keep you safe, and the vastly improved sound and call quality.

Tack on the 6-hour battery life, seamless linking with Apple's Find My with Precision Finding app to keep your AirPods Pro 2 secure, IP54-level dust, sweat, and water resistance, and the new ability to recharge with the Apple Watch charger in addition to USB-C, MagSafe, and other Qi-certified chargers, and those rave reviews make total sense.

Perhaps most impressively, the AirPods Pro 2 come with hearing health support that's a first in any mass-market earbuds. This includes a hearing test that allows you to check your hearing without a trip to the doctor's office, hearing protection for when you're in loud environments, and a clinical-grade hearing aid feature that assists people with mild to moderate hearing loss.

There's no predicting when that Amazon deal that drops the price of the AirPods Pro 2 from $249 to just $169. But when it does swing around — like right now — it's more than worth jumping on. You get the industry-leading AirPods Pro 2 with all of their upgrades and advanced features, not to mention the pristine sound and peerless performance when you're using them to take or make a phone call, and you get $80 back in your pocket.

How much is company culture worth?

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta has been attempting to lure its staff to work at its AI division with absolutely outrageous compensation. He claimed during a YouTube interview at Uncapped with Jack Altman, who is his brother, that the social media giant is offering $100M signing bonuses to some senior technical people, with even greater annual compensation. This shows how big a bet Meta has placed on AI, and how much it is willing to pour into the project to get a leg up on the competition.

The brothers were talking about Meta's recent acquisition of Scale AI, which happened about a week ago. “I've heard that Meta thinks of us as their biggest competitor, and it is rational for them to keep trying. Their current AI efforts have not worked as well as they've hoped, and I respect being aggressive and continuing to try new things,” Sam said when asked about Meta's move.

“They started making these giant offers to a lot of people on our team, like $100 million signing bonuses, more than that comp per year. I'm really happy that, at least so far, that none of our best people have decided to take them up on that. I think that people sort of look at the two paths and say, ‘Alright, OpenAI's got a really good shot — a much better shot, actually — delivering on [AI] superintelligence and also may eventually be the more valuable company.”

As many companies have continued investing billions of dollars in AI hardware over the past few years, they have probably realized that they need equally expensive talent to run them. There have been previous reports that Meta has been losing AI staff despite paying them $2 million annually, with many jumping ship to its rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic. If Altman's claims are correct, it may be that Meta has noticed this and has decided to up the ante and pay so much more for senior AI engineers to join its effort.

Sam criticized Meta, saying that the degree it focuses on the compensation — not the work or the mission — will not set up a great culture. Because of this, he says people would rather stay at OpenAI, despite the massive amounts of money that Meta is throwing towards its people. “I hope that we can be the best place in the world to do this kind of research. I think we build a special culture for it, and I think that we're set up suck that if we succeed at that, and a lot of people on research team believe we will or we have a good chance at it, then everybody will do great, financially,” said Altman. “I think it's incentive aligned with mission first, and then economic rewards, and everything else flowing from that.”

OpenAI's people not jumping ship to Meta despite the massive packages it offers makes sense, though. After all, if you're already making more than enough to support your lifestyle and then some, you really don't need the extra money in exchange for the risk you're taking by moving to a different company, especially one that seemingly lags what your current organization has already achieved.

Besides, OpenAI and its people are confident that it will be among the first ones, if not the first one, to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), and then AI superintelligence (ASI), which could make it and its people a lot of money — so much more than what Meta can offer. However, Anthropic CEO Darius Amodei has an opposing view about AI development — if the government and society are unprepared, its widespread use can cause unemployment rates to jump to 20% and wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs.

Victoria Aveyard's eyes avoid the camera when she slams her large white binder on the table, weighed down with a 1,000-page draft of her latest work in progress. The stack is heavy, made clear by her audible sigh as she splits the thick manuscript in half. Fueled with Cherry Lime Poppi and a bowl of grapes, she purposefully jots notes on the pages with every quick camera cut. Aveyard, the New York Times bestselling young adult fantasy author of the Red Queen series, doesn't say a single word in the video, but her captions on the screen speak volumes. “Using GenAI to write a book doesn't make you a writer, it makes you a thief,” reads one.

“Don't use generative-AI to make tropey, regurgitated romantasy sludge that you can then launder through the self-publishing industry in order to backdoor your way into a traditional publishing deal,” Aveyard tells her over 460,000 followers on TikTok in another video posted on May 27. “Authors talk.” Both TikToks garnered over 350,000 views.

Criticism and warnings of Gen-AI authors snagging coveted deals are flooding both Threads and TikTok, with writers and readers sometimes flinging around accusations when they suspect someone is using AI as part of their creative process. Now, Aveyard and other prolific authors are not only calling out people who use AI to write, they're also posting livestreams and time-lapses of their writing processes to defend themselves against such complaints.

“The r/WritingWithAI subreddit has over 40,000 subscribers and growing. It's a very depressing thought, to know we may very soon be the minority,” Aveyard tells WIRED. “I don't think my voice will move the needle much or convince anyone already using generative AI to stop, but I needed to voice my anger with the circumstances.”

The publishing market is expected to grow by $18.9 million between now and 2029, according to market research firm Technavio, partially due to an influx of self-published authors. But with scammy rewrites and digitally fabricated authors entering the market, artificial intelligence has made searching for human-made content more difficult, causing independent authors to combat what some are calling an AI-generated “witch hunt.”

“Sometimes it's hard to conceptualize the scope and scale of work that goes into writing a book, and showing a physical manuscript really helps that hit home,” Aveyard says when asked about the inspiration behind her 1,000-page editing video. She is a strong critic of AI in publishing, calling it theft of creative intellectual property. “I post regularly on my platforms, and I'm always looking for content that catches the eye as well as emphasizes my work. And getting to emphasize my position on generative AI? An added benefit.” (Aveyard never names any specific indie authors using generative-AI to secure a traditional publishing deal.)

“Do I think authors should post ‘proof'? Not necessarily,” says indie author Ashley Godschild. “Would I like to see more authors post their process and make it clear it's without AI? Yes. Because I think we need to be loud and clear that it's not welcome in this industry.”

Godschild, who penned the fantasy novel The Hunter and The Hunted, says she's been writing since childhood and goes through a lengthy process—plotting her manuscript years before putting pen to paper. A few days after seeing Aveyard's 1,000-page edit post, Godschild posted a time-lapse of herself writing at her computer, captioning the video, “Watch this time-lapse of me writing a scene in a murder mystery TV show without the use of gen-AI.” The caption also notes that she's “not a thief” and that “the murderer is so unpredictable not even a machine could figure out who it is.”

Some writers are using the AI controversy to remind people of the very human skills it takes to craft a complex story.

YA indie author Rachel Menard posted a TikTok of herself opening drafts of one of her manuscripts, writing that if she was using AI, “It wouldn't take me 78 drafts to get it done.”

“Everyone has forgotten what makes a book good, and it's the work that goes into it,” says Menard, who has penned three books independently. She adds that while AI may be able to “pop out a decent spice scene,” it can't create a compelling story. “If my characters don't feel like real people, living real lives, with real problems, then I need to keep working on it.”

Quan Millz, an indie author with over 830,000 TikTok followers and well-known for his jaw-dropping “street lit” titles like Old Thot Next Door and This Hoe Got Roaches in Her Crib, says accusations that he has used AI to write go beyond labeling him as a thief—they underestimate the cultural fluency behind his novels. Prior to revealing his identity on TikTok in 2023, Millz, who is Black, dealt with accusations that he was white and even a rumor that he was a “CIA operative.”

“It's clear now that you use AI to write all your books. Ain't no way you're dropping the books this fast,” one commenter wrote on one of Millz's posts.

Millz uses AI to make book covers, including for books that are still in the conceptual phase, but says allegations that he also writes with the tool are false.

“There's no way in hell you're going to get any of these AI models to really capture the essence of just how Black people talk,” Millz tells WIRED. The author says he has tested using AI for writing and found that the large language models censored his adult scenes and could not reproduce his nuanced tone. “It doesn't understand that AAVE [African American Vernacular English] is not monolithic … Black people in Chicago don't sound like Black people in New York.”

While Millz has hosted a couple of TikTok Lives documenting his writing process in real time, he tells WIRED that he won't be hosting more—even if it helps prove to skeptics that his written work is original.

Constantly checking in with commenters hindered his writing process, he says, and he feels that while having a social presence is crucial in indie publishing, filming your process won't provide more proof of AI-free work than your work itself—at least not yet. “I really do think that there's something else transcendent about the human experience, something mystical that we just don't know about yet, and you can feel that through the arts,” Millz says. “When you read AI text, even if you do a good job of trying to edit it or make it your own, there's still something amiss.”

Gummy supplements are appealing for one obvious reason: Instead of choking down a chalky powdered drink or swallowing a dubious-smelling capsule, you essentially get to eat some candy. Unfortunately, when it comes to creatine, these products might not contain the essential ingredient they claim. Four of six popular creatine gummy products sold on Amazon contained almost no creatine or none at all when samples were tested by an independent lab.

Creatine, a staple supplement for weightlifters and fitness buffs due to its impact on athletic performance, is experiencing a remarkable surge in mainstream popularity. In recent years, the wellness industry has been marketing the substance as a kind of health panacea. Sales are skyrocketing, especially among women. To appeal to as many customers as possible, companies have launched “gummy” creatine products as an alternative to the traditional powdered format. “It's really having a moment right now,” says Jordan Glenn, head of science at the supplement industry tracking and recommendation platform SuppCo, which ordered the creatine gummy tests. “It's no longer just a gym bro supplement.”

One of the products SuppCo had tested was the highest-ranked creatine supplement on Amazon. It's made by a brand called Happyummmm and has been purchased more than 50,000 times in the past two months. (It even has an “Amazon's choice” label.) The gummy's label indicates that two gummies make up a 5-gram serving, but the lab SuppCo hired found that two gummies actually contained 0.005 grams, under 0.1 percent of what was listed. This means that someone would have to eat 2,000 Happyummmm gummies to get the listed serving size. (Happyummm's Hong Kong–based parent company Happygummi Limited does not have a public email or phone number, and WIRED was unable to contact the company for comment.) A person attempting to use Happyummm's products for a creatine “loading phase,” in which the typical daily dosage is around 20 grams, would need to eat 8,000 gummies a day to get their fill.

SuppCo's testing found that a brand called DivinusLabs' gummy samples contained only 0.025 grams per serving rather than the 5 grams indicated on the label. “We appreciate the role of independent testing in promoting transparency and have shared the information with our manufacturing and quality assurance teams. While we had not previously seen this data, we take all reports seriously,” says Ilya Sheleg, the founder from the brand's Brooklyn-based parent company Primerose Hill. Sheleg says the company plans to retest its current batch of gummies with other independent labs.

Other gummies fared even worse in tests. Two brands, Ecowise and Vidabotan, came back with 0 percent creatine. Despite these results, both brands have high ratings on Amazon. The headline for Ecowise's top review: “Tastes great and actually works!”

Like Happigummi Limited, Vidabotan does not list contact information online, so the company could not be reached for comment. When WIRED reached out to Ecowise, its founder and CEO Vladislav Shabanov promptly responded, expressing disbelief that his products tested so poorly, as his Colorado-based manufacturers have been Current Good Manufacturing Practices–certified, which means they follow guidelines set by the US Food and Drug Administration. The company also tests its products in third-party labs at regular intervals.

However, after WIRED sent Shabanov details about how SuppCo conducted its tests, he conceded that it's possible there may have been quality control issues with some of the product and says the company is launching an internal investigation and had already made a decision to switch to a different manufacturer for some products. “There's always a non-zero chance that manufacturers screwed up,” he says. “Worst-case scenario, we'll have to get the whole batch out of Amazon.”

According to Amazon spokesperson Juliana Karber, the company requires dietary supplement sellers to submit third-party testing results to prove that they contain the ingredients on the label and are free from harmful contaminants. For the four products that failed SuppCo's test, she says “three have valid test reports verifying their compliance with relevant standards and that they contain the advertised amount of creatine.” She noted that Amazon is going to do its own test of the products. “Our teams are investigating the remaining product in question, and if we conclude it does not comply with Amazon's policies, it will be removed from the store,” Karber said in a statement. Amazon declined to share which of the supplements had not proffered a valid test report.

Creating effective gummy supplements is a difficult task, since it requires distributing active ingredients evenly throughout individual gelatinous sweets. According to Shabanov, Ecowise spent months refining its processes because it was so hard to create a product that had the appropriate amount of creatine and also tasted good.

What's more, since most methods of creating gummy candies involve heat, active ingredients can get damaged in the process. “Since creatine gummies are often like other gummies, requiring moisture and heat to produce and having citric acid lowering the pH of the gummy, creatine can degrade faster than it would when just manufactured as a dry, unflavored powder,” says Kamal Patel, cofounder of the nutrient and supplement database Examine.com. Patel describes the task of making a good creatine gummy as “a lot harder” than formulating a powder product.

SuppCo also had the creatine gummies tested for levels of creatinine, a waste product created when creatine breaks down. All of the gummies that contained creatine also contained elevated amounts of creatinine, indicating that some of the active ingredients had been degraded. When the lab tested popular powdered creatine products, none had this issue.

SuppCo's test wasn't the first attempt to gauge the potency of creatine gummies. In fact, testing competing brands of gummies has become a kind of tradition in the world of supplements. Last year, the supplement manufacturer NOW Foods tested a dozen popular creatine gummies brands and reported nearly as dismal results to the SuppCo findings—5 of the 12 samples failed, showing very little or no active ingredients. Earlier this year, fitness influencer James Smith sent a sample of gummies from a company called Ovrload that he had previously attempted to invest in out for tests. (Smith claims the investment offer fell through, after which point the company allegedly continued to use his image to promote the brand.) He posted a YouTube video detailing the failed results. Another British supplement company conducted a similar third-party test and also found that Ovrload gummies failed, leading the company to pause sales. (Ovrload didn't respond to requests for comment, but the founder recently posted on Instagram that he plans to resume sales, and will add a transparency portal where users can see exactly what is in the gummies).

“Gummies might not be the best way to take creatine,” says Shabanov. “There's so much potential for human error.”

Creatine gummies aren't the only gelatinous supplement with quality control issues. While some supplement makers have successfully created gummy-style formulas that work, it's a difficult product to produce correctly. “I don't recommend taking supplements or medications in a gummy format, because the chance that the quality will be poor, though it will vary from gummy to gummy, is much greater than with capsules,” says Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who studies supplements. Cohen's previous research has examined how the “great majority” of melatonin gummies sold in the US are inaccurately labeled. In that case, the gummies were actually far more potent than the labels suggested.

In the United States, supplements are regulated very differently than traditional medications. Products can be sold without first getting any approval from the Food and Drug Administration, and the companies selling them are charged with making sure they are safe and effective. Supplements that feature new dietary ingredients need to submit a notification to the FDA prior to launching, but with something like a creatine gummy, which uses established ingredients, that isn't necessary. “FDA has no systematic way of knowing when new dietary supplements are introduced to the market or what they contain. Because of this, we are often at a disadvantage to identify unsafe or otherwise unlawful supplements,” Cara Welch, the director of the FDA's Office of Dietary Supplement Programs in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in 2024.

The loose rules have fostered an environment in which mislabeling is rampant. Many products sold as supplements actually contain pharmaceutical ingredients, including generic Viagra. While some sellers require third-party testing—CVS introduced its mandatory program in 2019—other stores and marketplaces do not.

The Trump Administration is unlikely to adopt a more critical approach to the supplements industry anytime soon. Last fall, prior to his confirmation, current Health and Human Services head Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that the administration would undo the FDA's “aggressive suppression” of supplements.

Cohen says that the best safeguard people have to buy supplements is to check to see if they've been certified by two independent nonprofit organizations, US Pharmacopeia and the NSF International, which test products for health and safety standards.

“As American consumers, right now, we have no idea if the supplement we've purchased is accurately labeled or not. Some are, many aren't. So we've got to work around this until the laws are changed,” he says.

On February 25, 2025, the Australian swimmer James Magnussen stood on the starting blocks at a swimming pool in North Carolina with a million dollars and his reputation on the line. Magnussen, a triple Olympic medalist and world champion in the 100-meter freestyle, had been retired from professional sports for six years. But he had restarted his career to join the Enhanced Games, a kind of Olympics on steroids. This is meant literally: The event, which encourages athletes to take performance-enhancing drugs, is scheduled for May 2026 in Las Vegas.

Its founder, Aron D'Souza, is a slick-talking Peter Thiel acolyte who believes throwing off the shackles of drug testing can help push humanity to the next level. Enhanced, the company behind the Games, has secured millions from Thiel, Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital, and others, and praise from the likes of Joe Rogan. But the reaction from the sporting establishment has been split between horror over the health implications and skepticism over whether the event will ever actually happen.

At the time of his February swim, Magnussen was the only athlete to have publicly said he'd be willing to compete. He'd come to the Greensboro Aquatics Center for a secret time trial. If he could beat the world record time in the 50-meter freestyle—swimming's flagship event—he'd win a million-dollar prize from Enhanced, and D'Souza would get to prove his many doubters wrong by demonstrating that a cocktail of substances usually banned from elite sport could turn an ex-athlete into the fastest swimmer on Earth.

For four months, Magnussen had been on “the protocol”—a regimen of daily injections in the stomach and backside. No one from Enhanced would tell me what he was taking—they say they don't want to encourage copycats—but Magnussen let it slip to the Sydney Morning Herald: testosterone to boost muscle mass and bone density, the peptides BPC-157 and thymosin to speed up recovery, and ipamorelin and CJC-1295 to increase the release of growth hormone in the body.

James Magnussen, the first athlete to sign up to work with Enhanced, did not have an easy time training as enhanced athlete.

Standing on the blocks, he looked insane—his already out-there swimmer's physique pushed to the extreme. Veins popped on his forearms, and his shoulders were cartoonishly broad. His back muscles bulged so far out of the sides of his swimsuit that you could see them from the front. With the reflective goggles and black swimming cap, the overall effect was more alien than superhuman.

The target time was 20.91 seconds, set in 2009 by the Brazilian Cesar Cielo. But as soon as Magnussen broke the surface, you could tell something was wrong. He was sinking too low in the water. His arms raked forward, devouring the distance, but the more he strained, the more resistance he faced. He had put on 30 pounds of muscle, and his own beefed up body was working against him. The whole premise of the Enhanced Games seemed to hang in the balance. If the only elite athlete willing to come forward couldn't get close to the world record after five months of enhancements, well, what was the point?

In 2009, D'Souza got a phone call that changed his life and set him on the path that would lead to Enhanced. The Australian was in his first week as a law student at the University of Oxford, and a friend who was close to the billionaire Peter Thiel got in touch to say they were visiting the city and to ask if D'Souza would show them around.

Befriending Thiel opened his eyes to the “extraordinary opportunities that exist in the world,” he says. These were opportunities he wanted to seize; D'Souza is “obsessed with status and power,” as his friend Sam Altman once put it. He and Thiel hit it off immediately, and a year later D'Souza went to Thiel with a plan for how, given three to five years and $10 million, Thiel could take his revenge on Gawker for outing him as gay. Improbably, this involved covertly funding legal action by the wrestler Hulk Hogan against Gawker, which had published a sex tape without Hogan's consent. Although D'Souza is also gay, his plan to take down Gawker—which folded after Hogan won a $140 million verdict against it—was apparently not part of some righteous crusade. It was “just a way for him to make his mark,” writes Ryan Holiday in Conspiracy, a book about the trial.

After the verdict, D'Souza bounced between careers—diplomat, VC, philanthropist, fintech founder. But in the waning days of 2022, he got an idea. Every year D'Souza would spend the holidays sketching out new business plans—a subscription-based social network, a scheme to fund a poet laureate to define what it means to be Australian—but nothing had really stuck. Inspired by the ripped physiques he'd been seeing at the gym and on Instagram, D'Souza refined some thoughts for a showcase of just how far you could push human potential. He had the sense that public attitudes toward steroids were starting to shift after years of stigma following their misuse by athletes and state-sponsored doping regimes in the 1980s and 1990s.

Aron D'Souza, mastermind of the Enhanced Games.

It was a notion that had been percolating in D'Souza's head for years—ever since he'd read an article in a 2004 issue of WIRED called ‘Steroids for Everyone!' that outlined the case for an Enhanced Olympics using almost exactly the same argument that D'Souza employs today. There were other inspirations too: the “unimpressive” intellect of members of the International Olympic Committee who he met at a dinner in Oxford, and a study commissioned by the World Anti Doping Agency which surveyed athletes anonymously and found that 44 percent of them admitted to taking drugs. (This figure is one of D'Souza's most potent weapons in interviews, but one of the authors told me that it's likely an overestimate and that it was only ever meant to be a pilot study to assess new methods of measurement.)

He spent New Year's Eve with Thiel, as he does most years, and told the billionaire what he'd been working on. Thiel seemed interested, so D'Souza spent the next six months developing the concept further. D'Souza and his executive assistant Thomas Dolan tried pitching to investors (including Lance Armstrong, according to the Financial Times) but got little interest. “Everyone was like, you can't even talk about this stuff,” D'Souza says. “It was outside the Overton window.” In June 2023, D'Souza launched a website for the Enhanced Games and posted a 34-second stock-footage clip of a sprinter in the blocks, with a voice-over declaring that he was the fastest man in the world and “a proud enhanced athlete.” It presented the Games as a libertarian ideal: take whatever you want, with no testing.

D'Souza and Dolan spent £4,000 ($5,400) on paid promotion, and the clip got 9 million views in 24 hours. Enhanced had its first media coverage and its first investor—the prominent venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan, who reached out to D'Souza via Twitter DM, and followed up a few hours later with a term sheet for the deal, also sent over Twitter DM.

A few weeks later, D'Souza hosted a Sunday lunch at his house for Thiel, who was visiting London, and a few friends in the gay VC community. “We've all holidayed together for years,” he told me. “It's an extraordinarily tight group.” Also on the guest list was Christian Angermayer, a German biotech billionaire who Thiel had introduced to D'Souza on holiday in 2013. Angermayer had seen an article about Enhanced in the German press and wanted to come on board as a cofounder.

Neither Thiel, D'Souza, nor Angermayer are huge sports fans. (“We're three gay guys,” D'Souza says.) But over roast lamb, Yorkshire pudding, and fine wine the group got to talking about human enhancement, longevity, and all the rest of it, and by the end of the meal both Angermayer and Thiel had agreed to invest. D'Souza has proved to be a savvy fundraiser. He has the valuable ability to keep a straight face while saying something obviously ridiculous—engaging with him is “like talking to a bar of soap,” one doping expert told me.

The announcement of Thiel's and Angermayer's investments went out at the end of January 2024 and sparked a new round of media coverage, and the fiercest criticisms yet from health experts. Those I spoke to were worried about the effect of long-term steroid use on athlete's hearts, premature aging, and what might happen to people when they tried to come off the drugs. Others thought that an event like the Enhanced Games might cause steroid use to spread first through sport, then through society at large, and that people might end up taking larger doses or counterfeit versions of the pills that athletes are using. “There's going to be enormous ripple effects that will certainly have destructive implications in people,” says Thomas Murray, bioethicist and author of Good Sport: Why Our Games Matter—and How Doping Undermines Them. Personally, I felt that D'Souza had fundamentally misunderstood sports. At heart, they are about limitations: not who can travel 100 meters the fastest but who can do it while staying within a set of agreed-upon rules (no drugs, no rocket boots, no giant fan blowing a tail wind behind you). And even in events like sprinting and swimming, success isn't simply a function of adding more power. People aren't cars. There's a skill to swimming quickly that goes beyond the strength of your muscles. And the drugs aren't magic—even if you can take half a second off your 100-meter sprint time with steroids (and that's a generous estimate), to break Usain Bolt's record you need to find one of the handful of people who can already run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds and then convince them to risk their reputation, their earning potential, and maybe even their health.

Which raises a question: Why would even one athlete agree to this? In February 2024, Magnussen was driving home from a pickleball game when he got a call from the Hello Sport podcast; the hosts wanted to ask him about the Enhanced Games. He had a comfortable life in Australia: swimming at Bondi Beach every day and working as a commentator. But he missed the thrill of competition. “I love the simplicity of being an athlete,” he says. He made a flippant comment that would change his life and help usher the Games into being. “If they put up a million dollars for the 50-freestyle world record, I'll come on board as their first athlete,” Magnussen told the podcast hosts. “I'll juice to the gills and break the record within six months.”

A month after that, I met D'Souza at a plush coworking space in West London where Enhanced had set up a small office. Looking at the website back then, it was hard to take the idea seriously. D'Souza had co-opted the language of the LGBTQ community for his venture—the site talked about “coming out” as enhanced. There was a section devoted to covertly editing Wikipedia articles to, for instance, change the word “cheated” in an article about an athlete caught doping to “fought for science and bodily sovereignty.” On the official Enhanced Games Discord channel, which was mainly populated by bodybuilders sharing before and after pictures, I found a zip file called “The Arsenal” which was full of memes bashing the International Olympic Committee, the details of which are actually too cringe to describe.

But behind the scenes, things were starting to change. Angermayer had put his own people into senior roles, drafting in Mike Oakes from his Apeiron Investment Group to work on communications and Max Martin—a square-jawed twentysomething whose enthusiasm about his own enhancement program almost had me reaching for a syringe—to oversee the execution of the Games. More sensible hires followed: sports scientist Dan Turner to head up a scientific commission that would help advise athletes, former Team USA chief Rick Adams to handle the logistics of the event itself, Tim Phelan from Nike to run athlete relations. Magnussen had officially come on board as Enhanced's first athlete—they'd pay him a monthly salary. The mission changed, too, to become more about getting the public to embrace steroids, “the Enhanced Age,” superhumanity for everyone. There was also unrest: Early on, Angermayer had brought in physician Michael Sagner to sit on an independent medical commission that would ensure athlete safety. Sagner, a longevity and aging expert who operates a high-end clinic just off London's Harley Street, became incensed by some of D'Souza's public statements. “Without asking anybody, he was just going bananas with these press releases,” Sagner says. “And then it became even more outrageous when there was something else added to the website—that it's even better without testing, and anything goes.” He has stuck around—for now.

The Paris Olympics came and went with barely a peep from Enhanced. The first Enhanced Games had been slated for the end of 2024, but the open trials D'Souza had told me about the first time we met never materialized. Magnussen, still their only athlete, was getting restless.

In October 2024, Magnussen flew from Sydney to Los Angeles. He had presented Enhanced with a plan: With eight weeks to dope and train, he could try to break the world record as a way to showcase the potential of the Games before the first official event. His first challenge had been finding the drugs. A few companies had contacted him, and Enhanced had put him in touch with some members of its medical commission, but it wasn't the kind of thing that was easy to get advice on.

The next hurdle was finding somewhere to swim. Elite-level pools and coaches in Australia can only work with drug-tested athletes, so Magnussen reached out to Brett Hawke, a former Australian Olympian turned coach who had worked at Auburn University in Alabama for many years and was now coaching a club team in Irvine, California.

Hawke had coached the two previous fastest swimmers in history—Frédérick Bousquet in the years after his 21.04 in 2004, and Cesar Cielo's 20.91 in 2009, which was the target Magnussen would be trying to beat. Both these swims were in the supersuit era, when swimmers wore full-body polyurethane suits that made them more buoyant, before these were banned at the start of 2010. (Both swimmers also failed drug tests during their careers). Magnussen and Hawke had spoken about the Enhanced Games on Hawke's podcast a few weeks prior, and Magnussen figured California might be an easier place for him to train in anonymity.

At the height of his Olympic career, Magnussen had worked with a full team around him: biomechanicists, sports scientists, strength and conditioning coaches, physiotherapists, assistants. He had underwater cameras to check his form. The temperature of the water was always perfect. Irvine was different. It turned out that the pool manager at the club where Hawke normally worked didn't want Magnussen training there either. So they ended up doing the majority of the preparation for the world record attempt at the 25-yard swimming pool in Hawke's apartment complex—the one open to all residents. There were no lane markings and no blocks to dive from. There were no splash-over areas for the water to go into, so Magnussen was constantly fighting his own turbulence. “We would get a crowd sometimes. People would walk past and stare in amazement and sit and watch,” Hawke says. The only saving grace was the weather: a cold wet winter by California standards meant that they never had to share the pool with the other residents, although they did sometimes have to shoo away some ducks. “The whole process was bizarre to me,” Magnussen says.

James Magnussen, who burst through multiple swimsuits in his attempt to set a new world record.

He started his regimen of daily injections in mid-October, and his body soon started to change. In hindsight, he thinks he is a “super responder” to performance enhancements. “My strength was through the roof,” he says. “I was squatting 250 kilos, which I would say is at least 20 percent stronger than any other swimmer in history. It was insane.” Every few weeks, he would drive to a clinic in Los Angeles for a battery of blood tests and heart checks. Mostly he just trained—twice a day, every day for the first seven weeks in the US. But while the drugs helped his muscles bounce back quicker, the intense workload left no time for his central nervous system to recover. He was burning out.

In December, just when he should have been nearing his physical peak for the record attempt, he got a toothache, and his face “swelled up like a balloon.” He spent Christmas Day in the hospital, having an abscess drained and a root canal operation. The attempt had been pushed back from December to February, and for Magnussen what was meant to be an eight week stint away from friends and family became five months. He spent New Year's alone in an Airbnb, thousands of miles from home.

While Magnussen and Hawke toiled among the ducks and deck chairs in California, the Enhanced Games were inching closer to reality. More athletes were expressing an interest, D'Souza said—although none of them had yet been willing to stick their head above the parapet like Magnussen. Estimates ranged depending on who you asked: Some at Enhanced told me the number of interested parties was in the hundreds; Sagner put it at 35.

D'Souza says Enhanced was talking to “every major sports broadcaster” about screening the event, but he had his eye on social media virality. Angermayer drummed up interest from investors, while Max Martin and Rick Adams toured the world in search of potential host cities. But by the middle of 2024, they'd decided to wait and see who won the US presidential election. The Biden administration had been actively hostile to the idea of Enhanced. A Trump win opened up all sorts of interesting possibilities.

Enhanced began finalizing a deal to host the Games in Las Vegas not long after the election. “A hundred percent the reason they're happening in the US is because Trump won,” says Angermayer. A few months later, he secured investment from 1789 Capital, Donald Trump Jr.'s investment firm, and Enhanced would find itself ideally positioned to align itself with RFK Jr.'s crusade to “Make America Healthy Again.” (“He takes enhancements himself,” D'Souza says of Kennedy. “He is very pro–human enhancement.”) Enhanced started making plans to move its headquarters from London to New York.

In December 2024, D'Souza held a conference in Oxford on human enhancement. Speakers included the geneticist George Church, best known for trying to bring back the woolly mammoth, and Bryan Johnson, best known for plowing his personal fortune into increasingly creepy attempts to make himself younger. At the end, they signed the “First Declaration on Human Enhancement”—a document setting out the tenets that these “pioneers” agreed to follow. The 39 signatories are a strange mix: age-obsessed millionaires, longevity doctors, Enhanced staff members, interested college students, and a bodybuilding influencer called Mr. Vigorous Steve.

But the most interesting thing was the shift in tone. Angermayer's influence had made itself felt. Take Article 2d of the declaration: In competitions, organisers shall establish rigorous safety protocols, scientific testing and medical supervision to ensure that all enhancements are used responsibly.

This is a long way from the libertarian free-for-all that D'Souza had first proposed, and in fact, the more the Games evolved, the more they started to resemble the Olympics. “Obviously, as soon as you want to be taken seriously as a contender on the world stage … you can't have footage of athletes dropping dead,” says Ask Vest Christiansen, a doping researcher who was at the conference in Oxford but did not sign the declaration.

There was much trial-and-error with training the “enhanced” athletes.

Athletes who wanted to compete in the Games would be limited to legal drugs that were approved in the country where they reside and prescribed by a doctor, although several of the drugs Magnussen confessed to taking do not appear to have regulatory approval in either Australia or the US. (Enhanced said it couldn't comment on the “specific substances” Magnussen has taken but emphasized that he “underwent and successfully passed all of Enhanced's required medical screenings and safety checks at every stage of the process.”) Athletes would have regular blood tests and heart and brain scans, and if the doctors on the independent medical commission were concerned, those athletes would be barred from competing at the Enhanced Games.

Far from throwing off the shackles of the World Anti Doping Agency, it seemed as if Enhanced had simply re-created it, with a slightly different red line. The great irony of the Enhanced Games is that athletes who take part are likely to be tested much more often than they would have been had they stayed in clean competition. But by January 2025, the Enhanced Games had a venue, funding, and a friendly political environment. All they needed now was some proof that the drugs would actually make a difference.

After Magnussen recovered from his root canal surgery, he and Hawke tried to counteract some of the effects the enhancement program was having on his body shape. Swimming is a trade-off between power and weight: the heavier you are, the more you sink into the water and the more resistance you face when you're trying to propel yourself forward. He went on a diet plan to try to lose some of the weight he was putting on. Although Magnussen's athlete brain would never let him admit it, it was becoming clear to both him and Hawke that they were running out of time for him to get into world-record-breaking form.

In the meantime, Hawke got a call from Tim Phelan, Enhanced's VP of athlete relations. They had received an email from another athlete who wanted to sign up for the Games—a 31-year-old Greek-Bulgarian swimmer called Kristian Gkolomeev, who had finished fifth in the 50-meter freestyle at the Paris Olympics. (Enhanced says some non-swimmers have signed up too but has yet to name any.) Gkolomeev's ambition had always been to win a medal, but after Paris he felt despondent—he had missed out by less than three-tenths of a second for the second Olympics in a row.

Kristian Gkolomeev, another swimmer attracted to the million-dollar payday, at Enhanced Games event.

Throughout his career, Gkolomeev would bemoan how difficult it was to make a living as a professional swimmer. It was why his father Tsvetan—who swam for Bulgaria at the 1980 and 1988 Olympics—had moved the family to Greece in search of stable work when Kristian was 2. (Tsvetan died of skin cancer in 2010). Gkolomeev had his own young family now, and as he looked at the four years leading up to the next Olympics he wondered how he was going to make it work. Financially, mentally, emotionally, he was done. The million-dollar prize on offer for breaking a world record offered a tempting way out. “One successful year in the Enhanced Games and I could make as much as I would have made in almost 10 careers,” he says.

In early December 2024, Gkolomeev rented an Airbnb and moved his family from Houston to join Hawke in California, ostensibly to serve as a training partner for Magnussen. But a couple of weeks later, Hawke got another phone call. Gkolomeev was going to start an enhancement protocol—and he was going to try to break the world record too. “That's when all hell broke loose,” says Hawke.

Magnussen had moved his whole life to America for the record attempt and was “dead against” another swimmer muscling in on his turf, according to Hawke. “I wasn't thrilled about the prospect of having to share resources,” says Magnussen. “But it's not just about me and my attempt. To prove this concept of the Games, someone needed to break that world record.” Eventually they reached a compromise. Magnussen would get the first crack at the record attempt and the million dollars in February, then Gkolomeev would come back a few months later for his own attempt.

Hawke's job became as much about managing their egos as making them faster—he had to keep them separated when they were doing speed work so that they never got a direct comparison of their times. “Kristian's progression was a lot faster,” Hawke says. “That created a little bit of tension.”

Within a few weeks, Gkolomeev was swimming faster than Magnussen. Within a month, he was as fast as he'd been in Paris. In early February, Gkolomeev started his enhancement program. Like everyone at Enhanced, he was cagey about exactly what substances he was using, but it's clear that he took a very different approach than Magnussen. “I can tell you that I microdosed, like baby doses,” Gkolomeev says. “I could feel it within the first two weeks. I started feeling better—healthier, the energy levels, the confidence that I got.” Magnussen's extra muscle was weighing him down—they didn't want the same thing to happen to Gkolomeev.

A camera crew was following the swimmers as they tried to set new world records.

In the last week of February, Gkolomeev, Magnussen, and Hawke flew to North Carolina, where they were joined by a team from Enhanced and the documentary crew that would film the record attempt.

The Enhanced team had been scouring the country looking for 2009-era supersuits for Magnussen to wear—contacting former swimmers, paying thousands to buy their old gear and have it flown to Greensboro. They managed to find four: two for Magnussen, two for Gkolomeev. But Magnussen had put on so much muscle that he physically couldn't fit into the suit. The night before his first attempt at the record he tried one on and it ripped. Then the second suit ripped as well.

That night, there was a furious discussion in Hawke's room at the Marriott in Greensboro between Magnussen, Hawke, and Max Martin from Enhanced. Magnussen wanted the third supersuit—the one that had been promised to Gkolomeev. Hawke says the Greek was in his room downstairs, texting Hawke: “I'm not giving him my suit, I need it.” He'd done 21.45—just a hundredth below his personal best—in a time trial that morning and was within half a second of the world record in a newer, less buoyant supersuit. He felt like he could break the record.

“Kristian was a little pissed off at that stage,” Hawke says. He thinks the tension between the two men might go some way to explaining what happened next.

When he touched the wall on his final attempt in Greensboro on February 25, Magnussen's time was 22.73 seconds—almost two seconds off Cielo's world record and 1.2 seconds slower than his own clean personal best. He'd failed again, and the Enhanced team would have to regroup. They didn't have their record.

Magnussen was getting a massage in a room to the side of the pool when he heard Gkolomeev hit the water. Hardly anyone was watching—most of the film crew had taken a break, so only Hawke, Martin, and the official timekeepers were actually poolside to witness what happened next. The stakes seemed low, although the million was still up for grabs if either swimmer could go under 20.91 seconds. Gkolomeev had done two warm-up starts and slipped off the blocks both times, falling flat on his face, and he was planning to spend another couple of months on the enhancement protocol before returning to Greensboro in April for his own crack at the record.

But his third start was perfect. He slid into the water, and three powerful dolphin kicks set him on his way. He felt good—strong, relaxed, in flow. Magnussen could see a slice of the pool through the open door of the massage room, and when he saw him go past he knew he was going quicker than before. Hawke was jogging alongside the pool with a stopwatch to track the split times, and at the 35-meter mark he realized what was about to happen. Gkolomeev touched the wall and turned to check his time on the big screen in disbelief—20.89 seconds, a new world record. Mouth agape, hands raised to his black swimming cap in genuine shock. At the other end of the pool, Martin jumped into the water in celebration. “I felt like a Labrador who just couldn't help himself,” he says. Hawke sat with his head in his hands, as if he couldn't quite believe what they had just done. “It was a beautiful day,” Martin says. “Brett was crying. One of the officials was crying.”

Gkolomeev phoned his wife to tell her they were millionaires. The giant check presentation had to wait, though—the organizers had arranged one, but it had been made out to James Magnussen, so they returned the next day to stage some footage for the documentary and some slow-motion shots of them spraying champagne over each other. There was always one eye on the optics—and news of the record was kept a closely guarded secret, for now.

Seven weeks later, Gkolomeev returned to North Carolina to break another world record—for the fastest time in “jammers,” the skintight shorts that elite swimmers have worn since the supersuits were banned in 2010. But he found this one a lot harder. He had been on the enhancement regime for longer, and although he hadn't put on as much weight as Magnussen, he had to adjust his technique to compensate. In the end, it took Gkolomeev five attempts to go one-hundredth of a second under Caeleb Dressel's 2019 time of 21.04.

The fact that Gkolomeev seemed to get slower the longer he spent on the protocol made me wonder if he could have broken the record anyway, without the enhancements. “I would like to think yes,” says Hawke, his coach. Gkolomeev agrees—but says it would have taken longer, maybe six months of training. Magnussen, perhaps unsurprisingly, gives credit to the drugs. “If you watch his 50-meter freestyle race in Paris, at the 15-meter mark he was eighth,” he says. “He was last because he didn't quite have that explosive strength and power that you get on the performance enhancement protocol. I think that gave him that last 1 percent—that last cherry on top to break the world record.”

In May, Enhanced held what it was referring to internally as an “Apple-style launch event” at Resorts World, a sprawling hotel and casino complex in Las Vegas, where it would announce the date and venue of the first Enhanced Games. It was a day many of the doubters had thought would never come. If you'd asked me six months ago I would have agreed. But the changing political climate and Gkolomeev's record-breaking feats had changed what seemed possible.

The Vegas crowd during the Enhanced Games event.

In keeping with D'Souza's digital-first approach, the presentation was being streamed on YouTube, but there were about a hundred people gathered inside Zouk nightclub, where the VIPs seemed to outnumber the regular guests by about 4 to 1. There were burly men in suits that somehow managed to show off their arm muscles, several of whom turned out to be longevity doctors. I met Zoltan Istvan, a transhumanist who is running for governor of California. Enhanced staff—almost exclusively fit, young, and possibly enhanced men—buzzed around in branded black T-shirts. Peter Thiel's husband, Matt Danzeisen, was there with a delegation from Thiel Capital and a security detail so discreet that I didn't even notice they were there until someone told me afterward.

After a heavy-handed introduction—Greek statues crumbling, a solemn voice-over saying things like “we dream beyond what we were allowed to dream”—D'Souza took to the stage. He looked unusually nervous. The first Enhanced Games, he announced, would take place at Resorts World in Las Vegas on Memorial Day weekend in May 2026. If that was a bit anticlimactic—we were already sitting there, after all—what came next shocked the crowd. Angermayer got the honor of doing the Steve Jobs line—“one more thing”—as he introduced a clip of Gkolomeev breaking the 50-meter freestyle world record. There was a stunned silence in the room, followed by a round of applause. A guy near the front with a wrestler's physique and visible forehead veins rose to his feet in a standing ovation.

The Games had morphed from a libertarian Olympics into something smaller, safer—an exhibition with a few thousand in-person spectators. There will be a six-lane athletics track and a weightlifting arena. Gkolomeev and Magnussen will compete in the pool—with a more subtle enhancement program and the right suit, the Australian is sure he can break the record.

But maybe the event was never the point. All through my reporting I'd been struggling to understand what was in it for the investors—why billionaires with no interest in sport were so interested in disrupting it. Toward the end of the presentation in Vegas, it all clicked into place when D'Souza announced the launch of Enhanced Performance Products—a new line of supplements inspired by the ones athletes will be taking to prepare for the Games. This pill helped me run 100 meters in nine seconds, and now you can buy it too. The model isn't the Olympics or the World Cup. It's Red Bull.

“They buy sporting assets to sell an energy drink,” D'Souza told me. “That energy drink is 90 percent gross margin. They don't do the bottling or manufacturing, that's all done by outsourced service providers. And Red Bull is a multibillion-dollar company owned by two families. And so our business model is very similar.”

When I met D'Souza in his suite a few hours after the launch he was in a triumphant mood. He told me at least 20 new athletes had expressed interest, and “dozens” of people had signed up for the supplement line. He had received text messages from more than one royal. No matter that the livestream had, at the time of this reporting, a mere 4,000 views. The press had amplified that a thousand-fold. The sporting establishment had spent a year trying to ignore Enhanced, but in the following days USA Swimming sent a letter to athletes warning them against competing, and World Aquatics said athletes could still be banned for joining the Enhanced Games even if they competed clean. (Enhanced has always said drugs are optional for competing in the Games.) The World Anti Doping Agency is calling on the US authorities to shut down the Games. If it was all just marketing, he'd done a very good job.

D'Souza gestured out at Las Vegas—the hollow facade of the Sphere playing ads on an endless loop, the city conjured out of the desert, the parking lot soon to be transformed into the cradle of superhumanity. “In a year's time we're going to look out of that window and say wow—we built a track, we built a pool, we built a weightlifting arena, and we smashed a whole bunch of world records, and we did it safely and the world watched,” he said. In his mind, this moment was on par with the JFK speech that launched the space race—something to tell my grandchildren about. The dawn of the Enhanced Age.

Spectrum internet went down across L.A. thanks to vandals who didn't even find any copper


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Many households across Los Angeles were left without internet on Father's Day, after some would-be thieves attempted to strip copper from fiber optic cables. Internet provider Spectrum told The LA Times that cut lines in Van Nuys affected swaths of homes in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with the total number of affected residents unknown.

Internet customers, primarily concentrated northwest of Los Angeles proper near Burbank, were left waiting for service to return from midnight on Sunday morning until well into Monday morning, when repairs were completed. Spectrum reports that work crews needed to make thousands of splices to the fiber connections to restore service, a time-intensive process. Fusion splicing entire sheaths of fiber wire, done wire-by-wire, required calling out extra crews to the vandalism location.

In a bitter twist, the wire-slicers also didn't receive anything for their labor, as Spectrum's fiber-optic lines do not contain copper. After reportedly climbing trees and slicing into multiple lengths of wire looking for copper, the thieves were left fruitless. Those who committed the "criminal act of vandalism" have yet to be located by authorities.

The lack of copper does not mean the wires were not highly expensive, however. A Spectrum spokesperson shared that not just Spectrum, but the entire communications industry is experiencing increased repair expenses, "largely due to the increase in the price of precious metals. These acts of vandalism are not only a crime, but also affect our customers, local businesses, and potentially emergency services.”

The LA incident follows a nationwide uptick in would-be copper thieves chopping into fiber-optic and communications cables. While most phone lines still contain copper, fiber-optics are typically free of it, but take longer to repair, leaving some places with slower response times without internet for weeks post-fiber-vandalism.

Spectrum has pledged to credit customers in LA for the length of time they were without service. As precious metals increase in price, global tech markets are all beginning to feel the heat, with China recently increasing its rare earth exports to capitalize on high demand. And while we wait for truly wireless internet connections to homes, outages due to uneducated copper hunters may continue to increase.

Since their anesthetic effects were discovered approximately 180 years ago, inhalational anesthetics have been used for general anesthesia in surgical operations. However, the mechanism of their anesthetic has not been fully revealed yet. Previous studies have shown that inhalational anesthetics exert their anesthetic effects by acting on multiple proteins, but the presence of unknown target molecules has also been suggested.

In rare cases, patients with abnormal type 1 ryanodine receptors (RyR1) (RyR1 mutations) have been known to be at higher risk of malignant hyperthermia, which can be caused by inhalational anesthetics. However, the direct molecular interaction between inhalational anesthetics and RyR1 has not been clearly demonstrated, and the relationship between RyR1 and anesthetic effects has also been unknown.

In the present study, a research group led by Professor Hiroki Ueda of the Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, found that RyR1 which is a calcium release channel, induces general anesthesia by serving as a target molecule of inhalational anesthetics.

The research group first confirmed that isoflurane and other inhalational anesthetics activate RyR1 and stimulate calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. The amino acid residues in RyR1 which play an important role in the isoflurane-induced activation were identified, and the binding site of isoflurane was estimated. Additionally, the research group created a genetically modified mouse (knock-in mouse) which expressed the RyR1 mutant that does not respond to isoflurane. When the knock-in mice were exposed to isoflurane, they demonstrated a partially reduced sensitivity to anesthesia compared to normal mice.

Furthermore, new compounds that target the putative binding site of isoflurane were identified from in silico compound screening and were found to have sedative-like effects in mice. These results suggest that RyR1 is a functional target of isoflurane that is directly related to its anesthetic properties.

This research reveals one aspect of the molecular mechanism of inhalational anesthetics used for general anesthesia. This is a new finding as previous studies have not demonstrated the relationship between RyR1 and anesthetic effects in mammals. A more detailed understanding of anesthetics' mechanism of action could lead to the development of better anesthetics and treatment methods.
The results of this study were published in the online version of the American scientific journal PLOS Biology on June 3, 2025 (EDT).

This result was achieved in the Ueda Biological Timing Project, a research area of the Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO) by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). Under this project, JST pursues "systems biology for understanding humans" using the sleep-wake rhythm as a model system and aims to understand information on "biological time," which transcends from molecules to individual humans living in society.

Persistent sadness, fatigue, changes in sleep and appetite, or loss of interest are common symptoms in mothers suffering from perinatal depression. How do these symptoms evolve? A pioneering study followed the paths of mothers with this condition. It concluded that high sensitivity to internal and external stimuli can increase the risk of depression, while partner support during pregnancy has a protective effect.

The perinatal period is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the interval of time that begins at the 22nd week of pregnancy and ends 7 days after the infant is born. This period is marked by significant physiological and psychological changes, making it a difficult time for many women. Between 10% and 25% of women are vulnerable to perinatal depression, which can emerge during pregnancy and persist up to one year after childbirth. Persistent sadness, fatigue, changes in sleep and appetite, or loss of interest are common symptoms, with a significant impact on the emotional health of the mother and infant.

Although the symptoms of perinatal depression are well identified, there is less knowledge about how these symptoms evolve. To deepen this field, a study led by Maria Spinelli, with the support of the BIAL Foundation, was the first to track the perinatal depression trajectories at four different time points - in late pregnancy, and at 3, 6, and 9 months postpartum.

As part of this work, researchers from the G. d'Annunzio Chieti-Pescara University and the University of Pavia (Italy) carried out a longitudinal study with 88 mothers without a clinical diagnosis, exploring the roles of individual factors, such as SPS - Sensory Processing Sensitivity (which consists of greater awareness and reactivity to internal and external stimuli), and contextual factors, such as the global partner support.

In the article "Maternal depression during the perinatal period: the role of Sensory Processing Sensitivity and social support and its impact on infants' negative affect", published in the scientific journal Frontiers in Psychology, the researchers revealed that they had also examined the role of prenatal depression on infants' negative affect temperament as an early marker of emotional adjustment.

The results showed that mood declines immediately after giving birth, but tends to improve over time, with mothers with high sensitivity and less partner support being more vulnerable to negative feelings. High sensitivity can therefore increase the risk of depression, while partner support during pregnancy has a protective effect. The research also revealed that prenatal depression could influence the infant's emotional reactivity, particularly increasing their proneness to negative affect, acting as a prenatal stressor.

This study can help create support programmes for mothers, promoting better emotional adjustment for them and their infants".

Maria Spinelli

Given its significant impact, "partner participation should be an essential component of parenting programmes designed to nurture positive relationships from the very beginning of pregnancy, laying the foundations for supportive family dynamics and a healthier transition to parenthood", the researcher stresses.

As far as the mother-infant dyad is concerned, enhancing and promoting affective interactive touch in the postpartum period can improve the bond between the two, reducing stress, with benefits for both the mother's emotional state and the infant's emotional adjustment. "The positive role of tactile experience can serve as a basis for intervention programmes aimed at promoting safe and supportive relationships in early life", Spinelli points out.

A new research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) Volume 17, Issue 5, on May 1, 2025, titled "Oxytocin modulates insulin and GLP-1 secretion in pancreatic islets."

In this study, scientists from Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine investigated how the hormone oxytocin (Oxt) influences insulin levels by acting on specific cells in the pancreas. The team led by first author Kasumi Hattori and corresponding authors Kenju Shimomura and Yuko Maejima discovered that oxytocin may indirectly increase insulin secretion by triggering another hormone, GLP-1, from within the pancreas. This finding could lead to new strategies for improving blood sugar control in people with diabetes.

Oxytocin is commonly known for its roles in childbirth and social bonding, but scientists have also been exploring its effects on metabolism. While previous studies offered mixed results about whether oxytocin raises or lowers blood sugar, this research brings new clarity. The study focused on oxytocin's impact on insulin and a hormone called GLP-1, which helps regulate insulin production. Researchers tested this by using mice with and without oxytocin receptors and found that oxytocin's ability to raise insulin levels depended on the presence of these receptors and high blood sugar conditions.

Researchers found that oxytocin stimulates the release of "intra-islet GLP-1," a form of GLP-1 produced inside the pancreas rather than the intestine. In the pancreas, insulin is produced by beta cells, while alpha cells produce glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar. But recent research, including this study, has shown that alpha cells can also release GLP-1, which in turn helps beta cells secrete insulin. Oxytocin appears to increase this internal GLP-1 release, especially when blood sugar levels are high, thereby leading to insulin release in a natural and targeted way.

In this study researchers were also able to detect the difference between oxytocin's effect on blood sugar and its effect on insulin. They observed that right after oxytocin was given, blood sugar levels rose in all mice-even in those that lacked oxytocin receptors. However, only the mice with working oxytocin receptors showed a later increase in insulin. This suggests that oxytocin may trigger insulin production through a separate, receptor-dependent pathway involving the hormone GLP-1.

"WT mice showed a significant increase in insulin levels at 15-min, while OxtR KO mice did not."

This indirect action-oxytocin triggering alpha cells to release GLP-1, which then acts on beta cells-may represent a novel mechanism for controlling insulin release. It also explains why oxytocin does not increase insulin in low-glucose conditions, making it a potentially safer option for regulating blood sugar.

As treatments for type 2 diabetes increasingly focus on GLP-1–based drugs, this study opens the door to using oxytocin or similar compounds to naturally enhance the body's own insulin-producing system. With further research, this mechanism could help develop new therapies that better mimic the body's natural glucose control, particularly beneficial for older adults with diabetes.

The Calibr-Skaggs Institute for Innovative Medicines, the drug development division of Scripps Research, today announced a milestone in cancer treatment with the dosing of the first patient in a phase 1 trial (NCT06878248) evaluating CLBR001 + ABBV-461, a modular, switchable chimeric antigen receptor T cell (sCAR-T) therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have no suitable treatment options. This is the first study of the sCAR-T platform in solid tumors.

CAR-T therapy has been transformative for patients with hematological malignancies who failed numerous prior treatments. However, conventional CAR-T therapies have not yet been as successful at treating patients with solid tumors. This challenge is what Calibr-Skaggs' switchable CAR-T cell therapy platform was designed to address.

The sCAR-T platform developed by Calibr-Skaggs is designed to enhance the precision and safety of CAR-T therapies, and has demonstrated promising preliminary results in a phase 1 clinical trial for hematological malignancies. Additionally, initial results have demonstrated CLBR001 sCAR-T cells can expand in the body in significantly greater numbers than conventional CAR-T cells, affording a better chance of penetrating the hostile solid tumor microenvironment. And the switch offers an added advantage by allowing the cells to "rest," potentially avoiding CAR-T exhaustion.

There's a critical need to develop gene and cell therapy approaches that are able to recreate the success observed in blood cancers for patients with solid tumors like breast cancer. By integrating an antibody-based 'switch,' there's the potential to enhance the precision of targeting solid tumor cells, while also mitigating potential safety risks."

Travis Young, PhD, vice president of biology at Calibr-Skaggs

The clinical trial testing CLBR001 + ABBV-461 is now underway in the US. CLBR001 + ABBV-461 is being developed in collaboration with AbbVie.

A new lipid-based pathway essential for memory formation has been discovered by University of Queensland researchers – a breakthrough that could lead to treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Led by Professor Frédéric Meunier from UQ's Queensland Brain Institute, the team found a saturated fat called myristic acid is released by an enzyme, DDHD2, which is then used to chemically "tag" proteins where neurons connect and communicate with each other.

From our previous research we know myristic acid is essential to making memories stick.

In new this study, we found myristic acid hooks onto proteins and alters their membrane association, thereby driving memory formation.

Crucially, without this fat-tagging step, these proteins in dendritic spines can't do their job, and the neuron can't strengthen its connections."

Professor Frédéric Meunier from UQ's Queensland Brain Institute

Blocking this fat-signalling pathway in mice prevented the brain from undergoing these critical protein changes that occur during memory formation, providing strong evidence this process is essential to learning.

"This could mean we've found a way to temporarily interfere with how the brain stores memories," Professor Meunier said.

The National Study of Mental Health and Wellbeing 2020–2022 shows an estimated 11 per cent of Australians experience PTSD in their lifetime. 

Co-author Dr. Nathalie Dehorter said the discovery has significant implications for understanding brain plasticity and offers a potential therapeutic target for preventing the consolidation of traumatic memories.

"However, those clinical applications are still a long way off, and any approach to controlling memory would require careful ethical consideration,'' Dr Dehorter said.

The brain is the body's fattiest organ, with fatty compounds making up 60 per cent of its weight and this study further underscores the vital role that fats play in brain function.

The research was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Clem Jones Centre for Ageing Dementia Research and supported by UQ's Clinical Research Mass Spectrometry Facility and UQ's Biological Resources facility.

The research is published in The EMBO Journal.

Researchers estimate that about 32 million people globally live with Alzheimer's disease — a type of dementia that affects a person's ability to think, communicate, and remember. 

While there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, past studies show that certain lifestyle changes may help decrease a person's risk for the disease or slow down its progression. 

One of these main lifestyle changes is physical activity. A study published in April 2025 reported that increasing physical activity in middle age may help protect the brain from Alzheimer's disease. A study published in May 2025 says older adults who sit less may lower their risk for the condition. 

Now, a new study recently published in the journal Nature Neuroscience sheds light on how physical activity helps protect the brain from Alzheimer's disease on a cellular level. 

Scientists believe these findings may one day lead to new prevention and treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease. 

For this study, researchers used a technique called single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). 

“Single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is a technique that allows (us to) analyze gene activity by examining the RNA inside on a cell by cell level, giving us precise information about the activation state of each and every single cell in the tissue examined,” Christiane D. Wrann, DVM, PhD, a neuroscientist and leader of the Program in Neuroprotection in Exercise at the Mass General Brigham Heart and Vascular Institute and the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital, and senior author of this study, explained to Medical News Today. 

“We used this sophisticated technology to examine how exercise reshapes [the] brain in an important region in the brain of mouse models for Alzheimer's disease,” Wrann added. 

Scientists focused on the hippocampus of the brain, which is responsible for making new memories and keeping old ones, as well as processing emotions and learning new information. 

Using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease — that were later verified in human Alzheimer's disease brain tissue samples — researchers found that exercise changed activity in the hippocampus' immune cells called microglia, as well as a specific type of neurovascular-associated astrocyte (NVA).

NVAs are cells associated with the brain's blood vessels that help make sure the brain receives enough oxygen and is an important part of the blood-brain barrier. 

“[Our findings mean] that exercise can remodel these important cell types on the transcriptional/gene expression level, which likely increases their neuroprotective properties. “It [is] one example, how on the molecular level exercise can improve brain cells in Alzheimer's disease, hopefully rendering them more functionally.” — Christiane D. Wrann, DVM, PhD

Additionally, Wrann and her team pinpointed a metabolic gene called ATPIF1 as an important regulator to create new neurons in the brain.

“ATPIF1 is a mitochondrial protein that regulates cellular energy production AKA — a gene that regulates energy metabolism,” Wrann detailed. “Research has shown that stimulating neurogenesis can protect against cognitive decline in aging or Alzheimer's disease. In our study, we show that ATPIF1 is an important regulator of neurogenesis.”

“Exercise is important for your brain health — please keep exercising to protect your brain,” she continued. “Alzheimer's disease is incurable at the moment. There are smart and dedicated scientists working on finding innovative treatment options.” 

“This work not only sheds light on how exercise benefits the brain but also uncovers potential cell-specific targets for future Alzheimer's therapies,” Nathan Tucker, PhD, a biostatistician at SUNY Upstate Medical University and co-senior of the study said in a press release. “Our study offers a valuable resource for the scientific community investigating Alzheimer's prevention and treatment.”

MNT also had the opportunity to speak with Gary Small, MD, chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this study. 

Small commented that this study's findings are consistent with the well-documented link between physical activity and brain health, including its role in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's and of slowing its progression in people who already suffer from the disease. 

“While the basic conclusion that exercise is important to brain health is not new, these new findings showing the impact of physical activity on key brain cells such as microglia and neurovascular-associated astrocytes provide a more nuanced and deeper understanding why the brain responds to exercise,” he explained. 

“Astrocytes and microglia play a crucial role in both initiating and regulating the inflammatory response. Thus, these results further elucidate the link between heightened brain inflammation and cognitive decline,” he said. 

“Brain health has a strong influence on our quality of life. Cognitive decline affects not just the physical and behavioral health of the patient, but also has an impact on their caregivers and all who care about the person. The bottom line is that dementia and Alzheimer's disease are not inevitable parts of aging. We can take steps to reduce the risk through lifestyle habits. And even for those who develop the disease, making changes in diet, physical activity, and stress management can slow the progression and extend the time when a person can enjoy a fulfilling quality of life.” — Gary Small, MD

“The more we understand how cognitive decline occurs, and what can change the course of its development and progression, the more opportunities there are to find ways to treat it,” Small added.

Electronic cigarettes, or vapes, are widely used and available in hundreds of different types and flavors, yet researchers lack information about the everyday e-cigarette habits of young adults. The National Institutes of Health, in partnership with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has funded a University of Oklahoma study that will investigate how, when and why young adults use e-cigarettes and how that use may relate to health risks. The results will help the FDA make decisions about regulating the makers of e-cigarette products.

Emily Hébert, a member of the TSET Health Promotion Research Center at OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center and an assistant professor of family and preventive medicine in the OU College of Medicine, earned the $3.1 million, five-year NIH grant to conduct the study, which will begin enrolling young adults this fall. The study is a novel departure from the surveys that have been used to conduct such research in the past. Rather than relying on a person to remember their vaping habits over the past month, Hébert and her team will check in with study participants daily via a smartphone platform. Called ecological momentary assessment, the technique is designed to capture young adults' routines and motivations in the moment.

Surveys typically ask about average behavior, and they are subject to recall bias. We needed a different methodology to understand exactly which product characteristics are associated with which use patterns. What we want to know is, are there certain characteristics – like candy flavors or nicotine concentrations – that may carry higher public health risks or appeal disproportionately to youth, which is important for the FDA to know."

Study participants will be prompted for input multiple times daily for a month, then again in six months, in five different waves, helping researchers gather both short-term and long-term data. Hébert said researchers will ask about the types of products being used, what participants' moods are like, whether they're alone or with friends, whether they're also using other products like cannabis or traditional cigarettes, and if they have symptoms like respiratory problems.

In pilot studies, Hébert said she found that many young adults use multiple vaping products over the course of a month, not necessarily showing loyalty to a particular brand – and there are hundreds of different products to choose from, which can be purchased in person and online.

"Because we are collecting data so often, we can quickly monitor any market changes," she said. "Study participants can also upload pictures so we can see exactly what type of product they're using."

Understanding young adults' frequency of e-cigarette use is also important, Hébert said. Existing research shows that many young adults use e-cigarettes all day long.

"If people are using e-cigarettes to quit traditional cigarettes or are vaping just once or twice a day, we want to know that, but that's not necessarily what we're seeing," Hébert said. "We're seeing many young adults who have never smoked initiating e-cigarette use and, in some cases, reporting frequent use that may indicate early signs of dependence. Like other common substances, such as caffeine, frequency and intensity of use matter. Heavy use may indicate risk that warrants further investigation."

The FDA has approved approximately 30 e-cigarettes to be marketed in the United States, all either tobacco- or menthol-flavored. These authorizations are based on evidence that the products are suitable for protecting public health, taking into account factors such as youth appeal, addiction potential, and the likelihood of helping smokers transition away from combustible cigarettes, Hébert said. However, hundreds of other e-cigarette products remain on the market without FDA authorization. While enforcement is challenging, Hébert's study may shed light on the extent to which these unauthorized products are being used by young adults.

Hébert said she is excited to get started on her study because it offers the potential to gather information previously unavailable to the FDA.

"Young adults are comfortable using smartphones to communicate, and we anticipate getting rich, real-time data," she said. "This is a fulfilling type of research because your findings can lead to changes in policy. It is a unique area of tobacco regulatory science."

Could your diet help control IBD flares? New Dutch research uncovers the hidden food compounds that may tip the balance between remission and relapse.

Study: Food Compounds Associated With Disease Activity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Image Credit: Food Photo Master / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, researchers in the Netherlands identified food compounds linked to disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Food is vital in health and disease, including IBD. However, there is no consistent evidence that a well-defined diet can modulate the disease course in IBD. The commonalities among the most studied diets include avoiding processed and canned foods and promoting the intake of vegetables, fruits, chicken, and lean meat.

Nevertheless, the diverse nutritional recommendations and approaches about specific foods make comparing studies difficult. For instance, the Mediterranean and Groningen anti-inflammatory diets encourage wheat intake, whereas most IBD diets exclude wheat. Studies on IBD and diet have primarily assessed food groups or select nutrients.

While these studies have been valuable, food contains a large number of different compounds. Each compound is unique and may have specific health effects alone or in combination with others. As such, research on food compounds offers more comprehensive insights into the effects of individual food compounds or their combinations.

In the present study, researchers evaluated whether specific food compounds and their combinations are associated with disease activity in IBD patients. They obtained dietary and disease status data from patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease at a university medical center in the Netherlands. Patients were stratified into the flare or remission group based on whether they experienced flares or remained in remission during follow-up, respectively.

Flares were defined as active IBD-related hospitalization or surgery, step-up in medication, or endoscopy revealing active disease. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) adapted for individuals with IBD was administered at baseline. The authors previously linked two food compounds databases (Phenol-Explorer and FooDB) to NEVO, the Dutch food coding system, generating an integrated database with concentration values of 1,160 compounds, of which 768 were analyzed in this study (those consumed by at least 80% of participants).

Using this database and FFQ data, dietary data of IBD patients were translated into intake levels of food compounds. A random forest analysis was performed to explore compounds associated with remission and flares. Compounds contributing the most to the random forest were assessed for potential biological relevance by examining literature on gut health, IBD, or immunomodulation.

Overall, the study included 135 patients aged 19-68, who were in endoscopic or clinical remission at baseline. A disease flare occurred in 41 patients during a median follow-up of 29 months. The median time from baseline to relapse was 14 months. The median body mass index (BMI) was 23 kg/m2 for the flare group and 25 kg/m2 for the remission group. The random forest analysis was applied to the intake values of 768 food compounds.

Among the random forest models, those based on up to 75 food compounds showed optimal performance overall. Models performed particularly well in remission prediction, with negative predictive values and specificities up to 79% and 77%, respectively. Overall, 35 compounds, henceforth “selected compounds,” contributed the most to the random forest.

Of these, 25 were fatty acids, including short-chain, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, saturated, and unsaturated fatty acids. The remainder were ethanol, cellobiose, vanillin, kaempferol-3-glucoside, haem iron, molybdenum, acetylglycine, kaempferol-3-O-acetyl-glucoside, 4-hydroxyproline, and heptadecanoyl carnitine.

Among the 29 compounds with increased intakes in the remission group, butyric acid, capric acid, 4-hydroxyproline, and trans- and cis-linoleic acid reportedly attenuated inflammation in IBD, augmented barrier function, were gastroprotective, or were associated with a lower IBD risk. However, some findings appeared contradictory; for example, palmitic acid and myristic acid, which were also higher in the remission group, have previously been reported to impair intestinal integrity and increase the risk of flare.

Immunomodulatory effects were identified for 11 compounds, while 13 compounds lacked relevant literature regarding their impact on gut health, IBD, or the immune system. Among the six compounds with increased intake levels in the flare group, molybdenum might promote dysbiosis and aggravate colitis.

Conversely, cellobiose and kaempferol-3-glucoside have been reported to attenuate experimental colitis in mice. Suspected immunomodulatory effects were found for trans-11-docosenoic acid. The remaining two compounds had inconsistent or no data on the effects on the immune system, gut health, or IBD.

In sum, the random forest models based on up to 75 compounds achieved optimal performance. Fatty acids were the compounds that contributed the most to the models.

The contribution to the model by a compound may stem from a biologically relevant difference in intake between flare and remission groups. For some compounds, however, this may also be due to coincidence or co-occurrence in the diet with other compounds that have biological effects. This may help explain some of the contradictory findings.

The study also highlights the importance of considering "reverse causation," where the disease itself influences dietary choices. For instance, patients who experience frequent flares might strictly avoid fatty dairy products. While this may help alleviate symptoms, it could also unintentionally reduce their intake of beneficial fatty acids, such as butyric acid, potentially worsening their condition over time. This complexity is revealed by the compound-level analysis; the study noted that while patients in remission ate less dairy overall, their intake of specific beneficial fatty acids from sources like fatty butter and cheese was actually higher.

The analytic approach used in this study may also help uncover diet-disease relationships in other chronic conditions.

Further research is needed to clarify these associations and validate their biological significance.

Cannabis use is linked to a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, with significantly heightened risks of having a stroke or acute coronary syndrome-sudden reduced or blocked blood flow to the heart-finds a pooled analysis of real world data, published online in the journal Heart.

The authors of a linked editorial call for the drug to be treated like tobacco-not criminalized, but actively discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand vapour inhalation.

The use of cannabis and cannabinoids has soared over the past decade, note the researchers. Legalising cannabis in certain jurisdictions and expanding its use for medicinal purposes has probably changed people's risk perceptions of the drug and helped drive its growing popularity, they suggest.

While previously published studies have linked cannabis use to cardiovascular problems, the magnitude of the risk hasn't been clear. This is an important gap in light of the recent major changes in consumption and the increased potency of the drug, they add.

To strengthen the evidence base, therefore, the researchers scoured research databases looking for large observational studies, published between January 2016 and December 2023, which explored cannabis use and serious cardiovascular outcomes: cardiovascular disease death; and non-fatal acute coronary syndrome to include heart attack and stroke.

From an initial haul of 3012 articles, 24, involving around 200 million people, were included in a pooled data analysis of the results: 17 cross-sectional studies, 6 cohort studies, and 1 case-control study.

Study participants were mostly aged between 19 and 59. And in those studies where sex was recorded, cannabis users tended to be mostly male and younger than non-users.

The analysis revealed heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome; 20% higher for stroke; and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The researchers acknowledge that there was a moderate to high risk of bias in most of the included studies, largely because of lack of information on missing data and imprecise measures of cannabis exposure. And most of the included studies were observational, precluding the ability to draw causal inferences from the data. Several used the same data.

Notwithstanding these caveats, the researchers say that theirs is an exhaustive analysis of published data on the potential association between cannabis use and major cardiovascular disease and provides new insights from real-world data.

In a linked editorial, Emeritus Professor Stanton Glantz of the University of California at San Francisco and Dr Lynn Silver of the Public Health Institute, Oakland, California, and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California at San Francisco, say the study "raises serious questions about the assumption that cannabis imposes little cardiovascular risk."

More research is clearly needed to clarify whether cardiovascular risks are limited to inhaled products or extend to other forms of cannabis exposure, they suggest. Cannabis is now generally more potent and has diversified into a wide array of inhaled high potency cannabis concentrates, synthetic psychoactive cannabinoids, and edibles, they point out. 

"How these changes affect cardiovascular risk requires clarification, as does the proportion of risk attributable to cannabinoids themselves versus particulate matter, terpenes or other components of the exposure," they say.

They conclude: "Cannabis needs to be incorporated into the framework for prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease. So too must cardiovascular disease prevention be incorporated into the regulation of cannabis markets. Effective product warnings and education on risks must be developed, required, and implemented. 

"Cardiovascular and other health risks must be considered in the regulation of allowable product and marketing design as the evidence base grows. Today that regulation is focused on establishing the legal market with woeful neglect of minimising health risks. 

"Specifically, cannabis should be treated like tobacco: not criminalized, but discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand exposure."

A new study from The University of Texas at Arlington reveals that people who live in rural areas are more likely to have chronic pain than those in urban settings. They're also more likely to go from having no pain or occasional pain to chronic pain. The findings may help explain higher opioid prescription rates in rural communities and could guide future research into the root causes of this disparity.

"We already know about the rural-urban gap in mortality and life expectancy," said Feinuo Sun, UT Arlington assistant professor of kinesiology and lead author of the study in The Journal of Rural Health. "But when you look at pain, especially chronic pain, it becomes clear that rural residents face additional burdens."

Chronic pain has been previously linked to higher risks of disability and mortality and contributes to increased health care costs-an estimated $261 billion and $300 billion annually in the U.S. One key takeaway from Dr. Sun's study is the importance of timely intervention for middle-aged adults in rural communities as they are among the most vulnerable to developing chronic pain.

Without early intervention, it can have serious long-term consequences, including premature mortality. That's why targeted outreach and early pain management strategies are so important."

Feinuo Sun, UT Arlington assistant professor of kinesiology and lead author of the study

In her research, Sun, who has expertise in demography and population health, uses national data and a spatial analysis approach-a way of mapping how factors like health care services, job types and regional economic conditions shape health outcomes depending on where people live. In a 2024 study she authored, she found that rural residents expect to live more years with chronic pain than suburban and urban residents.

Sun's latest findings suggest the chronic pain disparities are not solely due to limited access to health care in rural communities. Rural residents are more likely to work physically demanding jobs and experience higher poverty rates, both of which contribute to chronic pain. Elevated pain levels, along with fewer treatment options, may help explain the heavier reliance on opioids in these communities.

Sun's research seeks to distinguish the root causes for higher opioid demand in rural areas.

"The goal for future research is to understand the causes of these disparities and to examine how differences in pain treatment between rural and urban areas contribute to the overall pain gap," she said.

A clinical trial involving adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has found a combination therapy may reduce chronic kidney disease and improve health outcomes. The findings could help guide more precision care for young people with T1D. 

Led by Dr. Farid Mahmud, Associate Scientist in the Translational Medicine program and Staff Physician in the Division of Endocrinology, at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and published in Nature Medicine, the study evaluated a therapy that combines standard insulin treatment with the investigational drug dapagliflozin. Results of this combination therapy showed improved blood sugar control and kidney function, and reduced weight gain in adolescents with T1D. 

T1D is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar levels. While most people with T1D are diagnosed as adults, the condition often starts in childhood and early adolescence. 

T1D requires insulin therapy throughout a person's life, which can lead to side effects such as weight gain and chronic kidney disease. In the trial, participants who received dapagliflozin alongside insulin had fewer of these side effects and better overall health outcomes. 

Our findings showed that adolescents who received this combination therapy were able to improve many symptoms typically associated with insulin-managed type one diabetes. This could inform a new early intervention strategy for the growing population of teenagers with type one diabetes." 

Dr. Farid Mahmud, Associate Scientist in the Translational Medicine program and Staff Physician, Division of Endocrinology, SickKids

While previous research has shown similar results in adults, Mahmud's team focused on designing a clinical trial specifically for teenagers, a group often underrepresented in clinical trials. Hormonal changes, psychological development, and the shared responsibility between teens and their parents for managing treatment protocols can make trial participation more complex for this age group. 

To address these challenges, the research team worked closely with patient partner Lynne McArthur. Together, they enrolled 98 participants between 12 and 18 years old in the study, known as the ATTEMPT study, across three sites. 

McArthur's involvement in research began when one of her twin sons was diagnosed with T1D following a trip to the SickKids emergency department at just 18 months old. A few years later, his twin was also diagnosed. That experience led McArthur to become more involved in research efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment options for families like hers. 

Now that her sons are older, McArthur continues to be involved as a patient advisor. She reviews recruitment materials and provides feedback on trial design, helping ensure the research stays connected to the lived experience of people managing T1D. 

"Participating in research, whether in a trial or as an advisor, is hugely rewarding. With my experience as trial participant, I can see how the plans on paper would impact the real lives of people living with diabetes," explains McArthur. 

The trial provides a valuable foundation for future research into precision medicine for children and adolescents with T1D. One of those opportunities is the Empowering diVERse Youth with diabetes thrOugh precisioN mEdicine, or 'EVERYONE', study, which builds on this approach by focusing on how individual factors influence treatment response. 

Aligned with Precision Child Health, a movement to individualize care for patients and families at SickKids, the EVERYONE study will explore how a youth's unique characteristics such as their insulin sensitivity, immune response, metabolism, genetics and social health impact how they respond to insulin treatment. By understanding these differences between patients, the team hopes to one day inform tailored treatments to optimize outcomes for youth with T1D. 

"This is opening exciting new treatment opportunities for youth with type one diabetes," says Mahmud, who is also an Associate Professor in the Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Medical Science at the University of Toronto. "We're giving them options that are grounded in science and designed to help them thrive throughout their lives." 

This study was funded by Breakthrough T1D (formerly known as Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, JDRF) and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Strategies for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR).

A record-breaking measles outbreak concentrated in Texas and New Mexico reveals the consequences of falling MMR vaccination rates and signals the urgent need to rebuild trust in public health before eradicated diseases return for good.

In a recent perspective piece published in the journal New Microbes and New Infections, researchers described the current state of measles outbreaks, with a focus on the United States, and highlighted risk factors for the disease, as well as recommendations for public health policy and clinical practice.

Without immediate action by policymakers and medical professionals, many communities could be at risk of severe disease outbreaks, leading to the return of endemic measles transmission across the U.S.

The Centers for Disease Control had reported 884 cases of measles across the U.S. by April 2025, with 11 outbreaks spanning 29 states. Texas was the hardest hit, reporting 646 cases, while New Mexico reported 65.

Most infections are clustered along the border shared by Western Texas and Southern New Mexico, accounting for over 90% of Texas cases and nearly all New Mexico cases. Gaines County in Texas has 393 cases, accounting for more than any individual state, and saw two child deaths, both unvaccinated, with one child from the local Mennonite community. Both children died in Lubbock. A third fatality, an unvaccinated adult, occurred in Lea County.

During the pandemic, parents stayed home, and doctors focused on COVID-19, causing many children to miss routine vaccinations, a gap that still hasn't been closed.

These figures marked the highest measles numbers the U.S. had seen since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. Previous spikes were far lower, with 667 cases in 2014 during the “Disneyland Outbreak” in California or 1,274 in 2019 among New York Orthodox Jewish communities. Alarmingly, 2025 numbers nearly surpassed the 2019 total within just a few months.

As of the latest CDC update, the U.S. has now reported 1,197 measles cases, just 77 cases short of the 2019 total, which had been the highest since the national elimination of measles was declared in 2000. Measles activity has now been confirmed in 35 states, up from 34 the previous week, likely reflecting Arizona's first reported cases of the year. Four new outbreaks were reported, bringing the total to 21 nationwide, compared to just 16 outbreaks in all of 2024. Notably, 90% of this year's measles cases have occurred as part of outbreaks, a rise from 69% last year, indicating the expansion of clusters of sustained transmission.

Internationally, measles cases have also been surging.

Europe is experiencing record levels, particularly in Kazakhstan and Romania. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has reported that, in the 12 months from April 2023 to March 2024, there were 56,634 measles cases across 41 countries. Five countries, Kazakhstan, Romania, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, and the Russian Federation, accounted for 85% of all cases. Alarmingly, 11 countries reported more than 100 cases per million population, far exceeding the World Health Organization's (WHO) threshold for measles elimination. Hospitalization was required in 71% of reported cases, and five measles-related deaths were documented. This escalation highlights immunity gaps and declining vaccination coverage in parts of the region, posing challenges to achieving elimination goals.

Africa remains heavily affected, with no country achieving elimination. These patterns highlight the growing global hesitancy towards vaccines.

Measles' immune amnesia has a hidden long-term cost: It can increase the risk of death from other infections like tuberculosis for up to two years, especially in regions with high infectious disease burdens.

The current surge in American measles cases is not driven by immigration but by declining vaccination coverage and domestic transmission. Most cases originate from American residents who traveled abroad and returned infected.

Because measles is extremely contagious, around 95% of the population should have immunity to prevent outbreaks, but national vaccination rates fall short. In 2023, less than 93% of children had two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and coverage is even lower in certain communities.

These estimates also exclude some undocumented and homeschooled children, who are less likely to receive vaccines, leaving numerous unprotected clusters. This year, 97% of measles cases occurred in individuals who were not vaccinated.

One example is Gaines County in Texas, which has the state's lowest vaccination rates and the highest number of cases. A major factor is the Mennonite community in the Old Colony, which maintains conservative traditions, resists assimilation, and has low access to healthcare and public health messaging, partly due to language barriers. This group is distinct from the Mennonite Church of America and typically speaks a Low German dialect. Although their doctrine does not explicitly prohibit vaccinations, cultural conservatism and historical exclusion from public health initiatives contribute to under-vaccination.

Their low vaccination rates mirror other under-vaccinated groups like New York Orthodox Jews, the Ohio Amish, and clusters in California, each of which has faced recent outbreaks.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted routine vaccinations and amplified public skepticism about all vaccines. Even after pandemic restrictions were lifted, MMR vaccine uptake has continued to decline, fueled by political polarization and growing far-right ideologies that promote distrust of science and public health.

This trend aligns with global patterns; worldwide MMR vaccination rates fell to a 20-year low in 2021 and remain below target levels.

Additionally, rising anti-immigration sentiment affects healthcare access for undocumented immigrants, who face barriers like cost, fears of deportation, and language obstacles.

Texas, with the second-largest undocumented population, risks expanding vulnerable groups. Ensuring equitable vaccination is vital for protecting public health and maintaining herd immunity.

Getting to 'yes' on vaccines takes time and empathy: Parents often need multiple non-pressured conversations to move from hesitation to acceptance, as pushing too hard can backfire.

Measles poses significant risks mainly due to its serious complications, including pneumonia and brain inflammation, which can be fatal.

Measles also weakens the immune system, leaving individuals more vulnerable to other infections for up to two years afterward. This “immune amnesia” may raise death rates beyond the initial illness, especially in areas with other widespread diseases, underscoring the urgency for sustained and comprehensive prevention strategies.

Healthcare providers, particularly primary care physicians, play a crucial role in increasing vaccination rates. They must engage parents in ongoing, respectful conversations, addressing fears and misinformation without judgment.

Children should receive routine MMR vaccines at 12 and 60 months of age, with early or accelerated doses administered when the exposure risk is high.

Refusing care to families who decline vaccines is not proven effective; instead, repeated, empathetic discussions can gradually change minds.

Public health efforts must also address the cultural, religious, and political influences behind vaccine hesitancy. Successful campaigns must consider community beliefs, as shown by an effective faith-led vaccination drive in India. This approach can inform local outreach efforts, such as those in Gaines County, where religious communities have low vaccination rates.

Without more decisive local and global action, communities remain vulnerable to measles and other preventable diseases, raising concerns about the possible return of endemic measles in the United States. The authors describe measles as a “canary in the coalmine,” signaling broader population vulnerability to vaccine-preventable diseases.

A new meta-analysis shows that even modest increases in ultra-processed food intake can drive up type 2 diabetes risk, especially when consumption exceeds 300 grams per day.

Study: Ultra-Processed Food Intake and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies. Image Credit: rafa jodar / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Diabetes and Metabolism Journal, researchers investigated the associations between ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

UPFs are industrial formulations made from fractions of whole foods, often modified and enhanced with food additives. UPFs are typically energy-dense, rich in sugar, sodium, and fat, and low in fiber. As such, UPF intake could lead to poor diet quality and excess energy intake, contributing to higher risks of obesity and other diseases. High UPF consumption may also impair insulin signaling and increase the risk of T2D. Food additives in UPFs, such as artificial sweeteners and emulsifiers, may also contribute by disrupting gut microbiota and promoting insulin resistance.

Processed meats showed the strongest diabetes link among UPF subgroups—34% higher risk per serving, outpacing sugary drinks and other categories.

In the present study, researchers meta-analyzed the relationship between UPF intake and T2D risk. First, they identified studies from PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases, using relevant search terms. This meta-analysis was limited to prospective studies that reported relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the associations between T2D risk and UPF intake. Studies not following the Nova classification (of food groups) were excluded.

The following data were extracted from eligible studies: sample size, age, follow-up duration, dietary assessment methods, exposure range, covariates, relative risks (RRs), and timing of UPF assessment, among other variables. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria were used to assess the risk of bias and the level of evidence, respectively. DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models were used for the meta-analysis comparing the highest versus the lowest UPF intake and individual UPF subgroups.

Further, non-linear and linear dose-response meta-analyses were performed for different UPF units (serving/day, absolute grams (g)/day, and percentage of g/day), using the two-stage random-effects model with restricted cubic splines and the two-stage generalized least squares trend estimation method, respectively. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test and funnel plots.

Sensitivity analyses were performed by sequentially excluding each study from the meta-analysis to evaluate the robustness of the findings. Heterogeneity was examined using the I-squared statistic and Cochran's Q test. Further, subgroup analyses were performed on methodological characteristics and potential effect modifiers to identify the sources of heterogeneity.

Whole grains in ultra-processed cereals likely drove their unexpected protective effect, highlighting that not all industrial foods share identical risks.

Overall, the study included 10 publications across 12 prospective cohort studies. Most studies were conducted in Europe (five) and North America (four). Seven publications were of high quality, while three had moderate quality. The meta-analysis of the highest vs. lowest UPF intake categories included 38,308 cases of diabetes from over 714,000 participants.

The summary RR was 1.48 for T2D risk, with moderate-to-high heterogeneity. Despite the heterogeneity in RR magnitude across studies, a consistent positive association was observed. No publication bias was noted. Among studies that reported associations for individual UPF subgroups, sugar- and artificially sweetened beverages, as well as processed meats, were positively associated with T2D risk.

Conversely, packaged sweet snacks and desserts, as well as packaged savory snacks and ultra-processed cereals and breads, were reported as inversely associated, although the inverse association for sweet snacks and desserts was not statistically significant (RR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–1.00). These inverse associations may be partly explained by factors such as flavanol content in chocolate-based products or the inclusion of whole-grain breads within the cereal subgroup.

In subgroup analyses by region, higher summary RRs were observed for European and North American studies compared to studies from other regions. This regional variation may be linked to higher intake of processed meats in Western populations, which was the UPF subgroup most strongly associated with T2D. The summary RRs for the highest versus the lowest UPF intake categories were comparable across studies using different UPF units.

Asian and South American populations showed milder UPF-diabetes links than Westerners, likely due to different dietary patterns and smaller portion sizes.

Eight studies reported associations using the percentage of g/day as the unit of UPF intake. Each 10% g/day increment in UPF intake was significantly associated with a 14% higher risk of T2D, with no evidence of non-linearity. Four studies used absolute g/day as the unit of UPF intake. Each 100 g/day increase in UPF intake was associated with a 5% increased risk of T2D.

A non-linear relationship was observed only for absolute g/day intake, with a steeper increase in risk at intake levels exceeding 300 g/day. Likewise, four studies used servings per day as the unit of UPF intake. A one-serving-per-day increment in UPF intake significantly elevated the risk of T2D by 4%, and this association was linear.

Further, results remained robust in sensitivity analyses that excluded one study at a time.

In summary, the meta-analysis revealed a positive association between UPF intake and T2D risk. Higher UPF consumption was associated with a 48% increased risk of T2D. The association remained statistically significant after adjusting for body mass index (BMI), though the effect was partially attenuated, suggesting BMI may mediate part of the relationship.

The associations also held after adjustment for diet quality and total energy intake, suggesting an independent effect. A non-linear relationship was observed specifically for absolute g/day intake, with a steeper increase in T2D risk at intake levels exceeding 300 g/day of UPF. Given the growing surge in UPF intake, more efforts are needed to decrease UPF consumption by increasing access to minimally processed or unprocessed foods.

          / AP
        

An animal-rights activist ran onto the field during a Club World Cup match between Manchester City and Wydad at Lincoln Financial Field on Wednesday, urging Morocco to reform its treatment of stray animals.

The man wore a shirt that read, "Morocco, end the stray dog massacre," and carried a sign that read, "Morocco: stop shooting dogs and cats." He ran for a few seconds before he was tackled by security workers and escorted out of the stadium.

The protester's shirt and sign included the logo of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

Wydad is based in Casablanca, Morocco. PETA has been critical of the Moroccan government for its treatment of stray cats and dogs.

Morocco is among the hosts of the 2030 World Cup. The government has expanded a "Trap, Neuter, Vaccinate and Return" program for stray animals, but activists have claimed that animals are being killed rather than neutered.

Following the backlash over the lack of anti-racism and anti-discrimination signage at the 2025 Club World Cup, FIFA played its "No To Racism" video at Hard Rock Stadium on Wednesday.

Thirty minutes before the Group H opener between Real Madrid and Al Hilal, the video package featuring the likes of Vinicius Jr., Sergio Ramos, Edinson Cavani and Pep Guardiola was shown on the big screen.

FIFA had originally raised questions from fans after a lack of use of any of its anti-racism and anti-discrimination videos, signage and marketing assets prior to Wednesday's Club World Cup match. In the first days of this year's club competition, the only visible signage has been "Football Unites the World" on captains' armbands and a "Be Active" dance cam in partnership with the World Health Organization.

The competition began across the U.S. this week, but the global soccer governing body had not previously used the platform to challenge all forms of discrimination, as they have formerly done across all competitions. The Athletic's Adam Crafton reported that FIFA developed anti-racism and anti-discrimination campaign materials for the tournament, but they had not been seen in the opening matches.

The campaigns have been quiet on social media since the competition started as well. FIFA has also not made its anti-racism protocol announcements in stadiums or performed the "universal anti-racism" gesture, which was to be applied to all competitions after its initial announcement in September.

During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, FIFA heavily advocated for inclusion in several avenues, including captains' armbands, in-stadium announcements and on-screen at game venues.

At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA kept several teams from wearing "OneLove" armbands as it was said to challenge homophobia, while the host nation criminalized same-sex marriage. Among the slogans permitted during the World Cup were: No Discrimination, Save the Planet, Protect Children, End Hunger, Education for All and Be Active.

The questions surrounding the lack of messaging come as FIFA president Gianni Infantino developed a relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. Infantino attended a pre-inauguration rally, was at Trump's inauguration and brought the Club World Cup trophy to the Oval Office during a White House visit.

According to The Athletic, FIFA did not respond when asked if its decision to avoid anti-discrimination messaging previously was influenced by the political climate in the United States, which has experienced nationwide rallies combating mass deportation. The association referred to its statutes, which state that FIFA will "remain neutral in matters of politics."

In May, Infantino called for policymakers and global legislators to impose criminal policies on those violating FIFA's anti-racism and anti-discrimination efforts.

"FIFA's Global Stand Against Racism called for the football world to take action, to educate, to raise awareness and, when necessary, to punish," Infantino said. "Racism and discrimination — they are not just wrong, they are crimes."

A FIFA spokesperson told The Athletic, "FIFA has a firm, zero-tolerance stance against all forms of discrimination and racism.

"This commitment was recently reinforced through the unanimous approval by the FIFA Council of the revised FIFA Disciplinary Code, which introduces new measures to fight racist abuse — including increased minimum bans for racist incidents and enhanced financial penalties as duly informed to the 75th FIFA Congress in Asuncion in May 2025."

The spokesperson added that FIFA's "three-step anti-discrimination procedure" will be implemented if incidents occur during the Club World Cup.

FIFA is set to hold the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer.

Club World Cup

live

Updated 50m ago

Manchester City have kicked off their Club World Cup title defence with a victory thanks to goals from Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku.

The two City forwards scored in the first half and the Premier League side comfortably closed it out in the second. They did, however, finish with 10 men after Rico Lewis was contentiously sent off in the 88th minute.

The other game in Group G sees Juventus face Al Ain later today.

Now he has had a bit of time to cool off, Pep Guardiola is smiling in his interview with DAZN, but he was not a happy man at full time as he spoke to the referee following Rico Lewis' sending off. 

Here's what he had to say: “That's why the first game of a group phase is always tricky. We play a team like them who have momentum and in certain moments we did really well. It was the first step and we will learn from here.

“Rico has never had any intention to do it it, it doesn't matter, it is what it is. Phil will be important (next season). He has another role, we have a lot of No. 10s so we will adjust things, step by step.

“The season is too long, it's 11 months. It's important to be here, it's a lot of humidity, it's hot.”

It's hard to know what to expect when two teams who have never faced each other before match up for the first time, as has been the case fairly often so far at the Club World Cup.

But that was an intriguing match from both sides. Job done for City — not without a bit of huffing and puffing to get past Wydad — and an encouraging performance from the Moroccan side. 

They did their bit to make sure that was not easy for City and could easily have got on the score sheet for the chances they had. That's their challenge in their next game.

How long have you been thinking about this, City fans?

Pep Guardiola will be dreaming of a full force Rodri in his side as soon as possible...

A relatively comfortable win for Manchester City, despite the odd threat from Wydad on the counter-attack. 

There were a couple of times when I looked up and thought, “Oh, they've brought John Stones on” — and no, it was Vitor Reis. 

That has to be an encouraging sign, albeit not for my eyesight.

Manchester City began their FIFA Club World Cup with a 2-0 victory against Wydad Casablanca in Philadelphia on Wednesday.

In The Athletic's briefing below, Jordan Campbell, Daniel Taylor, Sam Lee, and Larry Henry analyse the main talking points from the game.

Enjoy.

Here's our man of the match with his view on today's game as he spoke to DAZN:

"Very happy for the team to start the tournament with the win," he said. "It was difficult at times with the heat, we're not used to it so we had to keep the ball a bit more. 

"We're happy with the performance and the three points. I score most of my goals in the box so I just stayed alive and it fell to me nicely.

"A new season, a fresh me so I'm looking forward to the season now. 

"It's really important to get your sharpness now in this big tournament. "

We have the official man of the match award and today's winner is Phil Foden. 

He scored inside two minutes and remained an important focal point for City. 

Hard luck for both Jeremy Doku and Tijjani Reijnders, who had strong performances.

A valiant effort from Wydad AC, who held their own despite the score line. Here's a look at our rankings of the Wydad players:

Subs:

Job done for City. We saw two debuts and had plenty to dissect. Here's how we rate Pep Guardiola's side in that match:

Subs: 

Jeremy Doku performed well across both halves until he came off as a sub. Involved in both goals and looked a cut above when he was on the pitch. 

Showed class in a strange game — most of the early Club World Cup matches have had a pre-season feel — but showed no sign of wilting in the heat. 

Professional, effective, and driven in getting City their first win of the tournament.

Our pick for star player!

A bit hot in Philadelphia for that kind of garb, isn't it?!

📸 Credit to David Ramos of Getty Images for this snap.

That's a really unfortunate red card for Rico Lewis, especially after it got reviewed by VAR.

Obviously his boot connecting with Obeng's face is always going to bring some sort of discussion about a card but it looked like a classic 50-50 challenge at full speed.

Lewis had won the tackle and already got rid of the ball before they made contact. With both players at full stretch on the ground, it's hard to see how either could have avoided that collision. 

It was a dangerous impact but sport sometimes is dangerous. To suggest Lewis had the agency to do anything about that is madness.

FT: Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

At the whistle, Guardiola, whose lips are pursed as if he has swallowed a wasp, shook hands with the Wydad manager Amine Benhachem curtly before striding over to the referee to make his case.

He was not happy, waving his arms around in protest.

That's the ball game!

Manchester City get their 2025 Club World Cup opener off to a good start. A win, three points, a clean sheet.

The only thing to sour the day was Rico Lewis' late red card, though that may be overturned on appeal.

For Wydad, a decent performance and one which saw them create several good chances, but they couldn't find the net.

It should offer them some encouragement in future matches, though.

90+4' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Really good save from Benabid of Wydad, who is off his line to deny Erling Haaland, who had been played the ball and was one on one.

Though he should have done better with Foden's opener, the goalkeeper has been solid since then.

Only seconds left now...

90+4' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Midway through six minutes of added time, City bring on midfielder Matheus Nunes for winger Savinho. Nunes can (and will) cover right-back after Rico Lewis' dismissal.

4-4-1 shape for City now.

VAR upholds the decision but that is very harsh. Lewis slides in and hooks the ball clear. Obeng then dives in late but Lewis' boot connects with his face. 

No intention in that whatsoever and I'm not sure where he could realistically put his boot.

90' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Rico Lewis was furious. He was refusing to leave the field, protesting to the referee, and to Samuel Obeng, who was the man on the end of the challenge.

Both players slid in with full commitment, Lewis got the ball first and cleared it away with a stretch of his leg. In the follow through, Obeng caught Lewis' thigh (painful), and Lewis' boot accidentally flicked Obeng's face (also painful).

Obeng probably made the most of it, clutching his face and banging his hand on the ground, but it did look like it stung. The ref was in very close attendance and had the red out of his pocket quickly.

On the one hand, Lewis cleanly won the ball first, and took a knock for his troubles, and the contact was only on the follow through. On the other, his studs were up and he caught an opponent in the face. It was a bit reckless.

Not sure there's enough to overturn it. Though City will try I'm sure!

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is off and running, with plenty of talking points and storylines already. Let's get you caught up with what's happening today, what you've missed and what's still to come.

We will update this file throughout each matchday with the latest reporting, analysis and fun from the competition, so do check back regularly for the latest news as we follow the fun all the way up to the tournament final at MetLife Stadium on July 13.

PHILADELPHIA -- Pep Guardiola arrived at the Club World Cup telling his Manchester City players to forget about last season, and itt's a message that will have been directed at Phil Foden, in particular.

The England midfielder was voted as the Premier League's best player in May 2024. Fast-forward a year and he could barely get a game for City. Picked to start against Wydad AC in their Group G opener, Foden scored City's first goal of the tournament within two minutes. It's the first time he's found the net for club or country since January -- a statistic that tells its own story about how hard the 25-year-old has found the past few months.

As recently as last month, Foden told reporters he was burnt out, which was also the reason he decided to skip England's World Cup qualifiers in June. Guardiola can only hope that the extra rest has done him good and that a goal against Wydad -- guided into the net after Savinho's cross was parried back into the penalty area -- will kick start a resurgence.

If Foden can return to his 2023-24 levels, when he scored 27 goals in all competitions, then City could again become the Premier League's team to beat.

Rayan Cherki has arrived from Lyon this summer in the pre-tournament transfer window and has already been forced to answer questions about whether he's the replacement for Kevin De Bruyne. For Guardiola, though, Foden is likely to be considered as a more likely successor.

Guardiola had to do without De Bruyne for more than half of the 2023-24 campaign because of injury and it was Foden who stepped up as City claimed a fourth title in a row. When Foden scored after just 113 seconds, it looked like Wydad AC might be on the end of the kind of score we saw over the weekend between Bayern Munich and Auckland City. But it was to the Moroccan side's credit that they caused City problems on the break -- particularly during the middle period of the first half.

It was partly down to the pace of Wydad's South African forward Thembinkosi Lorch, but also because of Guardiola's ultra-attacking team. Foden, Cherki, Omar Marmoush, Jérémy Doku and Savinho were all crammed into the starting XI. It left Tijjani Reijnders to make his City debut as the deepest-lying midfielder even though he arrived from Milan talking about being a goalscoring No.8. A young back four that included Vitor Reis (19), Rico Lewis (20) and Nico O'Reilly (20) had some nervous moments before Doku made it 2-0 just before half-time.

The goal knocked the energy out of Wydad and the second half was comfortable for City, though the scoreline didn't deter the Moroccan fans. The block of red behind the goal bounced and chanted, led by a drummer who didn't stop all afternoon. At one point in the second half the game had to be paused after smoke bombs were let off. It gave the game a World Cup atmosphere as City kicked off their campaign with a win.

The only downside for Guardiola was a late red card for Lewis, despite appearing to win the ball first before clattering into Samuel Obeng. -- Rob Dawson

LOS ANGELES -- Esteban Andrada arrived at the Club World Cup with one foot out of the club, but he had his redemption match against UEFA Champions League runner-up Inter Milan as the Liga MX side earned a very credible 1-1 draw to begin their Group E campaign.

Andrada's mistakes and lack of confidence saw him benched down the stretch in Liga MX, which prompted Monterrey to seek reinforcements in the special pre-Club World Cup transfer window. They signed Uruguayan international Santiago Mele, who arrived in Los Angeles on Monday afternoon, but he was not considered for the match. In the end, Andrada was a force between the posts, making one big save and commanding his penalty area well against an onslaught of Inter shots, the Serie A side managing 15 shots for an xG (expected goals) of 2.68.

Coach Domenec Torrent now has an important decision to make for their next group game, against Argentine giants River Plate on Saturday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena: should he back Andrada to continue his heroics, or will Mele get an immediate look as a  starter? -- Ricardo Cariño, ESPN Mexico

PHILADELPHIA -- Empty seats are in danger of becoming a theme of the Club World Cup, but Wydad's travelling support more than made up for the shortfall at Lincoln Financial Field on Wednesday.

The attendance -- which did steadily increase after kick-off -- was announced as 37,446, just over half the stadium capacity of 67,594. That represents a reasonable return given the midday kick-off and summer humidity, but regardless, the sense of occasion was heightened by the ceaseless noise provided by Wydad's supporters.

Clad in red and gathered behind one goal, roughly 2,000 supporters led the charge with a pre-match tifo, drum-led chanting and, at one point during the second half, a sea of red flares which spread smoke and the smell of cordite drifting across the southern Philadelphia air. A few individuals went a step too far in throwing flares onto the pitch -- prompting boos from City supporters -- but overall FIFA will be grateful for the colour Wydad's ultras provided despite watching their team lose 2-0.

FIFA owes something of a debt to Morocco in this regard. Amid fears of empty stadia during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Morocco supporters descended on the Gulf state in their thousands to pack out arenas during the competition. What a boost it will be for FIFA and president Gianni Infantino if Wydad's fans continue to show this enthusiasm. -- James Olley

After losing 4-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in their opening Group B game, this already feels like a must-win match for Atletico Madrid if they want to progress to the knockout phase. That performance was unacceptable, the first-half failure to compete uncharacteristic of a Diego Simeone team.

Perhaps the midday heat in Pasadena was a factor, though there'll be no such excuse on Thursday evening at a cloudy Lumen Field in Seattle. The Sounders did well against Brazilian giants Botafogo there on Sunday -- giving the 2024 Libertadores winners a scare, though losing 2-1 despite having the bulk of the scoring chances and possession -- and they'll once again be underdogs against Atletico, hoping to secure a famous win at home. -- Alex Kirkland

FIFA Club World Cup

Club World Cup

Updated 39s ago

Jeremy Doku has doubled Manchester City's lead in the first game of their Club World Cup defence against Wydad AC.

The Belgium forward took advantage of some static set-piece defending to poke in at the back post. It came after Phil Foden had given City the lead with the fastest-ever goal scored in the history of this tournament.

Wydad had caused plenty of problems at the other end of the pitch, but failed to take any of the big chances they created.

The Club World Cup's brightest young players – including Doue, Bellingham and Bayern's new Robben?

75' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Erling Haaland has barely touched the ball since coming on, but that was good centre-forward play.

With City bringing the ball forward outside the box, he backed into his marker, preventing him from challenging for the ball, then stepped back into a pocket of space so Rico Lewis could find him.

One touch with the sole of his foot to set up the shot... but he got too much on it, powering the ball over the bar.

74' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

He does seem the ultra-composed type, Ederson, doesn't he. So laid back as to be almost supine.

The Brazilian is closed down by Lorch outside his box, but instead of just clearing it, he takes a cute touch around the attacker, before slipping a nice pass into a team-mate.

72' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

City have completed 400 passes to Wydad's 199, almost exactly double, but that one wasn't so good!

Rodri puts too much juice on a pinged ball out to the left wing and Savinho, and the ball slips out of play.

Savinho frustrated, as is Rodri, though the City subs on the sidelines clap encouragingly in commiseration.

Not often you see two poor Rodri passes in the same game!

68' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Smart from Pep Guardiola, as you'd expect.

With Wydad retaining some threat on the counter-attack, City sacrifice forward Marmoush for midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, changing the formation to a more defensively minded 4-3-3.

Both players take on some fluids at a break in play with a Wydad player down receiving some treatment. Guardiola wipes his sweaty scalp with a towel.

It's looking hot and humid out there in Philly.

Wydad are in this match. 

It's hard to see them coming back from two goals down but they have held their own and bounced back both times after conceding.

It would not be a surprise if they nicked a goal. 

Their fans are making a lot of noise and will certainly hope they will have something to cheer before full time.

66' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Rodri, Ballon d'Or winner... just passes it straight out of play.

Nice to see it can happen to the best of us, rather than just me at Sunday league.

63' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Finally Wydad have a focal point up top in Obeng.

A clever touch from Moufid, who takes a chipped ball from goalie Benabid down and side-steps Rico Lewis before sliding into Obeng, who caresses it out to the left wing with his first touch.

Decent ball in, Ake has to step in ahead of Obeng to put it behind. Ake clutches his calf in pain. Corner, dangerous, flicked behind for another... but there's a bit of push and shove in the box and the Brazilian referee gives City a foul.

The TV cameras pan to the Wydad fans behind the goal, who are literally bouncing up and down. Loud, proud, and colourful. Those fans are doing their club justice, and then some.

Super noise.

61' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Wydad respond with a couple of changes too. Midfielder Zemraoui and veteran winger Amrabat are off, target-man striker Samuel Obeng and Mickael Malsa are on.

60' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Off: Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki, Jeremy Doku.

On: Rodri, Erling Haaland, Oscar Bobb.

What do those changes mean? Rodri alongside Reijnders in central midfield, Bobb onto the right wing, with Savinho moving from the right to the left, Haaland alongside Marmoush up top.

Back four as we were.

59' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Just before the hour mark and City have a host of players ready to come on.

They have around half a billion's worth of players (in pound sterling) among their replacements!

54' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Doku should score! It's poor play from Wydad, sleepy. It's passed across from Meijers to Ferreira, summer signing to summer signing, but Ferreira's touch is poor and means he has to go back to the goalkeeper.

Again, sloppy, the pass is off-line and awkward for Benabid, who scrapes it back to Ferreira in the nick of time before Cherki slides in to intercept. Ferreira is unaware of Doku at his back, and his heavy first touch saw him robbed by the Belgian.

Doku one on one, he rather telegraphed his effort, opening up his body like Thierry Henry of old.

Benabid guessed right and plunged to his left to make the save. Good stop. Foden wanted the pass but he wasn't close enough really, right call to shoot from Doku.

52' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Sharp from City goalkeeper Ederson, wearing a garish fluorescent pink shirt. 

Zemraoui slid a clever through ball in search of Lorch, who was making a diagonal run, but Ederson raced out to smash it away. The offside flag eventually went up anyway.

Doku, then Lorch again, at the other end, are flagged offside in quick succession. Replays show Doku appeared to be onside. I know this is in opposition to the typical thinking in the sport at the moment, but let the move play out! 

51' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

City corner, and Vitor Reis, who hasn't had the greatest game of his career so far, latches onto it.

But the ball balloons high over the bar. Disappointing considering it was another testing delivery from Foden from the right.

Should do better.

48' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Lorch receives the ball and shoots on the bounce from a fair way out. Nordin Amrabat, the 38-year-old, kindly suggests he might have laid it off. He might have.

Lorch shrugs as if to say: ‘Might as well have a go, eh?'.

Ederson pauses over the goal kick, with five Wydad players committed forwards in the press. Ederson smashes it long downfield in search of Doku, who is challenging for the ball with Moufi, one on one.

Moufi does well, bringing it out, before being barged over by Doku. Foul, free kick.

46' Manchester City 2-0 Wydad AC

Like in the losing FA Cup final against Crystal Palace, City are looking for Doku at nearly every opportunity.

The danger man. They feed him the ball, he takes on Moufi, cuts inside into space, and releases Omar Marmoush with a nice through ball.

Just a tad overhit, though, and goalkeeper Benabid is on his toes and sprints off his line to gather the loose ball.

Back into the action we go!

Pep Guardiola was on the pitch moments ago waving his arms around with characteristic gusto.

Can Wydad get back into it and finally take an opportunity?

Only one way to find out, and only one place to do so: right here, right now.

Wydad knock the ball back. Let's go!

Confirmation, Rayhi replacing the booked Mailula.

No-brainer of a sub.

Wydad AC striker Mohamed Rayhi, profiled in our piece below, is warming up energetically on the pitch in Philadelphia.

It certainly appears as if he will come on at half-time to contest the second 45.

Wydad will hope the prolific striker, who was the joint-highest scorer in the Moroccan top division last season (with 11 goals) can get on the end of some of these dangerous Amrabat crosses.

The 2026 tournament will feature more teams and more air miles travelled than ever, casting doubt upon ambitious climate goals

As next summer's World Cup approaches, excitement is building for the biggest global soccer tournament ever held, but so too are concerns over the viability and environmental sustainability of the vastly expanded competition.

Held across 16 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico, the 2026 World Cup will be marked by the tournament expanding from 32 nations to 48 competing for soccer's most coveted prize. It will be a tournament of unprecedented scale both in terms of the number of teams, and the vast geographical expanse it will cover. Both of these factors bring significant environmental concerns, however – particularly regarding the tournament's carbon footprint and the effectiveness of Fifa's proposed mitigation strategies.

Fifa first introduced its Climate Strategy report back in 2021 in response to growing environmental concerns, launching its initiative at the UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26) that year. In the plan, Fifa pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2040. The strategy included measures such as promoting sustainable infrastructure, enhancing energy efficiency and encouraging the use of renewable energy. It also included a fair amount of carbon offsetting – a process by which entities buy “credits” that go toward environmental protection, to theoretically make up for emissions produced.

However, it has been argued by critics that Fifa's reliance on carbon offsetting lacks transparency and may not be effective in mitigating the environmental impact of its expanded showpiece tournament. The organization's previous claims of carbon neutrality for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar were deemed misleading by a Swiss regulator. Responding to complaints raised by environmental groups in five different countries, the Swiss Commission for Fairness – which is based in Fifa's home city of Zurich – found the governing body was “not able to provide proof that the claims were accurate” and “did not set out a plan to define how it will further offset emissions”.

This raises questions about the credibility of similar assertions Fifa has made about the 2026 World Cup. The tournament will feature 80 matches, spread across the three host countries. The massive geographical spread will necessitate extensive air travel for teams and fans alike, contributing to the tournament's substantial carbon emissions.

United 2026, the joint bid by the host nations, has estimated that the event will generate approximately 3.7m tonnes of CO₂, making it the highest World Cup carbon footprint ever recorded. Of this estimate, travel accounts for 85% of the emissions – 51% from international travel and 34% from inter- and intra-city travel.

The 2022 World Cup faced significant criticism for its environmental impact, but that was to do with factors other than travel. The construction of new stadiums and infrastructure, coupled with the energy-intensive cooling systems required for the desert climate, contributed to the tournament's substantial carbon footprint. Fifa estimated that the tournament was responsible for emissions of approximately 3.6m tonnes of CO₂.

In contrast, Uefa's approach to Euro 2024 in Germany seems to offer a more sustainable model. The tournament used existing stadiums, implemented energy-efficient technologies and promoted public transportation for fans and teams. These measures led to a 21% reduction in carbon emissions compared to initial forecasts. Additionally, Uefa established a €7m Climate Fund to support sustainable infrastructure projects, leaving a lasting environmental legacy for the Euros.

In fairness to the hosts, 2026 is being played under different conditions to Euro 2024 and Qatar 2022. Those tournaments were played in a single country (a tiny country in the latter case). Meanwhile, 2026 will traverse North America. The vast distances between venues in Canada, the United States and Mexico make air travel the most practical option for many teams and fans, significantly increasing emissions.

While the use of existing stadiums reduces the need for new construction, the pressure on infrastructure and transportation systems remains a concern. Efforts to mitigate these challenges include promoting public transit and reducing reliance on air travel within host cities. However, the effectiveness of these measures depends on the availability, accessibility and affordability of sustainable transportation options, in addition to the willingness of fans and teams to utilize them. And, as anyone who has used public transport in the US will tell you, it can vary from rickety but effective in cities such as New York to almost non-existent in places such as Kansas City and Arlington.

Fifa's choice of sponsorship partners for the tournament is another area in which the World Cup has come under scrutiny for its environmental impact. Partnerships with fossil fuel companies and airlines contribute to soccer's carbon footprint and raise questions about the alignment of commercial interests with stated sustainability goals. Among Fifa's many commercial partners for the 2026 tournament are Qatar Airways and Aramco, officially known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Group. It could be argued that such sponsorships undermine the organization's efforts to promote environmental responsibility.

After facing pushback against their sustainability reporting in the aftermath of the 2022 tournament in Qatar, the 2026 World Cup presents fresh challenges for Fifa and its green initiatives. But it also represents an opportunity for the organization to demonstrate a genuine commitment to environmental sustainability.

Soccer's supposed commitment to reducing emissions and easing its environmental impact is more than a mere box-ticking exercise; it is a matter of increasing importance to fans. A new study commissioned by UK-based climate change charity Pledgeball, in conjunction with the Champions League sponsor Mastercard, polled over 1,600 fans – including attendees at last year's Champions League final – on the subject of environmental sustainability in soccer. It found that 81% of respondents said they are worried about the climate crisis, and 82% said they wanted their clubs to do more to combat it.

The majority of respondents also believed that it was incumbent on governing bodies such as Fifa to take the lead by implementing a top-down approach by overseeing explicit reporting requirements and meting out punishments to clubs responsible for the highest emissions.

The sheer scope of the expanded competition next year will provide the sternest possible test of the mitigation measures Fifa has put in place. And there will be an added expectation for a greater level of transparency when it comes to the postmortem reporting of the tournament's carbon impact, after Fifa's attempts to do so after the Qatar tournament didn't stand up to scrutiny.

Set in the biggest media market on the planet, the 2026 World Cup will have record-breaking reach, but also a record-breaking carbon footprint. How Fifa tackles that issue will determine the credibility of its grand green plans.

NWSL

It's less than a year out from the 2026 men's World Cup, hosted in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and there's suddenly plenty of drama happening with the U.S. men's national team that isn't about their recent form.

The back and forth between captain Christian Pulisic and head coach Mauricio Pochettino over the Milan forward's decision to sit out the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer has earned plenty of headlines and sustained a couple of weeks' worth of podcast episodes. It has been fascinating to watch from a distance via the lens of covering the U.S. women's national team.

Having reported on the USWNT at the World Cups in France in 2019 and Australia/New Zealand in 2023, and at the Olympics in France last year, I have never seen anything like this on the women's side of the sport.

There will always be tensions between players and a head coach to varying degrees. The closest comparison I could come up with was Ali Krieger's long call-up drought before suddenly coming back into the fold for the 2019 World Cup, though it's not a perfect comparison, as public comments from either side stayed polite. Even new head coach Emma Hayes' surprising decision to leave Alex Morgan off the 2024 Olympic roster was largely covered as a pure soccer decision (and rightly so).

With the men, there are some inciting factors ramping up the heat. And the two former Chelsea colleagues, as managers of the London club's men's and women's teams during the 2023-24 season, find themselves in opposite scenarios.

An imminent World Cup being played largely on American soil, increasing workloads for players, the changing media landscape and the weight of former player voices, and even the high-profile nature of the men's head-coaching role for U.S. Soccer, are all escalating this from a single player's choice to contentious national discourse.

On the field, the USMNT's recent form — Gold Cup opener aside — has been lackluster, and the pressure is on to not just be prepared for a home World Cup but to perform well in it.

Meanwhile, for the USWNT, 2025 has been a rare release of the pressure valve that's usually on the women's game's perennial winners. This year is a slow build into World Cup qualifiers next summer, and the team is at the start of a new cycle leading into the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil and 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

For the women, the pressure is to win. For the men, it feels like something much closer to avoiding embarrassment on the international stage. The long shadow of Couva and the failure to qualify for the 2018 men's World Cup still lingers, even as the player pool has largely turned over in the years since.

Playing at home in a World Cup now less than 12 months away has cranked up pressure on the USMNT program to a level they've never actually experienced before.



Workload is also a factor.

It is not new or unique to Pulisic, to the USMNT or to men's soccer — but it does feel like players in general are beginning to reach a breaking point with the combined demands of club and international football, and are more willing to acknowledge their own need for rest as they put more and more minutes on their bodies.

There are legitimate concerns about player workload, something FIFPro, the sport's global players' union, has made a top priority, and the idea that footballers should feel enabled to take breaks for their physical or mental well-being is valid. Maybe we're just more used to these ideas on the women's side, since so much of the discussion around that branch of the game has come through the lens of players battling for better conditions, especially here in the United States.

It's not perfect yet by any stretch, but from the equal-pay fight to the NWSL abuse scandal, every person in the women's game has needed to grapple with player health and safety in a way the men's side has yet to be faced with.

After criticism over his decision to rest — including from former USMNT players such as Landon Donovan and Tim Howard — Pulisic wanted to clarify he was open to playing in two of the recent warm-up matches, but not the Gold Cup. Pochettino responded that while he understood Pulisic's line of thinking, he selected the same roster for those friendlies as the tournament itself because he considered it “a really important competition.”

But Pochettino's full response is where the discourse fully leapt into drama, even as he said his communication with Pulisic is “good,” though the same as he would have with any other player.

“I don't prioritize,” the former Argentina international said. “You say (Christian is) the best player. Yes, he's a good player, of course. But he needs to perform. Because I'm going to judge him like Diego (Luna, the attacking midfielder sitting next to him as he spoke to reporters), like another player. If he performs well and he is the best, it's normal he's going to have a place in the national team. It's not because a player (is saying), ‘I want to play', ‘I want this', ‘I want that'.

“When I signed my contract with the federation, it said I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin.”

the USMNT drama right now is🍿😭 and half the country is oblivious

When Hayes did not rotate her lineups during the Olympics, a tournament known for its compressed schedule and increased demands on players (and in that case, happened mostly in the high summer temperatures of southern France), she faced questions about workload. Hayes coached her players through those three weeks by comparing the tournament to a “pain cave”, a concept used by ultramarathoners running hundreds of miles.

“The reason I want to play the team together for as long as possible is because I want them to develop that. I want them to suffer. I want them to have that moment, because I do not believe you can win without it,” Hayes said as the USWNT advanced to the gold-medal game — and eventually took the title home.

Pochettino made a similar justification when explaining why he wanted the same roster for the Gold Cup and the two friendlies leading up to it.

“(Pulisic) contacted us with the concern about how he explained about how he was tired, that (he) was worried about different things,” Pochettino said before the Gold Cup, where his team will play up to six matches. “It's true that he wanted to come to be involved in the two friendly games — how he said. But it's common sense for us to build a roster to come to these two friendly games (in order) to prepare for the Gold Cup, because, for us, the Gold Cup is an important tournament.”

In this clear juxtaposition between the two U.S. national teams, Hayes has actively chosen to give almost all of the team's European-based players a rest for the upcoming camp and three friendlies. Her roster, announced Wednesday, featured only one player who plays in Europe — vice-captain and now Chelsea defender Naomi Girma was included in the majority NWSL player group as she builds back from an injury in March that meant over a month on the sidelines.

“This is the first opportunity, and the only one for them, to take a break between now and the World Cup in two years,” Hayes said, “and player welfare and rest and recovery are also important for these players.”

Hayes said Wednesday that while the increased player load across club and country is a conversation she can be a part of, but only influence via communication with U.S. Soccer and NWSL clubs, her specific role is to work with each individual player.

“All I can control is that in 2027, there is a World Cup and this player has this number of games, this is their season window, this is the international call-ups that they might receive, this is their off-season, this is their rest period,” she said. “Every one of them is different. My job is to educate the player.”

While Hayes viewed differences in player load between the European club game and the NWSL right now, the end goal was the same for her.

“Our players need to develop resilience to be able to tolerate the load,” she said

That said, how she manages a player like Emily Fox, who just won the Champions League with Arsenal, is different from an older player with a history of injuries or a young debutante with the national team who's stayed healthy.

While Hayes has the luxury of two years to build to Brazil 2027, Pochettino was brought in to replace Gregg Berhalter last September. There is a difference between the demands of a major tournament and the games one year out from one. Regardless, the discussion hasn't stayed on the actual structural issue at fault because the drama has superseded it.

Maybe this was unavoidable, though, thanks to U.S. Soccer's approach to hiring.

For both the men's and women's national teams, the federation has gone out and hired big-name coaches who create news cycles and have drawn off some of the coverage that might have otherwise gone to the players. Pochettino is already in an uncomfortable spot, due to the state of his team. Defensiveness should not be surprising.

There is a break in the clouds, at least. The USMNT got their opening win in the Gold Cup, 5-0 over Trinidad & Tobago, giving the team a chance to cut through the “noise” of the building negativity over the past few weeks.

While a result like that always helps things smooth over, there's still plenty to be resolved (at least publicly) between Pochettino and Pulisic — and it feels like everyone will still be waiting to see how this plays out.

The grass installed at MetLife Stadium is already under criticism a year out from the World Cup.

Soccer teams complaining about pitch conditions is truly a tradition unlike any other. If the turf isn't to a team's liking, the world will hear about it. Therefore, it should come as no surprise whatsoever that players and coaches are sounding off about the turf installed at MetLife Stadium for the FIFA Club World Cup.

The home stadium for both the New York Giants and New York Jets has long been known as having some of the worst artificial turf in the NFL. The real grass installed for the Club World Cup, a move required by FIFA, apparently isn't much better.

There is plenty of time between now and MetLife Stadium hosting the 2026 World Cup Final in July ‘26, but the fact that teams are already moaning about the playing surface isn't exactly the greatest vote of confidence about what is to come.

FIFA Renames MetLife Stadium With Dumbest Title Imaginable For 2026 World Cup Final

Porto took on Palmeiras in the first FIFA Club World Cup match at MetLife Stadium, and neither side was pleased with the playing surface.

"It's a different grass than in Europe. My feeling was the pitch was a little bit soft and it was a little bit, not dry, but I would say that the ball wasn't traveling so fast as we are used to," Palmeiras' Estêvão said, according to the New York Post. "This is a little bit of what my impression is, what my feeling is. But, everybody has to work in the same conditions and we don't search for any excuses."

Borussia Dortmund played to a scoreless draw against Fluminense on MetLife's surface as well, and Pascal Groß had similar concerns about the grass.

"It's just a totally different football pitch than what we played the whole year. It's nothing compared to the grass we play on," Dortmund's Pascal Groß said after the match. "But I'm not a fan of excuses, so that doesn't matter for me. … We need to adjust quick. We need to be able to play on different pitches."

Complaining about grass, the same grass your opponent has to play on as well, is always a questionable move. Add in the fact that these teams should have been well aware that the surface was a new one, and the complaints come across as nothing but a whine fest.

Having said that, the playing surface has to be pristine in time for the World Cup Final.

The Latest | Jun 18, 2025

KANSAS CITY (June 18, 2025) — A trio of Kansas City Current players in forward Michelle Cooper, midfielder Claire Hutton and defender Izzy Rodriguez have been called up by the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) for three international friendlies later this month. U.S. Soccer announced its 25-player roster on Wednesday as it continues preparation for Concacaf World Cup qualifying in Fall 2026.

After featuring in the Futures Camp earlier this year, Cooper and Hutton both got their first senior national team call-up in February for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup presented by Visa and have since appeared in two subsequent USWNT camps. This is the first time Rodriguez has been called up by the USWNT in her career.

The Stars and Stripes will play the Republic of Ireland for two contests, the first which will be held at DSG Park in Commerce City, Colo., on Thursday, June 26, at 8 p.m. CT. The teams then square off again in Cincinnati, Ohio, at 2 p.m. CT on Sunday, June 29, at TQL Stadium. The USWNT will conclude its trip in Washington, D.C., by facing Canada on Wednesday, July 2, at 6:30 p.m. CT for the Allstate Continental Clásico at Audi Field.

Fans can watch the first match against Ireland on TBS, TruTV, Universo, Max and Peacock, and can tune into TNT, TruTV, Universo, Max and Peacock for the second game. The Allstate Continental Clásico will air on TNT, TruTV, Universo, Max and Peacock.

Cooper made her USWNT debut during the 2025 SheBelieves Cup, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2-0 victory over Colombia on Feb. 20. In the team's next match against Australia, the forward scored her first international goal in the 68th minute which stood as the game-winner in a 2-1 win. Most recently, she dished out an assist in a 3-0 shutout over China PR on May 31. Cooper also had a decorated youth national team career, highlighted by winning the Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the 2022 Concacaf U-20 Championship as well as captaining her team at the 2022 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

Like Cooper, Hutton's first USWNT appearance was in the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year when she started against Australia and logged 70 minutes. She joined the starting lineup again – and played every minute – in an April friendly against Brazil, also putting in an 80-minute shift as a starter vs. Jamaica on June 3. Hutton's international debut was with the U.S. U-17 Youth National Team at the 2022 Concacaf Championship where she scored six goals. She was also tabbed captain of the U-19 squad at the 2023 PanAm Games and played at the 2024 FIFA U-20 World Cup, earning bronze in both events.

Receiving her first USWNT nod is Rodriguez, who has appeared in all 12 games of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season so far with nine starts. Her three assists are tied for third in the league and she was named to the NWSL Best XI for April, the second such honor of her career. Rodriguez has donned the red, white and blue on the international stage before: She helped the USA win the 2016 Concacaf U-17 Championship and played at the 2016 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Two years later, she guided the U.S. to a runner-up finish at the 2018 U-20 Concacaf Championship and had two appearances at the 2018 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

The Kansas City Current is back on the pitch on Friday, June 20, welcoming Angel City FC to CPKC Stadium to close out the first half of NWSL regular season action. Kickoff is at 7 p.m. CT and the match will broadcast on Prime Video. The action will also air on 90.9 The Bridge, and fans can tune in to hear the match in English, Spanish or Portuguese on the KC Current App.

Rose Lavelle is coming back to play in her hometown.

The United States Women's National Team announced Wednesday that the Mount Notre Dame graduate will be in uniform then they play three friendlies this summer, including June 29 against Ireland at TQL Stadium. That news came with the unveiling of their full training camp roster for the matches.

Lavelle, who turned 30 in May, had been out for six months with an ankle injury that required surgery. She recently returned to action for her Gotham FC club in the National Women's Soccer League, coming on as a substitute for the final 15 minutes during two games on June 7 and June 13.

She helped the USWNT win the 2024 Olympic gold medal in France but has not played for the National Team since the end of 2024. She currently has 110 career caps (appearances for the national team in international play) and 24 career goals for the USA, including in the 2019 World Cup which she played a key role in the USWNT winning.

Lavelle is currently in New York City with Gotham FC. She addressed her injury and the joy she feels coming back to Cincinnati in a virtual interview session from there with local media Tuesday in advance of the announcement.

“It just so special,” she said. “Everything is so much joy, bringing everyone to Cincinnati, show them how great a city it is.”

“It was a pretty big surgery, so it honestly might be a while until my ankle is 100 percent,” she said. “The rest of me feels great, though, so that's a good thing. (The surgery) was kind of treacherous. I definitely didn't know what all coming back from surgery entailed, so it was a harder process than I anticipated. But the med staff at Gotham has been great. I felt in such great hands. They really took great care of me and helped me get back to the point where I am, to be in the position to get back into camp and to get back into the game for Gotham. It was definitely a really, really tough process, but I think I'm better for it and I feel really grateful for the support system I had throughout it all.”

She said because she has only played limited minutes with Gotham so far that it's unlikely she'll play the full 90 minutes in Cincinnati, but she's working on it.

“Coming back from injury, how much I'll be available to play, hopefully some good amount, but obviously I can't go in and play maximum minutes,” she said. “It's my first camp back in and everybody's mentality going into camp is 'I have to go back in and earn spots.' It's something (that) having been in camp and with the national team for so long, it's a familiar position I'm in, to go back and an environment where we really have to compete and push each other.”

The ankle injury is the most serious one Lavelle has dealt with in her career, but it has come at a decent time in the soccer schedule.

“Any time I've had to take time away from the game, specifically when I've been injured, I think there's always a silver lining,” she said. “A lot of that is being able to reflect on knowing what all you still want. I want to win an NWSL championship. We have another cycle starting up, (we) qualified for the World Cup and Olympics and kind of go from there.

“I think it's kind of nice because I've been able to take a step back and reflect on and off the field. I feel like there's not really ever an ideal time to get an injury or have surgery, but I feel like if it was going to happen this year, it was probably the best time. I feel like it's allowed me to really prepare and reflect on the next couple years out.”

Gotham lost to Kansas City 2-1 on June 7 and beat Utah 3-0 on June 13. Gotham hosts Bay FC Saturday.

“It was such a long journey, so to finally get back on the field with Gotham and with my teammates was so fun,” she said. “Obviously, first game we lost, so that wasn't fun at the end of it, but during I enjoyed it. And then our last game, it got kind of wild and we were down two men because of red cards by the end of it. So it was kind of funny because when I was going in, we were 11 people on the field, we were up 3-0, that was so fun. And then as soon as I started going in, then they were reviewing for a red card and I was like, ‘OK I'm gonna be running.'”

When Lavelle helped the United States win the World Cup in 2019, she was a 24-year old phenom supported by older big names such as Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan. Now she's one of the older, most experienced players on the roster. She has the most career caps for the national team (110) of anyone on the current 25-player roster. Only four other players have more than 35, and the average age of the roster is 24.5.

Lavelle has been a mentor to her Gotham teammates this year, and is looking forward to doing everything she can for the national team, even if she can't play as much as she would like.

“I think it's really allowed me to step into more of a leadership role off the field,” she said. “So how can I still be a good teammate to them? How can I still use my voice and help the team whatever way I can, so I feel like I grew so much in that area during this past six months and I feel like I can use that going into camp.

“It still feels weird for me to think of myself as a veteran player, but I am, and with the past couple of (USWNT) rosters, it's been a really young new group. I've been that player before: The young inexperienced one. I always feel like I had such great veteran players to look up to, so I hope I can be that for them, help them feel a little more comfortable in an uncomfortable environment and hopefully set them up to be the best version of themselves in camps.”

Lavelle follows FC Cincinnati, and she's disappointed that the city didn't get an NWSL franchise in the recent expansion window.

When asked about it, she sighed and got emotional.  

“I was so sad,” Lavelle said. “I would have loved to see Cincinnati get a team and I would love to still see them get a team at some point. I think it's just such an underrated soccer city. The community and the friends rally around FCC so much, and I know it would have been the same for the women's team.”

Lavelle will be 36 when the U.S. hosts the World Cup in 2031. There's a possibility that Cincinnati could host games in the tournament. Whether she's still playing for the national team or not, she hopes it happens.

“I don't know if I'll be around that long, but regardless, I always say Cincinnati is such an underrated soccer city,” Lavelle said. “I feel like so much talent comes out of it. I think what FCC's been able to do has been so amazing and the way the city has rallied around all of the players that have come from Cincinnati that play in the league now, and FCC itself. So, I love any opportunity for people to be able to visit Cincinnati and see how amazing it is, and I think it would be such an amazing way to showcase the city, the soccer talent, the community.”

ATLANTA (June 18, 2025) – U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes has named the 25-player training camp roster for the upcoming matches against the Republic of Ireland on June 26 at DICK's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colo., presented by Allstate (7 p.m. MT / 9 p.m. ET on TBS, truTV and Max, Universo & Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports)and on June 29 at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio (3 p.m. ET on TNT, truTV and Max, Universo & Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports)before taking on Canada on July 2 at Audi Field in Washington, D.C. in the Allstate Continental Clasico(7:30 p.m. ET on TNT, truTV & Max and Universo &Peacock in Spanish and on the radio via Westwood One Sports).

Tickets for all three matches are available on ussoccer.com.

As Hayes shared last week, the roster does not feature almost all of the USA's European-based players with those players getting this FIFA window off to rest and recuperate after long European seasons. Only defender Naomi Girma of Chelsea FC currently plays her club soccer abroad, meaning 24 players on the roster are from National Women's Soccer League clubs. Hayes will name 23 players to suit up for each of the three matches.

GOALKEEPERS (3): Angelina Anderson (Angel City FC; 0), Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 0), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 3)

DEFENDERS (10):Kerry Abello (Orlando Pride; 1/0), Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 0/0), Naomi Girma (Chelsea FC, ENG; 46/2), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 0/0), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 6/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 4/0), Izzy Rodriguez (Kansas City Current; 0/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 4/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 108/2), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC; 3/0)

MIDFIELDERS (6): Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit; 3/0), Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 35/2), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 3/0), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 110/24), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC; 0/0), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 7/2)

FORWARDS (6): Lynn Biyendolo (Seattle Reign FC; 80/24), Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 6/1), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 9/0), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 5/1), Ally Sentnor (Utah Royals; 9/4), Alyssa Thompson (Angel City FC; 19/1)

The roster features four players earning their first-ever call-ups – defenders Jordyn Bugg, Lilly Reale and Izzy Rodriguez and midfielder Sam Meza -- meaning Hayes has now given 27 players their first USWNT call-ups. Six players on the roster have yet to be capped at the senior level and 19 players (76% of the roster) have fewer than 10 caps.

“We want to continue to improve our understanding of how we want to play and widen the player pool, and those are some of the key goals of this three-game window,” said Hayes. “On this roster, we have players with a varied amount of experience, and my priority is to deepen the exposures required for international soccer. These are three challenging matches and as always, we want to win, but also to make sure we are ready for the next steps.”

The roster does include the return of World Cup and Olympic champion midfielder Rose Lavelle, owner of 110 caps, 24 international goals and a goal in the 2019 Women's World Cup Final. Lavelle has recovered from ankle surgery and will suit up for the USA for the first time in about six and half months, last playing for the USWNT in the final match of 2024 against the Netherlands in The Hague.

Lavelle's inclusion will give her the chance to play in her hometown of Cincinnati, where she attended Mount Notre Dame High School and is one of the most popular local athletes of the last decade.

The roster features just six players who have played in a world championship at the senior level, and one of those is midfielder Croix Bethune, the 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year and a member of the 2024 Olympic Team (she played in one match in France), who returns after a long recovery from knee surgery. She has not played with the USA since the Olympics. Houston Dash forward Yazmeen Ryan also returns to the roster after being unavailable for selection during the last FIFA window due to injury. 

The other five players on the roster who have world championship experience are forward Lynn Biyendolo --who had a two-goal performance in her last USWNT outing in a 4-0 win over Jamaica on June 3 to bring her international goal total to 24 in 80 caps–defender Emily Sonnett (108 caps), midfielder Sam Coffey (35 caps), Girma and Lavelle. Fourteen players on this roster were on World Cup Teams for the USA at the U-17 or U-20 levels or both.

Ally Sentnor, who notched her first two-goal game in a U.S. uniform on June 3 against Jamaica, gets another call-up. She and the other five forwards on the roster have combined for 19 goals in the NWSL so far this season.

Four Seattle Reign FC players have been named to the United States Women's National team 25-player roster for the upcoming international window by Head Coach Emma Hayes – Lynn Biyendolo, Jordyn Bugg, Claudia Dickey and Sam Meza.

The United States is set to take on Republic of Ireland twice, on June 26 and 29, and Canada once, on July 2. The roster does not feature the vast majority USA's European-based players, with the exception of defender Naomi Girma of Chelsea FC. For each of the three friendly matches, Hayes will name 23 of the 25 total players to suit up.

"Having four players called into the senior U.S. Women's National Team — including first-timers Sam Meza and Jordyn Bugg — speaks volumes about the level of talent and commitment we have at this club. Whether it's Claudia and Lynn continuing to raise the bar, or Sam and Jordyn stepping onto the senior stage for the first time, we're incredibly proud to see the Reign so well represented,” said Seattle Reign FC General Manager Lesle Gallimore.

Forward Lynn Biyendolo brings the most experience of the four Reign players called up with 80 caps and 24 goals. She is one of just six players included on the roster to have played in a world championship at the senior level. Most recently, Biyendolo scored a brace for the USWNT in the team's 4-0 win over Jamaica. Much like her role with the Reign, the attacker will bring a reliable sense of leadership to the United States roster.

Goalkeeper Claudia Dickey continues her standout season, getting called up to camp once again after earning her first game call up during the May-June international window.  The 25-year-old is still looking for her first cap, along with five other players on the roster. All three of the goalkeepers called up to this camp have earned first call-ups this year or at the end of last year and have experience with the U.S. U-20s. 

Defender Jordyn Bugg and midfielder Sam Meza, two of the Reign's rising young stars, have been called up to the senior national team for the first time ever. They both have extensive experience at the youth national team level and are two of four players called up for the first time during this camp.

All four of the first-time call ups have previously appeared on a U.S. roster in FIFA Youth World Cup. Bugg, the youngest player in camp, played in the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup while Meza was on the USA's 2018 FIFA U-17 WWC Team but did not see action. The midfielder has won a Concacaf title at the U-15, U-17 and U-20 levels. Both Bugg and Meza were most recently called up to the United States Under-23 Women's Youth National Team for a trip to Germany when the Americans split games with the Germans.

FIFA claimed the Club World Cup would change football ‘for the better', but the tournament has endured an underwhelming start.

When the FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) opened on Saturday, Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest footballer, weaved his magic on the field as a cluster of former stars – David Beckham, Ronaldo, Kaka, Bebeto, Roberto Baggio and Javier Zanetti – watched on from their VIP seats at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

While Messi was unable to score any goals in Inter Miami's 0-0 draw against Egyptian club Al Ahly, football fans turned up in their thousands to watch the Argentinian lead his team in what could have been a goal-fest for the home side.

The organisers, led by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, appeared pleased with the tournament opener and would have hoped for the goals, spectators and popularity to increase as the Club World Cup progressed.

Infantino has treated the tournament as his personal project and aimed to bring the biggest names in football to the United States, one of the co-hosts for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

From Inter Miami's inclusion in the CWC under a special ‘host nation' spot for the regular-season winners of MLS (other football continents had different entry criteria for qualification), to Infantino's widely-reported comment that Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo “might play in the Club World Cup”, and increasing the winner's prize money by a whopping $35m, the FIFA chief has pulled out all the stops to support his claim that this competition is “the start of something historic that will change our sport for the better,” as he said earlier this week.

However, three days in, the CWC, billed by FIFA as the most elite global club competition, has yet to match the pre-tournament hype created by the sport's governing body.

Here's the key talking points after the opening 72 hours at the Club World Cup:

Kickoffs scheduled at noon and 3pm local time on scorching hot summer days have led to players dealing with difficult weather conditions in some fixtures.

In Sunday's PSG vs Atletico group match at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, the temperature was recorded at 31 degrees Celsius (87.8 Fahrenheit) shortly after kick-off at midday local time.

PSG coach Luis Enrique said the heat “had an impact on the game.”

“The rhythm of our play was a bit lower than usual,” Enrique said in a post-match interview.

“We did very very well in difficult conditions,” PSG midfielder Vitinha said.

Every team at the FIFA Club World Cup plays three group matches in the space on nine days.

While that schedule in itself is not unusual for an international competition, the CWC has been subject to criticism from players' unions long before the first kick of the opening game, as it comes off the back of a long domestic and international season in Europe and the Middle East for many clubs, while others – from the US, South America and Oceania – have hit pause on their regular seasons and will return to their respective leagues after the Club World Cup.

“The decision to schedule the FIFA Club World Cup between June 15 and July 13 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives,” FIFPRO – the global union representing professional football players – said in a statement when the tournament schedule was released in 2024.

“The extreme mental and physical pressures at the pinnacle of the game is the principal concern of players with multiple club and national team competitions, leading to exhaustion, physical injuries, mental health issues, diminished performance, and risks to career longevity,” the statement added.

FIFPRO called for the consideration of player health and safety regulations as a “matter of urgency” but that failed to deter FIFA from tinkering with the schedule.

FIFA says the protection of player welfare has always been at the core of its decision-making and has taken multiple tangible initiatives – many of them in close cooperation with FIFPRO, according to FIFA's press office – for the effective betterment of player welfare on several levels, including an additional player substitution at Club World Cup matches as well as a concussion substitute.

On heat management for players during CWC fixtures, FIFA will enact cooling breaks in the 30th and 75th minutes if the wet bulb globe temperature exceeds 32°C (89.6°F), according to FIFA's pre-existing international tournament guidelines.

Bayern Munich made history at the FIFA Club World Cup on Sunday as they became the first team to score double digits in a single game when they thumped Auckland City, a club made up of semi-pro players with full-time day jobs, 10-0.

The 34-time German champions, fielding a full-strength team, scored four goals in the first 21 minutes of the game in front of a hapless Auckland defence.

Add to it the fact that the fixture seemed more of a practice outing than a challenge for the Bundesliga side, with Bayern coach Vincent Kompany saying: “The next game against Boca Juniors will be the highlight of the group stage.”

While minnows and favourites are often pitted together in global tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, Auckland City – the Oceania champions and rated 4,957th in the world in the Opta Power Rankings – face strong opposition in their remaining group matches.

After losing to sixth-ranked Bayern Munich, they face 24th-ranked Portuguese side Benfica and Argentinian mega club Boca Juniors, who are ranked 131.

The next-lowest ranked clubs – Al Ain, Urawa Reds, Wydad Casablanca and Ulsan HD – are due to play their opening round matches on Tuesday and Wednesday.

While Messi-mania brought the crowds in the tournament opener in Miami on June 14, and European champions PSG thrashed Atletico Madrid in front of 80,000 Los Angeles fans at the famous Rose Bowl a day later, the same cannot be said for some of the other fixtures in the opening three days.

Monday's Chelsea vs LAFC encounter at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta was played out in front of 22,137 spectators – less than one-third of the stadium's 75,000 seat capacity.

Post-match, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, when asked to describe the atmosphere in Atlanta, said: “I think the environment was a bit strange.”

The Chelsea-LAFC encounter was not the only fixture to experience a low turnout.

On Monday, a Group C match between Flamengo and Esperance de Tunis attracted 25,797 fans to Philadelphia's 69,000-seat Lincoln Financial Field, representing a 37.4% attendance rate.

A Group B match on Sunday between Botafogo and Seattle Sounders, played at the 69,000-seat Lumens Field in Seattle, drew 30,151 spectators, or 43.7% of maximum spectator capacity, according to official match figures.

Also on Sunday, the 82,500-capacity MetLife Stadium, the venue for the FIFA Club World Cup final, was filled with 46,275 fans for the Group A clash between Palmeiras and Porto, representing 56.1% of the arena's maximum spectator capacity.

Of the remaining 36 group-stage games, 13 will be weekday afternoon kickoffs and it remains to be seen whether underwhelming ticket sales at some venues will continue throughout the first phase of the tournament.

FIFA has disclosed that fans from more than 130 countries have booked tickets to attend CWC matches and the organisation said on Tuesday that close to 1.5 million tickets had been sold.

...

“The environment,” Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca said, “was a bit strange.” When his team debuted Monday at the 2025 Club World Cup, a tournament FIFA has billed as a soccer “pinnacle,” Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Maresca noted, “was almost empty.” Even when late arrivers trickled in, there were around 50,000 unfilled seats in Atlanta. Elsewhere, through four days, a majority of the tournament's 12 games haven't reached half capacity; and none have been sellouts.

The swaths of empty seats have been a stain on the new-look Club World Cup, and have sparked debate around a simple question: Why?

The simplest answer is that FIFA, with “alarming” ticket prices and flawed messaging, priced out or put off significant chunks of would-be fans.

Diehard supporters of clubs from South America and Africa have taken to the tournament. But not all of them could afford (or were allowed) to travel to the U.S. for games. Local appetite, meanwhile, was misread by FIFA and beset by the perception that this Club World Cup is a “cash grab.”

And so, there were only 22,137 people at Mercedes-Benz Stadium to see Chelsea vs. LAFC, the first-ever “competitive” match between an MLS club and a European power. There were 30,151 at Lumen Field for Seattle Sounders vs. Botafogo — fewer than the Sounders average for MLS matches. There were 11,974 at the same stadium for River Plate vs. Urawa Reds two days later, and 3,412 in Orlando for Mamelodi Sundowns vs. Ulsan HD.

“If in America you fill soccer stadiums for friendly games, then when you come with a World Cup, with the best players to win a competition, for sure [stadiums will be full],” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in April.

But he was wrong. The following is an attempt to explain why.

The Club World Cup has averaged 36,126 fans at its first 12 games, and in a vacuum, that's not a terrible number. It's not the 53,191 average attendance at the 2022 World Cup, nor the 52,314 at Euro 2024, nor the 49,406 at last summer's Copa América. But it's a decent draw that's featured fun atmospheres in New Jersey and Miami.

The problem is that 10 of 12 games have been played at NFL stadiums or the Rose Bowl.

Overall, per FIFA's announced attendances and listed stadium capacities, only 54% of seats have been full.

The explanation for the empty 46% is twofold:

1. FIFA executives, reportedly bucking advice from their U.S.-based staff, chose to host most of the tournament at massive American football stadiums rather than smaller MLS grounds.

2. Their initial ticket prices for the Club World Cup, a start-up tournament, were among the most expensive for any major soccer tournament, ever.

When FIFA first released tickets in December, the cheapest for the opener were $223 (including Ticketmaster fees, but before taxes). Many upper-deck seats at a majority of group-stage games cost upwards of $100.

The prices were "alarming," Bailey Brown, president of the Independent Supporters Council, a group representing soccer fans across the U.S. and Canada, told Yahoo Sports in an email at the time. They fell in line with a uniquely American trend of soccer organizations trying to milk as much money out of people as possible. Brown was “genuinely concerned” that “many of the most passionate fans will be priced out of enjoying the sport” as a result.

Months later, with sales lagging, amid increasingly desperate attempts to drum up interest for the Club World Cup, FIFA slashed most prices. Of the 39 group games for which sufficient and analogous data was available on Ticketmaster, 33 had seen prices drop by at least 25% since December; only two had seen prices increase by at least 20%. In late May, tickets to 26 of the 48 group games were available for less than $50.

But still, many weren't selling. Why?

Because FIFA, it seems, did not promote the tournament properly.

The Club World Cup has been plagued all along by resistance from the European soccer establishment. When Infantino and FIFA finally powered through the resistance, scored a Saudi-backed broadcast deal, and got the competition up and running, they had to sell it to a skeptical public.

Their apparent strategy revolved around a fancy trophy and Infantino, who would simply state, again and again, that the Club World Cup would be the biggest and best tournament imaginable.

It would feature “the 32 best clubs and best players from all over the world,” Infantino said at December's draw. “Two, three, four million fans will be coming to the U.S.; four, five billion will be watching from home.”

Never mind that plugged-in fans knew none of this was necessarily true.

Casuals, on the other hand, had heard these types of bombastic claims before, from promoters of preseason events like the International Champions Cup. What the ICC successfully sold for several years was a chance for U.S. fans to see soccer's biggest clubs in the flesh. What FIFA had to explain to those same fans was why the Club World Cup was not just another summer exhibition.

And FIFA never really did that. It sent Infantino on a media tour in April, and he kept making the overhyped claims. A relentless digital advertising campaign screamed “THE BEST v THE BEST.” A social media push featured influencers outlining why the Club World Cup would be “the biggest sports tournament of the summer.” FIFA rarely engaged with traditional soccer media; never directly confronted criticism; and never went beyond the surface level to detail its vision or rationale for the tournament.

So, its messaging felt empty, and its credibility — already low among Western fans — wore thin.

The irony is that many critical thinkers have come around on the concept of the Club World Cup. Many believe that, over time, as fans see that players care, fans themselves will care, and the tournament's popularity will grow. This is the arc of any unproven competition. It's currently happening with the UEFA Nations League. It can happen with this one.

The problem is that FIFA priced it, and talked about it, like a proven tournament.

And now, rather than full stadiums converting skeptics, empty seats are reinforcing the perception that these matches are empty of meaning — even as many players say the opposite.

They are most meaningful, it seems, in South America and Africa. In Argentina and Tunisia, and in other countries home to participating teams, the Club World Cup is front-page news. But, for many people in those countries and elsewhere:

A vacation to America is unaffordable.

The Trump administration's unwelcoming rhetoric has made such a trip less appealing.

A U.S. visa might be difficult to obtain.

It's impossible to gauge the impact of those three factors. But consider the story of Gamal Hosni, a 28-year-old who lives in Cairo and adores Al Ahly, Inter Miami's opponent in Saturday's opener. “I really wanted to go, man,” Hosni told Yahoo Sports in a video interview. So, he says, he applied for a visitor visa, and paid the $185 fee. But his application was denied; he was forced to cancel his plans, and instead watch the game from home at 3 a.m.

With some foreign fans restricted, attendance has largely depended on the U.S. market. Thus far, expats from Egypt, Brazil, Argentina, Tunisia and elsewhere have turned up. But the stark reality is that most sports fans in the U.S. have never heard of Espérance Tunis or Ulsan HD or Botafogo.

Perhaps they've heard of Chelsea. But Chelsea has now come to the U.S. four straight summers. So has Real Madrid. Manchester City has been here three of the last four. Bayern Munich, Atlético Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Juventus have also visited recently. Their presence is no longer novel; and when they come on preseason tours, their opponents are often better — or at least more famous.

Still, it is stunning that Chelsea's 12 preseason friendlies (excluding a double-header) averaged over 50,000 fans, and never drew fewer than 32,724, whereas its Club World Cup opener drew 22,137.

A significant factor in Atlanta, and on Tuesday in New Jersey and Seattle, were the kickoff times: 3 p.m. or noon on a weekday.

The reason for those: FIFA prefers to schedule each game in a unique broadcast window to maximize total viewership.

Doing so comes at the expense of the match-going fan, which is a defensible tradeoff; in some sense, it makes the games more accessible. The baffling choice was to still ask fans to pay premium prices for tickets — plus around $30 for parking at some stadiums, $30 for a drink and food, and perhaps a vacation day.

That, in a nutshell, is why many seats have been empty.

FIFA did not respond to a pre-tournament interview request nor to questions about its ticketing strategy.

It said in a news release Tuesday that “close to 1.5 million tickets” have so far been sold. Across 63 games, that would be less than 40% of the roughly 4 million cumulative capacity.

Shaka Hislop say he was "wrong" about his early scepticism of the Club World Cup after the first few games of the tournament. (1:28)

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is off and running, with four strong days of fun and drama already in the books. Let's get you caught up with what you missed and what's ahead today and tomorrow.

Check in with ESPN as we bring you the latest news and analysis, all the way up to the tournament final at MetLife Stadium on July 13.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Some of the talk around the Club World Cup has been about the possibility of European teams sweeping all before them and turning the knockout rounds into the latter stages of the UEFA Champions League. But against Borussia Dortmund, Fluminense showed that such narratives might be wide of the mark.

The Brazilian side -- beaten Club World Cup finalists in 2023 -- were the better team on Tuesday at a rainy MetLife Stadium and were unfortunate to come away from MetLife Stadium in New Jersey with just a point after a 0-0 draw. Despite having less of the ball, Fluminense peppered eventual "Superior Player Award" winner Gregor Kobel with 14 shots, forcing five saves in a relentless performance.

Afterward, Dortmund boss Niko Kovac referenced the pitch and the humidity as reasons his players found it difficult. "The pitch isn't so easy for us. I think the humidity also wasn't so easy for all the players, although the Brazilians are more used to it," he said. "It was hard for us, we were running a lot, but overall we can live with a point."

In reality, Fluminense were just better and would have won but for a stunning double save from Kobel in the second half. After Dortmund failed to credibly clear a looping, outswinging corner, Kobel did brilliantly to get down low and parry Everaldo's curling shot from the edge of the box, recovering in time to spread out and block Nonato's follow-up shot from the rebound at close range.

Jobe Bellingham made his debut for Dortmund, putting in a breezy half-hour cameo as a second half substitute, but it was in many ways a fortunate escape for the Bundesliga side to emerge with a clean sheet and a draw ahead of arguably easier matches, with relative minnows Ulsan HD and Mamelodi Sundowns still to come in Group F.

One factor which maybe helped Fluminense is the timing of the tournament. They're 11 games into their domestic season, while Dortmund are coming off a tough campaign that saw them play 50 matches. It's perhaps no wonder that Fluminense looked fitter and fresher. -- Rob Dawson

MIAMI -- Inter Miami will continue to navigate the Club World Cup group stage with a weakened roster as Yannick Bright, David Ruiz and Allen Obando trained separately from the group in the days leading up to the match against FC Porto in Atlanta. Bright and Ruiz failed to make the matchday roster for the team's inaugural Club World Cup game against Al Ahly, while Obando watched from the bench as Miami drew 0-0.

There is good news for head coach Javier Mascherano and Inter Miami fans, as Jordi Alba returned to training for the first time since suffering a hamstring injury in the MLS match against CF Montreal on May 28. The former Barcelona player left the pitch in the 24th minute of that game and has been absent since, leaving the backline vulnerable.

Mascherano will address the media Wednesday before kickoff at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on June 19 and confirm whether the player is ready to feature, but his return to the training ground bodes well. Alba's inclusion in the starting lineup would free Noah Allen to return to the center back position and partner with Maximiliano Falcón as the two have done countless times this year.

Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Sergio Busquets trained as normal with the team leading up to the second group-stage match, seeing no health-related issues. As the tournament progresses, the team's roster could get deeper despite the lack of signings made during the limited transfer window. -- Lizzy Becherano

PHILADELPHIA -- It's a sign of how seriously Manchester City are taking this tournament that their schedule around games will closely match their preparation for Champions League fixtures.

Pep Guardiola likes his players to train at the CFA in Manchester in the morning the day before a European game. Players and staff will then usually travel later in the day after the session is finished. Guardiola and his staff have asked for the same schedule for the Club World Cup: City trained at their base at Lynn University in Boca Raton on Tuesday morning before a three-hour flight to Philadelphia in the afternoon ahead of their game against Wydad AC on Wednesday.

The only difference for City will be in their recovery. For Champions League games, players will usually stay over in the city the night of the game before traveling back to Manchester the following day. In the U.S., City have organized to return to Boca Raton immediately after each game. The idea is that the team hotel will be more comfortable for rest, recovery and relaxation rather than having the odd night in many different places. -- Dawson

PASADENA, Calif. -- Monterrey were excellent in their debut at the 2025 Club World Cup, taking a valuable point against Inter Milan, who came into the match as clear favorites but were surprised by the Liga MX team in their first match.

The difference of more than US$800 million in quality between the two teams wasn't reflected on the scoreboard, in a pulsating game that ended 1-1.

Rayados' goal was only ever going to come from one man, someone who appears in the toughest and most necessary moments: Sergio Ramos. The former Real Madrid star capitalized on a corner kick that came from a move against his own team, which ended with a shot blocked by Lucas Ocampos. Oliver Torres' corner was sent into the center of the penalty area, where Ramos rose unmarked and headed an effort that Inter keeper Yann Sommer had no chance of reaching.

The Nerazzurri found their equalizer five minutes before half-time thanks to a free kick which found Lautaro Martínez alone inside the box, who only had to tap the ball in.

Rayados goalkeeper Esteban Andrada, who was at his best during the first half and silenced the criticism that has surrounded him from some Monterrey fans, saved a number of important chances. Stefan Medina came close to scoring Rayados' second goal with a mid-range shot that hit the base of the post and rattled the metal. In the end both teams had to settle for a point. -- Ricardo Carino

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- "This was a park before?!" Dean Huijsen sounded surprised. Real Madrid's base camp at The Gardens North County District Park, Palm Beach Gardens -- where the team is training for the first half of this Club World Cup -- now looks like an elite performance venue. The players work on two side-by-side football pitches -- built in accordance with FIFA standards -- with impeccable surfaces. The fields are flanked by temporary buildings, huge, tented pavilions housing a gym and other equipment. Squint, and the players could be back home in Valdebebas, Madrid, not a community park outside Palm Beach.

"They've made great training facilities out of it," defender Huijsen told journalists Tuesday. "It's Real Madrid, so it's the best of the best." Midfielder Dani Ceballos described it as "one of the best [training venues] we've had here in the United States." Security is tight. Local police help to control access, ensuring only accredited personnel get in. The site has previously hosted MLS clubs, and even international teams, but staff said they've never seen anything like the interest generated by Madrid. Each day, fans gather outside, hoping for a glimpse of the players.

The only downside is the distance. The site is half an hour from the team's hotel, the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach, and over an hour from Hard Rock Stadium, where Madrid play Al Hilal. It's a journey coach Xabi Alonso had to make Tuesday, between morning training and giving his afternoon news conference at the stadium. "I'm excited," he said, reflecting on his impending debut as Madrid coach.

"It's good to train, and to talk, but the game will tell us a lot." -- Alex Kirkland

Alex Kirkland explains what we learned from Xabi Alonso's pre-match press conference ahead of taking charge of Real Madrid for the first time vs. Al Hilal.

ORLANDO, Fla. -- For those who enjoy random football, Tuesday's clash between Ulsan and Mamelodi Sundowns in Orlando was full of curious stories. From the South African fans creating a party atmosphere outside the stadium, to the delay in the start of the match due to weather conditions, the two teams delivered a full package for their supporters.

The Inter&Co Stadium was not that full. In fact, quite the opposite. Only 3,412 spectators were present at the venue, which has a maximum capacity of 25,000 people.

Still, the South African party is worth highlighting. Even with long hours of travel to the United States, Mamelodi Sundowns fans did not stop singing and dancing for a minute.

The songs were only interrupted by the match organizers just as the ball was about to roll. But for a fair reason. The threat of a storm caused the start of the game to be delayed by just over an hour, causing everyone to leave the stands.

On the field, the highlight was the bold South African team. The Pretorians were superior from start to finish and, thanks to a goal from Iqraam Rayners, won 1-0 to take the lead in Group F. -- Thiago D'Amaral

ATLANTA -- Chelsea's win over LAFC on Monday raised questions about the merits of the Club World Cup given that Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium was less than a third full, but it seems one of the tournament's idiosyncrasies has gone down well with the squad.

Before every game, each member of the starting lineup is introduced to the crowd and walks out alone, in a departure from the usual custom of the entire starting lineup entering the field together. Blues midfielder Romeo Lavia was particularly taken with the innovation.

"It's something special and new for us," he said. "It's a first, I enjoyed it. Why not bring it to the Premier League?" Pushed on that suggestion, Lavia immediately thought of a reason why it might not work. "I mean, it's a bit of a showbiz thing, isn't it? The only difference is [if we did it in the Premier League], we might get a bit cold because once you're out there, you have to wait for the other players."

High temperatures across the U.S. during some matches have led to some player complaints, but Lavia knows there's nothing like the English weather to rain on a parade. -- James Olley

River Plate entered Lumen Field in Seattle carrying high expectations as they kicked off their Club World Cup campaign against Japanese side and AFC representative Urawa Red Diamonds. Marcelo Gallardo's side clearly enjoyed a numerical advantage in the stands -- much like their bitter rivals Boca Juniors had the day before in Miami against Benfica -- and the sea of red and white may have played a role in River's 3-1 victory.

Much of the attention pregame was placed on teenage sensation Franco Mastantuono -- he will join Real Madrid when he turns 18 in August -- who started on the right wing. But it was on the opposite flank where another player stole the headlines.

Los Millonarios took an early lead when Marcos Acuña's cross found left winger Facundo Colidio, who headed past Shusaku Nishikawa. River continued to press in the second half and former Austin FC forward Sebastián Driussi added a second with another header. However, the goal proved bittersweet, as he fell awkwardly while beating Nishikawa to the loose ball and was forced off with an apparent lower leg injury. They'll be hoping for positive news on their star forward if they're to make good progress in this competition.

Urawa pulled one back shortly when Yusuke Matsuo converted a penalty past Franco Armani, but River responded swiftly -- another header -- as Maximiliano Meza nodded in another Acuña cross to seal a crucial win. The result ensured that all six CONMEBOL clubs remained unbeaten after their opening group stage matches.

River Plate's next test will be against Monterrey in what could be a decisive clash in Group E, while Urawa face a daunting challenge against Champions League runners-up Internazionale. -- Roberto Rojas

We could have well had our first upset of the Club World Cup on Tuesday, with Fluminense far superior against their more fancied opponents Dortmund.

The game ended in a 1-1 draw but, had Schwarzgelben keeper Gregor Kobel not been in such fine form, the result could have been a blowout in the Brazilians' favor. -- Mike Wise

Odds (via ESPN BET): Man City (-2500), Draw (+1400), Wydad AC (+2900)

Manchester City should be too strong for Wydad AC regardless of the team picked by Guardiola. Still, all eyes will be on his team selection to see which of the summer signings are thrown in right from the start as Rayan Aït-Nouri, Rayan Cherki and Tijjani Reijnders could all make their City debuts at Lincoln Financial Field.

Fans will be most excited to see 21-year-old Cherki, particularly after his thrilling international debut for France against Spain earlier this month, but it's Reijnders and Aït-Nouri could have the biggest immediate impact. City were crying out for energy and goals in midfield last season, and Reijnders should provide both. Meanwhile, Guardiola has also not worked with a specialist left back for nearly four years, while Aït-Nouri was one of the best left backs in the Premier League last season. -- Dawson

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

Odds: Real Madrid (-320), Draw (+475), Al Hilal (+650)

Finally: the first game of the Xabi Alonso era. The big doubt might be the availability of Kylian Mbappé -- he missed training on Tuesday with a fever -- but it's far from the only one.

Will Alonso play with three center backs, as he often did at Bayer Leverkusen? It seems unlikely, given fitness doubts over Éder Militão, Antonio Rüdiger and David Alaba. Are new additions Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen ready to play from the start? But more than formations or names, the fundamental question is this: After just nine days' training with the players, will this look like an Alonso team? -- Kirkland

Odds: Pachuca (+175), Draw (+225), Salzburg (+150)

CF Pachuca qualified to the Club World Cup when winning the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup, and will now face FC Salzburg to kick off their competition. To prepare, the Liga MX team signed seven reinforcements: Sebastián Jurado (FC Juárez), Agustín Palavecino (Necaxa), Federico Pereira (Toluca), Brian García (Toluca), Avilés Hurtado (FC Juárez), Víctor Guzmán (Chivas) and Robert Kenedy (Real Valladolid). Four of the seven players will only join the team for the Club World Cup, emphasizing the importance team ownership placed on this international competition.

Pachuca also hired Jaime Lozano as the newest head coach, strengthening every aspect of the roster. Despite a disappointing Liga MX Clausura campaign, qualifying to the playoffs in eighth place on the table before losing in the quarterfinals to Club America, the team will now look for a fresh start on the world's stage. -- Becherano

Odds: Al Ain (+1000), Draw (+550), Juventus (-550)

Igor Tudor arrived at Juventus in midseason with a simple task: get the Bianconeri into a Champions League spot after the psychodrama of the Thiago Motta tenure. He accomplished the mission with more substance than style, and at first, it appeared he might stick around for the Club World Cup before making way for a long-term successor. Yet the club, perhaps due to a lack of alternatives, opted to retain him, giving him a multiyear deal. Now he can make his mark straight away. Expect his trademark three-man defense, with Timothy Weah and Weston McKennie in the starting XI as well.

Al Ain, the Emirati champions, often get overshadowed by their neighbors in Saudi Arabia. Underestimate them at your own peril. They won the Asian Champions League in 2024, they have a top-shelf keeper in Rui Patrício (formerly of Roma and Wolves) and they boast a center forward, Togo's Kodjo Laba, with 113 goals in his past 119 games. (They also have a young fullback named Gino Infantino. (No relation ... we think!) -- Gab Marcotti

It's been just 18 days since Inter Milan played its last game, losing to Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League final. But a lot has happened since then.

The team parted ways with manager Simone Inzaghi, who led it to two European finals in three seasons, and replaced him with Cristian Chivu. It temporarily lost the services of forward Mehdi Taremi, who had returned to his native Iran earlier this month and became stranded there when Israeli attacks closed the airspace over much of the Mideast.

Then the rest of the second-best club in Europe traveled 6,000 miles from Milan to Los Angeles, where it opened the FIFA Club World Cup on Tuesday in a 1-1 draw with Mexican club Monterrey before an announced crowd of 40,311 at the Rose Bowl.

At a time when many other professional sports teams in Los Angeles are staying silent amid ICE raids, Angel City is using its platform to support immigrants.

“We're trying to focus. And it's not easy every day, I'm not going to lie,” said forward Marcus Thuram, whose 18 goals in all competition was second on the team this season. “But it's part of what we do, we love what we do and we'll continue doing what we do.”

Only doing what they do has become far more complicated and exhausting in recent years as the competition schedule for both club and country has expanded.

Thuram's father, Lilian, was widely regarded as one of the best defenders of his era during an 18-year career that saw him win two Serie A titles, a European championship and play in two World Cup finals, winning one. But he appeared in 46 or more club matches in a season just four times before retiring in 2008.

His 27-year-old son has done that in each of the past two seasons. And if Inter makes it to the final of the Club World Cup, he'll wind up playing 55 games in 11 months. That doesn't count his 10 appearances for the French national team since last June.

“We were prepared for that at the beginning of the season. It's not like they announced that at the end of the season,” Thuram, who came off the bench early in the second half Tuesday, said of the Club World Cup. “We knew it was going to be a long season.”

But how long is too long? In their ravenous quest for revenue, soccer clubs, leagues and governing bodies have crowded the calendar with invented competitions that have drained both fans' bank accounts and players' energy levels.

The Club World Cup is a perfect example. Although the tournament has been around since 2000, before this summer it never had more than eight teams and was held at one site during a 10-day break in the European season. This year it's expanded into a 32-team, monthlong competition that will be played in 11 cities spread across a continent.

“The goal is to tell the American public who we are and what values have always guided us. It's not about proving how good we are.”

— Giuseppe Marotta, CEO of Inter Milan, on the team's participation in the Club World Cup

If Inter Milan makes it to next month's final, its players will have just a couple of weeks off before reporting to training camp for the next Serie A season, which opens Aug. 23. With the World Cup also expanding next summer, national team players such as Thuram could play more than 70 games in 44 weeks and more than 120 games over two seasons.

That's clearly unsustainable.

“A serious dialogue is needed between FIFA, UEFA, leagues, clubs and players to redesign an international calendar that protects the health of players and maintains the quality of games,” said Giuseppe Marotta, chairman and chief executive officer  of Inter Milan. “With the introduction of the new Champions League format and the new Club World Cup, the workload on teams and players has clearly increased significantly.”

Yet clubs such as Inter Milan, Paris Saint-Germain (which played 58 games this season) and Manchester City (57 games) are drawn to the extra competitions for the same reason as the organizers who put them on: the money. The Club World Cup, now the largest and most ambitious global club tournament in history, is also the most lucrative, with a prize-money purse of $1 billion. The winner could take home $125 million, more than PSG got for winning the Champions League.

But it was forced into a gap in the schedule that really didn't exist before.

 LAFC 

Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez score for Chelsea as LAFC 10-game unbeaten streak across all competition ends in a 2-0 loss in the FIFA Club World Cup.

“It's undeniable that this event, positioned between two different seasons, is forcing us to do extra work and rethink what the traditional summer periods looks like for a football club,” Marotta said. “However these competitions also represent a huge opportunity in terms of visibility and revenue, often exceeding that of traditional competitions.”

The Club World Cup allows teams to face rivals from other continents, expanding their international following and generating additional revenue streams by planting the team's flag in new markets and introducing its players to new fans.

“The goal is to tell the American public who we are and what values have always guided us,” Marotta said.

“It's not about proving how good we are,” he added of the tournament. “It's about contributing to the development of global football.”

To accommodate it, Marotta said, changes will have to be made. For example Italy's Serie A could compact from 20 to 18 teams, the same as in the German Bundesliga and France's Ligue 1. That would mean four fewer league games per year; not a dramatic reduction, but a start.

Until that happens, Thuram said the players will continue doing what they do for as long as they can do it.

“It's about doing everything every day to prepare your body for these extreme games and extreme competition. Because soccer at the highest level is extreme for the body. It's tough,” he said. “But we have a lot of coaches, we have chefs, we have everything that is set up for us perfectly.”

As for the game,  Milan dominated statistically, controlling the ball for more than 55 of the 90 minutes and outshooting Monterrey 15-9. But it  couldn't make that advantage count.

All the scoring came in a 20-minute span of the first half with the ageless Sergio Ramos putting Monterrey in front with a header in the 25th minute and Lautaro Martinez pulling that back for Milan  three minutes before the intermission.

Former Belleview tennis star DJ Bennett made history in making the NCAA singles tournament final the for Auburn Tigers in November. Previously, making the final round earned collegiate players an automatic bid to the U.S. Open main draw. However, due to College International Tennis Association's changes to the NCAA collegiate tennis schedule, Bennett instead earned a bid to the 2025 American Collegiate Wildcard Playoff.

Bennett joins world No. 262 Mary Stoiana of Texas A&M, Amelia Honer of UCSB and Valerie Glozman of Stanford in the hunt for the American Collegiate Wild Card Playoffs singles division bid, but she's the only competitor to qualify for singles and doubles.

“We're really proud of come out of the, you know, Belleview area is pretty amazing, because it's not a hotbed of tennis in Florida,” DJ's father Steve Bennett said.

On Monday evening, June 16, Bennett, the third seed based on ATP or WTA rankings, was defeated in the singles semifinals. However, she'll have several chances to qualify for the US Open singles bracket with the tournaments she's scheduled to compete in the summer.

Meanwhile, Bennett's shot for a doubles spot in the US Open is alive and well. Auburn teammate Ava Hrastar joined Bennet in a 6-4, 6-3 win over South Carolina's Sarah Hamner and Kaitlyn Carnicella in a long-awaited rubber match.

Bennett and Hrastar, the first seed in the double's tournament bracket, will play the winner of UCLA's Olivia Center and Kate Fakih and North Carolina's Reese Brantmeier and Alanis Hamilton on Thursday night, with a chance to advance to the US Open open before her senior year of college on the line.

I've been to Paris more times than I can count, but this trip felt totally different. For once, I wasn't packing loafers or my usual button-downs—I was packing tennis shorts. It was my first time going to Roland Garros, and instead of dressing up in my classic Parisian fits, I found myself courtside in full Wilson gear and hitting on the red clay at a nearby tennis club. It felt refreshing, honestly. The trip was less about sitting pretty at a café, and more about actually moving in clothes that could handle shoulder season's unpredictable temps and still look good for a post-workout espresso. 

Wilson's latest Sport Professionals collection was launched with Roland‑Garros firmly in mind—designed to feel at home on clay but polished enough for everything off court. It was inspired by late-'90s aesthetics: so color blocking, and clean lines that pop against the red clay. But it has 2025 features like moisture-wicking fabrics, stink-fighting knits, and extra stretch. It feels dressier than last year's Challengers-core craze, which is much more in my style wheelhouse. However, what really stands out is how easy these pieces feel in so many settings. They kept me warm and dry on overcast afternoons, but still kept me looking and feeling cool during warm mid-day strolls along the Seine.

Out of everything Wilson sent me, three pieces stood out right away: the Elite Tennis Performance Jacket, Peak Tennis Short, and the Daily Court Polo. They ladder up to Wilson's vintage-meets-modern vibe that doesn't feel like a costume. Together, the look had a tailored vibe that I'd easily wear in the city. In fact, a colleague said I looked like an Alfred Hitchcock character (flex). 

Let's talk performance. The jacket was the MVP for me. Paris weather in late spring is famously unpredictable—one minute it's misty, the next it's muggy—and this layer worked through it all. It kept me dry during a light drizzle, but still felt light and breathable once things warmed up. It was easy to peel off and stuff in my tote without wrinkling, and it moved so well with my body that I forgot I was even wearing a layer. The tailored fit also gave it a cleaner silhouette than most warm-up jackets I've worn. 

The shorts were a little longer than I typically go for (closer to a 7-inch inseam—I'm usually in the 5-inch camp), but the athletic cut kept them looking sharp. I liked that they didn't cling, and the fabric stayed breathable through drills and rallies. They've got deep enough pockets to hold a couple of balls without them bouncing around, and the moisture-wicking fabric actually worked. I stayed pretty dry, even after 30 minutes of sprinting back and forth the court. 

Shop Wilson's Latest Drop

The biggest surprise, though, was the polo. I don't usually wear polos to play, but this one changed my mind. Made from a performance knit, it was soft, breathable, and didn't trap odor, even after hours in the heat. The shoulders fit just right (which never happens with me), and the structured collar actually stayed in place without flopping. It made an activewear polo a whole lot dressier, and made me look like a million bucks while working out. And yes, I did grab a glass of wine afterward in a stylish Parisian neighborhood and didn't feel out of place, something I can't say for most of my workout tees.

What I appreciate most about this collection is its versatility. I wore it all day—on court, courtside, walking through Paris, and even later back home in New York. These pieces look and feel like something more elevated than standard activewear. And after three weeks of wear and a full wash cycle, everything still looks new. No pilling, stretching, or weird shrinkage.

If you're someone who plays seriously, or just likes the idea of looking like you do, this collection checks every box. It's nostalgic but modern, polished but practical—and built to perform whether you're chasing rallies or chasing your dog through Central Park.

The 24-year-old Auger-Aliassime expressed similar sentiments: "I love the German tournaments. At the beginning of the year, I played in Munich, then in Hamburg, in Stuttgart and now in Halle. This is a really great tournament, and I have some good memories here."What makes the tournament in Halle so special is its rural location and, of course, the players' hotel, which is right next to the stadium. "Halle is a nice little town. In the morning, we always try to go and get a coffee, but there's not really much to do here. So I train a lot and spend some relaxing time with my team," said Shapo, as he likes to be called.What particularly struck Auger-Aliassime were the German fans: "They love tennis. It feels like the country has a big interest in the sport. They've had some great champions in the past and some top players today, such as Alexander Zverev," he said."This nation follows tennis. Wherever I play in Germany, people come to watch us train and see the players."

The duo added:We know each other so well, have a good time on court and just enjoy ourselves.As juniors, they won the Wimbledon doubles title together, but winning a senior trophy in doubles is not their main goal—even if it would be a nice bonus, of course. "It's more about us, being on the court together and having fun—even if it would be a nice result. We'll give our best in singles and doubles and try to win as many matches as possible."So it's not just the duo's warm demeanor that captivates tennis fans, but also the special bond they share. It doesn't matter whether they're playing in their home country of Canada, in the USA, Australia or even in Germany—it's just fun to watch them.

On Tuesday, tennis fans reacted with a mix of excitement and surprise as the first 16 teams for the 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles Championship were officially revealed. Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz and former US Open champion Emma Raducanu were a pair that stole headlines.

While many fans were thrilled to see the electric duo of Alcaraz and Raducanu unite, others voiced disappointment that Raducanu had not teamed up with fellow Brit and rising star Jack Draper, currently ranked No. 6 on the ATP Tour.

After winning his opening match at the HSBC Championships on Tuesday, Draper was asked about the decision. “Yeah, I mean, a wise person once told me you should find the best partner, and that's what she did in Alcaraz. I don't blame her at all for that,” Draper said.

“Yeah, I think she will have a lot of fun playing with Carlos. He's obviously the best player in the world, probably right now, along with [Jannik] Sinner. Great at doubles, as well. Saw that with Rafa [Nadal] at the Olympics. She's gone about and chose the best partner, for sure. Hopefully, they do well,” he explained.

Though fans may have hoped for an all-British dream team, Draper is set for a strong pairing of his own alongside WTA World No. 4 Qinwen Zheng. “Qinwen I know from the tour. I have seen her around. Obviously a great player herself and has a really good game,” he said about his partner.

Alcaraz and Raducanu have been respectful of each other for years, and fans have been wanting them to play together for a while. The pair already has a name on social media, “Alcaranu.”

“I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma,” the Spaniard said after defeating the Australian Adam Walton 6-4, 7-6 in the first round at Queen's Club. “I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me – I made that special request.”

Alcaraz added that Raducanu was initially hesitant before saying yes, he recounted with a laugh. “She's going to be the boss,” he said of the 22-year-old. “I've known Emma for a really long time and I have a really good relationship with her. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun.”

The 2025 US Open Mixed Doubles Championship begins August 19 at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, where all eyes will be on the new partnerships. However, the tournament hasn't been without controversy. Several established mixed doubles specialists have criticized the decision to exclude them from the initial lineup, arguing they weren't even offered a wildcard or a chance to compete. Still, despite the pushback, the new format remains in place, at least for now.

 A total of 400 tour-level wins represents a lot of potential favourites to choose from for Daniil Medvedev. 

 The 29-year-old hit the milestone Wednesday by downing Quentin Halys 6-2, 7-5 at the Terra Wortmann Open in Halle. Medvedev, a former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and 20-time tour-level champion, later identified his 2021 US Open final triumph against Novak Djokovic as an obvious win that sticks in his memory. Yet he admitted he found it hard to narrow it down to just one. 

 “Honestly, if I had to choose one, I would say beating Novak to win the US Open, because it's my only Grand Slam [title], but I could easily name like 20 really big ones in different aspects,” Medvedev told ATPTour.com. “For example, I remember a win against Hubi [Hurkacz] in Toronto in 2021. First set, I didn't know what to do. He played good, I didn't play my best, and he was absolutely all over the place and didn't give me any chance. It was 6-2. 

 “I saved a break point early in the second set and I was saying to myself, ‘I'm not playing good, he's playing amazing, there is no way I will win this match'. Then I managed to serve better, I won the tie-break somehow 7/5, finishing with an ace, and then I won Toronto, which gave me a confidence boost. I won the US Open two weeks later.”

 Medvedev's 2-6, 7-6(6), 7-6(5) quarter-final win against Hurkacz in Toronto that year may not be etched in the memory of many fans nearly four years on. Yet the current World No. 11 says he sees his total win tally, and indeed his achievements in tennis as a whole, as a product of such small moments. 

 “There are many wins which by themselves don't really represent anything,” said Medvedev. “But if you didn't have them, maybe you would not have your first title, and you wouldn't have the career you have.” 

 Perhaps more understandably, a 6-3, 6-1 win against Horacio Zeballos on the grass of ‘s-Hertogenbosch in 2016 also sticks in Medvedev's memory. It was his first tour-level victory. 

 “I actually remember Zeballos talking about it to me,” recalled Medvedev. “He said that he just came after Roland Garros, so the transition [from clay to grass] was not easy. He was like, ‘OK, I'm playing some guy who is ranked like 250', so he was kind of happy about it. 

 “Then I beat him good, so that was a fun moment and it was of course a great feeling. I was very young, so it made a lot of adrenalin and emotion come out, and I was very happy about it.”

BERLIN—Tatjana Maria completed a fairytale run in London last Sunday when, as a qualifier, she defeated four successive Top 20 players en route to lifting her biggest career trophy at the Queen's Club.This week, is it Ons Jabeur's turn to rediscover her own winning feeling at a venue where she's been the last woman standing previously?Three years ago, Jabeur captured the Berlin Tennis Open crown before reaching her first of two consecutive Wimbledon finals. Following her semifinal win at the All England Club, the Tunisian memorably pulled Maria out to share the spotlight on Centre Court after defeating the German over three sets.

Three years ago, Jabeur captured the Berlin Tennis Open crown before reaching her first of two consecutive Wimbledon finals. Following her semifinal win at the All England Club, the Tunisian memorably pulled Maria out to share the spotlight on Centre Court after defeating the German over three sets.

Both competitors present games that contrast the modern era's power-forward approach. For Jabeur, her friend's latest title run serves as a sublime reminder that she, too, can slice and dice her way back into the champion's corner.“I was watching a little bit of her matches. I texted her after winning. I'm so happy for her, for her family,” Jabeur tells TENNIS.com.“She's a true example of someone that maybe has struggled lately but is always smiling, always a good spirit outside the court. She's always fighting, which I love about Tatjana. I know she loves the grass, the slicing. It's unbelievable.“I learned a lot from her, especially when she wins against big hitters and the slices are really incredible. I hope I can slice as good as her.”

I've been always taught not to hate something that happened to you. It might be a good thing.

Back in Berlin, Jabeur finds herself with an uncommon identifier next to her name this time around. The former world No. 2 is competing as a lucky loser at an exceptional WTA 500 event that began with nine of the Top 10 in the draw. The opportunity to vye for the title was on the verge of never materializing before Jabeur staved off a pair of match points in her opening qualifying win over Elsa Jacquemot.Having fallen to Wang Xinyu at her next hurdle, Jabeur was ultimately afforded a second chance to continue at the tourmament. Was it luck, a dose of good karma, simply the way it's supposed to work out?“I hope everything. The stars, the good karma, everything is happening. I even forgot about the two match points,” says Jabeur.“I believe in destiny, I believe that everything happens for a reason. I've been always taught not to hate something that happened to you. It might be a good thing. I didn't hate the fact that I lost in the last round of qualifying. To get the lucky loser spot and to continue my path, it's been maybe written out there. Hopefully it's a good one.”

It certainly appears good on the surface so far. Two days after easing past Caroline Dolehide, Jabeur notched a victory that is sure to garner some attention. In a battle of the past two Wimbledon finalists, Jabeur handed fourth seed Jasmine Paolini a 6-1, 6-3 defeat in the Italian's grass season debut.Among the win's significance, it saw Jabeur snap a seven-match losing streak against Top 5 opponents—her first since defeating Aryna Sabalenka in the last four of 2023 Wimbledon. The 30-year-old also ended a three-match skid against Paolini that included a third-round defeat last month in Rome.

Today's match was great. It definitely helps me to get over the past few months.

While Jabeur isn't getting ahead of herself after Wednesday's performance, one can't help but wonder if Steffi Graf Stadium is the perfect place for the tour's resident “Minister of Happiness” to turn up her smile meter back to familiar levels.“I've been pretty successful the last years here in Berlin. It's a nice place, people are pretty chill here,” she shares.“Today's match was great. It definitely helps me to get over the past few months. Hopefully I can be better on the court, find my game better. Jasmine plays unbelievable. I had to take my revenge from the other times we played. I know she's still adapting to grass but I'll definitely take this win.”Jabeur awaits the winner of a Thursday matchup between Diana Shnaider and Marketa Vondrousova. The latter upstaged her for the 2023 Wimbledon championship.

Before the world knew Carlos Alcaraz as a Grand Slam champion and one of the sport's biggest stars, Jaume Munar had a front-row view to his early promise.

“I remember playing him in Marbella,” Munar told ATPTour.com ahead of his second-round clash against Alcaraz at the HSBC Championships “He was a young kid, playing fast and easy. Back then, he couldn't always manage the moment and made a few more mistakes. But you could already see how talented he was, with so much power in every shot.”

That meeting came in April 2021, when a then-17-year-old Alcaraz was making his first significant strides on the ATP Tour. Munar won the match in straight sets at the clay-court ATP 250, but even in victory, he walked away impressed.

“I just remember the power that came from his shots. Just the aggressive play, the lack of time, the movement. I won the match but I knew he would come to the top,” Munar reflected.

On Thursday, the pair meets for the fourth time (2-1 Alcaraz) in the second round in London but Alcaraz is a different proposition to the one four years ago. Now a five-time major champion and at No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, the Spaniard, alongside Jannik Sinner, is the leading man in men's tennis.

Munar is proud of his countryman's rise and believes his down-to-earth demeanour has been important to his success.

“I have a good relationship with Carlos,” Munar said. “I'm about six or seven years older than him, so we didn't spend much time together when we were younger. But since he joined the tour, we've had a very good connection.

“He's an extremely nice guy. Down to earth, a fantastic person. Not just a great tennis player. He's the kind of personality that's really good for the sport, and also great for Spain and his personality has helped him I think.”

For Spanish tennis, which is entering a new era following the retirement of Rafael Nadal, the emergence of Alcaraz as a figurehead is especially significant.
“After Rafa, we still have a top figure in the sport, which is huge,” Munar said. “I've had a close relationship with Rafa since I was a kid, we're friends and I've spent a lot of time with him.
“I know Rafa better, but for Spain, it's special to have someone like Carlos at the top now. We've always had great players, but we also have to recognise the value of having someone leading the way like he is.”
While Alcaraz has become a staple at the top of the game, Munar is quietly putting together a consistent season. The World No. 59 reached semi-finals in Hong Kong and Dallas and the fourth round at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome.
Now the 28-year-old is determined to find the winning formula on grass, a surface on which he has won just four tour-level matches.
“I love this tournament. It's a special time of year, leading into Wimbledon and playing in a historic tournament like this at Queen's,” Munar said. “It's probably the month I enjoy most during the season.
“I'm feeling good. For the past couple of years I've been trying to make some changes to get better on grass. I think I did, and honestly, I'm feeling comfortable. It's definitely one of the more difficult surfaces for us because we only play on it for three or four weeks a year, so it's not easy to find rhythm. But this year, I've had quite a few practise sessions already. I started last Tuesday, so I've had a full week, and I'm feeling great.”

Those changes include tweaks and tactical shifts designed to help him adapt to the speed of grass.
“I changed the strings, which is important here. I play with natural gut, which I don't use the rest of the year, so I need a few days to adjust, but it helps a lot,” Munar said. “There's the movement, which is very difficult on grass. I've also adjusted my tactics. I am trying to play a bit more aggressively, moving forward more than usual. I think I'm really starting to feel comfortable in this type of setup.”
Munar will hope it all comes together when he meets the 2023 Queen's Club champion in the second round on Thursday. The 28-year-old was ‘honest' when reflecting on his chances but believes he has the ability to hurt the 22-year-old on the London lawns. 
“Honestly, my chances are low. That's the reality,” Munar said. “But if I have to face Carlos, doing it on a surface where he hasn't had much preparation is the best-case scenario for me. It's going to be a big challenge, but if I can play my best and he's not at his peak, I might have a chance. That's why we compete. That's why we're here.”
Regardless of the outcome, Munar knows this is more than just a match. It's a checkpoint in his own journey on the surface.
“Beyond the result, it's also a good benchmark, to see where my game is on grass right now,” Munar said. “Carlos is a former Wimbledon champion, so it's a great opportunity to test myself and understand where I can improve. I see it as a challenge, and after tomorrow, we'll see how it went and what's next.”

Hey, everyone …

• Here's this week's Served podcast featuring special guest Darren Cahill:

• Good soldiering: Surviving Ohio State premiered Tuesday on HBO.

• I talked docs and tennis with the great Richard Deitsch.

• Wimbledon targets India.

• The 2026 U.S. Open “ball crew”—note the strategic omission of the words “boy,” “girl” or “kid”—tryouts are here.  

Onward …

Hi Jon,

Thank you for the mailbag as always.

The ceremony for [Rafael Nadal] at Roland Garros, the venue of his greatest achievements, was entirely fitting and wonderful to watch. It got me thinking of [Roger] Federer and [Andy] Murray, who had similarly fitting farewells at the Laver Cup and Wimbledon. They were all honoured in the places you might call their spiritual tennis homes.

It got me thinking of [Novak] Djokovic, whose own retirement is edging closer one way or another. Where would his grand send-off likely be? Australia is arguably the place of his greatest triumphs, but it is on another continent, and they also blocked his entry at one point. He deserves every bit the same honour, and has won in insane numbers pretty much everywhere. And yet nowhere is quite his.

I wonder if these thoughts entered his mind too? What are your thoughts?

Beate, London

• Great question. To be clear: We should all hope this ceremony is in 2040. It's Djokovic's decision. No one is pushing him out the door. But eventually, he'll retire and it's fair to speculate how and where.

You're quite right to note that while Djokovic saw his greatest (and first) success in Australia, it's too fraught. He's not going to hold his valedictory in the same country that detained and deported him. It's also too far—geographically and in terms of time zones—from his base in Europe.	

Djokovic has no real Laver Cup brand extension. He can't go to Roland Garros after Rafa-fest 2025. Wimbledon is an option—don't look now but Djokovic has won seven titles at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, as many as Pete Sampras. And only seven fewer than Federer—but that seems a little off.

My guess? Djokovic being Djokovic, he will do something off the menu, in complete resistance of convention. A mic-drop retirement, courtside with his kids. An elaborate ceremony on Stephen Schwarzman's balcony. A dinner theater song-and-dance revue doubling as a retirement announcement. Or, he will do something in Greece. Or, pending reconciliation, back in Serbia, celebrating his country in conjunction with his unparalleled achievements (and his inevitable pivot to politics).

Jon, how can tennis build on that great French Open. You and Andy were right to call it one of the best ever. But how can tennis make sure this isn't a one-off?

James, B.C.

• If only there were another big event right away that could draft off these good vibes … that was a joke. For as often as we lament the traffic jam that is the tennis calendar, it's a real benefit that we have another major starting in a few days. 

Obviously, if Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner can meet in the final again, another chapter in a gripping rivalry, it will help. And if Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka have another showdown with the trophy on the court, that would be great, too. 

Short of that, one hopes the casual fans who tuned into two classic sporting events stick around. (At least in the U.S., if ESPN could lean into this—and promote tennis during the NBA Finals the way that TNT did—that would be helpful.)

If this were a conventional business, there would be meetings discussing the precise point you raised. How do we keep this momentum going? How do we capitalize on this bump? What went right in Paris that we can incorporate going forward? If only tennis weren't so balkanized.

Hi Jon, Alcaraz and Sinner gave us a match worthy of Federer-Nadal Wimbledon 2008 and Borg-McEnroe Wimbledon 1980. If not quite as great as those, at least as memorable and drama-filled. And as in all truly great rivalries, it will drive both players to further excellence they would not reach otherwise. Let us hope they both stay healthy for many years to come, so they may continue to contend with each other and enthrall the tennis public. 

And why is it we so often see a player, even a great player, say that their opponent won because they themselves played poorly that day. Hadn't it occurred to them that the main reason they played poorly was in reaction and response to the better play of their opponent? Always best to be gracious in defeat. You look the better for it, always.

Thanks for your great coverage, as always. Looking forward to Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows!

• Thanks. Let's go in reverse order. Yes, some days you play better than others. But before denigrating your performance—and this goes way beyond tennis—it's helpful to ask why. Might it be because the opponent is creating circumstances that cause you to miss? Or adjust your risk tolerance? Or plays defense that stymies your offense? Like most sports, like most competitive endeavors, tennis does not exist in a vacuum. Your opponent has bearing on how well or poorly you play, whether you admit it or not.

“Where does this match rank?” was a question in heavy rotation last week, referencing, of course, Sinner and Alcaraz. After a week of cooling off, not much shine has diminished. Two rivals. No. 1 vs. No. 2. The match that had everything you could want in a sporting event: sways of momentum, endurance, shotmaking, mettle, inflection points, misses, defeat-from-the-jaws-of-victory and victory-from-the-jaws-of-defeat … all garnished with a sudden death ending.

This match was worthy and noteworthy, as well, for what it lacked: gamesmanship, controversy, injury, rain, etc. I'm biased toward the Federer-Nadal 2008 Wimbledon final. But if this match didn't overtake it, it is 1A in my book. Regardless, a sensational sporting event and a sensational day for tennis. 

Hi Jon,

As commentators have repeatedly labeled the Alcaraz/Sinner final as the second longest grand slam final, I can't help but think that the method of measuring match time is somewhat flawed. That 2012 outing down under between Nadal and Djokovic, the current acknowledged winner of “longest final”, was over-represented, in my opinion, given the pre-serve rituals of both players before a serve clock was implemented. I doubt anyone has compiled the actual time playing points for both matches, excluding incessant ball bouncing, but if they had, I have no doubt that Alcaraz and Sinner would reign supreme.

• Another defective tennis stat: time of match.Two players bounce the balls 25 times and/or go through an elaborate ritual before each serve? (Just hypothetically, of course.) It adds to match time. Players have a prolonged disagreement with the chair umpire, stop play and demand the supervisor make a cameo? It adds to match time. Players take bathroom breaks, sometimes dubiously to break opponents' rhythm and momentum. The meter is running. A spectator in the stands needs medical attention and play is stopped. The clock is still running. The time of match stat is wildly imprecise.

Note that in the case of Alcaraz and Sinner there were none of the above. Brisk pace of play. No long breaks. No unforeseen delays. It was five hours and 29 minutes, and the match seemed both longer and shorter, no?

Watching the women's Roland Garros final on TV—it seems Sabalenka's grunting is too loud and too long and should be considered a hindrance. Do you agree? And why is there no correction given to her?

Laura W.

• The periodic weigh-in here. I want to acknowledge that this is an issue for many of you. I also want to push back a bit and encourage differentiating between grunting that is strategic or gamesmanship and grunting that is the soundtrack of exertion and effort. I've always felt Sabalenka fell squarely in the latter camp. 

Again, I understand that grunting is annoying for many of you. I agree that the WTA's historic unwillingness to confront top players about it can come across as cowardly. But—especially when it's coming from the hardest hitters, male and female—I look at (hear it?) much as I do profuse sweating. It's a cost of doing business.

Hi Jon,

Why is Chris Evert talking so much about Serena Williams. It's time for TNT to find a new panel. They just spent the better part of the pre-final panel discussion talking about Serena Williams and as always, Chris Evert continues to bring her up during the matches also.

Time to move on … It's quite annoying.

• No one puts Chrissy in a corner!

Distilled, this is the problem with TV. One person says, Why are you dwelling on Serena? The next person says, Serena retired with 23 majors. Why are the commentators ignoring her? The same way people say, We need more statistics, while the next viewer says, Why gum up this theater with math?

• “The United States Tennis Association (USTA) announced the launch of a new micro-grant program aimed at growing tennis at the local level. The program includes a pledge of $5 million over the next five years further strengthening the USTA's commitment to grassroots tennis programs.”

Djokovic, at the age of 38, is in the twilight years of his career.

His rivals Roger Federer, Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal have already swapped the tennis court for retirement, leaving the Serb as the last man of the 'Big Four' still standing.

According to Greek outlet Protothema.gr, Djokovic has decided to move to Greece when he eventually hangs up his racket.

It's claimed that the tennis legend recently lunched with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who has apparently agreed to grant him a 'Golden Visa' that grants him five years of residence in the country.

That means Djokovic will be leaving his luxury £8.5m mansion behind, with the veteran currently residing there with wife Jelena and their two children.

The former world No 1 has reportedly chosen Greece over Serbia after previously becoming embroiled in a political row with the Serbian government.

He previously took aim at the regime of Aleksandar Vucic amid student protests in the country.

Meanwhile, as Wimbledon rapidly approaches, it will be fascinating to see how Djokovic fares.

He performed well enough at the recent French Open, making the semi-finals before falling to eventual runner-up Jannik Sinner.

Djokovic has won seven titles at Wimbledon throughout his career, with his first triumph coming back in 2011.

He has reached the last two finals there, only to lose to Carlos Alcaraz on both occasions.

Speaking recently, Djokovic opened up on retirement - and suggested he'd keep playing until 2028 so he can defend the Olympic gold medal secured at Paris last year.

The 38-year-old said: “The only thing on my mind right now, and the only thing that motivates me, is the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

Alex de Minaur has personal links with both the Australian Open and Wimbledon.

De Minaur reached the Australian Open quarter-finals earlier this year, his best ever result at his home Grand Slam tournament.

While he may represent Australia, due to De Minaur's engagement to Katie Boulter he does also have links to the United Kingdom.

After losing his first round singles match at Queen's, De Minaur has given his verdict on what separates the crowds at the Australian Open and Wimbledon.

Former finalist De Minaur lost his only singles match at Queen's Club this year to Jiri Lehecka in straight sets.

After his defeat, De Minaur headed to his post-match press conference where he was asked about British number one Jack Draper and the pressure he may face at Wimbledon as the biggest local hopeful.

This is something that De Minaur can relate to as the top ranked Australian, and he praised Draper for how he has been handling the pressure of expectation so far.

“Yeah, obviously I think Jack's dealing with it incredibly well,” said De Minaur. “He's obviously had a stellar year and achieving some incredible things.

“He's playing in his home ground now. I'm sure he'll love to do well. I guess for me it's just trying to use all the energy from the crowd. 

“I know that the crowd is behind me every single point when I play in Australia, and that's something that definitely helps me a lot kind of calm the nerves and just focus on myself.”

De Minaur was then asked how he feels playing against a British player during the grass court season, but he suggested that the Wimbledon crowd is more tempered than at the Australian Open.

“Yeah, I would say the British crowd is a little different to the Aussie crowd,” De Minaur continued. “Mainly I would say it's because of Wimbledon. Wimbledon has so much history and heritage and kind of culture. It's a very — they're very polite, I would say. You know, probably in Australia they're a little bit louder.”

While De Minaur has given Draper a good chance of impressing at Wimbledon, he has recently been struggling to show the same form that has made him world number 12.

De Minaur recently admitted to feeling burnt out, and has now lost back-to-back matches for the first time since February.

This means that De Minaur will head into Wimbledon this year without a singles victory on grass this year.

The 26 year old produced his best result at Wimbledon last year by reaching the quarter-finals, but De Minaur was forced to withdraw from his match against Novak Djokovic with a hip injury.

While De Minaur will no longer be in singles competition at Queen's Club, he still remains in the doubles tournament.

Playing alongside his compatriot Alexei Popyrin, De Minaur will play Lehecka again who is partnered by Taylor Fritz.

Taylor Fritz has played and beaten some of the greatest players on the ATP Tour en route to becoming world number four.

The American star enjoyed a breakout year in 2024, reaching two ‘big' finals, at the US Open and ATP Finals.

Despite coming up short in both, Fritz reached a career-high ranking of fourth in the world.

In both the ATP Finals and the US Open final, Fritz lost to world number one Jannik Sinner, a player many consider to be the toughest challenge in tennis today.

However, when asked recently who the best player he's ever played against was, Fritz named a different ATP star.

During an interview with TNT Sports on Instagram, Fritz was asked several quickfire questions, the first of which was which opponent was the toughest he's played.

A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports)

“Probably Novak [Djokovic],” he answered.

When looking at Fritz and Djokovic's head-to-head record, it's no surprise he answered as he did, having lost all ten of their ATP Tour meetings.

Just once has Fritz pushed Djokovic to a deciding set, at the Australian Open four years ago, when the injured Serb battled through to reach the fourth round.

Fritz also took the time to answer several other questions about tennis.

“Going to have to go with Tommy [Paul], because we have an Olympic medal,” said Fritz.

“Indian Wells,” he said.

“Indian Wells,” he said.

“Serena [Williams],” said Fritz.

“Novak,” he said.

After losing in the first round of this year's French Open, Fritz couldn't wait to get off the clay and move onto grass.

Beginning his grass-court season in Stuttgart, the American eased into the final without dropping a set.

There, Fritz beat home favorite Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6, to clinch the fourth grass-court title of his career.

Having won his first title of the season, many expected Fritz to make another deep run when he headed over to London for the Queen's Club Championships.

Entering the tournament as the number three seed, Fritz came face to face with French qualifier Corentin Moutet in round one.

After three sets of gruelling action, Moutet emerged victorious, 6-7, 7-6, 7-5, knocking Fritz out of the competition.

While far from his best, it wasn't a terrible performance by the world number four, who won the exact same number of points as his opponent (117).

Fritz will now turn his attention to the doubles tournament at Queen's, where he and Jiri Lehecka will take on Alex de Minaur and Alexei Popyrin on Wednesday, June 18.

He is also scheduled to appear at next week's Eastbourne International, an event he's enjoyed real success at over the years.

The 27-year-old is the most successful player in the history of the event, having won the title on three occasions.

Searching for title number four in 2025, Fritz will have a great chance to get his Wimbledon preparations back on track.

The 2025 Eastbourne International is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 23.

The former No. 1 advised Osaka to mix it up on serve ahead Wimbledon.ByDavid KanePublished Jun 18, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 18, 2025

Naomi Osaka's comeback hit another rough patch earlier this week when the former world No. 1 lost in the first round of the Berlin Tennis Open to Liudmila Samsonova. The Tennis Channel Live panel, led by fellow former world No. 1s Tracy Austin and Andy Roddick, broke down the defeat and looked ahead to Wimbledon, where Osaka has never been past the third round.“I've got to be honest: I didn't think it would take this long for someone who has won four majors and has been so committed, working with Patrick Mouratoglou,” Austin said on Tuesday. “She's worked so hard; when she's lost, she goes back to the Academy there. I'm super proud of Naomi for trying to play better on the clay. Her four majors were all on hard and she never felt comfortable on the grass. She can't wait for the summer to happen.”Osaka first returned from maternity leave at the start of 2024, having given birth to daughter Shai the year before. In the 18 months since returning to action, she has peaked just outside the Top 40 in the WTA rankings and has won one title earlier this season, a WTA 125K in Saint-Malo. Austin looks back at Osaka's 2024 Roland Garros defeat to Iga Swiatek, where the four-time Grand Slam champion held match point, as an inflection point in the comeback.

There's no reason why [Osaka] can't play well on grass. I think she needs to focus on that first-strike tennis, maybe move her serve around a little it more and take some chances on the second serve so her movement doesn't get a chance to get exposed as often. Andy Roddick

“That's where it could have turned,” said Austin. “I just think she's starting to have some doubt because she's losing 6-4 in the third, 7-5 in the third. Your aura is lost a little and others think I can beat her. That's a tough situation for her to be in right now.”Osaka's last three defeats—to Samsonova in Berlin, Paula Badosa at Roland Garros, and Peyton Stearns in Rome—have all been tough three sets with the 27-year-old coming up just short.Roddick took a more optimistic view of Osaka on what has traditionally been her weakest surface, encouraging her to be more aggressive on the slicker grass courts.“There's no reason why she can't play well on grass,” argued Roddick. “I think she needs to focus on that first-strike tennis, maybe move her serve around a little it more and take some chances on the second serve so her movement doesn't get a chance to get exposed as often.”

Osaka is 17-8 in 2025 following back-to-back first-round exits in Roland Garros and Berlin.

Osaka last reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2018; her most recent appearance at the All England Club ended in the second round against American Emma Navarro, who went on to upset Coco Gauff en route to the quarterfinals.“I think I'm still trying to find myself and or figure out who I am,” Osaka wrote on Threads following her loss in Berlin. “Can someone older than me please let me know if that's a constant inner struggle or is it something we magically figure out one day?”

Sebastian Korda is among the early Wimbledon casualties, having been forced to skip the Grand Slam this year.

Korda once backed himself to win Wimbledon, but the American has only ever managed to reach the fourth round.

The grass court event gets underway in London later this month, following the Australian Open and French Open in the Grand Slam schedule.

ATP Tour number one Jannik Sinner successfully defended his title in Melbourne this year, with Carlos Alcaraz doing the same in Paris.

And the Spaniard will now be looking to repeat that trend at Wimbledon, having won the tournament in both 2023 and 2024.

But unfortunately for Korda, he will not be among the players looking to knock Alcaraz off his perch in the English capital.

Sharing an update on his Instagram story, the American posted an image of himself on crutches with his leg in a cast.

The 24-year-old accompanied that with the message: “Unfortunately no Wimbledon for me this year. Stress fracture in my shin during the clay. Been a tough 12 months but better days ahead.”

It is certainly a very unfortunate situation for Korda, who looks upbeat despite the disappointing timing of the injury.

He once reached a career-high ranking of 15th on the ATP Tour, but has recently dropped three places to 26th.

A further drop should be expected given his impending absence, but hopefully he can return to the court in the very near future.

Korda certainly isn't the only high-profile player to be missing from the All England Club this year, with Kei Nishikori withdrawing from Wimbledon due to injury.

Alejandro Tabilo is another Wimbledon casualty, but star names Sinner, Alcaraz and seven-time champion Novak Djokovic are all expected to take part.

Taking place in London, the iconic grass court Grand Slam is set to be played over 14 days from June 30 to July 13.

Carlos Alcaraz continued his tradition of partying in Ibiza just days after his tennis coach advised against the move.

The Spaniard headed to the Balearic Island to celebrate his incredible French Open win, where he battled back from two sets down against Jannik Sinner to lift the Coupe des Mousquetaires. Alcaraz's coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, told El Larguero that he wanted the young star to have a good time, but it was "no longer about the word 'party', but about disconnecting."

He added: "[It's about] being with his friends and not thinking about tennis and being a normal 22-year-old, and returning to work with enthusiasm."

However, it seemed that Alcaraz enjoyed a fair amount of partying during the first night in Ibiza. Although he admitted that he has changed his ways slightly as he has gotten older.

Speaking to EFE, the 22-year-old stated that he was "more lively" in Ibiza previously, as he chose to avoid multiple late nights in celebration of his Roland-Garros triumph earlier this month.

Alcaraz said: "They were fun, but this year was quieter than the previous one. Last year was more lively. I went out on the first night and then didn't go out at night on the other two.

"In bed by 12 on Tuesday and Wednesday, although I did go out in the afternoon. I'm getting older and my body can't handle it anymore."

The two-time Wimbledon champion opened up about the criticism he's faced before for his youthful behavior. Alcaraz added: "There are situations where many people might not agree, where you might think yes, but they don't agree, but in life, I want to make my own mistakes.

"I'm glad that this year, people are telling me to go wherever I want, to disconnect, because the support is good for me in certain situations. Maybe in a few years, I won't be able to go, but now these moments to disconnect are good.

"It's probably a tradition. It's mid-season. It's the best time after Roland-Garros for those holidays. It's not so much about where you go, but more about being able to refresh physically. Having that time off is great. And now I can come back with more energy."

When asked if anyone on his team, including coach Ferrero, tried to shut down his Ibiza getaway, Alcaraz added: "No, they didn't do it. They knew I was going to be 100%."

The young tennis star admitted that his stunning turnaround in Paris even surprised himself by his own standards. Down 6-4, 7-6 in the early sets, Alcaraz bounced back in epic fashion to win the next three sets 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 in a marathon match clocking in at five hours and 29 minutes.

Reflecting on his emotions after the monumental triumph, Alcaraz said: "I keep watching it, and I still can't believe I was able to come back from that."

The Spanish sensation is back on the court at The Queen's Club in London ahead of aiming for a third straight Wimbledon title, escaping an upset by Australian lucky loser Adam Walton to advance to the last 16.

                Winner to face Medvedev or Halys in QF.            

Two big serving giants will meet on the OWL Arena on Wednesday, when Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex Michelsen look to grab a quarterfinal entry ticket at the 2025 Terra Wortmann Open in Halle, Germany. The two-time Grand Slam finalist is back on his least favourite surface, and an American mountain awaits him. Who will reign supreme?

Surprisingly, the Alex Michelsen match-up is one that hasn't been kind to Stefanos Tsitsipas. The Greek freak is yet to register a victory over his 20-year-old opponent. Michelsen boasts a 50% winning record in 2025 – his best performances include an Australian Open Round of 16 entry and a semifinal finish at Delray Beach. On the other hand, Tsitsipas won the Dubai Tennis Championships in February-March.

The 26-year-old has won 93% service games in his solitary grass court encounter thus far. Although his style of play means that he enjoys time on the ball and higher bounce which grass doesn't offer, Tsitsipas has the ability and adaptability to find success. His only title on this surface came at Mallorca in 2022.

0-2 is the head to head between Tsitsipas and Michelsen. The American has won both encounters in thrilling fashion against his Greek counterpart.

This will be the first match in this rivalry outside of outdoor hard courts. At the ATP-500 in Tokyo last year, Michelsen pulled off a magnificent comeback to pip Tsitsipas in the Round of 32. The Greek maestro seeked revenge at the Australian Open in early 2025, but failed to overpower the American young gun.

Contrary to what the rankings suggest, we predict Alex Michelsen to stun the former World No. 3 and retain his unbeaten record against Tsitsipas. The American can take advantage of the fact that Tsitsipas endured a draining match in Round-1. He also has the serve and groundstrokes to trouble the single-handed backhand of the Athens-born starlet, as was seen in their previous two tussles.

Prediction: Alex Michelsen in three sets.

Stefanos Tsitsipas is the minnow in this encounter against Alex Michelsen. It is a very close 51-49 affair, and the money line suggests a tight finish. Here are the odds (sourced via BetMGM):

Stefanos Tsitsipas Win: 21/20

Alex Michelsen Win: 3/4

Defending US Open mixed doubles champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori have entered this year's overhaul of the competition alongside singles stars Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka, Naomi Osaka and Elena Rybakina.

At this year's US Open, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori will attempt to defend their mixed doubles crown in a brand new format that sees them joined by singles stars from Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka to Naomi Osaka and Elena Rybakina.

The Italian duo are the current holders of two of the four mixed doubles majors, having also added this year's Roland Garros trophy to their haul. The USTA's overhaul of the competition means that it will now be a 16-team field competing on August 19-20, the tournament's Fan Week. Matches will be best of three sets with no-ad scoring and a 10-point super-tiebreak in lieu of a full third set. Sets will be short sets (first to four games, or a tiebreak played at 4-4) except the final, which will be first to six games, with a tiebreak played at 6-6).

Errani and Vavassori are one of 16 teams who comprise the initial entry list, and are joined by a slew of singles stars from both the WTA and ATP tours. The only players in this week's Top 11 of either tour who have not entered are Coco Gauff and Holger Rune. In order of combined singles rankings, the list is as follows:

1. Emma Navarro (USA) and Jannik Sinner (ITA)2. Zheng Qinwen (CHN) and Jack Draper (GBR)3. Jessica Pegula (USA) and Tommy Paul (USA)4. Jasmine Paolini (ITA) and Lorenzo Musetti (ITA)5. Elena Rybakina (KAZ) and Taylor Fritz (USA)6. Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev7. Madison Keys (USA) and Frances Tiafoe (USA)8. Aryna Sabalenka and Grigor Dimitrov (BUL)9. Iga Swiatek (POL) and Casper Ruud (NOR)10. Paula Badosa (ESP) and Stefanos Tsitsipas (GRE)11. Emma Raducanu (GBR) and Carlos Alcaraz (ESP)12. Belinda Bencic (SUI) and Alexander Zverev (GER)13. Olga Danilovic (SRB) and Novak Djokovic (SRB)14. Taylor Townsend (USA) and Ben Shelton (USA)15. Sara Errani (ITA) and Andrea Vavassori (ITA)16. Naomi Osaka (JPN) and Nick Kyrgios (AUS)

Aside from Errani and Vavassori, the only players on the list to have reached a Grand Slam mixed doubles final to date are Townsend (the 2024 US Open runner-up with Donald Young and the 2025 Roland Garros runner-up with Evan King) and Pegula (the 2023 US Open runner-up with Austin Krajicek).

Four teams on the list have previously competed together before. As well as Errani and Vavassori, Danilovic and Djokovic compiled a 2-0 record at the 2024 United Cup; Andreeva and Medvedev lost in the first round of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games (to Errani and Vavassori); and Badosa and Tsitsipas lost in the first round of the 2024 US Open.

The entry window for the tournament will close on July 28, at which point the top eight teams with the best combined singles rankings will gain direct acceptance. The remaining eight teams will be determined via wild cards and announced at a later date.

The women's world number one tennis player says she was ‘super emotional' and ‘completely unprofessional' after losing the French Open final to the American.

Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologise for the “unprofessional” comments she made following her loss to her American rival in the final of the French Open.

The top-ranked Sabalenka said on Tuesday that her remarks after her loss to Gauff at Roland-Garros were a mistake.

In her post-match media address in Paris, the Belarusian had suggested that the American's win was more due to her own errors than Gauff's performance.

Sabalenka had been poised for victory after claiming the opening set in a tiebreak, only to watch Gauff orchestrate a stunning 6-7(5) 6-2 6-4 comeback to claim her second Grand Slam title.

The 27-year-old made 70 unforced errors in the final and later said at the news conference that Gauff won “not because she played incredible, [but] because I made all of those mistakes” – comments she has since regretted making.

“That was just completely unprofessional of me,” Sabalenka told Eurosport Germany.

“I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then. You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward – not immediately, but recently.”

She said she wrote to Gauff to apologise and “make sure she knew she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her”.

“I never intended to attack her,” Sabalenka added. “I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I'm not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realised a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?”

Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, had lost to Gauff in the 2023 US Open final, where she also won the first set.

“I kept getting so emotional,” Sabalenka added. “So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn't be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me.”

Spanish sensation Carlos Alcaraz has declared fellow US Open champion Emma Raducanu will be the boss when they step out together in a revamped and experimental mixed doubles at the grand slam in New York in August.

As for Nick Kyrgios's high-profile partnership with Naomi Osaka, the champion who lit the Olympic Cauldron to start the Tokyo games in 2021? That might depend on whether the Aussie gets to the start line for the US Open's big gamble in tennis. 

Either way, those pairings are among the 16 star-studded combinations already entered for the reimagined event as US Open organisers wager on a format they believe will make mixed doubles a winner, with the victors pocketing A$1.54 million.

A single Tweet was all it took to get the world of tennis talking about an event that can be a side show in majors, with more than two million people having viewed the US Open's initial post about the 16-pair event within 12 hours of the confirmation of entrants.

To be played under the contentious Fast 4 format Australian officials deployed a few years back, it will feature eight seeded combinations based on singles rankings and another eight wildcard combinations, which is where Kyrgios would slot with Osaka.

Australian star Alex de Minaur and his fiance Katie Boulter, the former English No.1, could be among those to compete as well, with entries for the lucrative 16-pair format closing in late July.

People are talking and the timing of the announcement struck an ace, coming not long before dual-Wimbledon champion Alcaraz was about to speak at Queens following an opening round win over Aussie Adam Walton on Tuesday. 

Given Raducanu is a tabloid dream in the United Kingdom, with her every move covered at length four years after her improbable triumph in New York, it was a certainty her patnering with Alcaraz would get tongues wagging.

The Spaniard, fresh from a successful defence of his Roland Garros title, was happy to oblige, even quipping Raducanu played hard to get when he asked her to partner with him.

“She's going to be the boss,” he said, breaking into a smile.

“She took a while (to say yes). Not that much. But obviously she had to ask (her management) and she had to think a little bit.”









Alcaraz said that he was approached by US Open officials to take part and securing the biggest names is clearly important if the tournament, to be run over two days starting just 48 hours after the Cincinnati Open final, is to prove a winner.

“The US Open came to us and gave us opportunities to play mixed doubles. I'm super excited about it. I think it is going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament,” he said.

“I (have known) Emma since a really long time ago (and) I have a really good relationship with her, so it's just going to be interesting. Obviously (both) of us are going to enjoy it. for sure. I will try ... to put my doubles skill on it. We will try to win. But obviously it is oging to be really, really fund.”

Mixed doubles and doubles finals tend to be held as an add-on event to the singles finals, though they can draw a crowd. 

At Roland Garros, organisers open the major court to grounds pass holders for the finals, which boosts attendances and makes for a good atmosphere. But the US Open move will further the revenue earned at what is already a behemoth when it comes to making cash.





During a chat with a senior US Open official at Roland Garros earlier this month, there was confidence that the timing and nature of the format would draw big attendances and also significant viewership in the latest gambit to make grand slams three week events.

The Australian Open uses charity fundraises and exhibitions to boost attendances during qualifying week. At the French Open, the qualifying event alone is enough, with fans cramming into Roland Garros. Roehampton also draws crowds for Wimbledon qualifying.

Tickets for the mixed doubles tournament were selling for more than A$100 on Wednesday, but that is no surprise at a tournament where ground passes for the opening Sunday were priced at $423 on one on-sale service. That does not deter fans from attending.

Quizzed about concerns the format devalued what is still an event with a grand slam title, the official noted that the Fast 4 format is officially recognised by the International Tennis Federation and that the rules allowed majors discretion with mixed doubles.

US Open chief executive Lew Sherr expressed confidence “the fans will love it” while saying the initial pairings shows “the players are behind it”.

“Seeing the names that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited,” he said.

It is worth noting that the announcement comes at a time when the world's top players are pressing grand slam bodies about prize money amid a gulf in what is offered compared to the windfalls made by majors. 

At Roland Garros, several of the world's top ranked players met with representatives of the grand slam events including Australian Open officials to discuss the prizemoney percentage per tournament revenue disparity. 











Not everyone is happy, with former Australian Open chief executive Paul McNamee and esteemed coach Sven Groeneveld among them.

McNamee, who won the 1985 Wimbledon mixed doubles title, believes it devalues the integrity of the event by precluding doubles players from using their specialist ranking to enter.

“Much air play around the US Open mixed doubles entries” he noted on social media. 

“Have the event by all means, but do not diminish the integrity of a Grand Slam by awarding an official title. Imagine awarding the singles title if you could only use your doubles ranking to enter? Same same.”

Reshaping the event to reserve it for the world's biggest stars would also prove a case of the rich getting even richer, while talented players who use mixed doubles event to stay afloat are left without the chance to earn a decent cheque.

When one domino falls in a major, others tend to follow, as is the case with the Sunday starts at majors aside from Wimbledon that have had an impact on the smaller tournaments which are held the week before.

Aryna Sabalenka has written to Coco Gauff to apologise for what she deemed to be an "unprofessional" reaction to the pair's French Open final.

Sabalenka initially suggested she had lost the final to Gauff down to her own errors, rather than Gauff's performance.

Her apology came after Gauff asked people to give the world number one "a little bit of slack".

Aryna Sabalenka says she has written to Coco Gauff to apologise for the "unprofessional" comments she made following her loss to her American rival in the final of the French Open.

Speaking to Eurosport Germany, the top-ranked Sabalenka said her remarks after her 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-4 loss to Gauff at Roland-Garros this month were a mistake.

In her post-match press conference in Paris, Sabalenka had suggested that the result was more due to her own errors than to Gauff's performance.

"That was just completely unprofessional of me," Sabalenka said.

"I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then.

Coco Gauff continues a spectacular season for American women at the grand slams, battling from a set down to topple world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open final.

"You know, we all make mistakes. I'm just a human being who's still learning in life. I think we all have those days when we lose control. But what I also want to say is that I wrote to Coco afterward — not immediately, but recently."

Sabalenka hit 37 winners but finished the final with 70 unforced errors — compared to Gauff's 30.

She said she wrote to Gauff to apologise and "make sure she knew she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her".

"I never intended to attack her," Sabalanka added.

"I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I'm not necessarily grateful for what I did. It took me a while to go back and think about it, to approach it with open eyes, and to understand. I realised a lot about myself. Why did I lose so many finals?"

Sabalenka, a three-time major champion, also lost to Gauff in the 2023 US Open final, where she also won the first set.

"I kept getting so emotional," Sabalenka added.

"So I learned a lot. Above all, one thing: I'm the one who always treats my opponents with great respect, whether I win or lose. Without that respect, I wouldn't be where I am today. So it was a tough but very valuable lesson for me."

Sabalenka's apology comes after Gauff said she was "a little bit surprised" by the reaction of the Belarusian superstar.

"At the end of the day, what happened, happened. I won because I earned that win," she told ESPN's First Take.

"We both had to play in the wind, we both had to deal with those conditions. I didn't feel great on the court at all.

"I went down 4-1 and I thought I was playing the worst tennis of the tournament, but the difference was, I was able to recognise that and find a different way to try and win that match.

"She's probably emotional about it, so I'm not going to take it too [personally]. I do hope people give her a little bit of slack too."

Gauff and Sabalenka will both be in action at Wimbledon among the top seeds in the ladies' singles draw.

2025 Canadian Grand Prix: Gasly accuses Stroll of pushing him off track

Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur explains what went wrong for the Scuderia in Montreal.

Fred Vasseur believes Ferrari “failed massively” in Canada after failing to execute a clean weekend, despite his drivers both finishing in the points in Montreal.

Charles Leclerc came home fifth and Lewis Hamilton sixth, both inheriting a position thanks to the late retirement of Lando Norris. But Ferrari were not on the pace of Mercedes, Red Bull or McLaren – and that wasn't purely down to the car.

Leclerc crashed on Friday in Free Practice 1, which cost him the entirety of FP2 as well.

There were also question marks over the tyre strategy in Qualifying, with Ferrari focusing on using the C6 soft while Mercedes and Red Bull used the medium to good effect. Those questions intensified during the race, with Leclerc querying the decision to put him onto a two-stop strategy.

And Ferrari's cause was not helped by Hamilton picking up floor damage after hitting an animal.

“I think we made too many mistakes collectively from the beginning with the crash in FP1, with the mistake in Quali, with the marmot in the race,” Vasseur explained.

"And at the end the fight is so tight – I'm not speaking about lap time or race time, I'm speaking about that you can change the position for almost nothing from one weekend to another one.

“It's a good lesson also from Mercedes. They were nowhere the last three weekends and they were able to have the two cars on the podium this weekend.

“I'm not sure that they changed completely the car, it's more that from the beginning of the weekend, from Lap 1 on Friday morning, they were there, they did a good job in the preparation and so on. And honestly this weekend, for different reasons, the focus was not always there [for us].”

Vasseur added that, with the margins so small in 2025, executing the perfect weekend matters almost more than car set-up or any upgrades a team might bring.

“Honestly, I'm not sure that the characteristic of the car is the main issue today. The main issue is to do a good usage of the tyres first, and to understand the tyres and to choose the good ones for the Quali, and the exercise is quite difficult.

“I think today that Max [Verstappen] and Mercedes did a better job on the weekend than McLaren and us, but they were also into the choice of the tyres probably from the beginning of the weekend, and this you have to commit from Friday morning almost.

“Even before the weekend, you have to put everything together in the right place if you want to achieve a good result today, because in the tyre usage and the tyre performance, or what performance you get from the tyres, I think there is much more than between the cars.

“It doesn't matter the car, if the team is doing a very good job on the tyres, they will be in front. It's true this weekend, it was true in Monaco, it was true in Imola, and it is like it is, and it will be like this until the end of the season. But it's the same for everybody, we have to do a better job.”

Vasseur hinted that Ferrari would have some small upgrades in Austria – but was keen to stress that sharpening up the operation across the whole weekend would have far bigger an impact than any upgrades.

“If we want to achieve, if we want to start from the first rows and to have a clean weekend as [in] Monaco, we need to do a very smooth weekend in terms of execution, and it's where we failed massively in Canada,” he concluded.

Ferrari have slipped back to third in the Teams' Championship, 16 points behind Mercedes.

Yuki Tsunoda gave his honest reflections after ending the Canadian Grand Prix in P12 as he continues to get to grips with the Red Bull.

Yuki Tsunoda has admitted that he feels “a lot of pressure” amid another weekend without points in Canada, with the Japanese driver still in the process of adapting to the Red Bull following his switch to the squad earlier in the season.

Tsunoda's prospects for race day took a hit on Saturday when he was handed a 10-place grid penalty for overtaking McLaren's Oscar Piastri under red flag conditions in Free Practice 3, meaning that – after qualifying in 11th – he would start from the back of the field.

The 25-year-old ran a long opening stint on the hard tyre before switching to the mediums – and while he made gains from his original starting slot, Tsunoda ultimately ended the race in P12, meaning that he has gone without points for the last three races.

Asked if the result had been the maximum that was possible from where he started – particularly given the traffic that he faced at times – Tsunoda conceded: “Yeah, pretty much, that's it.

“The pace was okay, not amazing but still not too bad. Other than that, pretty much that's it really. At least [a] positive is the car performance now, and the pace in the car felt a bit more normal or better than last previous races, so at least there's a bit of motivation there.”

Since moving to Red Bull from Racing Bulls at the third race weekend of the season in Japan – as part of a driver swap with Liam Lawson – Tsunoda has been open about the challenge of getting to grips with the RB21, having at one point compared it to “a science room”.

While there have been positive moments during this process – with points coming in Bahrain, Miami and Imola – Tsunoda acknowledged in Montreal that it also brings pressure, though admitted that he hopes to use this as an opportunity to prove himself.

“[Saturday] was a tough day with the 10-place nonsense penalty,” the Red Bull driver said. “[I] lost a lot of time in FP3, especially with the new upgrades when you want to especially learn about the car.

“Still with our team, you want to be as high as possible, but I enjoy this challenge I guess. [In] these moments I'm having a lot of pressure, sometimes I'm not enjoying them that much but it's part of the time that [is] an opportunity to improve myself and prove myself more.”

Tsunoda will be hoping for better when F1 heads to the Red Bull Ring for his team's home event, the Austrian Grand Prix, on June 27-29.

Nico Hulkenberg converted his P11 grid slot to an eighth-place finish in Canada, as he scored more vital points for Kick Sauber.

Nico Hulkenberg is starting to make a habit of scoring points, as the Kick Sauber driver came home eighth in Canada to add to his brilliant fifth last time out in Spain.

His recent run of results has lifted Kick Sauber from the bottom of the table in the Teams' Championship, and they are now just eight points off P6 as the midfield pack tightens up once again.

For Sauber, it is further proof that their upgrade direction is the right one, with Hulkenberg able to use his updated car to good effect when fighting his midfield rivals. While he didn't quite have the pace to catch the Ferraris, like in Barcelona, the German was still proud of a race that included some “fun” overtakes.

“Well two times in [the top 10 in] a row, that's nice!,” Hulkenberg said after the race in Montreal. "Would be nice if we can continue the trend from here but obviously definitely some momentum on our side.

“A bit as I suspected in race trim the car comes alive a bit more, the update really paying dividends and just having better consistency and a better balance in the car so yeah quite pleasant, made some good gains.

“Franco [Colapinto] and Alex [Albon] were fighting in Turn 9 Lap 1 and I managed to capitalise on that and was a pretty clean race. A couple of overtakes to do, pretty fun racing and managing tyres basically.”

Hulkenberg's race craft remains sharp, the German more than happy to pounce on that opening lap when his rivals tangled, before executing a one-stop strategy that saw him make his hard tyres last 51 laps.

While his drive lacked the showiness of his Barcelona race, where he overtook Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, it was his third score of the season and first in a race that didn't feature variables like rain or mid-race Safety Cars.

As such, there are high hopes of more points at the coming races – regardless of the characteristics of the tracks in question. Hulkenberg was asked if he can keep scoring, and he was clear that he sees no reason why he won't be featuring in the top 10 more often moving forward.

“We've had two very different tracks here and in Barcelona" he said. "On both we were competitive in the midfield so there's no reason to think why not.”

Team Principal Jonathan Wheatley was also quick to praise Hulkenberg's drive in Montreal, as the team's one-stop strategy “proved to be spot on," calling the atmosphere within the squad "fantastic."

In May of 2023, Warner Bros. released a collection of classic cartoons on Blu-ray through their boutique Warner Archive label that was directly aimed at serious enthusiasts. That set, “Looney Tunes Collector's Choice: Volume 1,” was pure gold for animation fans, featuring 25 cartoons that had never been released on DVD or Blu-ray in remastered form. 

The positive response from lovers of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig led to three more volumes, each collecting 25 new shorts that were meticulously restored and presented in exquisite transfers.

Now, Warner Archive is continuing their mission with “Looney Tunes Collector's Vault: Volume 1,” a set that continues the label's previous work and expands on it. “I decided that instead of releasing a Volume 5 with the same curation criteria we would expand to 2-disc collections,” film historian George Feltenstein, who oversees the Warner Archive label, told IndieWire.

“The idea was to expand the variety of classic cartoons offered by letting the first disc continue the mission of what we had established with the Collector's Choice releases — 25 cartoons not previously available on DVD or Blu-ray in remastered form as part of a WB classic collection,” he said. “However, the addition of the second disc would contain 25 cartoons that have been available in standard definition on DVD, but had yet to be included remastered in High Definition on a Blu-ray disc.”

 










Among the newly included cartoons are several fan favorites and rarities, including choice selections by legendary director Chuck Jones. Feltenstein said that choosing favorites is difficult since he, in collaboration with animation historian Jerry Beck, selected all the cartoons, but he has particular fondness for the 1945 Jones short “Hare Conditioned.” In this hilarious cartoon, Bugs Bunny faces a threat from a department store manager who wants to get Bugs stuffed in the taxidermy department.

“Most of the Warner Bros. animation directors had their take on Bugs, but Jones' work with the character just seemed to get better and better over the years,” Feltenstein said. “This is a relatively early Jones/Bugs cartoon, but it has been a favorite since childhood.” Feltenstein also points to Jones' 1948 Daffy Duck short “Daffy Dilly” as a treasure that exhibits Daffy's evolution under Jones' direction.  

“I had the pleasure of meeting Chuck Jones late in his life, and we spoke at length about his work at Warner Bros.,” Feltenstein said. “He once told me — and I assume he told this to many — that Bugs Bunny, for him, represented the kind of individual we aspire to be, and that Daffy Duck was the individual we are afraid we're really more like. I thought his statement was quite brilliant.” 

 










In choosing the cartoons for the Warner Archive collections, Feltenstein and Beck — who have been collaborating on the programming of classic animation releases going back to the laserdisc era — asked themselves what the fans would want, which isn't difficult since they're fans themselves. In addition to the Jones shorts, other highlights in the vault collection include Friz Freleng's “Each Dawn I Crow” (1949) with Elmer Fudd from 1949, and “The Goofy Gophers,” which was released in 1947.

“‘The Goofy Gophers' features the screen debut of the characters ‘Mac and Tosh,' who appeared in several successive cartoons, but this was their introduction to the big screen,” Feltenstein said. “It was allegedly started by legendary animator Bob Clampett, but the balance of the work was taken over by Arthur Davis after Clampett's sudden departure from the studio.”

In addition to his work on the Warner animation collections, Feltenstein oversees a wide array of releases from the studio's live-action catalogue, often putting out pristine releases of classics as well as cult favorites and idiosyncratic oddities. Recent months have seen new Blu-rays of titles as varied as the criminally underrated Ryan Reynolds/Amy Smart comedy “Just Friends,” Vincente Minnelli's visually stunning melodrama “The Cobweb,” and the blaxploitation gem “Melinda,” just to name a few.

 










“We are usually working on several dozen releases at any given time, in various stages of production,” Feltenstein. “This requires very close coordination with other departments, so we can make sure that our efforts are synchronized with the company's dedication to preservation efforts.” Right now, the Warner Archive Collection is the only studio-based “boutique” label, dedicated to what physical media collectors want most, and Feltenstein takes his role as curator seriously.

“There are many factors that go into what can get released, and what is still waiting,” Feltenstein said. “We also have various groups of die-hard enthusiast consumers who each want to make their voices heard loudly about what they want to see released. We're listening, and our goal is to try and please all the different fan factions.” 

Ultimately, Feltenstein's work is complicated but his mission is simple: to get as much of the Warners library released from the vaults and onto the shelves of home viewers. It's a mission he's been on for over 16 years that has now yielded several thousand releases; given how strong the company's recent releases have been, here's hoping there are thousands more to come.

Following a highly successful run in China, where it topped TV ratings and became the most-streamed TV series throughout the country, Wong Kar Wai's 1990s-set drama “Blossoms Shanghai” will stream exclusively in North America on The Criterion Channel. Comprising 30 episodes, the show tracks the rise of a financial titan whose wealth comes in the wake of Shanghai opening its own stock exchange.

Created and directed by Wong, the filmmaker said of the project in a statement, “I am thrilled to continue my long-standing relationship with Criterion with the North American debut of my first series on the Criterion Channel. The series captures the vitality of Shanghai's roaring 90s, revealing universal human truths about desire and destiny. We hope the series provides insight into the pivotal moment of China's reinvention.”

Like many of Wong's works, “Blossoms Shanghai” contains strong romantic elements amid real-life historical foundations. It was adapted from the award-winning novel “Blossoms” by Jin Yucheng, which follows China's economic boom during the 1990s as seen through the eyes of Ah Bao, a figure many will come to know as the Jay Gatsby of Shanghai. Starting out as a simple, ordinary man with no standing, Ah soon becomes a self-made millionaire, but must fight to keep his fortune as others seek to destroy him.

Ah is played by the highly popular Chinese actor Hu Ge, whose credits include the Jackie Chan-produced “The Myth” and the Chinese historical drama “Nirvana in Fire,” for which he received Best Actor at the 2016 Shanghai Television Festival. Hu would go on to win this award again in 2024 for his performance in “Blossoms Shanghai.”

The episodic series represents the third piece in a trilogy about Wong's native Shanghai, including “In the Mood for Love” and “2046,” but the first to reflect a story that takes place in his actual birthplace. All three now have a home with The Criterion Collection, with the first two being featured in their “World of Wong Kar Wai” box set. Other films included in this comprehensive collection are “As Tears Go By,” “Days of Being Wild,” “Chungking Express,” “Fallen Angels,” and “Happy Together,” all of which are also now streaming via The Criterion Channel.

“In the Mood for Love” will also be returning to theaters this summer to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary. You can catch the Hong Kong historical romance starring Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung starting June 27 in NYC at the IFC Center and Film at Lincoln Center, with a national rollout to follow. Criterion will also stream “Blossoms Shanghai” in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand at some point in the near future.

Russell T Davies says he remains in the dark over Doctor Who‘s future.


	In a production diary for the latest issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Davies said the BBC‘s iconic sci-fi series will never end, but he was less certain about its immediate future following Season 15.


	“We don't know what's happening yet, and while everyone works that out, I'll take a pause on this page … Hopefully, we'll have news soon,” the showrunner wrote.


	A Doctor Who source explained: “This letter is a production notes diary for when the show is in production, or on air, and as Russell has stated within the piece, it is a pause.”

	Ncuti Gatwa has confirmed his exit as the Doctor, with the drama ending on an ambiguous note, as Gatwa regenerated into Billie Piper's Rose Tyler.


			Watch on Deadline		







	The BBC has not yet made a decision about a renewal, while questions linger over its co-production deal with Disney+, which streams Doctor Who in the U.S. 


	Produced by Bad Wolf, spin-off series The War Between The Land And The Sea is up next. It features Russell Tovey and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.


‘Doctor Who' Ratings


	Deadline has analyzed official seven-day viewing figures for Season 15, and it does not make easy reading for those involved in Doctor Who.


	The season averaged 3.2M viewers over its eight episodes, which was half a million viewers down from last year's season — Gatwa's first as the Doctor.


	Compare Season 15 to Jodie Whittaker's last outing as the Time Lord, and things get grimmer. Season 13 pulled in 1.7M more viewers, averaging 4.9M in 2021.


	Deadline has used viewing figures from Barb, the UK's official ratings body. They include on-demand and streaming viewing on televisions, but are not the full picture.


	Broadcasters and streamers prefer to use 28-day figures, which provide a more conclusive overview. Nonetheless, seven-day viewing is usually directional and the pattern of decline will likely be reflected in Doctor Who's final ratings.

	











	A BBC spokesperson said: “Doctor Who is the BBC's biggest drama for the under 35s and remains one of the most popular brands on iPlayer, with over 70 million viewing hours in 2024.”

MTV has set Wednesday, July 30 for the Season 41 premiere of its long-running reality competition series The Challenge, themed Vets and New Threats, which will see 16 vets competing against 16 rookies. The upcoming season will roll out globally across MTV's international networks in over 165 countries in the coming months.


	Per MTV, “this season, fresh faces and new threats have entered the arena with one goal: upend the old order and take it all. The Vets, driven by legacy and pride, will need to adapt fast. Their established hierarchy is crumbling, and leaning on past alliances, and experience is no longer reliable—it's about navigating the ever-shifting landscape of alliances, betrayals, and unknown threats. To win, Veterans and New Threats will be forced to work together, unless they're forced to turn on each other. Nothing is guaranteed.”

Rod Stewart has opened up about the friend breakup he went through with his old neighbor in Florida — President Donald Trump.


	In an interview with Radio Times, Stewart said he used to know Trump “very, very well,” and they often spent time together when they lived near each other in Florida (“literally half a mile away”). “I used to go to his house,” Stewart said, adding: “We're both on the beach. I used to go to his Christmas parties.”


	Stewart said one thing he liked about Trump was that he was always “a bit of a man's man,” but quickly added the caveat: “[H]e didn't, as far as I'm concerned, treat women very well.” And he said that since Trump became president, he's turned into “another guy. Somebody I didn't know.”


	The musician said he can no longer call Trump a friend, specifically raising the issue of the war in Gaza and the weapons that the U.S. (and the U.K.) continue to supply to Israel.

	“As long as he's selling arms to the Israelis — and he still is. How's that war ever gonna stop?” Stewart said. “And we [the U.K.] should stop selling them as well … What [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu is doing to the Palestinians is exactly what happened to the Jews. It's annihilation, and that's all he wants to do — get rid of them all. I don't know how they sleep at night.”

	Earlier this month, Stewart was forced to cancel and postpone a handful of shows in the U.S. as he recovered from a bout with the flu. As it stands, he's set to return to the stage at Glastonbury on June 29 when he'll headline the festival's Pyramid Stage in the “Legends slot.” 

	











	He'll return to North American soon after, with a trek kicking off July 3 in Quebec and through mid-September. He's also set to resume his residency at the Coloseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on Sept. 24.

	WWE Champions Liv Morgan & Dominik Mysterio share what their dream entrance song remixes would be, Liv wanting to go up against Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion in the ring, their thoughts on ‘Love On The Spectrum,' SummerSlam, Sabrina Carpenter and more!


	Are you excited for Summer Slam? Let us know in the comments!


Noah Reardon: We're here with Liv Morgan and Dominik Mysterio. Gonna chat music today, a little different for you. I want to hear from both of you: What is your dream remix? Who would you love to have remix your theme?


Liv Morgan: My dream remix of my song … I'd like a collaboration. I'd like a collaboration between Sabrina Carpenter and, like Drake, if they could come together and do some, like, cool remix of my song, I think that'd be pretty good. There'se a little giggle in the beginning, and that could be Sabrina, but then Drake could, like, chime in and, you know, say some cool s–t about me.


Dominik Mysterio: I would probably go a little bit more traditional Mexican. Fuerza Regida or Adriel Favela, Calle 24, maybe throw in some Mexican OT, too. I think that'd be, that'd be pretty dope. But, yeah, I think so.


Oh you just met him earlier?


Mysterio: Yeah, he's a good dude. 


How was that? 


Mysterio: He's awesome, yeah. I mean, looking forward to seeing him around more for sure.


I heard it's coming up on your anniversary. Is there any music from last summer's songs that you're like, “Oh, that is us. We were listening to that bumping that.” 


Morgan: I don't know that there's anything specific, because Dominik has, like, a very diverse, kind of eclectic music taste like he's everywhere. But, you know, I did learn last summer that he's a Sabrina Carpenter fan and so, you know, just anything Sabrina Carpenter kind of reminds me of Dominik a little bit. You know, she just released “Man Child,” not that song, but, you know, just Sabrina Carpenter in general.

	The Trump administration is once again targeting LGBTQ+ youth — this time by ending the contract between LGBTQ+ nonprofit group The Trevor Project and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.


	A suicide prevention nonprofit, the Trevor Project was founded in 1998 to address the high rate of mental health problems and suicidal ideation that LGBTQ+ youth face. According to 2024 data from the group, close to 39 percent of queer youth consider attempting suicide, a rate that is heavily impacted by anti-LBTQ+ policies and administrations. The nonprofit says it's helped more than 1.3 million LGBTQ+ youth since it was started.


	Trevor Project CEO Jaymes Black announced Wednesday that the group has been given a stop work notice ending its “Press 3” program with the federal government. Introduced in 2022, the “Press 3 option” allowed Suicide & Crisis Lifeline callers to be connected with a mental health counselor who specialized in LGBTQ+ issues and concerns. In a statement, SAMHSA called the shuttering of the “Press 3” program a move to “focus on serving all help seekers” through the suicide hotline. But the statement only mentioned the LGB+ community, omitting the markers for transgender and queer individuals, continuing the Trump administration's outsized targeting of the transgender community. 












	“Counselors who supported the press three option were trained specifically to support LGBTQ+ young people, because having someone who truly understands the unique needs and challenges of LGBTQ+ young people isn't just helpful. It can be the difference between saving a life or losing one,” Black said in a video statement. “When a questioning youth calls because they're terrified and they're alone, they need someone who can say, ‘You are not broken, you are loved exactly as you are.' When a transgender teenager calls because they're being bullied at school and contemplating suicide, they need someone who knows that their identity isn't a phase to be counseled away.”

	Representatives for the Trevor Project did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. According to Black's statement, the stop work order gives the Trevor Project 30 days before the LGBTQ+ option of the national suicide lifeline is shuttered.

	“This is this is not about politics. This is about people. This is your neighbor's kid. This is your coworker's daughter who sees no tomorrow.

	Almost 25 years before Sabrina Carpenter was born, Carly Simon was in a department store in New York and feeling pretty good. She'd just released her fifth album, Playing Possum, and the frisky single “Attitude Dancing” was looking to follow her hits “You're So Vain,” “Haven't Got Time for the Pain,” and “Anticipation” onto the radio. Then, a woman who was apparently familiar with the cover of Playing Possum approached her. 


	“She'd either seen a picture of it, or she knew someone who had the album,” Simon recalls. “And she said, ‘What were you thinking?' Voices were raised.”


	Last week, Carpenter unveiled the now-notorious cover for her upcoming album Man's Best Friend, in which she's depicted kneeling on the ground, one hand extended toward a figure in a suit who's grabbing her hair. Debates, some pretty intense, ensued about whether the photo signified savvy, knowing female empowerment or simply empowered the male gaze.


	But as Simon well knows, the sight of a female pop star in a similar pose and pushing plenty of the same buttons didn't start with Man's Best Friend. Released in 1975, Playing Possum sported a couple of suggestive song titles, like “Are You Ticklish” and “Love Out in the Street,” but its most provocative aspect was its black-and-white cover photo: Simon, on her knees, looking fierce and mysterious in a black negligee and black boots, fists clenched, face partly hidden, mouth sightly open. Photographer Norman Seeff's shot was the polar opposite of the cover of her previous album, 1974's Hotcakes, which featured a smiling and visibly pregnant Simon. Of Playing Possum, Simon says, “I remember thinking, if this works, it'll also let people see that I've gotten my body back.”

	But in a scenario that may be familiar to the Carpenter camp, fans and feminists alike didn't know what to make of it and began arguing over its message. As Rolling Stone reported at the time, the Sears department-store chain, which sold a good deal of LPs, considered not carrying Simon's album at all. Crawdaddy, a competing counterculture magazine, published a review that was entirely devoted to analyzing the cover instead of the music. The image became so indelible that the negligee Simon wore was included in her exhibit at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame when she was inducted in 2022.

	Given how much Playing Possum‘s cover contrasted with Hotcakes, its back story is ironic: It actually began with Simon's daughter Sally, who, only a few months old, was in a baby carrier on her mother's back as Simon shopped in Bloomingdale's. “I was looking through the racks of undergarments, and she bent over with me as I bent over to look at something,” Simon says, recalling how her daughter grabbed at the black lingerie and pulled it into the carrier with her. “It wasn't noticed at checkout.” (These were the days before security tags were affixed to clothing.)   


	When Simon arrived at Seeff's L.A. studio for the photo shoot, she was wearing the purloined piece of clothing underneath a skirt and blouse. As Simon remembers, she was in a dressing room putting her street clothes back on after the session when she heard Isaac Hayes' “Theme from Shaft” playing in the studio. “I loved that song, so I ran out and started dancing to it,” she says. As Seeff clicked away, Simon, in the black lingerie, sang along with Hayes, ultimately lying down on the floor on her back before pulling herself up. “And that's when Norman took that picture, after I landed in that pose,” she says. “It wasn't done on purpose. It wasn't a setup.”


	When the photos were developed, Seeff zeroed in on one in particular. “I'm looking at these shots, and I go, ‘Well, here's a shot that's got some kind of energy to it,'” he says. “The head's cut off. She was in movement from being on the floor to standing up, and she's got this clenched fist. No one thought about what it might convey. It was a fascinating, unique image and it left a lot to the imagination.”

	Simon herself wasn't sure at first but came around to the same thinking. “There was something about black and white photographs, where you suddenly see it as an art picture,” she says. “The whole thing looked artistic, even though it wasn't artistic on purpose.”  


	In Simon's memory, the initial feedback she received — from then husband James Taylor and her producer, the late Richard Perry — was positive, and she proudly showed it to Joni Mitchell and Graham Nash at a birthday party Simon threw for Taylor in L.A. just before the album was released. “Everybody looked at it, and people definitely had a reaction to it,” she says, “but they wouldn't have told me what they really thought.”

	











	The more visceral responses arrived when Playing Possum was shipped to stores. “How's that for crashing the image of the sweet mother-to-be beaming on the cover of her last album?” wrote one critic. Another wondered if she should be carrying a whip to match the outfit. Simon even recalls her mother, Civil Rights activist Andrea Louise Heinemann, saying, “Carly, darling! What are you doing?”


	“Suddenly, I'm getting calls from Time and Newsweek, saying, ‘This is one of the sexiest covers that has ever known,'” Seeff says. “There's this whole controversy around what did it represent? It felt very much like that energy in a woman, but I just thought of it as a beautiful shot. None of that stuff they were talking about was the intention.” The conversation didn't hurt sales: Playing Possum became Simon's third straight Top 10 album.


	The cover of Carpenter's Man's Best Friend isn't an overt homage to Playing Possum, but Simon has been recognized by modern pop stars. Both Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo have covered “You're So Vain” onstage, and Addison Rae shouted out Simon's later Boys in the Trees album in a recent interview. “I love it that the younger girls are discovering me, and that I've had attention from them,” Simon says.


	Of Carpenter's controversial artwork, Simon doesn't quite see the fuss. “She's not doing anything outrageous,” she says. “It seems tame. There have been far flashier covers than hers. One of the most startling covers I've ever seen was [The Rolling Stones'] Sticky Fingers. That was out there in terms of sexual attitude. So I don't know why she's getting such flak.”


	Simon herself hasn't released a new album since 2009, but she's been working on new music on and off for a decade. The songs, many produced by her son Ben, include “Howl,” featuring Nile Rodgers on guitar and a guest vocal from Chris Stills, son of Stephen. “It's kind of a vengeance song about getting back at someone, or, in this case, a whole lot of people,” she says. “Is it tender? No, it's not. It's very gutsy. It's got a lot of power.” She's also written a song about her daughter Sally, “Mother of Pearl,” and another, “Do It Anyway,” that she calls “kind of a coach song — ‘if you think you can't do it, do it anyway.'” “Pity the Poor Man” was co-written with Natasha Bedingfield, and Simon has also set a W.H. Auden poem to music.


	What form the songs will take remains to be seen, Simon says. “I didn't record it as an album,” she says. “I just did it as a song here and a song there. We have 10 songs, an album's worth, but you don't really release albums now, so we're just going to release one by one.”

	Since it may not be an actual old-fangled album, Simon isn't even thinking about cover art. But as far as advice to Carpenter on how to deal with her situation, Simon says, “Well, any press is good press, so I wouldn't worry about the press. And as far as her being salacious, I certainly don't think it's that. I mean, look at all of the people who dress much more scantily. She's so beautiful, and she should be proud of herself and the way she looks. I don't see anything wrong with that.”


	Taking another look at Man's Best Friend, Simon has one last thought. “I thought it was going over the line a little bit, touching the man's knee,” she says, with a chuckle. “I thought she didn't have to do that.”

Kathryn Bigelow is bringing her acclaim to Netflix. The Academy Award-winning director makes her return to filmmaking with thriller “House of Dynamite” set at the White House after a missile is launched at the U.S. 

The project was announced in 2024 with a Puck report confirming that “Jackie” and “Zero Day” scribe Noah Oppenheim was writing the original script. The film will be set in real-time and share a sensibility with Bigelow's previous films “Zero Dark Thirty,” “Detroit,” and “The Hurt Locker.”

Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Jared Harris, Greta Lee, Gabriel Basso, Anthony Ramos, Tracy Letts, and Moses Ingram will star in “House of Dynamite,” along with Jonah Hauer-King, Jason Clarke, Kaitlyn Dever, Willa Fitzgerald, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Malachi Beasley, Kyle Allen, Francesca Carpanini, Brian Tee, Brittany O'Grady, Abubakr Ali, and recent IndieWire Honors winner Aminah Nieves of “1923” fame.

The logline reads: “When a single, unattributed missile is launched at the United States, a race begins to determine who is responsible and how to respond.” 

 










“House of Dynamite” will premiere in select theaters in October and on Netflix October 24. This is a milestone for both Bigelow and Netflix: Amid the push from filmmakers such as Rian Johnson and Greta Gerwig to have theatrical releases for features, Netflix is putting Bigelow's on the big screen. 

“House of Dynamite” is Bigelow's first film since 2017's “Detroit.” She was previously developing an adaptation of David Koepp's novel “Aurora” also for Netflix, but the film was scrapped in 2022.

Nieves told IndieWire that none of the cast of “House of Dynamite” even knew the title of the film while in production. “It's wild, because I don't even know the name of the movie, and I don't know when it's coming out,” Nieves said. “All I can say is that it is completely different than what you've ever seen me do — which is not a lot — but still completely different and it was a very challenging role in regards to the time I spent with it and what it asked out of all of us.”

Bigelow was the first woman to win an Oscar for Best Director in 2009 with “The Hurt Locker.” Bigelow told IndieWire in 2017 while promoting “Detroit” that all of her films have “meaningful messaging,” especially about the government. 

“At the end of the day, entertainment needs a shred of messaging to it. That's a real motivator,” she said. “The genre element is captivating and attractive, both as a viewer and a filmmaker, but using it as a vehicle to move a conversation forward or at least shine a light on a conversation is extremely exciting. [‘Detroit' was] challenging material, but so were ‘Zero Dark Thirty' and ‘Hurt Locker.' When you work in this space where entertainment alone is not enough, you're using it as a delivery method for meaningful messaging, so you're operating in a more journalistic mode. I think if it's a good story and there's significant personal commitment from the filmmaker, it will find a way to reach an audience.” 

 










The iconic “Point Break” director added, “I'm always encouraged by the commitment and dedication of a filmmaker who lives in their material. Usually, that belief translates to the screen and therefore the audience. That's what moves me — truth and integrity… there's an integrity with respect to the choice of material by the filmmaker and how he or she realizes the story.” 

“House of Dynamite” is produced by Bigelow, Oppenheim, and Greg Shapiro. Brian Bell and Sarah Bremner executive produce.

	In the self-directed visual posted Tuesday (June 17), the pop star is surrounded by a diverse cast of men wearing varying amounts of clothing as she sits down for a feast in a rodeo-themed restaurant, where things unravel into chaos as the group ravishes the food and drinks — and each other — on the table. In other shots, a nearly nude Kesha rides on the back of a topless man while teasing him with a piñata and sprays another almost-naked gentleman with a hose. 


	Perhaps the most memorable scene in the project — which also featured direction from Brett Loudermilk and Zain Curtis — comes at the very end, with Kesha looking angelic as she breastfeeds a grown man wearing nothing but his underwear.

	











	“Berlin to Bombay, New York to L.A./ Tokyo to Tahoe, boys are my cocaine,” she sings on the electro-pop track. “Bikers and the dumb bros, daddies and the gym hoes/ Prowling like a kitty cat, I want to get you all alone.”

	Following singles “Joyride,” “Delusional” and “Yippee-Ki-Yay,” “Boy Crazy” marks the latest release from Kesha's upcoming album, . (Period), which will arrive July 4. The LP will be the artist's first under her own independent label after finishing her contract with Kemosabe Records, which ended after a now-settled legal battle with founder Dr. Luke over Kesha's claims that he drugged and raped her at a 2005 party — all of which he has vehemently denied.  


	Kesha has been open about how reclaiming control over her career has been both emotional and fulfilling, with the singer telling Jennifer Hudson in May, “It's been all of my vision, all of my words, a lot of hard work, a lot of joy … Really coming back home to myself and feeling what freedom really looks like, feels like, sounds like.”

	With his usual flair, Paramount President of International Theatrical Distribution, Mark Viane, kicked off the studio's CineEurope presentation today with a hysterical video that reimagined him as the head of “The Paramount Squad,” a reference to the upcoming Naked Gun reboot. Sporting a white wig, Viane was joined by other Par execs including the EMEA team while the mini film also nodded to upcoming studio titles including Smurfs and the latest Spongebob movie, among others. 


	After the video and as he took the stage here, replete in boxers and skirt à la Liam Neeson's Frank Drebin Jr in The Naked Gun, Viane exclaimed, “Comedies are back!”

The Naked Gun starts global rollout on July 30, getting to domestic theaters on August 1. Neeson introduced an exclusive look at the movie via a video message and cheekily said to exhibitors, “remember to book my movie — or I am coming for you.”

	During the presentation, Viane also announced that Paramount will co-produce with Universal Meet the Parents 4, and will handle international distribution.


	There was also extended Smurfs footage, including the opening sequence, that was introduced by Rihanna who voices Smurfette. The movie kicks off July 16 internationally and goes domestic on July 18.


	Moving away from comedy and targeting the underserved female audience, a first look at Colleen Hoover adaptation Regretting You was introduced via video by the cast including Allison Williams, Dave Franco, Mckenna Grace and Mason Thames. The story is set against a tragic event that unlocks a series of secrets, lies and regrets. A fall 2025 release is on deck.


	Also showing up for the first time for exhibitors was Primate, a horror movie about a domesticated chimp gone bonkers. That's swinging into cinemas in 2026.


	Viane closed out the Par presentation with new extended footage from The Running Man. Glenn Powell, Josh Brolin and Colman Domingo star in the Stephen King chase thriller adaptation from director Edgar Wright. Set in a dystopian America (in the year 2025), the story centers on Ben Richards (Powell), a desperate man who participates in violent reality show in order to win enough money to revive his gravely ill daughter. Powell, Brolin and Domingo sent a video to Barcelona to talk up the film and introduce the footage. Release is on November 7 this year.

It isn't every day that individual artists and creators and mega-studio conglomerates are actually aligned in what they want, but that's just the sort of villain that artificial intelligence has become when it comes to the entertainment sphere.

Last week, both Disney and NBCUniversal sued AI company Midjourney in a case of copyright infringement. For several years, there have been countless lawsuits filed by individuals against companies such as Midjourney objecting to the use of copyrighted material in the training of AI models and in these models' outputs. But two major studios teaming up to sue one of the bigger AI image generation tools for the same reason is a big step.

 








Related Stories Gary Oldman Says He Was ‘Typecast' as a Bad Guy for Years: ‘We Need a Villain and We'll Get Gary' Everything Coming to Hulu and Disney+ in July 

Before we start holding up any studio as a defender of artists' rights, there's a very good chance that how this lawsuit ultimately plays out will inform Disney, NBCUni, and other studios' own playbooks in building their own AI models. For now, the Midjourney suit has the potential to set a precedent around artificial intelligence, how AI companies can operate or train their models, and have an impact on all creatives.

 










“It's going to be an important case that'll affect the rights held by almost all creatives, regardless of how large they are,” said Ray Seilie, a trial attorney with Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir. “It's a rare alliance in the legal industry, or the entertainment legal industry, where you see studios actually doing something that artists are 100 percent behind.”

The 143-page lawsuit against Midjourney filed last Wednesday is a simple copyright lawsuit, even if it comes at the intersection of AI and bigger legal debates about whether AI-generated material can be considered copyrightable. Disney and NBCUniversal allege that Midjourney is willfully infringing on their biggest characters and IP and making a profit from doing it. It claims that anyone with a subscription to use Midjourney's image generating tool — and soon its video generation tool — can prompt the AI model to create an image of Darth Vader or the Minions, and it will spit out an almost perfect copy.

The lawsuit includes some convincing side-by-sides of the real movie stills and the images Midjourney has created. It's not as if those examples are a close facsimile that can be mistaken for something else, they're not a parody, and they're not a transformed iteration of existing characters; it's just an AI-generated copy. That's going to be a problem when Midjourney — which has yet to file a response to the complaint — tries to say it's just fair use.

 










“Just candidly, I think it is hard to see how the courts will let Midjourney keep doing what it's doing without any kind of restriction,” Seilie said. “To me, I think the studios have a very strong case here.”

Seilie said Midjourney will likely try to say that it is just the middleman providing the tools, and it's the users creating the images who are violating the copyright and are breaking the terms of service. That is a stretch, since Midjourney profits off subscriptions and controls what its users can and can't do.

Case in point: the lawsuit says Disney and NBCUniversal tried to get Midjourney to restrict users from creating images of copyrighted material, but it has ignored those pleas. Midjourney already prevents users from generating images of a violent or sexual nature, so why can't they just flip another switch to keep people from generating Yoda?

“Legally speaking, it's clear that Midjourney is willfully infringing. They're intentionally infringing, and it sounds like they didn't take any steps to try to mitigate or limit what the users could do on their platform,” said entertainment attorney Dale Nelson, who works with Donaldson Callif Perez and is former in-house counsel for Warner Bros. “And willful infringement is far worse than infringement of the type where you have a good faith belief that what you were doing was okay. So the fact that they didn't respond to the studios' letters just doesn't look good for Midjourney.”

 










Nelson said Midjourney may also argue that any ruling against them could have unintended consequences on the whole industry and what AI models are able to do. But the studios' lawyers have thought of that too. 

“I think that they have made very specific factual allegations in their complaint, probably wisely so, that it's not a lawsuit just about all AI. This is a very specific use that they're complaining about,” Nelson said. 

All this matters to Disney and NBCUni because it represents lost revenue. If someone can just generate an image with AI of their favorite “Star Wars” character, why would they want to buy anything specific from Disney itself? It could also be damaging to Disney's brand if AI can easily generate images of Disney characters that are more adult in nature than they'd prefer and let the average user distribute that image widely on the web. 

Seilie said this could be a very narrow ruling, one that only impacts Midjourney and how it operates or needs to operate moving forward, but more likely, any ruling will cause other AI companies to be proactive and change what their models can do or how they're trained based on what the court decides. They don't want their own lawsuits if they can avoid them. It could also just be settled with Midjourney agreeing to pay Disney and NBCUniversal a licensing fee to keep creating copies of their IP. 

 










But Seilie expects this to go deeper and believes the studios will want a ruling of some kind — and will fight until they get one. Seilie believes Disney and NBCUniversal will want discovery with the ability to get a clear sense of exactly how Midjourney's models were trained and how they're used.

“The studios want the precedent here,” Seilie said. “They want a district court opinion that says that scraping data for a training engine or using copyrighted material in training data is a copyright violation. I think they're gonna want a ruling that says that, and it'll probably go through appeals.”

Precedent is the crux of the issue here, giving the studios clarity on exactly what can and can't be used in training AI models, whether it's licensing someone else's to make movies or training their own internally. Because the flip side, should the courts rule in favor of Midjourney, could be “earth shaking” for how the studios do business. 

“It would be a sea change in the way that copyrighted material works,” Seilie said. “We would see a lot of changes in how studios operate or how creatives, frankly, operate.”

By inking a pact with French broadcaster TF1 to carry its live sports, drama series and reality shows, the streaming giant is evolving into a giant aggregator — that looks a lot like the Pay TV interface of old.  


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Netflix may entice its subscribers to chill, but the global streamer is working on new offerings and deals to future-proof its content lineup and business. In line with that, it made notable headlines on Wednesday, unveiling a carriage deal with French broadcaster TF1 at Cannes Lions that will see Netflix offering live broadcasts and on-demand content from the partner starting in the summer of 2026.


	“This is a first-of-its-kind partnership that plays to our strengths of giving audiences the best entertainment alongside the best discovery experience,” said Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix. “By teaming up with France's leading broadcaster, we will provide French consumers with even more reasons to come to Netflix every day and to stay with us for all their entertainment.”

	How much of a game-changer the TF1 deal presents was a topic of industry discussion following the news, with several analysts predicting that more carriage and aggregation agreements in its vein would follow.


	Some pointed out that TF1 CEO Rodolphe Belmer sat on the board of directors of Netflix from 2018 until 2022, namely until he was named the French giant's boss. Last year, Netflix also partnered with France's Newen Studios and TF1 to co-produce the streamer's first-ever daily drama series for France. The series, Tout Pour La Lumière (All for Light), a family series set in the world of music and dance, became available on Netflix late last week before its free-to-air debut on TF1, along with its TF1+ platform, this week.

	











	“This is a very innovative deal,” with “nothing of the sort elsewhere,” Enders Analysis analyst François Godard tells The Hollywood Reporter. “It pivots Netflix into aggregation.”


	Will Netflix bring this approach to other markets? “They could,” the expert says. “They are a trial-and-error company. So maybe they will wait first to see how it goes in France.”


	PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore tells THR that for Netflix, the TF1 deal “makes perfect sense given its direction of travel.” He explains: “It is pivoting towards a platform for entertainment, and it was only a question of time before we saw typically big hits being streamed on the platform.”


	For broadcasters and others, collaborating with the global streamer is also appealing. “Everyone wants to work and distribute with Netflix,” he says. “It is the undisputed market leader and paved the way for others. While rivals grapple to understand streaming and continue to figure out what to do with legacy businesses, Netflix remains one step ahead. Free-to-air broadcasters have got no choice but to either collaborate with each other as a final resort or partner with a streamer.”


	Pescatore sees no losers in such carriage pacts. “It is a win-win for all parties,” he argues. “For free-to-air broadcasters, it gives them a new lease on life, for Netflix, a broad range of programming, and users [get] reduced fragmentation by having more in one place.”


	The PP Foresight expert sees more deals ahead, adding: “This is the start, and we will now see a chain reaction with others looking to replicate this deal.”

	











Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also forecasts more Netflix carriage deals in the future, telling THR: “They are trying to be a platform and be the starting point for any viewing.”

	In the first official trailer for Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, Jon Landau (Jeremy Strong) wants to make a few things clear. “Here's what I want you to understand,” the longtime music manager tells Columbia Records executive Al Teller (David Krumholtz), “this is not about either one of us. This is not about the charts. This is about Bruce Springsteen. And these are the songs that he wants to work on right now.”


	Moments earlier, Jeremy Allen White‘s Springsteen settled behind a mic in his New Jersey bedroom — just him, some antiquated furniture, and Mike Batlan (Paul Walter Hauser), his recording engineer for the Nebraska sessions. “Don't need to be perfect,” he tells him. “I want it to feel like I'm in the room by myself.” In theaters Oct. 24, Deliver Me From Nowhere catches the musician during the making of Nebraska, his stripped back acoustic folk record that arrived in 1982.


	The biopic trailer offers glimpses into Springsteen's rugged childhood under the watch of his father (played by Stephen Graham), his whirlwind romance with a woman named Faye (Odessa Young), and his nights performing to sold-out crowds. The clip closes out with White doing his best take on the Springsteen classic “Born to Run” with lights flashing all around him and sweat pouring down his face. “I'm trying to find something real in all the noise,” he says.

	“Making Springsteen was deeply moving as it allowed me to step inside the soul of an artist I've long admired — and to witness, up close, the vulnerability and strength behind his music,” director Scott Cooper said in a statement. “The experience felt like a journey through memory, myth, and truth. And more than anything, it was a privilege to translate that raw emotional honesty to the screen, and in doing so, it changed me. I cannot thank Bruce and Jon Landau enough for allowing me to tell their story.”

	











	Cooper wrote the script for the film based on Warren Zane's 2023 book, Deliver Me from Nowhere. The film also stars Gaby Hoffman and Marc Maron. Deliver Me From Nowhere began production this past October. In November, Springsteen stopped by a shoot day in Bayonne, New Jersey, when the crew was capturing the moment he picked out his first car, a Chevrolet Z28 Camaro. The scene appears early in the trailer, with a salesman telling him, “It's awful fitting for a handsome devil rockstar — I do know who you are.” White's Springsteen responds, “Well, that makes one of us.”

	Slasher pic Silent Night, Deadly Night is produced by the original 1984 TriStar film's producers Scott Schneid and Dennis Whitehead and New Dimension's Jamie R. Thompson, Rebel 6's Erik Bernard and White Bear Films' Jeremy Torrie, with executive producers Steven Schneider, Anthony Masi, and Sarah Eilts. Terrifier's Brandon Hill and Brad Miska will oversee for Cineverse and will executive-produce alongside Erick Opeka and Yolanda Macias, Bondit Media Capital's Matthew Helderman and Luke Taylor. Financing came from Bondit Media Capital and Royal Bank of Canada. Distribution outside of North America is being handled by Sixth Dimension, StudioCanal's genre label.


	When it was released in 1984, the first Silent Night, Deadly Night movie became one of the most controversial movies of the year. In a series of letters, parents demanded the film be pulled from theaters. The film charts the story of a young man who goes on a murderous rampage dressed as Santa after being released from an orphanage.

	











Return to Silent Hill is the third installment in the game-to-screen horror film franchise, marking its 20th year since the first film, Silent Hill, was released in theaters. Starring Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean and directed by Christophe Gans, Silent Hill topped the box office its opening weekend in 2006. Silent Hill: Revelation followed in 2012, directed by M.J. Bassett and starring Kit Harington and Adelaide Clemens. It follows James (Irvine), a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary (Anderson), ends. When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognizable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary, he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town.


	Produced by Victor Hadida of Davis Films, Molly Hassell of Hassell Free Productions and David Wulf, the film is financed by Davis Films and Ashland Hill Media Finance. The Veterans handle international rights.“We have been anything but silent about our mission to champion proven IP as a central piece of our theatrical strategy,” said Cineverse Chief Motion Pictures Officer Yolanda Macias. “These two films will represent event viewing that meet fan demand for new releases from their favorite franchises, and an opportunity for them to reach a new audience.”Said Mark Rupp, CFO/COO and co-founder of Iconic Events Releasing: “Cineverse's decision to release Silent Night, Deadly Night as an unrated wide theatrical title reflects a proven strategy that continues to resonate with genre fans and deliver results and we're confident it will be well-positioned for the holiday season. Return to Silent Hill hits theaters at the perfect time following the successful recent launch of the Silent Hill 2 game remake that the movie is based on, while also celebrating the 20th anniversary of the start of the horror film franchise.”

The annual UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report is continuing to chart the spaces in which filmmaking remains unequal. The 2025 report, which examined the top 100 English-language film releases on major streaming platforms (Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Netflix, Paramount+, and Peacock) in 2024, found that, while films with more racially diverse casts performed better on streaming platforms, female filmmakers are still underrepresented when it comes to big budget features.

“We're glad to see gains for diversity with streaming films, but the gap between movie budgets for streaming and theatrical releases gets wider and wider,” Michael Tran, a sociologist and co-author of the report, said in an official statement. “It's especially troubling since only a select few, specifically men, are given the chance to dip into the upper echelons of financial backing.”

 








Related Stories Disney and NBCUniversal's Midjourney Lawsuit Isn't About Money — It's About Setting AI Precedent Jeremy Allen White Transforms Into Bruce Springsteen in First ‘Deliver Me from Nowhere' Trailer 

That gap had a staggering discrepancy: No woman or other-gender person, regardless of race or ethnicity, had the opportunity to direct a streaming film with a budget of $100 million or more in 2024. White women continue to be the most likely to direct films with the smallest budgets; all of their films had a budget less than $20 million, except for the animated “Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie.”

 










The UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report began separating streaming films from theatrical releases for analysis in 2023. At the time, white men still directed the “supermajority of big budget films,” with 56 percent of white women directors having budgets smaller than $20 million. 

Two years later, and the statistic is not much different. 

In total, 65.5 percent of the top streaming films had budgets less than $20 million, compared to 34.6 percent for theatrical films. On the other end, only 4.4 percent of streaming films had budgets of $100 million or more, which is almost 6 times less than the 26 percent share in top theatrical films. And male filmmakers were the “only directors with this level of resources,” as the study found. 

Yet streaming still remains more diverse than theatrical: Directors of color accounted for four out of 10 directors for streaming-released films, as opposed to only two out of ten for theatrical movies. “Hollywood loves formulas, but they need more elements that resonate with the audiences of today,” Ana-Christina Ramón, co-founder of the report and director of the Entertainment and Media Research Initiative at UCLA, said in a statement. “You can't expect an increasingly diverse population of avid movie viewers and ticket buyers to settle for a generic film with little to no diversity that may have been a hit over ten years ago. In order for Hollywood to survive financially and to remain relevant, it must invest in storytellers who bring diverse perspectives and new ideas to the table.”

 










Ramón added, “Streaming platforms are one of the few places where the stories and faces that reflect the people of this country can be found on and off screen.”

The Hollywood Diversity Report series is in its twelfth year. While there are still strides to be made for behind the camera gender equity, the study discovered a milestone for on-camera parity: In 2025, the report found that for the first time, 1 in 2 leads of streaming films were people of color, which is almost double the percentage for top theatrical films.

“Films should reflect the realities of this country in terms of representation,” Darnell Hunt, the executive vice chancellor and provost at UCLA, and co-founder of the report, said in a statement. “We're past the point where we can let the wholesale erasure of people's identities, perspectives and experiences slide. Having diverse stories pushes the boundaries of what we know and understand. Inclusive storytelling is needed now more than ever.”

The all-star July 5 gig in Birmingham will feature the rock icon's first full performance since 2018. 


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	If you can't make it to Birmingham, England on July 5 for what is being billed as the final-ever show by Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath don't sweat it, the Prince of Darkness has you covered. A video posted on Osbourne's socials on Wednesday morning (June 18) shows a massive crowd joining the metal icon in an “ay-ay-ay” shout as the screen fills with comments from fans asking (and begging) for the Back to the Beginning show to be livestreamed.


	“Your prayers answered!” reads a bold font message, followed by vintage footage of Ozzy saying “it's time to go back to the beginning.”  

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Ozzy, 76, recently said he will make it to the final show by Sabbath — with original bandmates guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Bulter and drummer Bill Ward — in their hometown of Birmingham no matter what it takes. As he trains for his first full concert since 2018 following a series of surgeries and health setbacks, Ozzy recently said on his “Ozzy Speaks” SiriusXM show that he will make it to the stage in Villa Park “by hook or by crook.” 

	











	Sabbath's final show will feature them joined by Metallica, Mastodon, Anthrax, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Gojira, Slayer and a supergroup featuring members of Guns N' Roses, the Smashing Pumpkins, Limp Bizkit, Judas Priest, Rage Against the Machine among many others.


	The livestream ticket will cost $29.99 and include access to watch the entire show beginning at 10 a.m. ET on July 5, with VOD replay access to rewatch the whole event from July 5th shortly after the event's conclusion until 10 a.m. ET on July 7; click here for details on livestream tickets.


	Osbourne's wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, recently said she'd removed a band from the Back to the Beginning lineup after a dispute with the unnamed group's manager, which made her feel “the worst way I've felt in years… I had a huge, huge to-do with a manager over this celebration for Ozzy and Sabbath. And it was probably the worst way I've felt in years. And I don't care what this person says about me, thinks about it, because he doesn't know me. And he's now going around making up bulls— lies because I threw his band off the bill.” At press time it was unclear which band Osbourne was referring to.

The first trailer for the new Bruce Springsteen movie, Deliver Me From Nowhere, is here. The clip offers another glimpse of Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen, as he creates the 1982 classic Nebraska. The trailer also features Jeremy Strong as Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau; Marc Maron as producer Chuck Plotkin; Johnny Cannizzaro as Steven Van Zandt; and others. Watch the trailer below.

Deliver Me From Nowhere, a 20th Century Studios film, hits theaters on Friday, October 24, 2025. The movie's director, Scott Cooper, said in a press statement, “Making ‘Springsteen' was deeply moving as it allowed me to step inside the soul of an artist I've long admired—and to witness, up close, the vulnerability and strength behind his music. The experience felt like a journey through memory, myth, and truth. And more than anything, it was a privilege to translate that raw emotional honesty to the screen, and in doing so, it changed me. I cannot thank Bruce and Jon Landau enough for allowing me to tell their story.”

Along with the aforementioned cast members, Deliver Me From Nowhere stars Paul Walter Hauser as guitar tech Mike Batlan; Stephen Graham as Bruce Springsteen's father, Doug; Odessa Young as a love interest name Faye; Gaby Hoffman as Springsteen's mother, Adele; and David Krumholtz as Columbia Records executive Al Teller. The film's producers are Scott Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Eric Robinson, and Scott Stuber, and its executive producers are Tracey Landon, Jon Vein, and author Warren Zanes.

Kneecap's Mo Chara was today granted unconditional bail on a controversial terror charge linked to an alleged display of support for Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, BBC News reports. Hundreds of supporters cheered, chanted “Free Palestine,” and waved Irish and Palestinian flags outside Westminster Magistrates' Court, where a preliminary hearing took place before legal arguments commence on August 20. Wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, Mo Chara, whose real name is Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, spoke only to confirm his identity. If convicted, he faces up to six months in prison and a fine, according to The New York Times.

During the brief hearing, prosecutor Michael Bisgrove told the court that the case is not about the rapper's “support for the people of Palestine or his criticism of Israel,” adding, “He is well within his rights to voice his opinions and his solidarity.” Instead, Bisgrove said, the case rests on footage, from a London concert in November 2024, that appeared to show Mo Chara draped in the Hezbollah flag and shouting, “Up Hamas! Up Hezbollah!” Public support of Hamas or Hezbollah is banned in the United Kingdom under anti-terror laws.

The Belfast rap trio came under scrutiny from the Metropolitan Police after displaying pro-Palestine and anti-Israel messages at this year's Coachella, which led to the recirculation of that 2024 footage. Mo Chara's defense lawyer, Brenda Campbell, argues the charge falls outside a six-month limit, Reuters reports. “If we are right in relation to that, then this court has no jurisdiction and there ends the case,” Campbell told the court.

Since the charge was filed, Kneecap have released a statement saying, “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah. We condemn all attacks on civilians, always. It is never okay.” On social media, they called the charge “political policing” and “a carnival of distraction.” The group has long been vocal in its support of Palestine and the Palestinian people, and has redoubled that support in light of Israel's continued assault on Gaza and the West Bank.

Mo Chara was joined today by bandmates Naoise “Móglaí Bap” Ó Caireallain and JJ “DJ Próvaí” Ó Dochartaigh. Kneecap rose to the public eye last year, when they released the album Fine Art and the semi-autobiographical film Kneecap. Their stance on Palestine has led to calls for them to be pulled from festivals, as well as a groundswell of support from fans and fellow artists. Among them is Paul Weller, one of the many present outside the courtroom today.

Jeremy Allen White is showing off his voice for his latest film, “Deliver Me from Nowhere.” The actor transforms into iconic rocker Bruce Springsteen for the biopic, which is set in the early '80s during the recordings of “Born in the USA” and “Nebraska.” 

Jeremy Strong portrays Springsteen's manager Jon Landau, with  “Adolescence” star Steven Graham as Springsteen's father.  Paul Walter Hauser, Marc Maron, Gaby Hoffmann, Odessa Young, and David Krumholtz co-star. “Deliver Us from Nowhere” was written and directed by Scott Cooper, who adapted the story from Warren Zanes' Springsteen biography. 

 










Springsteen said during Variety's Awards Circuit podcast that he was approached to partake in the film that only spans a sliver of his life and career. “They pitched the idea, and I said, ‘It sounds like fun,'” Springsteen said. “It's an interesting concept, because it's only a couple of years out of my life. It's '81, '82, and centered around the creation of that particular record while I was simultaneously recording ‘Born in the USA' and also going through some personal difficulties that I've been living with my whole life. But it's fantastic.”

He also told The Hollywood Reporter that he hopes the film is a “surprise” for fans. “I don't want to talk about it too much, except saying that Jeremy Allen White did a fantastic job,” Springsteen said. “As did Jeremy Strong, and there's a young woman, Odessa Young, in the picture, she's incredible also.”

“Deliver Me from Nowhere” is the latest musical biopic starring an in-demand rising actor: “A Complete Unknown” landed a slew of Academy noms, including a Best Actor nod for Timothée Chalamet as Bob Dylan. The four-part Beatles biopic is also in the works, with Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison, Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr, and Harris Dickinson as John Lennon.

In the meantime, “Deliver Me from Nowhere” star White could land his first Oscar nom for this feature. “The Bear” actor already has two Emmys under his belt. 

20th Century Studios will release “Deliver Me from Nowhere” in theaters on Friday, October 24. Check out the trailer below.

The news comes after Jimin and Jung Kook were recently released from their mandatory army service.

BTS fans' long wait is nearly over. The K-pop supergroup's label, BIG Hit, announced on Wednesday morning (June 18) that Suga, the final member of the group awaiting discharge from mandatory military duty in the South Korean army, is preparing to join his bandmates.

	At press time it was not known exactly when Suga will be released, but when he is discharged he will be last member of the group to complete the nation's 18-21 month mandatory military service; due to a prior shoulder injury, Suga did an alternate national service. Last week, Jung Kook and Jimin were discharged, joining RM, V, Jin and J-Hope in finishing their obligations, paving the way for the septet to reconvene after they went on hiatus in 2022.

	











	After his discharge last month, J-Hope told fans, “To all the ARMYs who have waited for us in the military, I want to say I am truly, truly grateful. Please wait just a little longer and we will return with a really cool performance.”

The Veo 3 video generator is capable of creating both videos and sound based on text prompts, with YouTube CEO Neal Mohan saying the "AI technology will push the limits of human creativity."


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	In a move that could change the video landscape, YouTube will integrate Google's most advanced AI video generation tool, Veo 3, into YouTube Shorts later this summer.


	YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced the integration in a keynote at the Cannes Lions festival Wednesday, where he was joined by YouTube creators Amelia Dimoldenberg, Alex Cooper, and Brandon Baum.




	“The possibilities with AI are limitless,” Mohan said. “A lot can change in a generation. Entertainment itself has changed more in the last two decades than any other time in history. Creators led this revolution.

	“My bet for the next 20 years? Creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream — as brand ambassadors, big business ventures and visionary storytellers,” he continued. “Communities will continue to surprise us with the power of their collective fandom. And cutting-edge AI technology will push the limits of human creativity. My biggest bet is that YouTube will continue to be the stage where it all happens. Where anyone with a story to share can turn their dream into a career… and anyone with a voice can bring people together and change the world.”




			Related Video		







	YouTube already uses an older generation of Veo for its Dream Screen background generation tool, but Veo 3 is a substantial upgrade. It announced the product back in 2023, and has been iterating on it since.


	The company has also been proactive in trying to get ahead of potential issues or controversies, including partnering with CAA and some top creators to develop a tool that gives celebrities and other high-profile people control over their likeness on the platform.

	











	Already videos created by Veo 3 have gone viral on social platforms, including concepts that imagine if historical or fictional figures were vloggers, though Mohan framed it's integration into shorts a tool to “open new creative lanes” for creators.


	Shorts has become a strategic imperative for YouTube as platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels also battle for shares of the short-form video audience. YouTube launches Shorts in 2021, and Mohan revealed Wednesday that it now averages more than 200 billion views per day, an astonishing number that underscores YouTube's scale in streaming video.


	Mohan also sued the keynote to highlight something that has become a recurring theme for the platform in recent years: That YouTube has become a dominant force in entertainment and popular culture, and telling the crowd in Cannes that creators “are the startups of Hollywood.”


	“Like most startups, these creators are reimagining the industry that inspired them and creating new jobs for writers, editors, actors and producers. Some are even building state-of-the-art studios,” he said. As THR previously reported, some creators have raised financing and turned to entertainment veterans to build bona fide production facilities.

Jeremy Strong also stars in writer-director Scott Cooper's feature that hits theaters this fall.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Jeremy Allen White is in his glory as Bruce Springsteen in the first trailer for Deliver Me From Nowhere. 


20th Century Studios releases writer-director Scott Cooper‘s biopic movie in theaters Oct. 24. White, known for his Emmy-winning role on The Bear, stars as Springsteen and does his own singing, while Jeremy Strong plays the musician's longtime manager and record producer Jon Landau.




Deliver Me From Nowhere focuses on the making of Springsteen's 1982 spare and deeply personal Nebraska, one of the most acclaimed albums of all time. Stephen Graham, Odessa Young, Paul Walter Hauser, Gaby Hoffmann, Johnny Cannizzaro, Harrison Gilbertson, Marc Maron, David Krumholtz and Chris Jaymes round out the cast.

	Footage from the film debuted at CinemaCon in April and included White's stirring rendition of Springsteen's 1975 single “Born to Run,” which became the singer's first Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.


	In the trailer, White declares about the album, “Don't need to be perfect. I want it to feel like I'm in the room by myself.” Strong's Landau later describes Nebraska by saying that with the album, Springsteen is “repairing that hole in himself. Once he's done with that, he's going to repair the entire world.”


	Cooper helmed the project from his own script that he adapted from Warren Zanes' 2023 book of the same name. Producers include Cooper, Zanes and Scott Stuber, along with Gotham Group's Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and Eric Robinson. Both Springsteen and Landau are involved with the film.


The Hollywood Reporter previously reported that record producer Dave Cobb, who has worked with Springsteen, is involved with the film's music.


	During his CinemaCon appearance, White called making the movie a “dream come true” and added, “I feel really lucky. We all had Bruce's blessing on this film.”

The singer appeared to be agitated by the sight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arresting people on the streets.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Like the reported five million plus Americans who took to the streets across the country over the weekend as part of the massive “No Kings” rallies, Bad Bunny is not happy with the Trump administration's recent actions. In a video posted to his Instagram Story on Tuesday (June 17), the singer lashed out at what he said was a raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in his native Puerto Rico.

	











	“Those motherf–kers are in these cars, RAV4's,” Bad Bunny can be heard saying in the video in Spanish over footage of a scrum of unmarked SUVs blocking the street and seemingly apprehending some people on what the singer said was Avenida Pontezuela in Carolina, Puerto Rico. “They came here… sons of b–ches, instead of letting the people alone and working.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	At press time it was unclear what the footage Bad Bunny posted was depicting, but if the action was part of the Trump administration's stepped-up ICE raids all over the U.S. it comes after the president surged more than 4,000 National Guard members and 700 active-duty Marines into Los Angeles — over the objections of both the mayor and the state's governor — to quell what have been mostly peaceful protests against the ICE raids in that city.


	Though Trump promised to remove criminals who are in the U.S. without proper documentation, the ICE raids have so far targeted a much wider swath of folks. NPR reported recently that the raids in Puerto Rico have mostly rounded up Dominican immigrants in actions that harken back to the island's “long history of anti-Dominican racism,” with racial profiling possibly playing a role in the arrests. 

	











	Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico Rebecca González-Ramos said agents on the island nation have done surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, questioned people in the street and asked workers at the department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the estimated 6,000 people who got licenses under an immigrant-friendly law that opened driving privileges to people without legal status, according to NPR. 


	González-Ramos added that so far ICE agents in P.R. have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the first four months of Trump's second administration, less than 80 of whom had criminal records; three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals.


	Bad Bunny joins a rising chorus of artists who've lashed out at the ICE raids. Over the weekend, Olivia Rodrigo posted her thoughts on the ICE deportations, saying, “I've lived in LA my whole life, and I'm deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration. LA simply wouldn't exist without immigrants.”


	Addison Rae also said she was “so disappointed and disturbed by what is happening across our nation. This country could not exist without immigrants. Every human being deserves the right to exist in an environment that makes them feel safe, lovingly protected, and embraced.” Finneas claimed he was tear-gassed during a peaceful protest in L.A. earlier this month, writing “F–K ICE… If you are into this fascist s–t you are small and weak and will lose.”


	Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong has also hit out at ICE, in addition to Katy Perry who has called the raids a “huge injustice,” while Shakira said she lives in “constant fear” as an immigrant in the U.S. Others who protested the actions in L.A. include Tyler, the Creator, The Game, Kehlani, Tom Morello, Reneé Rapp and Rebecca Black.

	











	Earlier this month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration to end what he said was the “illegal and unnecessary takeover of a CalGuard unit, which has needlessly escalated chaos and violence in the Los Angeles region.” The lawsuit names Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Department of Defense, in a filing that outlines “why the takeover violates the U.S. Constitution and exceeds the President's Title 10 authority, not only because the takeover occurred without the consent or input of the Governor, as federal law requires,  but also because it was unwarranted.”


	Trump responded over the weekend by saying that ICE must “expand  efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” cities the president described as “the core of the Democrat Power Center.”

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


	Aaron Guzikowski (Raised by Wolves) has signed to write the screenplay for an adult-targeted animated feature inspired by Hideo Kojima's hit action-adventure video game Death Stranding.


	The signing was announced by Japanese games maestro Hideo Kojima's Tokyo and L.A.-based Kojima Productions and L.A.-based animation company Line Mileage.


	The partners say the movie, which is currently in development, will be in a similar vein to adult-targeted, animated genre films such as the recently announced John Wick animated prequel and sci-fi horror Predator: Killer of Killers, which released on this month on Hulu and Disney+.

	It will feature an original story unfolding in the universe of Death Stranding, set in the wake of a series of cataclysmic explosions around the world which result in the dead and living becoming connected.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Guzikowski has won praise for his emotionally charged storytelling, with credits including sci-fi show Raised by Wolves and 2013 abduction drama Prisoners directed by Denis Villeneuve. 


	“I love the world of Death Stranding, it's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honored that Hideo Kojima, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe,” said Guzikowski.


	“Drawing and animation have always been near and dear to my heart, so to finally get to play in this space is a dream come true.”

	











	Directed by Kojima and featuring performances by Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, Léa Seydoux, Guillermo del Toro, Death Stranding has been credited with redefining the dramatic potential of video games. A new version of the original game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach – adding Elle Fanning to the cast – is due out on June 26.


	The new animated feature project is separate from a previously announced live-action adaptation being developed by Kojima Production with A24.


	Line Mileage is the animation production company of partners Jacob Robinson (Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft), Daniel Dominguez (Seis Manos), and Brad Graeber (Castlevania).


	Specializing in adult genre storytelling across animation, the team brings deep experience in adapting IP across games, comics, and beyond.


	Line Mileage CCO Daniel Dominguez said the cinematic quality of Death Stranding meant the game lent itself well to an animated movie adaptation.


	“As an avid gamer I can say, unequivocally, Death Stranding is the most cinematic, thought-provoking video game I have ever played,” he said.


	“Playing it gave me the same emotional rush, visceral punch, and intellectual pleasure I had the first time I watched Blade Runner, or Ghost in the Shell. Adapting it into a form it so naturally evokes is an honor. And for Aaron Guzikowski to lend his talents, whose authorial mind and creative energy humble me… needless to say, this project is a dream come true.”


	 Guzikowski is represented by Verve, Lit Entertainment Group and attorney Jeff Frankel.

The MC appeared at Westminster's Magistrates Court in London in relation to the charge 


													By
												

	Thomas Smith



Kneecap's Mo Chara appeared at Westminster's Magistrates Court on Wednesday (June 18) in relation to an alleged terror offense.


	In May, the MC (born Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh) was charged for allegedly showing support for militant organizations Hamas and Hezbollah – both of which are defined as terror groups by U.K. law – in newly surfaced videos from a past concert. The video appeared to show Chara shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” and displaying a Hezbollah flag at a show in London in November 2024.


	During the hearing, Mo Chara spoke only to confirm his name. The Press Association reports that Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring, presiding over the case, released him on unconditional bail and set a hearing date of Aug. 20. Mr Goldspring said that the 27-year-old must attend court on that day. Prosecutor Michael Bisgrove told the court: “This case is not about Mr hAnnaidh's support for the people of Palestine or his criticism of Israel.” (via The Irish News)

	Campaigners supporting the group were present at the court's entrance, with the band and its label Heavenly encouraging fans to attend.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The Belfast trio, made up of Mo Chara, Móglaí Bap and DJ Próvaí arrived to court wearing “Free Mo Chara” t-shirts. In the build-up to the court case, Kneecap had “plastered” London with billboards with the message ‘More Blacks, More Dogs, More Irish, Mo Chara,' in reference to the discriminatory slogan that was present at some London pubs in the 1950s and '60s.


	Speaking on their social platforms, the group called the charge “a carnival of distraction” from what they see as the real issue at hand: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes.”

	











	The group say that their pro-Palestine views have been weaponised against them and claimed that their artistic free speech has been infringed. A number of artists including Massive Attack, Fontaines D.C., Paul Weller and IDLES signed an open letter backing the trio. On Monday, The Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr shared a statement showing support for Kneecap, and called for them to remain on the bill at Glastonbury Festival next week (June 27-29) despite calls for a boycott.


	The Northern Irish hip-hop trio released their breakthrough album Fine Art in 2024 alongside a self-titled biopic which saw critical acclaim, and was nominated for an Academy Award as well as winning a BAFTA prize.


	In April 2025, the group ended their Coachella sets with a message that stated: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes. F–k Israel; free Palestine.” A number of industry names including Sharon Osbourne called for them to be removed from the bill and their work visas to be revoked.


	Past videos of the band soon began to surface, including one from November 2023 with the group allegedly saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” Kneecap issued a statement on the remarks, offering an apology to the families of Sir David Amess and Jo Cox; both were killed while standing as MPs in separate incidents in 2021 and 2016, respectively. 


	“Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah. We condemn all attacks on civilians, always. It is never okay,” the group said. “We know this more than anyone, given our nation's history. We also reject any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever. An extract of footage, deliberately taken out of all context, is now being exploited and weaponised, as if it were a call to action.” The group were not charged in connection with this incident.

	











	During the fallout, a number of the band's shows were cancelled by organisers, including TRNSMT in Glasgow, Scotland and the Eden Sessions in Cornwall. Kneecap announced – and promptly sold out – make-up shows for fans in those cities.

Alex Medeiros, head of drama, documentaries & film at Brazilian media and entertainment giant Grupo Globo's streaming service Globoplay, spoke at Conecta Fiction & Entertainment in Cuenca, Spain.

	Conecta Fiction & Entertainment, taking place in Cuenca, Spain, this week, may be mostly a TV industry gathering, but Brazil's Oscar-winning movie I'm Still Here, directed by Walter Salles and starring Fernanda Torres, got a big shout-out at the event on Wednesday. 


	Alex Medeiros, head of drama, documentaries & film at Brazilian media and entertainment giant Grupo Globo‘s streaming service Globoplay, appeared at Conecta in a session entitled “American Commissioners Uncovered,” and he touted the movie's success. Highlighting that the story of a family broken apart by dictatorship was the first movie from the company after it merged its two film brands under the Globo Filmes banner, he said: “We're extremely happy and proud that we won Brazil's first-ever Oscar for best international feature.”

	The executive then quipped: “Well, it's only downhill from there, but this is really a great moment for us, and we hope to keep investing in the theatrical experience.” 


	Globo brings films to cinemas first and then to its streaming platform, and there is a good reason for that. “We still think that the better they do theatrically, the better they will do on the platform, and so far, that has been the case,” Medeiros explained. 


	Next up for Globo is School Without Walls, a film about a public school in one of Brazil's biggest favelas directed by Cao Hamburger, that is a co-production of Brazil's Gullane, Portugal's Ukbar Filmes and France's Playtime Group that is also backed by Telecine. Julio Andrade stars as an inspirational headteacher in the movie.

	











	“We are shooting in two weeks,” Medeiros shared at Conecta. “We have high hopes for this movie. It's a beautiful, true story about a guy who implements a very revolutionary methodology in a school in a very difficult area of Sao Paulo.”


	On Tuesday at Conecta, executives from the likes of Gaumont Television and Warner Bros. Discovery had discussed their original programming plans and the state of the TV industry.

	The BBC has confirmed an all-star cast for its latest drama from Hugo Blick.


	Deadline brought you news that Bill Nighy was in talks for Clifftops back in February and the BBC has confirmed the show, now titled California Avenue, will star Nighy, Helena Bonham Carter, Tom Burke and Erin Doherty, the latter of whom is fresh off the back of the runaway success of Netflix's Adolescence.


California Avenue is set in a secluded canal-side caravan park deep in the luscious English countryside, where its peace is irrevocably disrupted by the arrival of Lela (Doherty) and her 11-year-old child, both on the run, looking for refuge in this hidden world. It is here that a fractured family will come together, ghosts and demons will firmly be put to rest and an unexpected love is forged. Nighy and Bonham Carter star as Jerry and Eddie, Lela's parents, while Burke is showman outcast, Cooper.

California Avenue (6×60) is produced by Colin Wratten (The English, Lockerbie: A Search for Truth), and the executive producers are Blick for Eight Rooks, Greg Brenman for Drama Republic, Nighy, Bonham Carter, and Lucy Richer for the BBC. The series is produced by Drama Republic. Mediawan Rights and Entourage Media will distribute the series internationally.

Ozzy Osbourne is officially the Prince of Immortality, or at least, he's giving fans a shot at it. 


	In one of the most bizarre and perfectly on-brand collaborations of the year, Liquid Death has announced it will sell a limited run of iced tea cans containing traces of Osbourne's actual DNA.


	The ultra-limited release, dubbed Infinite Ozzy, features 10 cans of Liquid Death Iced Tea that were each consumed by Osbourne before being sealed to preserve his DNA, with each can coming in a lab-quality display container and is hand-signed by the rock legend.

	The campaign arrives just weeks before Osbourne is set to return to the stage for what's being billed as the final Black Sabbath show. The metal icon recently revealed that he's undergoing intense training to prepare for Back to the Beginning, the massive July 5 hometown concert at Villa Park in Birmingham, England — his first full performance since 2018.


	“I haven't done any physical work for the last seven, six and a half, seven years,” Osbourne shared during the latest episode of his SiriusXM show Ozzy Speaks. “By hook or by crook, I'm gonna make it [to the stage at Villa Park].” The star-studded farewell show is set to feature appearances by Metallica, Mastodon, Pantera, Slayer, Anthrax, Gojira, Alice in Chains, and a supergroup composed of members of Guns N' Roses, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine and more.

	“I've got this trainer guy who helps people get back to normal,” he added. “It's hard going, but he's convinced that he can pull it off for me. I'm giving it everything I've got.”

	











	As for the Liquid Death collab, the brand says the goal is to preserve Osbourne's DNA in case fans want to clone him in the future, once technology and law allow. The campaign leans heavily into Liquid Death's signature over-the-top style, which previously included Tony Hawk skateboards infused with his blood.


	A teaser video shared with press ahead of the launch shows Osbourne deadpanning: “My DNA is in this can. You could clone me — but why the f**k would you want to?” Only 10 Infinite Ozzy cans exist.


	Osbourne's most recent studio album, Patient Number 9, debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 in 2022. Despite major health setbacks, including spinal surgeries and a Parkinson's diagnosis, he has remained creatively active and continues to embrace his role as heavy metal's most enduring provocateur.

Justin Bieber rang in his first Father's Day as a dad on Sunday, June 15, sharing glimpses of his celebration with wife Hailey and their 9-month-old son Jack Blues Bieber across social media. The 31-year-old singer documented the special day through Instagram posts that showcased everything from lavish presents to sweet family moments.

The “Baby” singer kicked off his Father's Day posts with his signature humor, sharing a selfie featuring a fake tiny hand giving the middle finger. “I'm a dad that's not to be [expletive] with,” Justin captioned the photo.

His celebration included an impressive haul of luxury gifts, including an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch valued at $38,000, two Prada backpacks, and a new Apple laptop. The singer playfully captioned his gift photo with “Happy daddy day to me u lil ho.”

Despite ongoing speculation about their relationship status, the Biebers spent the holiday together. Justin would document their romantic getaway on Instagram. “Made it home from a lil date night getaway 🛸,” he wrote alongside photos of Hailey walking into their home.

The couple's son, Jack Blues, joined the celebrations in an adorable way. Justin shared videos of the baby at the piano with his mom, Hailey. In one clip, the singer filmed from the ground as his wife and son enjoyed music time together. Little Jack even sported a gold bracelet featuring his initials “JBB,” adding a touch of baby bling to the festivities.

Some outlets claimed Hailey “snubbed” Justin by not posting on Instagram for Father's Day. However, the couple clearly celebrated together based on Justin's numerous posts showing their family time. Hailey's distinctive engagement ring was visible in the piano photos. She also shared one of the images on her own Instagram Story, further confirming their quality moments together.

The couple welcomed Jack Blues in August 2024 after announcing their pregnancy in May of that year. A source close to the family told People shortly after the birth that Justin was already “great” at being a dad. They noted, “They're both overjoyed. The baby is such a miracle. He's adorable and doing well. The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for.”

Justin has already expressed enthusiasm about sharing his passions with his son. During a February 2025 charity hockey game, he told reporters he wanted to get Jack on the ice “as soon as possible,” joking, “It's never too early.” 

For her part, Hailey recently described motherhood as the “wildest, coolest thing I've ever done” in an Instagram post marking International Women's Day. The couple, who married in September 2018, continue to navigate parenthood together while sharing selective glimpses of their growing family with fans.

Amy Jo Johnson is honoring the memory of her late “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” co-star Jason David Frank with a heartfelt tribute. The actress, best known for her role as Kimberly Hart, the original Pink Ranger, shared a rare photo of the duo in an Instagram post following her appearance at the Niagara Falls Comic Con earlier this month.

The 90's star captioned the post, “💕 thank you to whoever it was who gave me this photo at Niagara. 💕 miss this guy, as we all do. 🦋,” Johnson captioned the image, which shows her smiling beside Frank.

Frank, who portrayed Tommy Oliver on the beloved 1990s series, died by suicide in November 2022 at age 49, as reported by Deadline. The photo, which resurfaced during the fan convention, quickly sparked an emotional response from fans who fondly remember the chemistry between the two characters on screen.

According to People, Johnson took to Instagram Live in November 2022 following Frank's death to share her grief and connect with fans. Through tears, she said, “I just came on here because I was feeling really sad and really it's really hitting home today what had happened and that he's gone. I don't know. I just thought of all of you guys because I know how much you all meant to him and how much you guys are probably in the same amount of pain and so sad.”

She went on to describe Frank as “such a force and such a bright, bright, crazy, wild, funny light. I just can't even believe it. My head hurts so bad.”

Before ending the livestream with a song, Johnson delivered a powerful message to anyone struggling with their mental health. “Anybody who is out there who is feeling depressed and like there's no hope, just know that that's not the way and there is help and you do have a community here,” she said. “Just reach out. Reach out for help if you are feeling like that. F—. It f—— sucks. Sorry for the swearing, but it really f—— sucks. Sorry.”

At the end of her livestream, Johnson added, “I know how much you all meant to Jason, and it sucks. But we're all going to be okay.”

Jason David Frank was a mainstay in the “Power Rangers” franchise and a fan-favorite at conventions around the world. His legacy continues to resonate deeply with fans and co-stars alike.

Celebrity chef Anne Burrell, known for her vibrant personality and signature spiky blonde hair, has died at age 55. The Food Network star passed away on June 17 at her home in Brooklyn, her family confirmed in a statement.

“Anne was a beloved wife, sister, daughter, stepmother, and friend—her smile lit up every room she entered,” her family shared with E! News. “Anne's light radiated far beyond those she knew, touching millions across the world. Though she is no longer with us, her warmth, spirit, and boundless love remain eternal.”

Her last television appearance was on an episode of Food Network's “House of Knives,” which premiered in March 2025.

A post shared by SCREEN THRILL| Movies & TV (@screenthrill)

Burrell was widely recognized as the host of popular Food Network series including “Worst Cooks in America” and “Secrets of a Restaurant Chef.” Her legacy in food television spans nearly two decades, starting in 2005 when she first appeared as a sous chef for Mark Ladner on “Iron Chef America.”

Beyond her television career, Burrell was classically trained at the Culinary Institute of America and studied abroad at the Italian Culinary Institute for Foreigners. She later served as a sous chef at Felidia in Manhattan and as head chef at Savoy in SoHo. Her talent and charisma earned her an Emmy nomination and two bestselling cookbooks.

Burrell often emphasized bringing joy into the kitchen. “I truly, in my heart, feel that your food knows how you're feeling when you cook it and it reacts accordingly,” she told Tasting Table in April. “I like to put happy and joy into my food, and it's not so serious… take the fear factor out of it and put the fun factor in.”

A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)

As reported by E News, Burrell had taken up improv comedy classes in New York City in the months leading up to her death. “I showed up on the first day and [was] by far and away the oldest person in my class and the only one without a theater degree,” she said. “You go for three hours a week and it's playing games… and it's so fun.”

She performed her final improv set on June 16—just one day before her death, per US Weekly. Her last Instagram post, shared days prior, featured a selfie with the Green Lady of Brooklyn. “I'm not going to lie—I have been keeping an eye out for her… She is just lovely!!!” Burrell captioned the photo.

A post shared by Food Network (@foodnetwork)

The Food Network posted a heartfelt tribute to their official Instagram page, writing, “We are deeply saddened to share the news that beloved chef, Anne Burrell, passed away this morning. Anne was a remarkable person and culinary talent – teaching, competing and always sharing the importance of food in her life and the joy that a delicious meal can bring. Our thoughts are with Anne's family, friends and fans during this time of tremendous loss.”

According to People, Burrell is survived by her husband Stuart Claxton, her stepson Javier, her mother Marlene, and her sister Jane. No cause of death has been disclosed.

Jay Slater's post-mortem and funeral will feature in a new Channel 4 documentary that will look into conspiracy theories surrounding the case. 

The Disappearance Of Jay Slater will follow the story of the 19-year-old who vanished in Tenerife last June - only to be found dead a month later at the bottom of a ravine on the Spanish party island. 

The film, which has been made in collaboration with Mr Slater's family, will include exclusive access to his post-mortem and funeral. 

It is also set to look at the conspiracy theories that stemmed from the story, the online abuse that the family still receive and the media coverage of the case. 

Mr Slater's disappearance last summer sparked a global internet storm - with armchair detectives sparking wild theories as to what happened to him. 

Rita Daniels, Channel 4 commissioning editor, said: 'The story of Jay Slater captured the nation last summer with a fervour and intensity fuelled by armchair detectives and internet culture.

'We are so glad to be working with Anna on a sensitively handled exploration of the family's experience, and understanding the impact of being in the middle of a social media storm, amplified by grief.

'The film holds a light up to our current society and is exactly the story that is a necessity for Channel 4 to tell.'

Produced by Candour Productions, it will also look at the world of online armchair detectives and the consequences of their actions.

It comes after celebrity investigator Mark Williams-Thomas last week revealed the first full witness account from the last person to see Mr Slater alive. 

According to the extraordinary new account, the 19-year-old armed himself with two knives and stole a bag of ketamine before fleeing an AirBnB on Tenerife.

Mr Williams-Thomas found that those around Mr Slater on the night he disappeared spoke of him having taken a cocktail of drugs that left him 'on a mission'. 

Extraordinarily the TV investigator managed to track down two key witnesses in the case - just a month after the coroner officially appointed to investigate Mr Slater's death expressed exasperation that the police had been unable to find the same pair. 

Those witnesses include Ayub Qassim - the man who the apprentice bricklayer from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire accompanied back to an AirBnB after staying up all night on drugs following a music festival. 

Convicted drug dealer Qassim, 31, is understood to be was the last person to see the apprentice bricklayer before he vanished in mountains high above the village of Masca and had been due to give evidence at his inquest last month but the coroner said he could not be traced.

In the two part podcast called Jay Slater The Investigation, Williams-Thomas underlines how Qassim served a nine-year jail term after being convicted in 2015, following the smashing of a plot to flood the streets of Cardiff with Class A drugs.

Speaking to Williams-Thomas, Qassim describes how he had picked up Lucy Law and two friends Bradley Hargreaves and Brandon Hodgson, and they went to look for Jay after she had contacted him on social media.

In the podcast, Williams Thomas says: 'What Qassim said next was really significant and I believe provides real context to a very number of important aspects of this case.'

Qassim tells him: 'They were just doing my head in, one said. 'That's the two bottles of Henny [Hennessy cognac], they were just doing my head in.

'In the end I just turned to Brandon and said:' Look Brandon, one of your mates, yesterday walked way because he's f**** off with the ket [ketamine] and he want missing. Tell this f****** idiot to get back in the car.'

Williams-Thomas says: 'So, let's just re hear that again,' before playing the clip once more, and then adding:' I believe this is really significant new information.

'When Qassim said ket, he was referring to ketamine and my information is that this drug was readily available and that Jay had definitely been using it.

'I have further information about the supply of ketamine into the country, in the UK ketamine is a class B drug carrying a maximum of five years sentence for possession and 14 years for supply.'

Williams-Thomas adds: 'So, Qassim says in the recording that Jay left the rental on the morning and took with him Qassim's ketamine.

'If you wonder why we've not heard this before, his police statement of course made no mention of this.

'My intelligence, however, is that the rental location was specifically chosen so as not to being attention to nay illegal activity.'

The release date for Channel 4's new show is yet to be announced.

Instruments flying more than 18 miles (29 kilometers) above Antarctica detected two unexplainable radio pulses coming from below the ice — and these signals seem to defy particle physics.

Researchers determined the radio pulses came from angles around 30 degrees below Antarctica's surface, which the laws of physics theoretically prohibit. Calculations suggest the signals had to pass through thousands of miles of rock to get to the surface; however, scientists expect the pulses to be absorbed by the rock on this journey, rendering them undetectable.

The research team is now looking deeper into what could have caused the unexpected pulses. They ruled out some possible explanations using the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina and shared those findings in a study published March 27 in the journal Physical Review Letters.

"It's an interesting problem because we still don't actually have an explanation for what those anomalies are," Stephanie Wissel, a particle physicist and co-author of the study, said in a statement.

The mysterious pulses were first detected by the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment. ANITA comprises 24 radio antennas attached to a NASA balloon, located near the south pole to avoid signal interference.

The project was designed to capture data about neutrinos — subatomic particles that are especially difficult to study because they lack electric charge and have minimal mass. These elusive characteristics have earned them the nickname "ghost particles".

But the confusing radio signals are "most likely not representing neutrinos," Wissel said. Existing models, she explained, predict that pulses caused by neutrinos would originate from angles very far from 30 degrees under the surface. The new study provides further evidence that neutrinos are probably not involved.

Using complex mathematical models and simulations, the research team also ruled out noise and known particle interactions as sources of the signals. They even examined data from other experiments to see if they observed any interaction that could cause the pulses, to no avail.

Since these observations can't be explained by the Standard Model, the theory that describes subatomic particles, the phenomenon responsible for these pulses could be key to unlocking new scientific understanding.

"More research needs to be done on this," Benjamin Flaggs, a physics graduate student at the University of Delaware and co-author of the study, told Live Science. "There are theorists proposing some beyond-standard-model interactions from different types of particles," he said.

If neutrinos aren't responsible for the radio signals, then what is?

Some theories suggest the signals are coming from dark matter — the invisible entity that makes up about 27% of the universe, but which remains poorly understood — Wissel said. But more data is needed before coming to any meaningful conclusion. Wissel favors the theory that the origin of these pulses may be explained by some as-of-yet unknown behavior of radio waves, but there's no evidence to support this guess, either. "So, right now, it's one of these long-standing mysteries," she said.

The Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations, a new balloon-based instrument, with advanced levels of sensitivity, is expected to help solve this puzzle by detecting more anomalies, thus providing more data to be scrutinized. "The more data we can get, the better we can get our statistical error," Flaggs said. The instrument will launch from Antarctica in December.

"We haven't discovered everything yet," Flaggs added. "It's exciting for researchers because these are problems that no one else has figured out before."

TOPICS:

WASHINGTON (TNND) — Trump administration border czar Tom Homan on Tuesday announced illegal alien encounters at the southern border had fallen to the “lowest number ever recorded.”

Over the past 24 hours, he wrote, Border Patrol officials encountered just 95 illegal aliens. This, Homan said, marks a drastic contrast from the thousands per day which entered the country under former President Joe Biden.

“That is the lowest number EVER recorded," Homan wrote. "On top of that, they released the vast majority into the US. How many were released under Trump for May? Zero. Compare that to the 62,000 aliens Biden released in May of last year.”



Homan continued by making an appeal for Congress to pass the “big, beautiful bill” to allow his teams to continue its mass deportation efforts.

“To continue this great work and make it more permanent, we need the Big Beautiful Bill passed so we can finish the job, to include the biggest deportation operation the American people voted for,” he added. “God bless the men and women of CBP and ICE.”

His comments follow widespread protests and riots to combat the immigration enforcement efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Homan most recently challenged California Gov. Gavin Newsom over his challenge to be arrested for supporting the display.

“No one is above the law,” Homan said in an appearance on Fox News. “If they cross the line, if they commit a crime, absolutely they can [be arrested].”

“All you hear is ICE being racists, being Nazis and Gov. Newsom feeds that,” he added.

Sports Business

Welcome back to MoneyCall, The Athletic's weekly sports business cheat sheet. (Want to receive it every Wednesday in your email? Subscribe here.)

Name-dropped today: John Henry, Florian Wirtz, Mario Lemieux, Brian Rolapp, Caitlin Clark, Joey Chestnut, JJ Spaun, Louis Vuitton, Michael Rubin, Pope Leo XIV, Ares Management, Kylian Mbappe, Angel Reese, Simone Biles and more. Let's go:

The reality of the Devers trade

It is convenient — and undoubtedly cathartic — for Red Sox fans to blame this week's seemingly lopsided Rafael Devers trade on owner Fenway Sports Group's wider holdings across the Sox, Liverpool and the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Advertisement

As tempting as it is to construct a corporate conspiracy, three things can be true at once:

 1 Red Sox honcho Craig Breslow — presumably with the blessing of principal owner John Henry — felt like the Devers' drama wasn't worth the dollars owed through 2033 and found a way to get out from under the deal (even if it meant losing a great player for modest return).

 2 Liverpool, coming off a Premier League championship season, had the opportunity to sign arguably the best player in Europe, Florian Wirtz, which was going to require paying a premium. But what's the price of sustained Premier League glory?

 3 As for the Pens, FSG identified that the market for selling stakes in teams playing in major U.S. sports leagues has never been hotter, so they are looking into cashing in during a frothy moment to sell a non-controlling stake.

Conspiracy?!?! No. Just the reality of multi-team ownership groups navigating opportunities (and, yes, challenges) within — not across — each portfolio team.

A sharp golf hire, plus a shrewd WNBA TV deal

Big talkers from the sports business industry:

NFL No. 2 Brian Rolapp named PGA Tour CEO: This is an A+ hire for the PGA Tour, which is expected to consolidate its power structure around and under the veteran media leader over the rest of this year.

As the PGA juggles a new infusion of investment billions, new competitors and the need to find new audience and revenue growth, Rolapp is as well-positioned as anyone they could have hired to map it out.

Club World Cup lightning round:
Fields: Bad (MetLife esp)
Attendance: Iffy! (Very!)
Politics: Controversial
Must-see team: Boca Juniors
Marketing: Michelob Ultra winning?
Weather: It's hot (WC26 preview?)

Caitlin Clark Effect, cont'd: CC returned from injury last Saturday for Fever-Liberty, and the game proceeded to drive 2.2M viewers, the third-most ever for a WNBA game on ABC.

Related: WNBA and Scripps extended their win-win ION Friday TV deal.

Other current obsessions: Joey Chestnut returning to Nathan's July 4 hot dog contest … Real Madrid x Louis Vuitton … the MLB collectible concession-food trend … Apple's “haptic” trailer for “F1: The Movie” …

The biggest draw of Fanatics' new mega-event

Fanatics Fest returns to New York City this weekend. Michael Rubin's Fanatics — which has expanded from a place to buy fan gear to a collectibles juggernaut — has invested in making its annual convention the glitziest collectibles event of the year.

This year will include appearances from a ton of star athletes, including Tom Brady, LeBron James and Peyton Manning. The Athletic will have a team of five reporters on the scene.

I asked our Memorabilia & Collectibles editor Brooks Peck what part of the weekend fans will be talking about most:

 “The “Museum of Greatness” is going to be pretty incredible. This is going to be a 10,500-square-foot experience bringing together over $200 million worth of sports cards and memorabilia, some of which has never been publicly displayed before, from the private collections of an unnamed assortment of athletes and collectors.

“It's supposedly the most valuable collection of sports memorabilia ever assembled.

“But it's not just the display itself that's notable, it's the security around it, too. The exhibit will be guarded 24/7 by two dozen armed security guards, undercover police officers, security dogs and more. This all sounds like the setup for a heist movie.”

Payout of the Week: $4.3M

Can't say U.S. Open champ J.J. Spaun didn't earn it. Related: My colleague Elise Devlin on four lessons anyone can learn from Spaun's success. (Not included: How to drain a 64-foot putt to clinch a championship.)

Number to Know: 39,255
That's MLB's average attendance on Father's Day this year, the highest on any Sunday since … Father's Day 2008.

Brand Watch: ‘47
The hat company (part of New Era) got a boost when Pope Leo XIV was photographed wearing a White Sox cap earlier this month. My colleague Dhani Joseph looked into what happens to a brand when that kind of serendipitous marketing moment occurs.

TIL: NFL Chess Champ?
Didn't know this existed: NFL players competed in a blitz chess competition, and Justin Reid beat Kyler Murray for the title. (Next year, this needs a much bigger TV platform.)

Investor of the Week: Ares Management
SailGP investment isn't just for Marvel characters and soccer stars. Per my colleague Asli Pelit, the investment firm with the $3.7B sports-only fund jumped in to take a big stake in Kylian Mbappe's French team, expanding an Ares portfolio that already includes stakes in the Miami Dolphins, Inter Miami and Atletico Madrid.

Executive Q&A Series: Reebok CEO
We're experimenting on a new Q&A series with sports executives. Most recent: Reebok CEO Todd Krinsky on the brand's return to basketball and betting on Angel Reese. Speaking of …

Trademark Search: “Mebounds”
Yup, Reese submitted a trademark application based on fan mockery of her playing style. No athlete in sports right now is more innovative about turning criticism into opportunity than Reese.

Peak of the Week: Commencement ‘25
Derek Jeter at Michigan. Simone Biles at Wash U. Mia Hamm at UNC. Carmelo Anthony at Syracuse. Loved this story from Rustin Dodd about the different inspiring messages being relayed from sports figures to college graduates over the past month.

Great business-adjacent reads for your downtime or commute:

My colleague Damon Sayles made the short trip from Dallas to Bells, Texas, to see first-hand the replica of Fenway Park built for wiffle ball. Living vicariously through that assignment!

Two more reads worth your time:

“Previously …” in MoneyCall, we featured the Orlando Magic's branding return to the old, beloved pinstripes. Then my colleague David Betancourt dug into why the team did it, a great case study in marketing.

Posted Jun 18, 2025 05:00:06 AM.

Last Updated Jun 18, 2025 11:31:45 AM.

TORONTO — For Domee Shi, making a movie about an introverted kid getting abducted by aliens felt oddly familiar.

Not because she's had any close encounters, but because she remembers being a teenager longing to be taken away to a world where her weirdness was understood.

The Toronto native co-directs “Elio,” a Pixar animated sci-fi film about an 11-year-old orphan who yearns to be snatched by extraterrestrials to escape his loneliness — and gets his wish when an interplanetary organization mistakes him for Earth's ambassador.

“He's this lonely artsy kid who just wants to belong somewhere. I definitely felt that way growing up,” says the Oscar-winning animator behind 2022's coming-of-age Toronto-set hit “Turning Red.”

Born in Chongqing, China and raised in Toronto after immigrating to Canada as a child, Shi grew up obsessed with anime. She describes it as an isolating experience. In high school, she was the vice-president of the anime club — a group that had only two members.

“Back in the '90s and 2000s, anime was popular, but it wasn't as popular, I feel, as it is now…. I really wished people cared about the same stuff that I cared about,” Shi says during a promotional stop in Toronto.

She recalls dreaming of going to animation school so she could “find people who understood me, who spoke my language, who understood all my nerdy-ass references.”

In “Elio,” out Friday, the film's titular character, voiced by Yonas Kibreab, finds a sense of belonging in the Communiverse — a kind of cosmic United Nations where alien civilizations convene to share knowledge and resolve conflicts. It's a far cry from life on Earth, where Elio feels out of place living with his stressed-out, overextended aunt Olga, voiced by Zoe Saldaña.

In real life, Shi says she found her own place in the universe at Anime North, an annual anime convention in suburban Toronto. She remembers attending for the first time as a teen.

“I had a really crappy ‘One Piece' cosplay on. I wore a straw hat and was dressed like a bad version of Luffy,” she says, referring to the protagonist of the Japanese manga series.

“But then I looked around and there were so many crappy cosplays around me, and people just wearing their nerddom on their sleeve…. I was like, ‘Oh my God, everyone speaks the same language as me.'”

It was there that Shi learned about the renowned animation program at Toronto's Sheridan College, which had propelled graduates into orbit at studios such as Pixar and Disney.

After graduating from Sheridan, Shi went on to work for Pixar as a storyboard artist for films including 2015's “Inside Out” and 2019's “Toy Story 4.”

Shi became the first woman to direct a Pixar short with 2018's “Bao,” a heartfelt tale about a Chinese-Canadian mother and her dumpling-turned-son that won the 2019 Oscar for best animated short. She broke new ground again with “Turning Red,” becoming the first woman to solo direct a Pixar feature.

“Elio” marks Shi's first time co-directing a feature. Shi says the film began as a project by ”Coco” director Adrian Molina, inspired by his isolated childhood growing up on a military base. After delays caused by the Hollywood strikes, Molina was tapped to co-direct “Coco 2” and handed the reins to Shi and fellow director Madeline Sharafian, who was a storyboard artist on “Turning Red,” to complete the story.

Shi describes the final product as “a beautiful mind-meld” of all three directors' styles. In addition to channeling her own teen experience, she infused the film with influences from her favourite sci-fi films growing up — including 1979's “Alien” and 1982's “The Thing” — as well as eerie stop-motion classics such as 1993's “The Nightmare Before Christmas.”

“I think kids can handle a little bit of scariness if it's more of a fun scary, like a thrill,” she says.

Shi notes there are some Canadian influences in “Elio” as well. 

“It's weird to say but I feel like diversity shows up very naturally in my work and I think that's because I grew up in a very diverse neighbourhood and city,” she says.

She says she doesn't even clock those multicultural touches until American colleagues point it out.

“People will be like, ‘Oh, are you doing that intentionally? Is it intentional that Mei's friends are all girls from different backgrounds?'” she says, referencing the quartet at the heart of “Turning Red.” 

“I mean, kind of, but that's also what my friends were like growing up. I grew up in East York, moved to Scarborough. That's just what kids looked like, and I'm just used to it.”

Elio's cultural background — half Mexican and half Dominican — is woven into the film with care and intention. His Mexican heritage draws from Molina's roots, while his Dominican side is brought to life through Saldaña's own background. Shi says the actor infused Olga with personal touches, including the suggestion of a Dominican song for one scene.

A nod to Shi's own heritage turns up in an unexpected way.

“I feel like the Communiverse could be an allegory for Canada,” she laughs.

“It's definitely a mishmash and a beautiful, chaotic mosaic of different cultures and species and aliens all working and living together.”

Leading the ensemble are Lovi Poe (“Seasons,” “Guilty Pleasure”), Enchong Dee (“Gomburza,” “Outside”) and Timothy Granaderos (“13 Reasons Why,” “The Remedy”).

	The film, scripted by Jerrold Tarog (“Heneral Luna,” “Bliss”), follows a group of vloggers who venture into a remote Philippine village in search of a mysterious substance harvested only once a decade. Their content-driven expedition transforms into a nightmare as they become entangled in sacred rites and face off against an ancient entity from Filipino folklore.


	Cruz previously helmed “Sleepless” and “The Other Wife.” 


	Montgomery Blencowe (“Heist,” “Marauders”) and Mark Stewart (“Escape Plan”) are producing under C'est Lovi Productions and Kind Hearts Entertainment, with CMB Film Services also on board. Jaime G. Baltazar serves as president and managing director of CMB Film Services.


	Known for directing international festival favorites like “Norte, the End of History” and “The Woman Who Left” — which won the Golden Lion at Venice in 2016 — Diaz was recently at the Cannes Film Festival with his latest feature “Magellan” starring Gael García Bernal. In “The Sacrifice,”  he plays Pilo, a quiet and enigmatic jungle guide who leads the vloggers deep into remote terrain steeped in ritual and folklore.

On May 15, at age 84, the paranormal expert Jaime T. Licauco passed on to the realm beyond. He has authored many essays and books on the strange, which I keep copies of in my personal library. I met him once, in 2018, during a book fair. Licauco was a fantastic storyteller, and even though I found some of his stories a little too fantastical, they nevertheless remind us that there is more to the world than what we see with our eyes.

I have always been fascinated with what we call “kababalaghan.” When I was a little boy, I spent my afternoons browsing through my lolo's bookshelves. His collection included many books on mysticism and psychic experiments. (Yes, he also had Licauco's books!) 

Growing up, I also watched how my grandaunt healed people through prayer, and how some of her patients entered hypnotic states and started speaking in tongues. They were “slain by the Holy Spirit,” or, in other words, sinapian. 

I personally know so many people who can “see” entities, who have been healed by albularyos, who have been “courted” (niligawan) by engkantos, and who have had prophetic dreams. This may be a cultural thing, too—maybe our Indigenous worldview is just so open and affirming to the supernatural.

Aside from Licauco, there has always been sincere paranormal investigation in popular media. You may also know about Ed Caluag, and, in the '90s, there was Tony Perez's Spirit Questors. I know some people today who continue to investigate cases. Five days after Licauco's passing, Perez followed. He has been a guiding light for many spiritual seekers. 

There are many local TV episodes dedicated to folk beliefs and supposed cases of kulam—you can just search for them online. If you can recall, a few years ago, there was a woman who got possessed live on air while talking to a priest. People laughed at her on social media, but the fact that it happened shows how common sapi actually is in the Philippines—to the point that the first center for exorcism in Asia will be built here!

Among the academics, the person who first comes to mind is the priest psychologist Jaime Bulatao, founder of Ateneo de Manila University's psychology department. He dealt with many cases of sapi and household disturbances supposedly caused by duwendes. His students may also remember his classes on astral projection. I met him a few weeks before his death in 2015. 

In the '60s and '70s, scientific researchers from around the world would visit the Philippines to study the practice of psychic surgery, where healers would remove tumors from a person's body using prayers and their bare hands. Some came to debunk them, while others came to be healed—even some Hollywood celebrities!

Now, how can we explain these things? We do not have to prove or disprove anything. We already know that weird things are happening. But, as Father Bulatao said, we can separate our “experience” of something with our “interpretation” of it. In other words, something happened, but how we understand it can differ depending on culture and upbringing. For example, are we being haunted by a “ghost,” or are we being “haunted” by memory and trauma? Our folklore provides the colorful metaphors for very real psychological experiences. It is the task of the psychologist—or paranormal investigator—to interpret it appropriately. 

I was once told a story about a young woman who would be “possessed” by an engkanto every time a young man showed interest in her. This young woman never had a boyfriend, and often kept to herself. The people around her believed that an engkanto had fallen in love with her and claimed her for himself. So, he would assert himself every time someone new came along. Now that is the cultural interpretation of the paranormal experience. 

Let us attempt an alternative psychological interpretation. Maybe she was just not ready for a relationship. Maybe, to avoid having to deal with the awkwardness of romance, her mind created a familiar character (the folkloric engkanto) in order to escape the situation. It is like a child's selective listening when an authority figure is lecturing them—“Pasok sa isang tenga, labas sa kabila.” In that way, she does not have to be stressed about it. The treatment for this case will depend on what this young woman needs—counseling for her romantic issues, or even an exorcism, can be helpful in different ways.

I hope that more people get interested in this field and join me in exploring it in a psychological and culturally appropriate way, especially since kababalaghan is so common in our everyday lives. If you are interested, I have written an academic article entitled “Philippine Parapsychology,” which was published in an international journal last year. If you are affiliated with a university as a student or teacher, you can ask your library for help to access it. 

For my fellow kababalaghan enthusiasts, whether you are following the footsteps of Jaime Licauco or Jaime Bulatao, our task is not to judge people and their experiences. Our role is to understand them. Why is it so common among Filipinos? What is it about our folk psychology that is so open to the strange, spiritual, and supernatural?
