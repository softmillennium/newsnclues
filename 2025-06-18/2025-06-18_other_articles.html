                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The film, which has been made in collaboration with Mr Slater's family, will include exclusive access to his post-mortem and funeral. Rita Daniels, Channel 4 commissioning editor, said: 'The story of Jay Slater captured the nation last summer with a fervour and intensity fuelled by armchair detectives and internet culture. 'The film holds a light up to our current society and is exactly the story that is a necessity for Channel 4 to tell.' It comes after celebrity investigator Mark Williams-Thomas last week revealed the first full witness account from the last person to see Mr Slater alive. According to the extraordinary new account, the 19-year-old armed himself with two knives and stole a bag of ketamine before fleeing an AirBnB on Tenerife. Mr Williams-Thomas found that those around Mr Slater on the night he disappeared spoke of him having taken a cocktail of drugs that left him 'on a mission'. Those witnesses include Ayub Qassim - the man who the apprentice bricklayer from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire accompanied back to an AirBnB after staying up all night on drugs following a music festival. Convicted drug dealer Qassim, 31, is understood to be was the last person to see the apprentice bricklayer before he vanished in mountains high above the village of Masca and had been due to give evidence at his inquest last month but the coroner said he could not be traced. In the podcast, Williams Thomas says: 'What Qassim said next was really significant and I believe provides real context to a very number of important aspects of this case.' Qassim tells him: 'They were just doing my head in, one said. 'That's the two bottles of Henny [Hennessy cognac], they were just doing my head in. 'In the end I just turned to Brandon and said:' Look Brandon, one of your mates, yesterday walked way because he's f**** off with the ket [ketamine] and he want missing. Tell this f****** idiot to get back in the car.' Williams-Thomas says: 'So, let's just re hear that again,' before playing the clip once more, and then adding:' I believe this is really significant new information. 'When Qassim said ket, he was referring to ketamine and my information is that this drug was readily available and that Jay had definitely been using it. 'I have further information about the supply of ketamine into the country, in the UK ketamine is a class B drug carrying a maximum of five years sentence for possession and 14 years for supply.' The release date for Channel 4's new show is yet to be announced.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers detected mysterious radio waves in Antarctica that seem to defy the rules of particle physics. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Instruments flying more than 18 miles (29 kilometers) above Antarctica detected two unexplainable radio pulses coming from below the ice — and these signals seem to defy particle physics. "It's an interesting problem because we still don't actually have an explanation for what those anomalies are," Stephanie Wissel, a particle physicist and co-author of the study, said in a statement. Related: Antimatter detected on International Space Station could reveal new physics The project was designed to capture data about neutrinos — subatomic particles that are especially difficult to study because they lack electric charge and have minimal mass. These elusive characteristics have earned them the nickname "ghost particles". Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. But the confusing radio signals are "most likely not representing neutrinos," Wissel said. Existing models, she explained, predict that pulses caused by neutrinos would originate from angles very far from 30 degrees under the surface. The new study provides further evidence that neutrinos are probably not involved. Using complex mathematical models and simulations, the research team also ruled out noise and known particle interactions as sources of the signals. They even examined data from other experiments to see if they observed any interaction that could cause the pulses, to no avail. "More research needs to be done on this," Benjamin Flaggs, a physics graduate student at the University of Delaware and co-author of the study, told Live Science. "There are theorists proposing some beyond-standard-model interactions from different types of particles," he said. If neutrinos aren't responsible for the radio signals, then what is? But more data is needed before coming to any meaningful conclusion. Wissel favors the theory that the origin of these pulses may be explained by some as-of-yet unknown behavior of radio waves, but there's no evidence to support this guess, either. "So, right now, it's one of these long-standing mysteries," she said. —Bizarre Particles Keep Flying Out of Antarctica's Ice, and They Might Shatter Modern Physics The Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations, a new balloon-based instrument, with advanced levels of sensitivity, is expected to help solve this puzzle by detecting more anomalies, thus providing more data to be scrutinized. "It's exciting for researchers because these are problems that no one else has figured out before." Her beats include space, tech and the physical sciences, but she also enjoys digging into other topics, like renewable energy and climate change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (TNND) — Trump administration border czar Tom Homan on Tuesday announced illegal alien encounters at the southern border had fallen to the “lowest number ever recorded.” Over the past 24 hours, he wrote, Border Patrol officials encountered just 95 illegal aliens. This, Homan said, marks a drastic contrast from the thousands per day which entered the country under former President Joe Biden. “That is the lowest number EVER recorded," Homan wrote. How many were released under Trump for May? Compare that to the 62,000 aliens Biden released in May of last year.” His comments follow widespread protests and riots to combat the immigration enforcement efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Gavin Newsom over his challenge to be arrested for supporting the display. “No one is above the law,” Homan said in an appearance on Fox News.

Name-dropped today: John Henry, Florian Wirtz, Mario Lemieux, Brian Rolapp, Caitlin Clark, Joey Chestnut, JJ Spaun, Louis Vuitton, Michael Rubin, Pope Leo XIV, Ares Management, Kylian Mbappe, Angel Reese, Simone Biles and more. It is convenient — and undoubtedly cathartic — for Red Sox fans to blame this week's seemingly lopsided Rafael Devers trade on owner Fenway Sports Group's wider holdings across the Sox, Liverpool and the Pittsburgh Penguins. 2 Liverpool, coming off a Premier League championship season, had the opportunity to sign arguably the best player in Europe, Florian Wirtz, which was going to require paying a premium. 3 As for the Pens, FSG identified that the market for selling stakes in teams playing in major U.S. sports leagues has never been hotter, so they are looking into cashing in during a frothy moment to sell a non-controlling stake. Just the reality of multi-team ownership groups navigating opportunities (and, yes, challenges) within — not across — each portfolio team. As the PGA juggles a new infusion of investment billions, new competitors and the need to find new audience and revenue growth, Rolapp is as well-positioned as anyone they could have hired to map it out.

Other current obsessions: Joey Chestnut returning to Nathan's July 4 hot dog contest … Real Madrid x Louis Vuitton … the MLB collectible concession-food trend … Apple's “haptic” trailer for “F1: The Movie” … Fanatics Fest returns to New York City this weekend. Michael Rubin's Fanatics — which has expanded from a place to buy fan gear to a collectibles juggernaut — has invested in making its annual convention the glitziest collectibles event of the year. This year will include appearances from a ton of star athletes, including Tom Brady, LeBron James and Peyton Manning. I asked our Memorabilia & Collectibles editor Brooks Peck what part of the weekend fans will be talking about most: “The “Museum of Greatness” is going to be pretty incredible. “It's supposedly the most valuable collection of sports memorabilia ever assembled. This all sounds like the setup for a heist movie.” Related: My colleague Elise Devlin on four lessons anyone can learn from Spaun's success.

My colleague Dhani Joseph looked into what happens to a brand when that kind of serendipitous marketing moment occurs. Didn't know this existed: NFL players competed in a blitz chess competition, and Justin Reid beat Kyler Murray for the title. (Next year, this needs a much bigger TV platform.) Investor of the Week: Ares Management SailGP investment isn't just for Marvel characters and soccer stars. Per my colleague Asli Pelit, the investment firm with the $3.7B sports-only fund jumped in to take a big stake in Kylian Mbappe's French team, expanding an Ares portfolio that already includes stakes in the Miami Dolphins, Inter Miami and Atletico Madrid. No athlete in sports right now is more innovative about turning criticism into opportunity than Reese. Peak of the Week: Commencement ‘25 Derek Jeter at Michigan.

My colleague Damon Sayles made the short trip from Dallas to Bells, Texas, to see first-hand the replica of Fenway Park built for wiffle ball. Then my colleague David Betancourt dug into why the team did it, a great case study in marketing. “From women-specific locker rooms to sensory spaces and breastfeeding facilities for the fans, the design adds a thoughtful layer of creativity, exploring how a stadium can function and feel when women are considered equally.” — Asli Pelit, on innovation in soccer stadium design with women in mind.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TORONTO — For Domee Shi, making a movie about an introverted kid getting abducted by aliens felt oddly familiar. Not because she's had any close encounters, but because she remembers being a teenager longing to be taken away to a world where her weirdness was understood. The Toronto native co-directs “Elio,” a Pixar animated sci-fi film about an 11-year-old orphan who yearns to be snatched by extraterrestrials to escape his loneliness — and gets his wish when an interplanetary organization mistakes him for Earth's ambassador. “He's this lonely artsy kid who just wants to belong somewhere. I definitely felt that way growing up,” says the Oscar-winning animator behind 2022's coming-of-age Toronto-set hit “Turning Red.” In “Elio,” out Friday, the film's titular character, voiced by Yonas Kibreab, finds a sense of belonging in the Communiverse — a kind of cosmic United Nations where alien civilizations convene to share knowledge and resolve conflicts. It's a far cry from life on Earth, where Elio feels out of place living with his stressed-out, overextended aunt Olga, voiced by Zoe Saldaña. She remembers attending for the first time as a teen. “I had a really crappy ‘One Piece' cosplay on. I wore a straw hat and was dressed like a bad version of Luffy,” she says, referring to the protagonist of the Japanese manga series. “But then I looked around and there were so many crappy cosplays around me, and people just wearing their nerddom on their sleeve…. I was like, ‘Oh my God, everyone speaks the same language as me. It was there that Shi learned about the renowned animation program at Toronto's Sheridan College, which had propelled graduates into orbit at studios such as Pixar and Disney. After graduating from Sheridan, Shi went on to work for Pixar as a storyboard artist for films including 2015's “Inside Out” and 2019's “Toy Story 4.” She broke new ground again with “Turning Red,” becoming the first woman to solo direct a Pixar feature. Shi says the film began as a project by ”Coco” director Adrian Molina, inspired by his isolated childhood growing up on a military base. After delays caused by the Hollywood strikes, Molina was tapped to co-direct “Coco 2” and handed the reins to Shi and fellow director Madeline Sharafian, who was a storyboard artist on “Turning Red,” to complete the story. Shi describes the final product as “a beautiful mind-meld” of all three directors' styles. In addition to channeling her own teen experience, she infused the film with influences from her favourite sci-fi films growing up — including 1979's “Alien” and 1982's “The Thing” — as well as eerie stop-motion classics such as 1993's “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” Shi notes there are some Canadian influences in “Elio” as well. “People will be like, ‘Oh, are you doing that intentionally? Is it intentional that Mei's friends are all girls from different backgrounds? “I mean, kind of, but that's also what my friends were like growing up. I grew up in East York, moved to Scarborough. A nod to Shi's own heritage turns up in an unexpected way. “I feel like the Communiverse could be an allegory for Canada,” she laughs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Cruz's supernatural horror feature “The Sacrifice” has wrapped principal photography in the Philippines and revealed its complete cast lineup. Leading the ensemble are Lovi Poe (“Seasons,” “Guilty Pleasure”), Enchong Dee (“Gomburza,” “Outside”) and Timothy Granaderos (“13 Reasons Why,” “The Remedy”). The newly revealed supporting cast includes Max Collins (“Firefly,” “Only We Know”), Louie Chapman (“Chasers,” “The Dresden Sun”), Pokwang (“Becky & Badette,” “Mommy Issues”), and Tommy Alejandrino (“Gomburza,” “Mallari”). The film, scripted by Jerrold Tarog (“Heneral Luna,” “Bliss”), follows a group of vloggers who venture into a remote Philippine village in search of a mysterious substance harvested only once a decade. Their content-driven expedition transforms into a nightmare as they become entangled in sacred rites and face off against an ancient entity from Filipino folklore. Cruz previously helmed “Sleepless” and “The Other Wife.” Montgomery Blencowe (“Heist,” “Marauders”) and Mark Stewart (“Escape Plan”) are producing under C'est Lovi Productions and Kind Hearts Entertainment, with CMB Film Services also on board. Jaime G. Baltazar serves as president and managing director of CMB Film Services. Known for directing international festival favorites like “Norte, the End of History” and “The Woman Who Left” — which won the Golden Lion at Venice in 2016 — Diaz was recently at the Cannes Film Festival with his latest feature “Magellan” starring Gael García Bernal. In “The Sacrifice,”  he plays Pilo, a quiet and enigmatic jungle guide who leads the vloggers deep into remote terrain steeped in ritual and folklore.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He has authored many essays and books on the strange, which I keep copies of in my personal library. I met him once, in 2018, during a book fair. Licauco was a fantastic storyteller, and even though I found some of his stories a little too fantastical, they nevertheless remind us that there is more to the world than what we see with our eyes. His collection included many books on mysticism and psychic experiments. Growing up, I also watched how my grandaunt healed people through prayer, and how some of her patients entered hypnotic states and started speaking in tongues. They were “slain by the Holy Spirit,” or, in other words, sinapian. This may be a cultural thing, too—maybe our Indigenous worldview is just so open and affirming to the supernatural. Aside from Licauco, there has always been sincere paranormal investigation in popular media. You may also know about Ed Caluag, and, in the '90s, there was Tony Perez's Spirit Questors. I know some people today who continue to investigate cases. Five days after Licauco's passing, Perez followed. He has been a guiding light for many spiritual seekers. There are many local TV episodes dedicated to folk beliefs and supposed cases of kulam—you can just search for them online. He dealt with many cases of sapi and household disturbances supposedly caused by duwendes. I met him a few weeks before his death in 2015. We do not have to prove or disprove anything. We already know that weird things are happening. But, as Father Bulatao said, we can separate our “experience” of something with our “interpretation” of it. In other words, something happened, but how we understand it can differ depending on culture and upbringing. For example, are we being haunted by a “ghost,” or are we being “haunted” by memory and trauma? Our folklore provides the colorful metaphors for very real psychological experiences. This young woman never had a boyfriend, and often kept to herself. So, he would assert himself every time someone new came along. Maybe she was just not ready for a relationship. It is like a child's selective listening when an authority figure is lecturing them—“Pasok sa isang tenga, labas sa kabila.” In that way, she does not have to be stressed about it. The treatment for this case will depend on what this young woman needs—counseling for her romantic issues, or even an exorcism, can be helpful in different ways. If you are interested, I have written an academic article entitled “Philippine Parapsychology,” which was published in an international journal last year. If you are affiliated with a university as a student or teacher, you can ask your library for help to access it. For my fellow kababalaghan enthusiasts, whether you are following the footsteps of Jaime Licauco or Jaime Bulatao, our task is not to judge people and their experiences.
