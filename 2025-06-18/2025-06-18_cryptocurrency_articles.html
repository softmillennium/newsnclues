                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The number of Bitcoin held for over 10 years is increasing faster than new coins are mined—550 BTC/day versus 450 issued BTC/day. 17% of BTC is already considered illiquid, and projections suggest up to 30% by 2026. The report noted that the “ancient” Bitcoin supply, coins held for 10 years or more, has started to outpace new issuance, with 550 BTC entering the ancient supply category daily compared to 450 BTC issued. This trend, coupled with steady purchasing from institutional investors, raises a compelling question: Could this increasing demand send Bitcoin's price to $1 million? This reflects strong holder conviction, with daily decreases occurring less than 3% of the time. At the same time, institutional investor capital is accelerating. According to Bitwise, Bitcoin inflows are expected to reach $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026 in its base case scenario. In a bull case, inflows could exceed $426 billion, absorbing over 4 million Bitcoin (19% of supply), further tightening liquidity. This institutional accumulation, alongside ancient supply growth, suggests a scenario where a significant portion of Bitcoin's supply becomes illiquid, potentially amplifying analysts' price targets due to increasing demand. Related: Price predictions 6/18: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, HYPE, SUI, BCH Reaching $1 million per Bitcoin requires a market capitalization of $21 trillion, a tenfold increase from the current $2.10 trillion with 19,880,604 BTC mined, or 94.66% of the 21 million total. The fixed supply and growing illiquidity could facilitate BTC's next significant milestone. Historical trends after the halving events (2013, 2017, 2021) exhibit rallies driven by reduced supply growth and rising demand, supporting the thesis that current dynamics could lead to a similar outcome. If institutional investors continue accumulating, 30% of the supply could become illiquid by 2026 (6.3 million BTC). After the 2024 US election, ancient supply has declined on 10% of days—nearly four times the historical average—indicating even long-term holders can sell during volatility. Similarly, five-year holder supply decreased 39% of days post-election, three times the typical rate, correlating with sideways price action in Q1 2025. This suggests that while illiquidity trends are strong, market conditions can trigger supply increases, potentially moderating price appreciation. Its bear case projects over $150 billion in inflows, while the bull case exceeds $426 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC, underscoring significant demand potential. Thus, Bitcoin's ancient supply and projected institutional inflows form a narrative of increasing scarcity. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PM Petr Fiala defeats an opposition motion to topple his administration months before scheduled elections. The Czech government on Wednesday survived a no-confidence vote triggered by a bitcoin scandal involving a drug dealer that has thrown the country's politics into turmoil. Some 98 out of 192 MPs present voted against an opposition motion to topple Prime Minister Petr Fiala's government — which could have triggered a snap ballot just four months before the country is scheduled to vote in regular elections. By contrast, 94 MPs voted to bring down the government. The no-confidence motion followed a scandal that saw Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blažek from Fiala's conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS) resign last month after accepting a €40 million bitcoin donation to the ministry from a convicted drug dealer.The cryptocurrency was provided by Tomáš Jiřikovský, who according to the courts ran an illegal darknet market that had drugs for sale, and who had served time in prison for embezzlement, drug trafficking and illegal possession of weapons. Czech newspaper Deník N broke the news last week that police are investigating the donation.Blažek, whose embroilment in multiple scandals from pressuring judges to meeting a pro-Russian lobbyist earned him the moniker Don Pablo — a play on deceased Colombian drugs baron Pablo Escobar — claims everything he did was “ultra-legal” and that Jiřikovský had donated money as “a form of penance.”The bitcoin affair is likely to further boost the election prospects of the current populist frontrunner Andrej Babiš, leader of the opposition ANO party, who previously governed Czechia from 2017 to 2021. The government has a fragile majority of 104 MPs. Fiala's government has survived four votes of no confidence since it took power in 2021. Insect producers say EU rules are choking their industry and driving it into financial ruin — with the environment paying the price.

Circle CEO, Chairman and co-founder Jeremy Allaire details IPO excitement, high-utility stablecoin, the GENIUS Act's 'excellent' points and the state of America's macroeconomy in a wide-ranging interview. "There's an opportunity to build very significant scaled platforms and utilities in the same way that we've seen those built in other industries on the internet." Circle is a New York-based company specializing in stablecoins. Going public in early June, Circle's share prices saw an eye-popping surge on opening day, signaling a strong appetite for digital currency backed by real world assets. Stablecoin values are pegged to currencies like the U.S. dollar, unlike its more price-volatile competitor Bitcoin. This makes them more predictable for everyday use, and more attractive for many consumers and lawmakers. In Allaire's terms, stablecoin is "over-the-top internet money." Jeremy Allaire, chief executive officer of Circle Internet Financial Ltd., center, during the company's initial public offering (IPO) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Thursday, June 5, 2025. It received bipartisan support and backing from President Donald Trump, who has embraced cryptocurrencies during his second term. "It's wonderful to see our political leaders, our economic leaders kind of embracing this and working towards it. Supporters say stablecoins could help cement the U.S. dollar's dominance on the global stage by turning it into a frictionless, exportable digital currency. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire joins ‘Mornings with Maria' to discuss the company's historic debut on the New York Stock Exchange. "This is great for the dollar," said Allaire. And so, if we're in a digital currency space race with China, or with other countries, or BRICS, or what have you, this is a huge way to win." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed that optimism in a post on X, writing in part: "Recent reporting projects that stablecoins could grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of the decade." At its core, Allaire argues, stablecoins offer a safer, smarter approach to digital finance. "It is a very powerful force," he said. "You're not holding a bank's credit risk. And so, it's a powerful model that I think just intuitively people understand. It's a safer, higher-utility form of money."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vietnam has always been a leader in using crypto. But even though many people use it, the country's crypto market has been in a confusing state because the rules weren't clear. This is a big step forward to make crypto legal and set clear rules. Vietnam has just made a big decision with its new Law on Digital Technology Industry. It does not cover things like stocks, digital versions of traditional money, or other typical financial tools. This new clarity is great news for crypto businesses and investors who were unsure about the rules before. Importantly, it comes with strict cybersecurity and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements bringing Vietnam in line with global standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Vietnam has been on FATF's “gray list” since 2023, and this law is a big step toward fixing that by tightening up rules to stop money laundering and terrorist financing. But this new law isn't only about crypto. It also offers big benefits to the entire digital tech industry. These benefits include tax breaks, incentives for land use, support for research and development, and even training programs to develop local skills. The aim is to make Vietnam a leader in new technologies like AI, semiconductors, and blockchain. This law isn't just a set of rules, it's Vietnam's way of declaring itself a leader in the global digital economy. Regulatory Oversight Government to define business conditions, classifications, and mechanisms Incentives Tax breaks, land-use benefits, R&D support, workforce subsidies This table illustrates how Vietnam's crypto policy balances regulation with innovation, creating a structured yet attractive environment for digital assets. These actions are expected to attract serious developers and investors to Vietnam's crypto scene, even though the law will take effect in 2026. This move places Vietnam as a leader in clear regulations within the region, setting an example that other Southeast Asian countries might follow. The law clearly separates virtual assets from crypto assets, follows international guidelines to get off the financial grey list, and sets up direct government oversight on creating, storing, and transferring cryptocurrencies, all while enforcing rules against money laundering. With this proactive approach and Vietnam is set to become more prominent in the digital finance world. While some experts are positive about Vietnam's progress in crypto, others advise caution, especially considering past events like the $400 million Matrix Chain scam. By making cryptocurrencies legal, setting clear rules, and offering benefits to promote innovation, Vietnam is preparing for a surge in digital assets. Some say that “more countries will follow, and the shift is already happening,” suggesting this could inspire global changes. Everyone will be watching as Vietnam's crypto journey develops, with the potential to change digital finance in Southeast Asia and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The most number of transactions are always done on the platform, particularly during times of significant market rallies. This analysis reveals that, on average, there is a sharp increase in transactions involving the inflow of altcoins to exchanges following significant market rallies. These spikes typically indicate that traders are attempting to realize profits. This action typically correlates with short-term price spikes and a high volume of transactions. This exchange reached the highest daily inflows of 59,000 altcoin transactions. Binance retains the top spot, with a maximum of 42,000 altcoin addresses sending altcoins to its exchange. Based on this trend, Binance is the go-to altcoin exchange during times when there is high activity in the market. Binance continues to lead inflow transactions even in these under the radar times. The data indicate that platform processes approximately 13,000 altcoin inflow transactions. Coinbase does between 6,000 and other platforms do about 10,000. The market leadership of exchange can also be seen in stablecoin inflows. Binance has obtained nearly 53,000 stablecoin transactions on the Ethereum network. All the other exchanges have a share of 53,000 additional transactions. These figures indicate the place where the traders are depositing their money in anticipation to make a move in future. This pattern suggests a significant role for Binance in the trading domain, particularly with stablecoins such as TRON-based USDT. Similarly, the overall dominance of exchange in maintaining continuous leadership in altcoin and stablecoin inflows reflects the high level of users and its developed infrastructure. The exchange is still the main entrance to Capital, becoming part of the crypto market as traders keep on coming to it as a source of liquidity and to trade.

A speech published by the central bank did not cover these operational details, but instead urged changes in global currencies and cross border payments. He said that international dominant currencies are like public goods. He warned that accumulated domestic fiscal and structural issues in that country could spill over into an international financial crisis. Hence, he called for greater diversification in currency usage worldwide. It's also not new for a governor to suggest a greater take up of the IMF's special drawing rights (SDR) in international trade. Beyond currency, he also addressed payment systems. The topic of blockchain and DLT in cross border payments was discussed in the context of both central bank digital currencies and stablecoins. He only alluded to mBridge, the international cross border CBDC originally developed by five Asian and Middle Eastern central banks with help from the BIS. For now, with Hong Kong passing stablecoin legislation, it seems that island is being used as a learning and observation ground for mainland China. “Technologies such as smart contracts and decentralized finance will also continue to promote the evolution and development of the cross border payment system,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The largest tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), can now be used as collateral on two of the most active crypto trading platforms, Crypto.com and Deribit, issuer Securitize said in a Wednesday press release. The listings allow institutional traders to post BUIDL tokens as margin for leveraged trades on those two exchanges, while also earning yield on the underlying token. The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets, growing about 400% in the past year to over $7 billion in market capitalization, rwa.xyz data show. These tokens let investors earn a yield on their idle cash, just like a money market fund, but without leaving the blockchain environment. They are also increasingly being used as collateral for trading. With $2.9 billion in assets, BUIDL is the largest of the tokenized Treasury funds and is backed by a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries. "Tokenized Treasuries are being actively used to improve capital efficiency and risk management across some of the industry's most sophisticated trading venues, while still offering yield," Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said in the statement. "The [BUIDL] fund is evolving from a yield-bearing token into a core component of crypto market infrastructure."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The McKinney, Texas-based companies, founded by co-CEOs Paul and Katy Drake Bettner whose past work includes Words With Friends, Lucky's Tale, and Age of Empires, have secured $6.5 million to date and expect to close the remaining funding over the next 60 days. Wildcard is a third-person, 2v2 Collectible Card Action Game (CCAG) that seamlessly blends fast-paced arena combat with strategic deck-building. Master dynamic abilities, outplay opponents with skillful action mechanics, and harness the power of your summons in a thrilling fusion of collectible card strategy and third-person action combat—all set in a live, interactive arena. This new funding builds on the companies' $46 million Series A raised in 2022, and will be usedto accelerate development of their integrated ecosystem of products, utilizing the Thousandsprotocol and Thousands.tv platform to unlock new channels of creator-centric user acquisitionand help launch their own upcoming game, Wildcard. “It's simple,” said Paul Bettner, co-CEO, in a statement. “Wildcard only succeeds if its creators and community succeed. Thousands gives us the on-chain ‘rails' to solve this problem, to record and reward user acquisition and conversion at every step of the funnel.” The synergy between Wildcard and Thousands has already demonstrated explosive growth. The Thousands network recorded over $800,000 in revenue in May 2025 alone, with an average revenue-per-stream of $50,000, average viewer-to-payer conversion of 77%, and a new all-time-high revenue record at $134,000 — metrics that far exceed industry standards. The Thousands network enables creators and communities to earn instantly when their content drives conversions, while IP owners benefit from significantly lower customer acquisition costs compared to traditional channels. “Thousands is redefining how games and content reach audiences,” said Rick Johanson, founding partner at Arbitrum Gaming Ventures, in a statement. “Their web-native streaming layer – think Twitch meets WalletConnect – allows every connected viewer to become an active participant in an on-chain economy, transforming spectators into engaged users.” “Paul, Kate, and team have created one of the most eagerly anticipated games in crypto and we're very excited for what comes next.” Since their initial funding, both platforms have achieved significant milestones. Wildcard was recently approved for release on Steam, where the 100k+ community are now playtesting Alpha builds of the game weekly, in preparation for Wildcard's Early Access release later this year. These playtests are broadcast on Thousands.tv several times a week, helping to demonstrate the Thousands' network's ability to sustain engagement and monetization, with an average revenue per viewer of $141 dollars. “Fans and creators are interacting; you're not just watching the game. With Thousands, being there matters, and that changes everything.” The companies have 30 full-time employees and another 30 or so contractors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Between April and September 2023, a hacker carried out a credential stuffing attack on 23andMe's platform, exploiting reused login credentials that were stolen from previous unrelated data breaches. This resulted in the unauthorised access to personal information belonging to 155,592 UK residents, potentially revealing names, birth years, self-reported city or postcode-level location, profile images, race, ethnicity, family trees and health reports. The ICO investigation found that 23andMe did not have additional verification steps for users to access and download their raw genetic data. John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said: “This was a profoundly damaging breach that exposed sensitive personal information, family histories, and even health conditions of thousands of people in the UK. “As one of those impacted told us: once this information is out there, it cannot be changed or reissued like a password or credit card number. This left people's most sensitive data vulnerable to exploitation and harm. “We carried out this investigation in collaboration with our Canadian counterparts, and it highlights the power of international cooperation in holding global companies to account. Data protection doesn't stop at borders, and neither do we when it comes to protecting the rights of UK residents.” The ICO found that 23andMe breached UK data protection law by failing to put in place appropriate authentication and verification measures as part of its customer login process, including, but not limited to, mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure password requirements, or unpredictable usernames. The company also failed to put in place appropriate security measures that focused on the access to and download of raw genetic data. Despite all this activity, the company did not start a full investigation until October 2023, when a 23andMe employee discovered that the stolen data had been advertised for sale on Reddit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump has deepened his ties with Chinese billionaire Justin Sun—who's fighting civil charges in the United States of fraud and market manipulation—as the president's stablecoin begins minting on Sun's blockchain, which hosted the largest share of illicit crypto activity last year, according to a crypto intelligence firm. In 2024, Tron hosted 58% of all illicit crypto activity—the most of any blockchain and more than Ethereum and Bitcoin combined—“reflecting continued preference for blockchains that have low transaction fees, smart contracts, and popular stablecoins,” according to blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs. White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told Forbes in a statement Trump has no conflicts of interest because his “assets are in a trust managed by his children”; a spokesperson for World Liberty Financial declined to comment; and spokespeople for Tron and the Trump Organization did not respond to inquiries. Trump can earn income from his businesses while in office through the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, the same structure he used during his first term. He is its sole donor and beneficiary, while Donald Trump Jr. serves as the trustee. “We've seen increased criminal use of stablecoins on the Tron blockchain, and I think the launch highlights how little is known about USD1 and World Liberty Financial's ability to thwart criminal activity,” White told Forbes. “There is very little transparency into how the project intends to grapple with this persistent problem, and whether they have the capacity to do so responsibly.” In addition to Tron, two other crypto firms that announced relationships with World Liberty Financial in the past month also have faced scrutiny from U.S. authorities. In May, USD1 started trading on KuCoin, an exchange recently banned from the United States after admitting to anti-money laundering violations and agreeing to pay $300 million in penalties. It also launched on Binance, which admitted in a November 2023 plea deal with the Justice Department to anti-money laundering and sanctions violations, agreeing to pay $4 billion in penalties. Sun shared a post claiming Eric Trump was expected to join the company, though Trump denied it, calling Sun a “great friend” but saying the report was “inaccurate.” The brothers each hold more than 5% of the firm, largely in exchange for serving 10 weeks on an previously somewhat dormant advisory board that also includes three other Trump Organization executive vice presidents. Dominari Holdings CEO Anthony Hayes praised the advisory board's work in a letter to shareholders. Forbes estimates Trump's net worth at about $5.2 billion, with crypto now accounting for most of his wealth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoins were used to streamline Feniix Energy's $75 million buyout, bypassing traditional banks. Feniix Energy, an energy firm based in Latin America, has completed a $75 million acquisition of a live oil and gas operation using blockchain tokenization, according to a statement shared with CryptoSlate on June 17. Global Settlement, a blockchain firm specializing in real-world assets (RWAs), executed the deal through its GSX Protocol. The protocol enabled instant settlements, reduced counterparty risk, and lowered transaction fees. It also introduced full transparency throughout the funding and ownership process. This marked a pivotal move in financing capital-intensive projects using decentralized finance tools. The acquisition was structured entirely through tokenized debt and equity. An unnamed leading commodity trading company provided the debt portion, making this the first known instance of a fully tokenized capital structure used to purchase an active energy asset. “Our collaboration with Global Settlement demonstrates how innovation can bridge traditional finance and the crypto economy, unlocking substantial value for our stakeholders.” He emphasized that on-chain infrastructure helped streamline capital flows and reduce operational costs. Industry observers see this acquisition as a breakthrough moment for blockchain adoption in traditional sectors. The use of tokenized capital in live infrastructure deals signals growing confidence in blockchain as a financing tool for institutional-grade projects. A June 16 report by CoinGecko noted that the tokenized treasuries market surged 544.8% in 2024, reaching an all-time high of $5.6 billion by April 2025.
