                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since their anesthetic effects were discovered approximately 180 years ago, inhalational anesthetics have been used for general anesthesia in surgical operations. However, the mechanism of their anesthetic has not been fully revealed yet. Previous studies have shown that inhalational anesthetics exert their anesthetic effects by acting on multiple proteins, but the presence of unknown target molecules has also been suggested. In rare cases, patients with abnormal type 1 ryanodine receptors (RyR1) (RyR1 mutations) have been known to be at higher risk of malignant hyperthermia, which can be caused by inhalational anesthetics. However, the direct molecular interaction between inhalational anesthetics and RyR1 has not been clearly demonstrated, and the relationship between RyR1 and anesthetic effects has also been unknown. In the present study, a research group led by Professor Hiroki Ueda of the Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, found that RyR1 which is a calcium release channel, induces general anesthesia by serving as a target molecule of inhalational anesthetics. The research group first confirmed that isoflurane and other inhalational anesthetics activate RyR1 and stimulate calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, the research group created a genetically modified mouse (knock-in mouse) which expressed the RyR1 mutant that does not respond to isoflurane. Furthermore, new compounds that target the putative binding site of isoflurane were identified from in silico compound screening and were found to have sedative-like effects in mice. These results suggest that RyR1 is a functional target of isoflurane that is directly related to its anesthetic properties. This is a new finding as previous studies have not demonstrated the relationship between RyR1 and anesthetic effects in mammals. This result was achieved in the Ueda Biological Timing Project, a research area of the Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO) by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). Under this project, JST pursues "systems biology for understanding humans" using the sleep-wake rhythm as a model system and aims to understand information on "biological time," which transcends from molecules to individual humans living in society. Isoflurane activates the type 1 ryanodine receptor to induce anesthesia in mice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Persistent sadness, fatigue, changes in sleep and appetite, or loss of interest are common symptoms in mothers suffering from perinatal depression. A pioneering study followed the paths of mothers with this condition. It concluded that high sensitivity to internal and external stimuli can increase the risk of depression, while partner support during pregnancy has a protective effect. This period is marked by significant physiological and psychological changes, making it a difficult time for many women. Between 10% and 25% of women are vulnerable to perinatal depression, which can emerge during pregnancy and persist up to one year after childbirth. Persistent sadness, fatigue, changes in sleep and appetite, or loss of interest are common symptoms, with a significant impact on the emotional health of the mother and infant. Although the symptoms of perinatal depression are well identified, there is less knowledge about how these symptoms evolve. To deepen this field, a study led by Maria Spinelli, with the support of the BIAL Foundation, was the first to track the perinatal depression trajectories at four different time points - in late pregnancy, and at 3, 6, and 9 months postpartum. As part of this work, researchers from the G. d'Annunzio Chieti-Pescara University and the University of Pavia (Italy) carried out a longitudinal study with 88 mothers without a clinical diagnosis, exploring the roles of individual factors, such as SPS - Sensory Processing Sensitivity (which consists of greater awareness and reactivity to internal and external stimuli), and contextual factors, such as the global partner support. The results showed that mood declines immediately after giving birth, but tends to improve over time, with mothers with high sensitivity and less partner support being more vulnerable to negative feelings. High sensitivity can therefore increase the risk of depression, while partner support during pregnancy has a protective effect. The research also revealed that prenatal depression could influence the infant's emotional reactivity, particularly increasing their proneness to negative affect, acting as a prenatal stressor. This study can help create support programmes for mothers, promoting better emotional adjustment for them and their infants". Given its significant impact, "partner participation should be an essential component of parenting programmes designed to nurture positive relationships from the very beginning of pregnancy, laying the foundations for supportive family dynamics and a healthier transition to parenthood", the researcher stresses. "The positive role of tactile experience can serve as a basis for intervention programmes aimed at promoting safe and supportive relationships in early life", Spinelli points out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) Volume 17, Issue 5, on May 1, 2025, titled "Oxytocin modulates insulin and GLP-1 secretion in pancreatic islets." In this study, scientists from Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine investigated how the hormone oxytocin (Oxt) influences insulin levels by acting on specific cells in the pancreas. The team led by first author Kasumi Hattori and corresponding authors Kenju Shimomura and Yuko Maejima discovered that oxytocin may indirectly increase insulin secretion by triggering another hormone, GLP-1, from within the pancreas. This finding could lead to new strategies for improving blood sugar control in people with diabetes. Oxytocin is commonly known for its roles in childbirth and social bonding, but scientists have also been exploring its effects on metabolism. While previous studies offered mixed results about whether oxytocin raises or lowers blood sugar, this research brings new clarity. Researchers tested this by using mice with and without oxytocin receptors and found that oxytocin's ability to raise insulin levels depended on the presence of these receptors and high blood sugar conditions. In the pancreas, insulin is produced by beta cells, while alpha cells produce glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar. But recent research, including this study, has shown that alpha cells can also release GLP-1, which in turn helps beta cells secrete insulin. Oxytocin appears to increase this internal GLP-1 release, especially when blood sugar levels are high, thereby leading to insulin release in a natural and targeted way. In this study researchers were also able to detect the difference between oxytocin's effect on blood sugar and its effect on insulin. They observed that right after oxytocin was given, blood sugar levels rose in all mice-even in those that lacked oxytocin receptors. However, only the mice with working oxytocin receptors showed a later increase in insulin. This suggests that oxytocin may trigger insulin production through a separate, receptor-dependent pathway involving the hormone GLP-1. This indirect action-oxytocin triggering alpha cells to release GLP-1, which then acts on beta cells-may represent a novel mechanism for controlling insulin release. It also explains why oxytocin does not increase insulin in low-glucose conditions, making it a potentially safer option for regulating blood sugar. As treatments for type 2 diabetes increasingly focus on GLP-1–based drugs, this study opens the door to using oxytocin or similar compounds to naturally enhance the body's own insulin-producing system. With further research, this mechanism could help develop new therapies that better mimic the body's natural glucose control, particularly beneficial for older adults with diabetes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Calibr-Skaggs Institute for Innovative Medicines, the drug development division of Scripps Research, today announced a milestone in cancer treatment with the dosing of the first patient in a phase 1 trial (NCT06878248) evaluating CLBR001 + ABBV-461, a modular, switchable chimeric antigen receptor T cell (sCAR-T) therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have no suitable treatment options. CAR-T therapy has been transformative for patients with hematological malignancies who failed numerous prior treatments. However, conventional CAR-T therapies have not yet been as successful at treating patients with solid tumors. This challenge is what Calibr-Skaggs' switchable CAR-T cell therapy platform was designed to address. The sCAR-T platform developed by Calibr-Skaggs is designed to enhance the precision and safety of CAR-T therapies, and has demonstrated promising preliminary results in a phase 1 clinical trial for hematological malignancies. Additionally, initial results have demonstrated CLBR001 sCAR-T cells can expand in the body in significantly greater numbers than conventional CAR-T cells, affording a better chance of penetrating the hostile solid tumor microenvironment. There's a critical need to develop gene and cell therapy approaches that are able to recreate the success observed in blood cancers for patients with solid tumors like breast cancer. By integrating an antibody-based 'switch,' there's the potential to enhance the precision of targeting solid tumor cells, while also mitigating potential safety risks."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new lipid-based pathway essential for memory formation has been discovered by University of Queensland researchers – a breakthrough that could lead to treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Led by Professor Frédéric Meunier from UQ's Queensland Brain Institute, the team found a saturated fat called myristic acid is released by an enzyme, DDHD2, which is then used to chemically "tag" proteins where neurons connect and communicate with each other. From our previous research we know myristic acid is essential to making memories stick. In new this study, we found myristic acid hooks onto proteins and alters their membrane association, thereby driving memory formation. Crucially, without this fat-tagging step, these proteins in dendritic spines can't do their job, and the neuron can't strengthen its connections." Professor Frédéric Meunier from UQ's Queensland Brain Institute Blocking this fat-signalling pathway in mice prevented the brain from undergoing these critical protein changes that occur during memory formation, providing strong evidence this process is essential to learning. "This could mean we've found a way to temporarily interfere with how the brain stores memories," Professor Meunier said. The National Study of Mental Health and Wellbeing 2020–2022 shows an estimated 11 per cent of Australians experience PTSD in their lifetime. Co-author Dr. Nathalie Dehorter said the discovery has significant implications for understanding brain plasticity and offers a potential therapeutic target for preventing the consolidation of traumatic memories. "However, those clinical applications are still a long way off, and any approach to controlling memory would require careful ethical consideration,'' Dr Dehorter said. The brain is the body's fattiest organ, with fatty compounds making up 60 per cent of its weight and this study further underscores the vital role that fats play in brain function. Lysine myristoylation mediates long-term potentiation via membrane enrichment of synaptic plasticity effectors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, past studies show that certain lifestyle changes may help decrease a person's risk for the disease or slow down its progression. Scientists believe these findings may one day lead to new prevention and treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease. For this study, researchers used a technique called single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Scientists focused on the hippocampus of the brain, which is responsible for making new memories and keeping old ones, as well as processing emotions and learning new information. Using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease — that were later verified in human Alzheimer's disease brain tissue samples — researchers found that exercise changed activity in the hippocampus' immune cells called microglia, as well as a specific type of neurovascular-associated astrocyte (NVA). “[Our findings mean] that exercise can remodel these important cell types on the transcriptional/gene expression level, which likely increases their neuroprotective properties. “It [is] one example, how on the molecular level exercise can improve brain cells in Alzheimer's disease, hopefully rendering them more functionally.” — Christiane D. Wrann, DVM, PhD Additionally, Wrann and her team pinpointed a metabolic gene called ATPIF1 as an important regulator to create new neurons in the brain. “Research has shown that stimulating neurogenesis can protect against cognitive decline in aging or Alzheimer's disease. In our study, we show that ATPIF1 is an important regulator of neurogenesis.” There are smart and dedicated scientists working on finding innovative treatment options.” “This work not only sheds light on how exercise benefits the brain but also uncovers potential cell-specific targets for future Alzheimer's therapies,” Nathan Tucker, PhD, a biostatistician at SUNY Upstate Medical University and co-senior of the study said in a press release. “Our study offers a valuable resource for the scientific community investigating Alzheimer's prevention and treatment.” MNT also had the opportunity to speak with Gary Small, MD, chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this study. “While the basic conclusion that exercise is important to brain health is not new, these new findings showing the impact of physical activity on key brain cells such as microglia and neurovascular-associated astrocytes provide a more nuanced and deeper understanding why the brain responds to exercise,” he explained. Thus, these results further elucidate the link between heightened brain inflammation and cognitive decline,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Electronic cigarettes, or vapes, are widely used and available in hundreds of different types and flavors, yet researchers lack information about the everyday e-cigarette habits of young adults. The National Institutes of Health, in partnership with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has funded a University of Oklahoma study that will investigate how, when and why young adults use e-cigarettes and how that use may relate to health risks. Emily Hébert, a member of the TSET Health Promotion Research Center at OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center and an assistant professor of family and preventive medicine in the OU College of Medicine, earned the $3.1 million, five-year NIH grant to conduct the study, which will begin enrolling young adults this fall. Rather than relying on a person to remember their vaping habits over the past month, Hébert and her team will check in with study participants daily via a smartphone platform. Surveys typically ask about average behavior, and they are subject to recall bias. What we want to know is, are there certain characteristics – like candy flavors or nicotine concentrations – that may carry higher public health risks or appeal disproportionately to youth, which is important for the FDA to know." Study participants will be prompted for input multiple times daily for a month, then again in six months, in five different waves, helping researchers gather both short-term and long-term data. Hébert said researchers will ask about the types of products being used, what participants' moods are like, whether they're alone or with friends, whether they're also using other products like cannabis or traditional cigarettes, and if they have symptoms like respiratory problems. In pilot studies, Hébert said she found that many young adults use multiple vaping products over the course of a month, not necessarily showing loyalty to a particular brand – and there are hundreds of different products to choose from, which can be purchased in person and online. Understanding young adults' frequency of e-cigarette use is also important, Hébert said. Existing research shows that many young adults use e-cigarettes all day long. "If people are using e-cigarettes to quit traditional cigarettes or are vaping just once or twice a day, we want to know that, but that's not necessarily what we're seeing," Hébert said. "We're seeing many young adults who have never smoked initiating e-cigarette use and, in some cases, reporting frequent use that may indicate early signs of dependence. Like other common substances, such as caffeine, frequency and intensity of use matter. Heavy use may indicate risk that warrants further investigation." These authorizations are based on evidence that the products are suitable for protecting public health, taking into account factors such as youth appeal, addiction potential, and the likelihood of helping smokers transition away from combustible cigarettes, Hébert said. However, hundreds of other e-cigarette products remain on the market without FDA authorization. While enforcement is challenging, Hébert's study may shed light on the extent to which these unauthorized products are being used by young adults. "Young adults are comfortable using smartphones to communicate, and we anticipate getting rich, real-time data," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Could your diet help control IBD flares? Food is vital in health and disease, including IBD. However, there is no consistent evidence that a well-defined diet can modulate the disease course in IBD. Nevertheless, the diverse nutritional recommendations and approaches about specific foods make comparing studies difficult. For instance, the Mediterranean and Groningen anti-inflammatory diets encourage wheat intake, whereas most IBD diets exclude wheat. Studies on IBD and diet have primarily assessed food groups or select nutrients. While these studies have been valuable, food contains a large number of different compounds. Each compound is unique and may have specific health effects alone or in combination with others. As such, research on food compounds offers more comprehensive insights into the effects of individual food compounds or their combinations. In the present study, researchers evaluated whether specific food compounds and their combinations are associated with disease activity in IBD patients. They obtained dietary and disease status data from patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease at a university medical center in the Netherlands. Patients were stratified into the flare or remission group based on whether they experienced flares or remained in remission during follow-up, respectively. Flares were defined as active IBD-related hospitalization or surgery, step-up in medication, or endoscopy revealing active disease. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) adapted for individuals with IBD was administered at baseline. The authors previously linked two food compounds databases (Phenol-Explorer and FooDB) to NEVO, the Dutch food coding system, generating an integrated database with concentration values of 1,160 compounds, of which 768 were analyzed in this study (those consumed by at least 80% of participants). Using this database and FFQ data, dietary data of IBD patients were translated into intake levels of food compounds. A random forest analysis was performed to explore compounds associated with remission and flares. Compounds contributing the most to the random forest were assessed for potential biological relevance by examining literature on gut health, IBD, or immunomodulation. Overall, the study included 135 patients aged 19-68, who were in endoscopic or clinical remission at baseline. The median time from baseline to relapse was 14 months. Among the random forest models, those based on up to 75 food compounds showed optimal performance overall. The remainder were ethanol, cellobiose, vanillin, kaempferol-3-glucoside, haem iron, molybdenum, acetylglycine, kaempferol-3-O-acetyl-glucoside, 4-hydroxyproline, and heptadecanoyl carnitine. Among the 29 compounds with increased intakes in the remission group, butyric acid, capric acid, 4-hydroxyproline, and trans- and cis-linoleic acid reportedly attenuated inflammation in IBD, augmented barrier function, were gastroprotective, or were associated with a lower IBD risk. However, some findings appeared contradictory; for example, palmitic acid and myristic acid, which were also higher in the remission group, have previously been reported to impair intestinal integrity and increase the risk of flare. Immunomodulatory effects were identified for 11 compounds, while 13 compounds lacked relevant literature regarding their impact on gut health, IBD, or the immune system. Among the six compounds with increased intake levels in the flare group, molybdenum might promote dysbiosis and aggravate colitis. Conversely, cellobiose and kaempferol-3-glucoside have been reported to attenuate experimental colitis in mice. Suspected immunomodulatory effects were found for trans-11-docosenoic acid. In sum, the random forest models based on up to 75 compounds achieved optimal performance. The contribution to the model by a compound may stem from a biologically relevant difference in intake between flare and remission groups. For some compounds, however, this may also be due to coincidence or co-occurrence in the diet with other compounds that have biological effects. This may help explain some of the contradictory findings. For instance, patients who experience frequent flares might strictly avoid fatty dairy products. While this may help alleviate symptoms, it could also unintentionally reduce their intake of beneficial fatty acids, such as butyric acid, potentially worsening their condition over time. This complexity is revealed by the compound-level analysis; the study noted that while patients in remission ate less dairy overall, their intake of specific beneficial fatty acids from sources like fatty butter and cheese was actually higher. The analytic approach used in this study may also help uncover diet-disease relationships in other chronic conditions. Further research is needed to clarify these associations and validate their biological significance. Tarun is a writer based in Hyderabad, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cannabis use is linked to a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, with significantly heightened risks of having a stroke or acute coronary syndrome-sudden reduced or blocked blood flow to the heart-finds a pooled analysis of real world data, published online in the journal Heart. The authors of a linked editorial call for the drug to be treated like tobacco-not criminalized, but actively discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand vapour inhalation. Legalising cannabis in certain jurisdictions and expanding its use for medicinal purposes has probably changed people's risk perceptions of the drug and helped drive its growing popularity, they suggest. While previously published studies have linked cannabis use to cardiovascular problems, the magnitude of the risk hasn't been clear. To strengthen the evidence base, therefore, the researchers scoured research databases looking for large observational studies, published between January 2016 and December 2023, which explored cannabis use and serious cardiovascular outcomes: cardiovascular disease death; and non-fatal acute coronary syndrome to include heart attack and stroke. From an initial haul of 3012 articles, 24, involving around 200 million people, were included in a pooled data analysis of the results: 17 cross-sectional studies, 6 cohort studies, and 1 case-control study. Study participants were mostly aged between 19 and 59. And in those studies where sex was recorded, cannabis users tended to be mostly male and younger than non-users. The analysis revealed heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome; 20% higher for stroke; and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Notwithstanding these caveats, the researchers say that theirs is an exhaustive analysis of published data on the potential association between cannabis use and major cardiovascular disease and provides new insights from real-world data. In a linked editorial, Emeritus Professor Stanton Glantz of the University of California at San Francisco and Dr Lynn Silver of the Public Health Institute, Oakland, California, and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California at San Francisco, say the study "raises serious questions about the assumption that cannabis imposes little cardiovascular risk." Cannabis is now generally more potent and has diversified into a wide array of inhaled high potency cannabis concentrates, synthetic psychoactive cannabinoids, and edibles, they point out. "How these changes affect cardiovascular risk requires clarification, as does the proportion of risk attributable to cannabinoids themselves versus particulate matter, terpenes or other components of the exposure," they say. They conclude: "Cannabis needs to be incorporated into the framework for prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease. So too must cardiovascular disease prevention be incorporated into the regulation of cannabis markets. "Cardiovascular and other health risks must be considered in the regulation of allowable product and marketing design as the evidence base grows. Today that regulation is focused on establishing the legal market with woeful neglect of minimising health risks. "Specifically, cannabis should be treated like tobacco: not criminalized, but discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand exposure."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from The University of Texas at Arlington reveals that people who live in rural areas are more likely to have chronic pain than those in urban settings. The findings may help explain higher opioid prescription rates in rural communities and could guide future research into the root causes of this disparity. "We already know about the rural-urban gap in mortality and life expectancy," said Feinuo Sun, UT Arlington assistant professor of kinesiology and lead author of the study in The Journal of Rural Health. "But when you look at pain, especially chronic pain, it becomes clear that rural residents face additional burdens." Chronic pain has been previously linked to higher risks of disability and mortality and contributes to increased health care costs-an estimated $261 billion and $300 billion annually in the U.S. One key takeaway from Dr. Sun's study is the importance of timely intervention for middle-aged adults in rural communities as they are among the most vulnerable to developing chronic pain. Without early intervention, it can have serious long-term consequences, including premature mortality. That's why targeted outreach and early pain management strategies are so important." In her research, Sun, who has expertise in demography and population health, uses national data and a spatial analysis approach-a way of mapping how factors like health care services, job types and regional economic conditions shape health outcomes depending on where people live. In a 2024 study she authored, she found that rural residents expect to live more years with chronic pain than suburban and urban residents. Sun's latest findings suggest the chronic pain disparities are not solely due to limited access to health care in rural communities. Rural residents are more likely to work physically demanding jobs and experience higher poverty rates, both of which contribute to chronic pain. Elevated pain levels, along with fewer treatment options, may help explain the heavier reliance on opioids in these communities. Sun's research seeks to distinguish the root causes for higher opioid demand in rural areas. "The goal for future research is to understand the causes of these disparities and to examine how differences in pain treatment between rural and urban areas contribute to the overall pain gap," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A clinical trial involving adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has found a combination therapy may reduce chronic kidney disease and improve health outcomes. The findings could help guide more precision care for young people with T1D. While most people with T1D are diagnosed as adults, the condition often starts in childhood and early adolescence. T1D requires insulin therapy throughout a person's life, which can lead to side effects such as weight gain and chronic kidney disease. In the trial, participants who received dapagliflozin alongside insulin had fewer of these side effects and better overall health outcomes. Our findings showed that adolescents who received this combination therapy were able to improve many symptoms typically associated with insulin-managed type one diabetes. This could inform a new early intervention strategy for the growing population of teenagers with type one diabetes." Dr. Farid Mahmud, Associate Scientist in the Translational Medicine program and Staff Physician, Division of Endocrinology, SickKids While previous research has shown similar results in adults, Mahmud's team focused on designing a clinical trial specifically for teenagers, a group often underrepresented in clinical trials. Hormonal changes, psychological development, and the shared responsibility between teens and their parents for managing treatment protocols can make trial participation more complex for this age group. To address these challenges, the research team worked closely with patient partner Lynne McArthur. McArthur's involvement in research began when one of her twin sons was diagnosed with T1D following a trip to the SickKids emergency department at just 18 months old. A few years later, his twin was also diagnosed. That experience led McArthur to become more involved in research efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment options for families like hers. Now that her sons are older, McArthur continues to be involved as a patient advisor. She reviews recruitment materials and provides feedback on trial design, helping ensure the research stays connected to the lived experience of people managing T1D. With my experience as trial participant, I can see how the plans on paper would impact the real lives of people living with diabetes," explains McArthur. One of those opportunities is the Empowering diVERse Youth with diabetes thrOugh precisioN mEdicine, or 'EVERYONE', study, which builds on this approach by focusing on how individual factors influence treatment response. Aligned with Precision Child Health, a movement to individualize care for patients and families at SickKids, the EVERYONE study will explore how a youth's unique characteristics such as their insulin sensitivity, immune response, metabolism, genetics and social health impact how they respond to insulin treatment. By understanding these differences between patients, the team hopes to one day inform tailored treatments to optimize outcomes for youth with T1D. "This is opening exciting new treatment opportunities for youth with type one diabetes," says Mahmud, who is also an Associate Professor in the Department of Paediatrics and Institute of Medical Science at the University of Toronto.
