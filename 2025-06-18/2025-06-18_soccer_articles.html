                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An animal-rights activist ran onto the field during a Club World Cup match between Manchester City and Wydad at Lincoln Financial Field on Wednesday, urging Morocco to reform its treatment of stray animals. The man wore a shirt that read, "Morocco, end the stray dog massacre," and carried a sign that read, "Morocco: stop shooting dogs and cats." He ran for a few seconds before he was tackled by security workers and escorted out of the stadium. The protester's shirt and sign included the logo of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Wydad is based in Casablanca, Morocco. PETA has been critical of the Moroccan government for its treatment of stray cats and dogs. Morocco is among the hosts of the 2030 World Cup. The government has expanded a "Trap, Neuter, Vaccinate and Return" program for stray animals, but activists have claimed that animals are being killed rather than neutered.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following the backlash over the lack of anti-racism and anti-discrimination signage at the 2025 Club World Cup, FIFA played its "No To Racism" video at Hard Rock Stadium on Wednesday. FIFA had originally raised questions from fans after a lack of use of any of its anti-racism and anti-discrimination videos, signage and marketing assets prior to Wednesday's Club World Cup match. FIFA has also not made its anti-racism protocol announcements in stadiums or performed the "universal anti-racism" gesture, which was to be applied to all competitions after its initial announcement in September. During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, FIFA heavily advocated for inclusion in several avenues, including captains' armbands, in-stadium announcements and on-screen at game venues. At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA kept several teams from wearing "OneLove" armbands as it was said to challenge homophobia, while the host nation criminalized same-sex marriage. The questions surrounding the lack of messaging come as FIFA president Gianni Infantino developed a relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. Infantino attended a pre-inauguration rally, was at Trump's inauguration and brought the Club World Cup trophy to the Oval Office during a White House visit. According to The Athletic, FIFA did not respond when asked if its decision to avoid anti-discrimination messaging previously was influenced by the political climate in the United States, which has experienced nationwide rallies combating mass deportation. The association referred to its statutes, which state that FIFA will "remain neutral in matters of politics." In May, Infantino called for policymakers and global legislators to impose criminal policies on those violating FIFA's anti-racism and anti-discrimination efforts. A FIFA spokesperson told The Athletic, "FIFA has a firm, zero-tolerance stance against all forms of discrimination and racism. "This commitment was recently reinforced through the unanimous approval by the FIFA Council of the revised FIFA Disciplinary Code, which introduces new measures to fight racist abuse — including increased minimum bans for racist incidents and enhanced financial penalties as duly informed to the 75th FIFA Congress in Asuncion in May 2025." The spokesperson added that FIFA's "three-step anti-discrimination procedure" will be implemented if incidents occur during the Club World Cup. FIFA is set to hold the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City have kicked off their Club World Cup title defence with a victory thanks to goals from Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku. They did, however, finish with 10 men after Rico Lewis was contentiously sent off in the 88th minute. The other game in Group G sees Juventus face Al Ain later today. Man City 2 Wydad 0: Contrasting debuts for Reijnders and Cherki as Foden signals a return to form Now he has had a bit of time to cool off, Pep Guardiola is smiling in his interview with DAZN, but he was not a happy man at full time as he spoke to the referee following Rico Lewis' sending off. Here's what he had to say: “That's why the first game of a group phase is always tricky. It was the first step and we will learn from here. He has another role, we have a lot of No. It's hard to know what to expect when two teams who have never faced each other before match up for the first time, as has been the case fairly often so far at the Club World Cup. But that was an intriguing match from both sides. Job done for City — not without a bit of huffing and puffing to get past Wydad — and an encouraging performance from the Moroccan side. They did their bit to make sure that was not easy for City and could easily have got on the score sheet for the chances they had. How long have you been thinking about this, City fans? There were a couple of times when I looked up and thought, “Oh, they've brought John Stones on” — and no, it was Vitor Reis. That has to be an encouraging sign, albeit not for my eyesight. Manchester City began their FIFA Club World Cup with a 2-0 victory against Wydad Casablanca in Philadelphia on Wednesday. Man City 2 Wydad 0: Contrasting debuts for Reijnders and Cherki as Foden signals a return to form Here's our man of the match with his view on today's game as he spoke to DAZN: "It was difficult at times with the heat, we're not used to it so we had to keep the ball a bit more. "It's really important to get your sharpness now in this big tournament. " He scored inside two minutes and remained an important focal point for City. Hard luck for both Jeremy Doku and Tijjani Reijnders, who had strong performances. A valiant effort from Wydad AC, who held their own despite the score line. Here's a look at our rankings of the Wydad players: We saw two debuts and had plenty to dissect. Here's how we rate Pep Guardiola's side in that match: Jeremy Doku performed well across both halves until he came off as a sub. Involved in both goals and looked a cut above when he was on the pitch. Showed class in a strange game — most of the early Club World Cup matches have had a pre-season feel — but showed no sign of wilting in the heat. Professional, effective, and driven in getting City their first win of the tournament. A bit hot in Philadelphia for that kind of garb, isn't it? 📸 Credit to David Ramos of Getty Images for this snap. That's a really unfortunate red card for Rico Lewis, especially after it got reviewed by VAR. Obviously his boot connecting with Obeng's face is always going to bring some sort of discussion about a card but it looked like a classic 50-50 challenge at full speed. With both players at full stretch on the ground, it's hard to see how either could have avoided that collision. At the whistle, Guardiola, whose lips are pursed as if he has swallowed a wasp, shook hands with the Wydad manager Amine Benhachem curtly before striding over to the referee to make his case. He was not happy, waving his arms around in protest. Manchester City get their 2025 Club World Cup opener off to a good start. For Wydad, a decent performance and one which saw them create several good chances, but they couldn't find the net. It should offer them some encouragement in future matches, though. Really good save from Benabid of Wydad, who is off his line to deny Erling Haaland, who had been played the ball and was one on one. Though he should have done better with Foden's opener, the goalkeeper has been solid since then. Midway through six minutes of added time, City bring on midfielder Matheus Nunes for winger Savinho. Nunes can (and will) cover right-back after Rico Lewis' dismissal. VAR upholds the decision but that is very harsh. Obeng then dives in late but Lewis' boot connects with his face. No intention in that whatsoever and I'm not sure where he could realistically put his boot. Both players slid in with full commitment, Lewis got the ball first and cleared it away with a stretch of his leg.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PHILADELPHIA -- Pep Guardiola arrived at the Club World Cup telling his Manchester City players to forget about last season, and itt's a message that will have been directed at Phil Foden, in particular. Picked to start against Wydad AC in their Group G opener, Foden scored City's first goal of the tournament within two minutes. As recently as last month, Foden told reporters he was burnt out, which was also the reason he decided to skip England's World Cup qualifiers in June. Guardiola can only hope that the extra rest has done him good and that a goal against Wydad -- guided into the net after Savinho's cross was parried back into the penalty area -- will kick start a resurgence. If Foden can return to his 2023-24 levels, when he scored 27 goals in all competitions, then City could again become the Premier League's team to beat. Rayan Cherki has arrived from Lyon this summer in the pre-tournament transfer window and has already been forced to answer questions about whether he's the replacement for Kevin De Bruyne. Guardiola had to do without De Bruyne for more than half of the 2023-24 campaign because of injury and it was Foden who stepped up as City claimed a fourth title in a row. When Foden scored after just 113 seconds, it looked like Wydad AC might be on the end of the kind of score we saw over the weekend between Bayern Munich and Auckland City. It was partly down to the pace of Wydad's South African forward Thembinkosi Lorch, but also because of Guardiola's ultra-attacking team. Foden, Cherki, Omar Marmoush, Jérémy Doku and Savinho were all crammed into the starting XI. It left Tijjani Reijnders to make his City debut as the deepest-lying midfielder even though he arrived from Milan talking about being a goalscoring No.8. A young back four that included Vitor Reis (19), Rico Lewis (20) and Nico O'Reilly (20) had some nervous moments before Doku made it 2-0 just before half-time. The block of red behind the goal bounced and chanted, led by a drummer who didn't stop all afternoon. The only downside for Guardiola was a late red card for Lewis, despite appearing to win the ball first before clattering into Samuel Obeng. • Al Hilal CEO: Signing Ronaldo would have been "unusual" • New Chelsea signing Sarr: I want to be Chelsea's van Dijk • Man City open Club World Cup with a win LOS ANGELES -- Esteban Andrada arrived at the Club World Cup with one foot out of the club, but he had his redemption match against UEFA Champions League runner-up Inter Milan as the Liga MX side earned a very credible 1-1 draw to begin their Group E campaign. Andrada's mistakes and lack of confidence saw him benched down the stretch in Liga MX, which prompted Monterrey to seek reinforcements in the special pre-Club World Cup transfer window. They signed Uruguayan international Santiago Mele, who arrived in Los Angeles on Monday afternoon, but he was not considered for the match. In the end, Andrada was a force between the posts, making one big save and commanding his penalty area well against an onslaught of Inter shots, the Serie A side managing 15 shots for an xG (expected goals) of 2.68. Coach Domenec Torrent now has an important decision to make for their next group game, against Argentine giants River Plate on Saturday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena: should he back Andrada to continue his heroics, or will Mele get an immediate look as a  starter? PHILADELPHIA -- Empty seats are in danger of becoming a theme of the Club World Cup, but Wydad's travelling support more than made up for the shortfall at Lincoln Financial Field on Wednesday. Clad in red and gathered behind one goal, roughly 2,000 supporters led the charge with a pre-match tifo, drum-led chanting and, at one point during the second half, a sea of red flares which spread smoke and the smell of cordite drifting across the southern Philadelphia air. A few individuals went a step too far in throwing flares onto the pitch -- prompting boos from City supporters -- but overall FIFA will be grateful for the colour Wydad's ultras provided despite watching their team lose 2-0. FIFA owes something of a debt to Morocco in this regard. What a boost it will be for FIFA and president Gianni Infantino if Wydad's fans continue to show this enthusiasm. Odds (via ESPN BET): Palmeiras (-165), Draw (+300), Al Ahly (+450) That performance was unacceptable, the first-half failure to compete uncharacteristic of a Diego Simeone team. Perhaps the midday heat in Pasadena was a factor, though there'll be no such excuse on Thursday evening at a cloudy Lumen Field in Seattle. The Sounders did well against Brazilian giants Botafogo there on Sunday -- giving the 2024 Libertadores winners a scare, though losing 2-1 despite having the bulk of the scoring chances and possession -- and they'll once again be underdogs against Atletico, hoping to secure a famous win at home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 tournament will feature more teams and more air miles travelled than ever, casting doubt upon ambitious climate goals As next summer's World Cup approaches, excitement is building for the biggest global soccer tournament ever held, but so too are concerns over the viability and environmental sustainability of the vastly expanded competition. Held across 16 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico, the 2026 World Cup will be marked by the tournament expanding from 32 nations to 48 competing for soccer's most coveted prize. Both of these factors bring significant environmental concerns, however – particularly regarding the tournament's carbon footprint and the effectiveness of Fifa's proposed mitigation strategies. Fifa first introduced its Climate Strategy report back in 2021 in response to growing environmental concerns, launching its initiative at the UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26) that year. The strategy included measures such as promoting sustainable infrastructure, enhancing energy efficiency and encouraging the use of renewable energy. It also included a fair amount of carbon offsetting – a process by which entities buy “credits” that go toward environmental protection, to theoretically make up for emissions produced. However, it has been argued by critics that Fifa's reliance on carbon offsetting lacks transparency and may not be effective in mitigating the environmental impact of its expanded showpiece tournament. The organization's previous claims of carbon neutrality for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar were deemed misleading by a Swiss regulator. Responding to complaints raised by environmental groups in five different countries, the Swiss Commission for Fairness – which is based in Fifa's home city of Zurich – found the governing body was “not able to provide proof that the claims were accurate” and “did not set out a plan to define how it will further offset emissions”. The massive geographical spread will necessitate extensive air travel for teams and fans alike, contributing to the tournament's substantial carbon emissions. The 2022 World Cup faced significant criticism for its environmental impact, but that was to do with factors other than travel. Additionally, Uefa established a €7m Climate Fund to support sustainable infrastructure projects, leaving a lasting environmental legacy for the Euros. Efforts to mitigate these challenges include promoting public transit and reducing reliance on air travel within host cities. However, the effectiveness of these measures depends on the availability, accessibility and affordability of sustainable transportation options, in addition to the willingness of fans and teams to utilize them. And, as anyone who has used public transport in the US will tell you, it can vary from rickety but effective in cities such as New York to almost non-existent in places such as Kansas City and Arlington. Fifa's choice of sponsorship partners for the tournament is another area in which the World Cup has come under scrutiny for its environmental impact. Partnerships with fossil fuel companies and airlines contribute to soccer's carbon footprint and raise questions about the alignment of commercial interests with stated sustainability goals. Among Fifa's many commercial partners for the 2026 tournament are Qatar Airways and Aramco, officially known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Group. It could be argued that such sponsorships undermine the organization's efforts to promote environmental responsibility. But it also represents an opportunity for the organization to demonstrate a genuine commitment to environmental sustainability. Soccer's supposed commitment to reducing emissions and easing its environmental impact is more than a mere box-ticking exercise; it is a matter of increasing importance to fans. A new study commissioned by UK-based climate change charity Pledgeball, in conjunction with the Champions League sponsor Mastercard, polled over 1,600 fans – including attendees at last year's Champions League final – on the subject of environmental sustainability in soccer. It found that 81% of respondents said they are worried about the climate crisis, and 82% said they wanted their clubs to do more to combat it. The majority of respondents also believed that it was incumbent on governing bodies such as Fifa to take the lead by implementing a top-down approach by overseeing explicit reporting requirements and meting out punishments to clubs responsible for the highest emissions. And there will be an added expectation for a greater level of transparency when it comes to the postmortem reporting of the tournament's carbon impact, after Fifa's attempts to do so after the Qatar tournament didn't stand up to scrutiny. How Fifa tackles that issue will determine the credibility of its grand green plans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer teams complaining about pitch conditions is truly a tradition unlike any other. Therefore, it should come as no surprise whatsoever that players and coaches are sounding off about the turf installed at MetLife Stadium for the FIFA Club World Cup. The real grass installed for the Club World Cup, a move required by FIFA, apparently isn't much better. There is plenty of time between now and MetLife Stadium hosting the 2026 World Cup Final in July ‘26, but the fact that teams are already moaning about the playing surface isn't exactly the greatest vote of confidence about what is to come. FIFA Renames MetLife Stadium With Dumbest Title Imaginable For 2026 World Cup Final Porto took on Palmeiras in the first FIFA Club World Cup match at MetLife Stadium, and neither side was pleased with the playing surface. My feeling was the pitch was a little bit soft and it was a little bit, not dry, but I would say that the ball wasn't traveling so fast as we are used to," Palmeiras' Estêvão said, according to the New York Post. But, everybody has to work in the same conditions and we don't search for any excuses." Borussia Dortmund played to a scoreless draw against Fluminense on MetLife's surface as well, and Pascal Groß had similar concerns about the grass. "It's just a totally different football pitch than what we played the whole year. "But I'm not a fan of excuses, so that doesn't matter for me. Complaining about grass, the same grass your opponent has to play on as well, is always a questionable move. Add in the fact that these teams should have been well aware that the surface was a new one, and the complaints come across as nothing but a whine fest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KANSAS CITY (June 18, 2025) — A trio of Kansas City Current players in forward Michelle Cooper, midfielder Claire Hutton and defender Izzy Rodriguez have been called up by the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) for three international friendlies later this month. U.S. Soccer announced its 25-player roster on Wednesday as it continues preparation for Concacaf World Cup qualifying in Fall 2026. After featuring in the Futures Camp earlier this year, Cooper and Hutton both got their first senior national team call-up in February for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup presented by Visa and have since appeared in two subsequent USWNT camps. The Stars and Stripes will play the Republic of Ireland for two contests, the first which will be held at DSG Park in Commerce City, Colo., on Thursday, June 26, at 8 p.m. CT. The USWNT will conclude its trip in Washington, D.C., by facing Canada on Wednesday, July 2, at 6:30 p.m. CT for the Allstate Continental Clásico at Audi Field. Fans can watch the first match against Ireland on TBS, TruTV, Universo, Max and Peacock, and can tune into TNT, TruTV, Universo, Max and Peacock for the second game. The Allstate Continental Clásico will air on TNT, TruTV, Universo, Max and Peacock. Cooper made her USWNT debut during the 2025 SheBelieves Cup, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2-0 victory over Colombia on Feb. 20. Most recently, she dished out an assist in a 3-0 shutout over China PR on May 31. Cooper also had a decorated youth national team career, highlighted by winning the Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the 2022 Concacaf U-20 Championship as well as captaining her team at the 2022 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Like Cooper, Hutton's first USWNT appearance was in the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year when she started against Australia and logged 70 minutes. She joined the starting lineup again – and played every minute – in an April friendly against Brazil, also putting in an 80-minute shift as a starter vs. Jamaica on June 3. Hutton's international debut was with the U.S. U-17 Youth National Team at the 2022 Concacaf Championship where she scored six goals. Receiving her first USWNT nod is Rodriguez, who has appeared in all 12 games of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season so far with nine starts. Her three assists are tied for third in the league and she was named to the NWSL Best XI for April, the second such honor of her career. The Kansas City Current is back on the pitch on Friday, June 20, welcoming Angel City FC to CPKC Stadium to close out the first half of NWSL regular season action. Kickoff is at 7 p.m. CT and the match will broadcast on Prime Video. Sign up for latest news, offers & more! You are about to leave this site.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rose Lavelle is coming back to play in her hometown. The United States Women's National Team announced Wednesday that the Mount Notre Dame graduate will be in uniform then they play three friendlies this summer, including June 29 against Ireland at TQL Stadium. Lavelle, who turned 30 in May, had been out for six months with an ankle injury that required surgery. She recently returned to action for her Gotham FC club in the National Women's Soccer League, coming on as a substitute for the final 15 minutes during two games on June 7 and June 13. Lavelle is currently in New York City with Gotham FC. She addressed her injury and the joy she feels coming back to Cincinnati in a virtual interview session from there with local media Tuesday in advance of the announcement. “It was a pretty big surgery, so it honestly might be a while until my ankle is 100 percent,” she said. “The rest of me feels great, though, so that's a good thing. I definitely didn't know what all coming back from surgery entailed, so it was a harder process than I anticipated. But the med staff at Gotham has been great. “Coming back from injury, how much I'll be available to play, hopefully some good amount, but obviously I can't go in and play maximum minutes,” she said. “It's my first camp back in and everybody's mentality going into camp is 'I have to go back in and earn spots.' It's something (that) having been in camp and with the national team for so long, it's a familiar position I'm in, to go back and an environment where we really have to compete and push each other.” “A lot of that is being able to reflect on knowing what all you still want. We have another cycle starting up, (we) qualified for the World Cup and Olympics and kind of go from there. “I think it's kind of nice because I've been able to take a step back and reflect on and off the field. I feel like there's not really ever an ideal time to get an injury or have surgery, but I feel like if it was going to happen this year, it was probably the best time. I feel like it's allowed me to really prepare and reflect on the next couple years out.” “It was such a long journey, so to finally get back on the field with Gotham and with my teammates was so fun,” she said. “Obviously, first game we lost, so that wasn't fun at the end of it, but during I enjoyed it. When Lavelle helped the United States win the World Cup in 2019, she was a 24-year old phenom supported by older big names such as Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan. Lavelle has been a mentor to her Gotham teammates this year, and is looking forward to doing everything she can for the national team, even if she can't play as much as she would like. “I think it's really allowed me to step into more of a leadership role off the field,” she said. “So how can I still be a good teammate to them? “It still feels weird for me to think of myself as a veteran player, but I am, and with the past couple of (USWNT) rosters, it's been a really young new group. I've been that player before: The young inexperienced one. I always feel like I had such great veteran players to look up to, so I hope I can be that for them, help them feel a little more comfortable in an uncomfortable environment and hopefully set them up to be the best version of themselves in camps.” Lavelle follows FC Cincinnati, and she's disappointed that the city didn't get an NWSL franchise in the recent expansion window. When asked about it, she sighed and got emotional. “I would have loved to see Cincinnati get a team and I would love to still see them get a team at some point. I think it's just such an underrated soccer city. There's a possibility that Cincinnati could host games in the tournament. “I feel like so much talent comes out of it. So, I love any opportunity for people to be able to visit Cincinnati and see how amazing it is, and I think it would be such an amazing way to showcase the city, the soccer talent, the community.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (June 18, 2025) – U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes has named the 25-player training camp roster for the upcoming matches against the Republic of Ireland on June 26 at DICK's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colo., presented by Allstate (7 p.m. MT / 9 p.m. As Hayes shared last week, the roster does not feature almost all of the USA's European-based players with those players getting this FIFA window off to rest and recuperate after long European seasons. Only defender Naomi Girma of Chelsea FC currently plays her club soccer abroad, meaning 24 players on the roster are from National Women's Soccer League clubs. Hayes will name 23 players to suit up for each of the three matches. FORWARDS (6): Lynn Biyendolo (Seattle Reign FC; 80/24), Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 6/1), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 9/0), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 5/1), Ally Sentnor (Utah Royals; 9/4), Alyssa Thompson (Angel City FC; 19/1) The roster features four players earning their first-ever call-ups – defenders Jordyn Bugg, Lilly Reale and Izzy Rodriguez and midfielder Sam Meza -- meaning Hayes has now given 27 players their first USWNT call-ups. “We want to continue to improve our understanding of how we want to play and widen the player pool, and those are some of the key goals of this three-game window,” said Hayes. “On this roster, we have players with a varied amount of experience, and my priority is to deepen the exposures required for international soccer. These are three challenging matches and as always, we want to win, but also to make sure we are ready for the next steps.” Lavelle's inclusion will give her the chance to play in her hometown of Cincinnati, where she attended Mount Notre Dame High School and is one of the most popular local athletes of the last decade. Houston Dash forward Yazmeen Ryan also returns to the roster after being unavailable for selection during the last FIFA window due to injury. The other five players on the roster who have world championship experience are forward Lynn Biyendolo --who had a two-goal performance in her last USWNT outing in a 4-0 win over Jamaica on June 3 to bring her international goal total to 24 in 80 caps–defender Emily Sonnett (108 caps), midfielder Sam Coffey (35 caps), Girma and Lavelle. Fourteen players on this roster were on World Cup Teams for the USA at the U-17 or U-20 levels or both. Ally Sentnor, who notched her first two-goal game in a U.S. uniform on June 3 against Jamaica, gets another call-up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four Seattle Reign FC players have been named to the United States Women's National team 25-player roster for the upcoming international window by Head Coach Emma Hayes – Lynn Biyendolo, Jordyn Bugg, Claudia Dickey and Sam Meza. For each of the three friendly matches, Hayes will name 23 of the 25 total players to suit up. "Having four players called into the senior U.S. Women's National Team — including first-timers Sam Meza and Jordyn Bugg — speaks volumes about the level of talent and commitment we have at this club. Whether it's Claudia and Lynn continuing to raise the bar, or Sam and Jordyn stepping onto the senior stage for the first time, we're incredibly proud to see the Reign so well represented,” said Seattle Reign FC General Manager Lesle Gallimore. Forward Lynn Biyendolo brings the most experience of the four Reign players called up with 80 caps and 24 goals. She is one of just six players included on the roster to have played in a world championship at the senior level. Goalkeeper Claudia Dickey continues her standout season, getting called up to camp once again after earning her first game call up during the May-June international window. All three of the goalkeepers called up to this camp have earned first call-ups this year or at the end of last year and have experience with the U.S. U-20s. They both have extensive experience at the youth national team level and are two of four players called up for the first time during this camp. All four of the first-time call ups have previously appeared on a U.S. roster in FIFA Youth World Cup. Both Bugg and Meza were most recently called up to the United States Under-23 Women's Youth National Team for a trip to Germany when the Americans split games with the Germans. 6:00 p.m. PT – United States vs. Republic of Ireland at DICK's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado (truTV and Max, Universo & Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports) 12:00 p.m. PT – United States vs. Republic of Ireland at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio (TNT, truTV and Max, Universo & Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports) 4:30 p.m. PT – United States vs. Canada at Audi Field in Washington, D.C.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) opened on Saturday, Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest footballer, weaved his magic on the field as a cluster of former stars – David Beckham, Ronaldo, Kaka, Bebeto, Roberto Baggio and Javier Zanetti – watched on from their VIP seats at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. While Messi was unable to score any goals in Inter Miami's 0-0 draw against Egyptian club Al Ahly, football fans turned up in their thousands to watch the Argentinian lead his team in what could have been a goal-fest for the home side. From Inter Miami's inclusion in the CWC under a special ‘host nation' spot for the regular-season winners of MLS (other football continents had different entry criteria for qualification), to Infantino's widely-reported comment that Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo “might play in the Club World Cup”, and increasing the winner's prize money by a whopping $35m, the FIFA chief has pulled out all the stops to support his claim that this competition is “the start of something historic that will change our sport for the better,” as he said earlier this week. Kickoffs scheduled at noon and 3pm local time on scorching hot summer days have led to players dealing with difficult weather conditions in some fixtures. While that schedule in itself is not unusual for an international competition, the CWC has been subject to criticism from players' unions long before the first kick of the opening game, as it comes off the back of a long domestic and international season in Europe and the Middle East for many clubs, while others – from the US, South America and Oceania – have hit pause on their regular seasons and will return to their respective leagues after the Club World Cup. “The decision to schedule the FIFA Club World Cup between June 15 and July 13 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives,” FIFPRO – the global union representing professional football players – said in a statement when the tournament schedule was released in 2024. FIFPRO called for the consideration of player health and safety regulations as a “matter of urgency” but that failed to deter FIFA from tinkering with the schedule. FIFA says the protection of player welfare has always been at the core of its decision-making and has taken multiple tangible initiatives – many of them in close cooperation with FIFPRO, according to FIFA's press office – for the effective betterment of player welfare on several levels, including an additional player substitution at Club World Cup matches as well as a concussion substitute. On heat management for players during CWC fixtures, FIFA will enact cooling breaks in the 30th and 75th minutes if the wet bulb globe temperature exceeds 32°C (89.6°F), according to FIFA's pre-existing international tournament guidelines. Bayern Munich made history at the FIFA Club World Cup on Sunday as they became the first team to score double digits in a single game when they thumped Auckland City, a club made up of semi-pro players with full-time day jobs, 10-0. While minnows and favourites are often pitted together in global tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, Auckland City – the Oceania champions and rated 4,957th in the world in the Opta Power Rankings – face strong opposition in their remaining group matches. After losing to sixth-ranked Bayern Munich, they face 24th-ranked Portuguese side Benfica and Argentinian mega club Boca Juniors, who are ranked 131. The next-lowest ranked clubs – Al Ain, Urawa Reds, Wydad Casablanca and Ulsan HD – are due to play their opening round matches on Tuesday and Wednesday. Monday's Chelsea vs LAFC encounter at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta was played out in front of 22,137 spectators – less than one-third of the stadium's 75,000 seat capacity. Post-match, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, when asked to describe the atmosphere in Atlanta, said: “I think the environment was a bit strange.” On Monday, a Group C match between Flamengo and Esperance de Tunis attracted 25,797 fans to Philadelphia's 69,000-seat Lincoln Financial Field, representing a 37.4% attendance rate. A Group B match on Sunday between Botafogo and Seattle Sounders, played at the 69,000-seat Lumens Field in Seattle, drew 30,151 spectators, or 43.7% of maximum spectator capacity, according to official match figures. Of the remaining 36 group-stage games, 13 will be weekday afternoon kickoffs and it remains to be seen whether underwhelming ticket sales at some venues will continue throughout the first phase of the tournament. FIFA has disclosed that fans from more than 130 countries have booked tickets to attend CWC matches and the organisation said on Tuesday that close to 1.5 million tickets had been sold.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been just 18 days since Inter Milan played its last game, losing to Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League final. The team parted ways with manager Simone Inzaghi, who led it to two European finals in three seasons, and replaced him with Cristian Chivu. It temporarily lost the services of forward Mehdi Taremi, who had returned to his native Iran earlier this month and became stranded there when Israeli attacks closed the airspace over much of the Mideast. At a time when many other professional sports teams in Los Angeles are staying silent amid ICE raids, Angel City is using its platform to support immigrants. And it's not easy every day, I'm not going to lie,” said forward Marcus Thuram, whose 18 goals in all competition was second on the team this season. Only doing what they do has become far more complicated and exhausting in recent years as the competition schedule for both club and country has expanded. Thuram's father, Lilian, was widely regarded as one of the best defenders of his era during an 18-year career that saw him win two Serie A titles, a European championship and play in two World Cup finals, winning one. His 27-year-old son has done that in each of the past two seasons. And if Inter makes it to the final of the Club World Cup, he'll wind up playing 55 games in 11 months. That doesn't count his 10 appearances for the French national team since last June. “We knew it was going to be a long season.” In their ravenous quest for revenue, soccer clubs, leagues and governing bodies have crowded the calendar with invented competitions that have drained both fans' bank accounts and players' energy levels. The Club World Cup is a perfect example. Although the tournament has been around since 2000, before this summer it never had more than eight teams and was held at one site during a 10-day break in the European season. It's not about proving how good we are.” If Inter Milan makes it to next month's final, its players will have just a couple of weeks off before reporting to training camp for the next Serie A season, which opens Aug. 23. With the World Cup also expanding next summer, national team players such as Thuram could play more than 70 games in 44 weeks and more than 120 games over two seasons. “A serious dialogue is needed between FIFA, UEFA, leagues, clubs and players to redesign an international calendar that protects the health of players and maintains the quality of games,” said Giuseppe Marotta, chairman and chief executive officer  of Inter Milan. But it was forced into a gap in the schedule that really didn't exist before. Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez score for Chelsea as LAFC 10-game unbeaten streak across all competition ends in a 2-0 loss in the FIFA Club World Cup. “It's undeniable that this event, positioned between two different seasons, is forcing us to do extra work and rethink what the traditional summer periods looks like for a football club,” Marotta said. “However these competitions also represent a huge opportunity in terms of visibility and revenue, often exceeding that of traditional competitions.” The Club World Cup allows teams to face rivals from other continents, expanding their international following and generating additional revenue streams by planting the team's flag in new markets and introducing its players to new fans. “The goal is to tell the American public who we are and what values have always guided us,” Marotta said. “It's not about proving how good we are,” he added of the tournament. “It's about contributing to the development of global football.” For example Italy's Serie A could compact from 20 to 18 teams, the same as in the German Bundesliga and France's Ligue 1. Until that happens, Thuram said the players will continue doing what they do for as long as they can do it. But it  couldn't make that advantage count.
