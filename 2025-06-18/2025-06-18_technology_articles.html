                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The man who prosecutors have charged with assassinating Melissa Hortman, a Democratic Minnesota state representative, and her husband Mark Hortman, once said in a sermon that his religious awakening came when he was 17 years old, working next to a man who “talked about God all of the time” at a vegetable canning factory. Over the next four decades of alleged shooter Vance Boelter's life, while working in the food industry, local government, and private security, his religious worldview appeared to incorporate fringe theological ideas that are often associated with so-called charismatic Christianity and Christian Nationalism, a movement that's captured the American religious right, has been seen as a key driver behind the January 6 Capitol riot, and currently enjoys an outsized influence on current Trump administration personnel and policy. Charismatic Christianity is a broad movement of evangelical Christians who are associated with belief in modern supernatural experiences, like speaking in tongues, divine healing and prophesy. NAR is an extreme Christian supremacist network that aims to dismantle the secular state, which it sees as demonic, and transform its institutions in accordance with Christian law. Experts tell WIRED that there are several links from the suspect's religious background to Christian nationalism that could explain why he allegedly targeted lawmakers and pro-abortion advocates. WIRED has also confirmed that the suspect attended a bible school in Dallas that was attended by several controversial figures from the world of Christian nationalism. “Vance Boelter, from everything I have read and heard, would clearly be a Christian nationalist,” claims Michael Emerson, the Baker Institute's Chavanne Fellow in religion and public policy at Rice University. They were harming the vision of a truly Christian identity and nation.” WIRED previously reported that the 57-year-old alleged shooter has been affiliated with at least one evangelical organization, serving for a time as the president of Revoformation Ministries. According to a tax filing reviewed by WIRED, he ran the ministry with his wife. He moonlighted as a religious pastor part of Pentecostal congregations, and participated in missions preaching around the world, including in Gaza and the West Bank, according to an archived website for Revoformation. The churches are so messed up, they don't know abortion is wrong, many churches.” In other sermons, the alleged shooter talked about the LGBTQ community, saying, “There's people, especially in America, they don't know what sex they are. “Everything that I've seen indicates that he's charismatic,” says Matthew Taylor, senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Baltimore and author of The Violent Take It by Force: The Christian Movement That Is Threatening Our Democracy. Abortion in the independent charismatic Christian movement is often characterized as a demonic practice. Charismatic Christians often talk about abortion in terms of “child sacrifice to demons,” says Taylor. “I don't think it's hard to see how someone could get radicalized around that language,” he alleges. The alleged shooter's now-deleted Facebook profile also showed that he had “liked” a page for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy organization known for its hardline stances against abortion and LGBTQ rights. “This signals at least a right-wing anti-abortion conviction,” says Taylor. David Carlson, who has known the alleged shooter since fourth grade and described the 57-year-old as his best friend, told reporters that the alleged shooter was a Trump supporter, “very conservative,” and would be offended if anyone suggested otherwise. Dutch Sheets, a NAR pastor who popularized the “Appeal to Heaven” flag waved by Christian nationalists and rioters on January 6, 2021, graduated from the institute in 1978, and worked as an adjunct professor therein the late 1980s and early 1990s; he later briefly returned as an instructor in 2012. Cindy Jacobs, an avid supporter of Trump who has been described as one of the most influential prophets in America, settled in Dallas in the 1980s, and according to Taylor, was regularly on the institute's campus lecturing or guest-teaching. When WIRED contacted the Institute, they directed our query to a statement saying it “unequivocally rejects, denounces, and condemns any and all forms of violence and extremism, be it politically, racially, religiously or otherwise motivated.” The statement also said that they were “aghast and horrified” that an alumnus of an Institute was a suspect in the Minnesota shootings. Although independent charismatic Christians don't directly call for adherents to take matters into their own hands, they do see themselves as soldiers in the primordial battle of “spiritual warfare,” where demonic forces can only be overcome by prayer and carrying out God's will. “This binary good versus evil worldview transforms democratic politics into a deadly version of the board game Risk, where geographic territory, institutions, and leaders have come under the sway of Satan,” says Robert Jones, president and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute. “If Christian nationalism is to be realized, those of different faiths or no faith do not belong. And Taylor notes that, for example, “the people who participated in J6 were overwhelmingly in [Christian] charismatics; they would say they were doing God's will” because “God had revealed that Donald Trump was anointed for another term.” The alleged shooter, too, may have seen himself as one of those soldiers. According to a criminal complaint filed Monday, Boelter texted his family after the killings, writing “Dad went to war last night..I don't wanna say more because I don't wanna implicate anybody.” Hoffman and his wife Yvette survived despite being shot multiple times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI researchers say they've discovered hidden features inside AI models that correspond to misaligned “personas,” according to new research published by the company on Wednesday. The researchers found one such feature that corresponded to toxic behavior in an AI model's responses —meaning the AI model would give misaligned responses, such as lying to users or making irresponsible suggestions. OpenAI's latest research gives the company a better understanding of the factors that can make AI models act unsafely, and thus, could help them develop safer AI models. “We are hopeful that the tools we've learned — like this ability to reduce a complicated phenomenon to a simple mathematical operation — will help us understand model generalization in other places as well,” said Mossing in an interview with TechCrunch. OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic are investing more in interpretability research — a field that tries to crack open the black box of how AI models work — to address this issue. The research found that OpenAI's models could be fine-tuned on insecure code and would then display malicious behaviors across a variety of domains, such as trying to trick a user into sharing their password. The phenomenon is known as emergent misalignment, and Evans' study inspired OpenAI to explore this further. But in the process of studying emergent misalignment, OpenAI says it stumbled into features inside AI models that seem to play a large role in controlling behavior. “When Dan and team first presented this in a research meeting, I was like, ‘Wow, you guys found it,'” said Tejal Patwardhan, an OpenAI frontier evaluations researcher, in an interview with TechCrunch. Some features OpenAI found correlate to sarcasm in AI model responses, whereas other features correlate to more toxic responses in which an AI model acts as a cartoonish, evil villain. OpenAI's researchers say these features can change drastically during the fine-tuning process. Notably, OpenAI researchers said that when emergent misalignment occurred, it was possible to steer the model back toward good behavior by fine-tuning the model on just a few hundred examples of secure code. In 2024, Anthropic released research that tried to map the inner workings of AI models, trying to pin down and label various features that were responsible for different concepts. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are making the case that there's real value in understanding how AI models work, and not just making them better.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ruling does not affect states where gender-affirming care for youth remains legal, but establishes the precedent that states can ban this kind of treatment. They argued that the Tennessee law discriminates based on sex and gender status by denying medical care to transgender youth that is available to other minors. Tennessee enacted its law in 2023, which prohibits health care providers from prescribing medication or offering gender-affirming surgical procedures to minors whose gender identities are different from their assigned sex at birth. The law excludes procedures that address congenital defects or physical injuries, as well as gender-affirming medical care for minors whose gender identity conforms with their designated sex at birth. It means, for instance, that a cisgender boy with gynecomastia, a hormonal condition that causes enlarged male breast tissue, could receive medication or undergo surgery to remove breast tissue to conform to their gender identity, but a transgender individual could not receive the same treatment for gender dysmorphia. Today's Supreme Court ruling, delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts, maintains that Tennessee's law is not discriminatory because it “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to any minor to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence, regardless of the minor's sex.” According to the justices, the Tennessee law does not exclude any individual from medical treatments based on their transgender status. Since 2021, more than two dozen states have adopted laws or policies that prohibit or severely limit gender-affirming care for people under the age of 18. According to the health policy nonprofit KFF, 40 percent of trans youth between the ages of 13 and 17 live in a state that has enacted a policy against gender-affirming care. Though several states were facing legal challenges to their bans, today's Supreme Court decision means those laws will likely remain intact. One study from 2022 surveyed nearly 12,000 transgender and nonbinary youth aged 13 to 24 and found that those who received gender-affirming hormone therapy had lower rates of depression, thoughts of suicide, and attempted suicide than those who had not received hormone therapy. “Today's Supreme Court decision is a devastating blow to transgender youth and the families who love them,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, an organization that promotes LGBTQ+ civil rights, in a statement. “Families may now have to make the heartbreaking choice to leave their state or split their families, or take on extensive financial burdens, in order to ensure that their kids can access medically necessary care.” There's a very simple pattern to Elon Musk's broken promises Big Story: The epic rise and fall of a dark-web psychedelics kingpin WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team led by David Dreyer, a visiting research fellow in sensory biology at Lund University, suggests that Bogong moths may use the starry sky—among other tools—to navigate in the right direction. If this proves to be true, Dreyer and his colleagues claim it would make the Australian Bogong moth the first known invertebrate to “use the stars for discerning specific geographical directions (that is, a direction relative to north) for directed long-range navigation to a distant goal,” the team wrote in a new study, published today in the journal Nature. In 2018, the same researchers suggested that Bogong moths reach their destinations by both sensing Earth's magnetic field and by using unknown visual landmarks. In fact, as noted by a Nature News and Views article, some animals rely on several different navigational methods. “By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator, we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth's known magnetic sense), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions,” the researchers explained in the study. As ancient seafarers would attest, the predictable positions of stars make them a reliable navigational tool. Nonetheless, scientists have previously documented only some night-migratory birds using starlight to find a specific geographical direction. Dung Beetles use the stars to travel in a straight line, but they are not migratory insects—they're not using stellar cues for long-distance travel like birds and Bogong moths do. By analyzing the moth's brain, the scientists also demonstrated that neurons linked to vision “responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation,” showing the greatest activity “when the moth was headed southwards.” In other words, their brains appear to be wired to pick up on stellar cues. However, the parts of the starry sky that moths specifically rely on for directions remain a mystery, especially since it is unclear whether moths can even see individual stars. “Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth's magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination,” the researchers concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Israel-linked hacker group known as Predatory Sparrow has carried out some of the most disruptive and destructive cyberattacks in history, twice disabling thousands of gas station payment systems across Iran and once even setting a steel mill in the country on fire. Predatory Sparrow, which often goes by its Farsi name, Gonjeshke Darande, in an effort to appear as a homegrown hacktivist organization, announced in a post on on its X account Wednesday that it had targeted the Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex, accusing the exchange of enabling sanctions violations and terrorist financing on behalf of the Iranian regime. According to cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic, the hackers destroyed more than $90 million in Nobitex holdings, a rare instance of hackers burning crypto assets rather than stealing them. “Associating with regime terror financing and sanction violation infrastructure puts your assets at risk.” “Caution: Associating with the regime's instruments for evading sanctions and financing its ballistic missiles and nuclear program is bad for your long-term financial health,” the hackers wrote. Sepah Bank's website was offline yesterday but appeared to be working again today. Nobitex's website was offline today and the company couldn't be reached for comment. As is often in the case in the fog of an unfolding war and its accompanying cyberattacks, what effects Predatory Sparrow's cyberattacks have had remain unclear. But Hamid Kashfi, an Iranian cybersecurity researcher living in Sweden and the founder of the cybersecurity firm DarkCell, says he has heard from contacts in Iran that Sepah's online banking and ATMs have been offline since the attacks began, causing widespread disruption to civilians' ability to access their funds. “It just seems to be straight up causing damage and chaos. I can't think of what other logic would be behind it. But they do for millions of regular joes and civilians as well.” “The hackers clearly have political rather than financial motivations,” says Tom Robinson, Elliptic's cofounder. Elliptic also confirmed in its blog post about the attack that crypto tracing shows Nobitex does in fact have links with sanctioned IRGC operatives, Hamas, Yemen's Houthi rebels, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group. The hackers, who are widely believed to have links to Israel's military or intelligence agencies, have for years targeted Iran with an intermittent barrage of carefully planned attacks on the country's critical infrastructure. The group has targeted Iran's railways with data-destroying attacks and twice disabled payment systems at thousands of Iranian gas stations, triggering nationwide fuel shortages. Exactly why Predatory Sparrow has now turned its attention to Iran's financial sector—whether because it sees those financial institutions as the most consequential or merely because its banks and crypto exchanges were vulnerable enough to offer a target of opportunity—remains unclear for now, says John Hultquist, chief analyst on Google's threat intelligence group and a longtime tracker of Predatory Sparrow's attacks. Almost any conflict, he notes, now includes cyberattacks from hacktivists or state-sponsored hackers. But the entry of Predatory Sparrow in particular into this war suggests there may yet be more to come, with serious consequences. “This actor is very serious and very capable, and that's what separates them from many of the operations that we'll probably see in the coming weeks or months,” Hultquist says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran's largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, said Wednesday that it was hacked and funds have been drained from its hot wallet. Pro-Israel hacking group Predatory Sparrow (also known in Farsi as “Gonjeshke Darande”) took credit for the cyberattack. A day earlier, the hacking group also claimed responsibility for a hack on Iran's Bank Sepah resulting in widespread outages at ATMs across the country. News of the cyberattacks comes as Israel and Iran attack each other's cities. It's not clear who is behind Predatory Sparrow, which first appeared in 2021, but the hacking group has targeted Iranian organizations with destructive cyberattacks in the past, and broadly appears aligned with Israeli interests.

Researchers from the Lincoln Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are showing the world that there are still plenty of new innovations to come in the world of 3D printing. We've reviewed really fun 3D printers like the Cocoa Press that 3D prints chocolate, but this is the first time we've seen anyone 3D print with glass. The thought of parsing hot material like molten glass through a machine sounds unreasonable to manage, and that's because it is. That's why the team at MIT developed a new technique that allows the team to produce glass structures at a much lower temperature. They hope that the new development makes it easier for people to manufacture a wide variety of glass devices, giving examples like high-temperature electronic components and microfluidic systems. This material apparently resolves stability concerns found in other filaments while still allowing for flexibility when it comes to structural versatility. This inorganic composite glass is made of inorganic materials, with nanoparticles and silicate solution confirmed by the team as part of those materials. Once the glass filament has been printed, it's placed in an oil bath where the temperature is then raised to 250°C. An organic solvent is then used to clean any residue from the print. We don't expect to see glass filament on the shelves anytime soon, but it's exciting to know this possibility is out there and being actively pursued.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HDR needs to be embraced 'from day one, not as an afterthought,' seems like sage advice. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. We are well aware of social media rage farming, but a coolly considered, in-depth new technical blog by Alexander Mejia, agrees that Mario Kart World was developed using “an SDR-first content pipeline with a last-minute HDR tonemap that limits the color and dynamic range.” Mejia is probably one of the leading authorities on creating HDR visual experiences, based on his experience in delivering “the world-leading Dolby Vision HDR experience to Xbox Series X and Unreal Engine.” In fairness, the developers of Mario Kart World have set themselves up for this stinging criticism, as the flagship launch title is marketed with boasts of it supporting 4K resolution at 60FPS refresh with HDR visuals (4K60 HDR for short). However, “Mario Kart World reveals that even the highest caliber of developers aren't taking HDR seriously,” reckons Mejia. That tripping up over HDR isn't uncommon, though. If you are curious about how Mejia captured, reviewed, and assessed the Mario Kart World on Switch 2, he shares the full details of his hardware and capture path, the procedure, and tips for home users wishing to achieve similar insight. A particularly stark result comes from image brightness peak measurement. “Not a good sign that they took HDR seriously.” Also, it was observed that, even if the console brightness is cranked to 10,000 nits, “captured peaks in game never exceed ~950 nits.” That's quite a discrepancy. Above: Both Godfall Ultimate Edition on XBOX Series X (left), and Mario Kart World on Nintendo Switch 2 (right) are captured in HDR, with 10,000 nits max brightness. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. In short, it looks like even the best developers are not taking HDR seriously, seem to follow an SDR-first workflow, and are thus squandering the possibilities of modern consoles and TVs (or monitors). The HDR expert finishes up by cannily touting his studio consultancy, offering help with “HDR first rendering pipelines, Dolby Vision integration, and dynamic tone-mapping strategies.” Keep that in mind as you ponder his findings.

Nvidia's Blackwell architecture touts support for a raft of AI-powered "neural rendering" features. Among the more interesting of these is neural texture compression, or NTC. As developers pursue more realistic gaming experiences, texture sizes have also grown, creating more pressure on limited hardware resources like VRAM. An enthusiast has now demoed texture compression tech in action on both Nvidia and Intel test systems, demonstrating massive improvements in compression, a feature that will ultimately allow developers to do more with less VRAM, or to enable more features within the same GPU memory capacity. To enable neural rendering features like these, Nvidia, Microsoft, and other vendors have worked together to create a DirectX feature called Cooperative Vectors that gives developers fine-grained access to the matrix acceleration engines in modern Nvidia, Intel, and AMD GPUs. NTC hasn't appeared in a shipping game yet, but the pieces are coming together. The textures decompressed via NTC for this example are visibly crisper and sharper relative to those using the block compression method commonly employed today. At least on Compusemble's system, which includes an RTX 5090, the average pass time required increases from 0.045ms to 0.111ms at 4K, or an increase of 2.5x. Even so, that's a tiny portion of the overall frame time. Dramatically, NTC without Cooperative Vectors enabled requires a shocking 5.7 ms of pass time, demonstrating that Cooperative Vectors and matrix engines are essential for this technique to be practical. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Nvidia's demo shows the benefits of NTC for VRAM usage. As with Intel's dinosaur demo, there's a small computational cost to enabling NTC, but that tradeoff seems well worth it in exchange for the more efficient usage of fixed resources that the technique enables. Overall, these demos show that neural texture compression could have dramatic and exciting benefits for developers and gamers, whether that's reducing VRAM pressure for a given scene or increasing the visual complexity possible within a set amount of resources. We hope developers begin taking advantage of this technique soon. As the Senior Analyst, Graphics at Tom's Hardware, Jeff Kampman covers everything to do with GPUs, gaming performance, and more.

I think that people sort of look at the two paths and say, ‘Alright, OpenAI's got a really good shot — a much better shot, actually — delivering on [AI] superintelligence and also may eventually be the more valuable company.” As many companies have continued investing billions of dollars in AI hardware over the past few years, they have probably realized that they need equally expensive talent to run them. There have been previous reports that Meta has been losing AI staff despite paying them $2 million annually, with many jumping ship to its rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic. If Altman's claims are correct, it may be that Meta has noticed this and has decided to up the ante and pay so much more for senior AI engineers to join its effort. Because of this, he says people would rather stay at OpenAI, despite the massive amounts of money that Meta is throwing towards its people. OpenAI's people not jumping ship to Meta despite the massive packages it offers makes sense, though. After all, if you're already making more than enough to support your lifestyle and then some, you really don't need the extra money in exchange for the risk you're taking by moving to a different company, especially one that seemingly lags what your current organization has already achieved. Besides, OpenAI and its people are confident that it will be among the first ones, if not the first one, to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), and then AI superintelligence (ASI), which could make it and its people a lot of money — so much more than what Meta can offer. However, Anthropic CEO Darius Amodei has an opposing view about AI development — if the government and society are unprepared, its widespread use can cause unemployment rates to jump to 20% and wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs.

Victoria Aveyard's eyes avoid the camera when she slams her large white binder on the table, weighed down with a 1,000-page draft of her latest work in progress. “Don't use generative-AI to make tropey, regurgitated romantasy sludge that you can then launder through the self-publishing industry in order to backdoor your way into a traditional publishing deal,” Aveyard tells her over 460,000 followers on TikTok in another video posted on May 27. Now, Aveyard and other prolific authors are not only calling out people who use AI to write, they're also posting livestreams and time-lapses of their writing processes to defend themselves against such complaints. “I don't think my voice will move the needle much or convince anyone already using generative AI to stop, but I needed to voice my anger with the circumstances.” But with scammy rewrites and digitally fabricated authors entering the market, artificial intelligence has made searching for human-made content more difficult, causing independent authors to combat what some are calling an AI-generated “witch hunt.” “Sometimes it's hard to conceptualize the scope and scale of work that goes into writing a book, and showing a physical manuscript really helps that hit home,” Aveyard says when asked about the inspiration behind her 1,000-page editing video. “I post regularly on my platforms, and I'm always looking for content that catches the eye as well as emphasizes my work. And getting to emphasize my position on generative AI? An added benefit.” (Aveyard never names any specific indie authors using generative-AI to secure a traditional publishing deal.) Because I think we need to be loud and clear that it's not welcome in this industry.” Some writers are using the AI controversy to remind people of the very human skills it takes to craft a complex story. “Everyone has forgotten what makes a book good, and it's the work that goes into it,” says Menard, who has penned three books independently. Quan Millz, an indie author with over 830,000 TikTok followers and well-known for his jaw-dropping “street lit” titles like Old Thot Next Door and This Hoe Got Roaches in Her Crib, says accusations that he has used AI to write go beyond labeling him as a thief—they underestimate the cultural fluency behind his novels. Prior to revealing his identity on TikTok in 2023, Millz, who is Black, dealt with accusations that he was white and even a rumor that he was a “CIA operative.” “It's clear now that you use AI to write all your books. Millz uses AI to make book covers, including for books that are still in the conceptual phase, but says allegations that he also writes with the tool are false. “There's no way in hell you're going to get any of these AI models to really capture the essence of just how Black people talk,” Millz tells WIRED. The author says he has tested using AI for writing and found that the large language models censored his adult scenes and could not reproduce his nuanced tone. “It doesn't understand that AAVE [African American Vernacular English] is not monolithic … Black people in Chicago don't sound like Black people in New York.” While Millz has hosted a couple of TikTok Lives documenting his writing process in real time, he tells WIRED that he won't be hosting more—even if it helps prove to skeptics that his written work is original. Constantly checking in with commenters hindered his writing process, he says, and he feels that while having a social presence is crucial in indie publishing, filming your process won't provide more proof of AI-free work than your work itself—at least not yet. “When you read AI text, even if you do a good job of trying to edit it or make it your own, there's still something amiss.” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.
