In May of 2023, Warner Bros. released a collection of classic cartoons on Blu-ray through their boutique Warner Archive label that was directly aimed at serious enthusiasts. That set, “Looney Tunes Collector's Choice: Volume 1,” was pure gold for animation fans, featuring 25 cartoons that had never been released on DVD or Blu-ray in remastered form. The positive response from lovers of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig led to three more volumes, each collecting 25 new shorts that were meticulously restored and presented in exquisite transfers. Now, Warner Archive is continuing their mission with “Looney Tunes Collector's Vault: Volume 1,” a set that continues the label's previous work and expands on it. “I decided that instead of releasing a Volume 5 with the same curation criteria we would expand to 2-disc collections,” film historian George Feltenstein, who oversees the Warner Archive label, told IndieWire. Related Stories The Academy Reveals Board of Governors for 2025-2026 You Can Now Debate ‘Megalopolis' (and America's Future) with Francis Ford Coppola “However, the addition of the second disc would contain 25 cartoons that have been available in standard definition on DVD, but had yet to be included remastered in High Definition on a Blu-ray disc.” Among the newly included cartoons are several fan favorites and rarities, including choice selections by legendary director Chuck Jones. Feltenstein said that choosing favorites is difficult since he, in collaboration with animation historian Jerry Beck, selected all the cartoons, but he has particular fondness for the 1945 Jones short “Hare Conditioned.” In this hilarious cartoon, Bugs Bunny faces a threat from a department store manager who wants to get Bugs stuffed in the taxidermy department. “He once told me — and I assume he told this to many — that Bugs Bunny, for him, represented the kind of individual we aspire to be, and that Daffy Duck was the individual we are afraid we're really more like. In addition to his work on the Warner animation collections, Feltenstein oversees a wide array of releases from the studio's live-action catalogue, often putting out pristine releases of classics as well as cult favorites and idiosyncratic oddities. “We are usually working on several dozen releases at any given time, in various stages of production,” Feltenstein. “This requires very close coordination with other departments, so we can make sure that our efforts are synchronized with the company's dedication to preservation efforts.” Right now, the Warner Archive Collection is the only studio-based “boutique” label, dedicated to what physical media collectors want most, and Feltenstein takes his role as curator seriously. “We also have various groups of die-hard enthusiast consumers who each want to make their voices heard loudly about what they want to see released. It's a mission he's been on for over 16 years that has now yielded several thousand releases; given how strong the company's recent releases have been, here's hoping there are thousands more to come.

Following a highly successful run in China, where it topped TV ratings and became the most-streamed TV series throughout the country, Wong Kar Wai's 1990s-set drama “Blossoms Shanghai” will stream exclusively in North America on The Criterion Channel. Related Stories Everything Coming to Hulu and Disney+ in July ‘The Daily Show' Clip: Jordan Klepper Heads to Washington for Trump's Birthday Parade Like many of Wong's works, “Blossoms Shanghai” contains strong romantic elements amid real-life historical foundations. It was adapted from the award-winning novel “Blossoms” by Jin Yucheng, which follows China's economic boom during the 1990s as seen through the eyes of Ah Bao, a figure many will come to know as the Jay Gatsby of Shanghai. Starting out as a simple, ordinary man with no standing, Ah soon becomes a self-made millionaire, but must fight to keep his fortune as others seek to destroy him. All three now have a home with The Criterion Collection, with the first two being featured in their “World of Wong Kar Wai” box set. Other films included in this comprehensive collection are “As Tears Go By,” “Days of Being Wild,” “Chungking Express,” “Fallen Angels,” and “Happy Together,” all of which are also now streaming via The Criterion Channel. “In the Mood for Love” will also be returning to theaters this summer to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary. You can catch the Hong Kong historical romance starring Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung starting June 27 in NYC at the IFC Center and Film at Lincoln Center, with a national rollout to follow. Criterion will also stream “Blossoms Shanghai” in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand at some point in the near future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russell T Davies says he remains in the dark over Doctor Who‘s future. In a production diary for the latest issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Davies said the BBC‘s iconic sci-fi series will never end, but he was less certain about its immediate future following Season 15. “We don't know what's happening yet, and while everyone works that out, I'll take a pause on this page … Hopefully, we'll have news soon,” the showrunner wrote. BBC Content Chief: Kate Phillips Confirmed As Replacement For Charlotte Moore In Top Job BBC Sets 'California Avenue' Drama Series From Hugo Blick Starring Bill Nighy, Erin Doherty, Helena Bonham Carter & Tom Burke Ncuti Gatwa has confirmed his exit as the Doctor, with the drama ending on an ambiguous note, as Gatwa regenerated into Billie Piper's Rose Tyler. The BBC has not yet made a decision about a renewal, while questions linger over its co-production deal with Disney+, which streams Doctor Who in the U.S. The season averaged 3.2M viewers over its eight episodes, which was half a million viewers down from last year's season — Gatwa's first as the Doctor. Compare Season 15 to Jodie Whittaker's last outing as the Time Lord, and things get grimmer. Deadline has used viewing figures from Barb, the UK's official ratings body. They include on-demand and streaming viewing on televisions, but are not the full picture. Broadcasters and streamers prefer to use 28-day figures, which provide a more conclusive overview. Nonetheless, seven-day viewing is usually directional and the pattern of decline will likely be reflected in Doctor Who's final ratings. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

In an interview with Radio Times, Stewart said he used to know Trump “very, very well,” and they often spent time together when they lived near each other in Florida (“literally half a mile away”). Stewart said one thing he liked about Trump was that he was always “a bit of a man's man,” but quickly added the caveat: “[H]e didn't, as far as I'm concerned, treat women very well.” And he said that since Trump became president, he's turned into “another guy.

Who would you love to have remix your theme? There'se a little giggle in the beginning, and that could be Sabrina, but then Drake could, like, chime in and, you know, say some cool s–t about me. Dominik Mysterio: I would probably go a little bit more traditional Mexican. Fuerza Regida or Adriel Favela, Calle 24, maybe throw in some Mexican OT, too. I mean, looking forward to seeing him around more for sure. I heard it's coming up on your anniversary. Morgan: I don't know that there's anything specific, because Dominik has, like, a very diverse, kind of eclectic music taste like he's everywhere. But, you know, I did learn last summer that he's a Sabrina Carpenter fan and so, you know, just anything Sabrina Carpenter kind of reminds me of Dominik a little bit. You know, she just released “Man Child,” not that song, but, you know, just Sabrina Carpenter in general.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A suicide prevention nonprofit, the Trevor Project was founded in 1998 to address the high rate of mental health problems and suicidal ideation that LGBTQ+ youth face. According to 2024 data from the group, close to 39 percent of queer youth consider attempting suicide, a rate that is heavily impacted by anti-LBTQ+ policies and administrations. Trevor Project CEO Jaymes Black announced Wednesday that the group has been given a stop work notice ending its “Press 3” program with the federal government. Introduced in 2022, the “Press 3 option” allowed Suicide & Crisis Lifeline callers to be connected with a mental health counselor who specialized in LGBTQ+ issues and concerns. “Counselors who supported the press three option were trained specifically to support LGBTQ+ young people, because having someone who truly understands the unique needs and challenges of LGBTQ+ young people isn't just helpful. It can be the difference between saving a life or losing one,” Black said in a video statement. “When a questioning youth calls because they're terrified and they're alone, they need someone who can say, ‘You are not broken, you are loved exactly as you are.' When a transgender teenager calls because they're being bullied at school and contemplating suicide, they need someone who knows that their identity isn't a phase to be counseled away.” Young people who require help will still be able to contact The Trevor Project directly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kesha just can't get enough in the video for her new single, “Boy Crazy.” Perhaps the most memorable scene in the project — which also featured direction from Brett Loudermilk and Zain Curtis — comes at the very end, with Kesha looking angelic as she breastfeeds a grown man wearing nothing but his underwear. “Bikers and the dumb bros, daddies and the gym hoes/ Prowling like a kitty cat, I want to get you all alone.” Following singles “Joyride,” “Delusional” and “Yippee-Ki-Yay,” “Boy Crazy” marks the latest release from Kesha's upcoming album, . The LP will be the artist's first under her own independent label after finishing her contract with Kemosabe Records, which ended after a now-settled legal battle with founder Dr. Luke over Kesha's claims that he drugged and raped her at a 2005 party — all of which he has vehemently denied. Kesha has been open about how reclaiming control over her career has been both emotional and fulfilling, with the singer telling Jennifer Hudson in May, “It's been all of my vision, all of my words, a lot of hard work, a lot of joy … Really coming back home to myself and feeling what freedom really looks like, feels like, sounds like.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In line with that, it made notable headlines on Wednesday, unveiling a carriage deal with French broadcaster TF1 at Cannes Lions that will see Netflix offering live broadcasts and on-demand content from the partner starting in the summer of 2026. “This is a first-of-its-kind partnership that plays to our strengths of giving audiences the best entertainment alongside the best discovery experience,” said Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix. How much of a game-changer the TF1 deal presents was a topic of industry discussion following the news, with several analysts predicting that more carriage and aggregation agreements in its vein would follow. The series, Tout Pour La Lumière (All for Light), a family series set in the world of music and dance, became available on Netflix late last week before its free-to-air debut on TF1, along with its TF1+ platform, this week. So maybe they will wait first to see how it goes in France.” PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore tells THR that for Netflix, the TF1 deal “makes perfect sense given its direction of travel.” He explains: “It is pivoting towards a platform for entertainment, and it was only a question of time before we saw typically big hits being streamed on the platform.” For broadcasters and others, collaborating with the global streamer is also appealing. “For free-to-air broadcasters, it gives them a new lease on life, for Netflix, a broad range of programming, and users [get] reduced fragmentation by having more in one place.” The PP Foresight expert sees more deals ahead, adding: “This is the start, and we will now see a chain reaction with others looking to replicate this deal.” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also forecasts more Netflix carriage deals in the future, telling THR: “They are trying to be a platform and be the starting point for any viewing.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a move that could change the video landscape, YouTube will integrate Google's most advanced AI video generation tool, Veo 3, into YouTube Shorts later this summer. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced the integration in a keynote at the Cannes Lions festival Wednesday, where he was joined by YouTube creators Amelia Dimoldenberg, Alex Cooper, and Brandon Baum. YouTube Aims to Democratize Branded Content Just Like It Did With Videos Creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream — as brand ambassadors, big business ventures and visionary storytellers,” he continued. “Communities will continue to surprise us with the power of their collective fandom. And cutting-edge AI technology will push the limits of human creativity. My biggest bet is that YouTube will continue to be the stage where it all happens. The company has also been proactive in trying to get ahead of potential issues or controversies, including partnering with CAA and some top creators to develop a tool that gives celebrities and other high-profile people control over their likeness on the platform. Already videos created by Veo 3 have gone viral on social platforms, including concepts that imagine if historical or fictional figures were vloggers, though Mohan framed it's integration into shorts a tool to “open new creative lanes” for creators. Shorts has become a strategic imperative for YouTube as platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels also battle for shares of the short-form video audience. YouTube launches Shorts in 2021, and Mohan revealed Wednesday that it now averages more than 200 billion views per day, an astonishing number that underscores YouTube's scale in streaming video. “Like most startups, these creators are reimagining the industry that inspired them and creating new jobs for writers, editors, actors and producers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justin Bieber rang in his first Father's Day as a dad on Sunday, June 15, sharing glimpses of his celebration with wife Hailey and their 9-month-old son Jack Blues Bieber across social media. The “Baby” singer kicked off his Father's Day posts with his signature humor, sharing a selfie featuring a fake tiny hand giving the middle finger. “I'm a dad that's not to be [expletive] with,” Justin captioned the photo. His celebration included an impressive haul of luxury gifts, including an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch valued at $38,000, two Prada backpacks, and a new Apple laptop. The singer playfully captioned his gift photo with “Happy daddy day to me u lil ho.” Justin would document their romantic getaway on Instagram. Little Jack even sported a gold bracelet featuring his initials “JBB,” adding a touch of baby bling to the festivities. Some outlets claimed Hailey “snubbed” Justin by not posting on Instagram for Father's Day. However, the couple clearly celebrated together based on Justin's numerous posts showing their family time. Hailey's distinctive engagement ring was visible in the piano photos. She also shared one of the images on her own Instagram Story, further confirming their quality moments together. A source close to the family told People shortly after the birth that Justin was already “great” at being a dad. The pregnancy was something that they very much wished and prayed for.” During a February 2025 charity hockey game, he told reporters he wanted to get Jack on the ice “as soon as possible,” joking, “It's never too early.” For her part, Hailey recently described motherhood as the “wildest, coolest thing I've ever done” in an Instagram post marking International Women's Day. The couple, who married in September 2018, continue to navigate parenthood together while sharing selective glimpses of their growing family with fans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amy Jo Johnson is honoring the memory of her late “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” co-star Jason David Frank with a heartfelt tribute. A post shared by Amy Jo Johnson (@atothedoublej) The 90's star captioned the post, “💕 thank you to whoever it was who gave me this photo at Niagara. 🦋,” Johnson captioned the image, which shows her smiling beside Frank. Frank, who portrayed Tommy Oliver on the beloved 1990s series, died by suicide in November 2022 at age 49, as reported by Deadline. Through tears, she said, “I just came on here because I was feeling really sad and really it's really hitting home today what had happened and that he's gone. I just thought of all of you guys because I know how much you all meant to him and how much you guys are probably in the same amount of pain and so sad.” She went on to describe Frank as “such a force and such a bright, bright, crazy, wild, funny light. Before ending the livestream with a song, Johnson delivered a powerful message to anyone struggling with their mental health. “Anybody who is out there who is feeling depressed and like there's no hope, just know that that's not the way and there is help and you do have a community here,” she said. Reach out for help if you are feeling like that. Sorry for the swearing, but it really f—— sucks. At the end of her livestream, Johnson added, “I know how much you all meant to Jason, and it sucks. Jason David Frank was a mainstay in the “Power Rangers” franchise and a fan-favorite at conventions around the world. His legacy continues to resonate deeply with fans and co-stars alike.</p>
