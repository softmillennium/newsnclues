                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, are investigating an apparent break-in at the home of state Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was shot and killed at the house with her husband, Mark Hortman, early Saturday in what Gov. Tim Walz called “a politically motivated assassination.” “The home appeared to have been searched by an unknown individual; however, the family has indicated that they don't believe anything is missing,” Brooklyn Park Police said in a news release. Any evidence related to the Hortmans' shooting deaths had already been removed from the house by crime scene investigators, according to police. Brooklyn Park Police are looking into the break-in, and crime scene investigators returned to the house to gather evidence. Police are asking neighbors to check surveillance cameras and report anything suspicious. Prosecutors say Vance Boelter, dressed like a police officer, visited the homes of at least four Minnesota lawmakers, shooting and killing Hortman, the top Democrat in the Minnesota House, and her husband, as well as shooting and severely wounding state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Officials said Boelter, 57, had an hit list of dozens of targets, which were largely Democrats or figures with ties to Planned Parenthood or the abortion rights movement. The search for Boelter lasted 43 hours and was the largest manhunt in Minnesota history. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We are carrying out military strikes today,” Cruz said in an interview. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was caught stumbling to answer basic questions about Iran and the U.S.'s role in Israel's war in an eye-opening interview airing Wednesday, despite his full-throated support for overthrowing the Iranian government and deeper U.S. involvement in the fighting. “We are carrying out military strikes today,” Cruz said. This directly contradicts what federal officials have said about the U.S.'s involvement. The State Department has said that Israel's strikes are “unilateral,” and directed all embassies and consular posts to reiterate that claim in a cable, CBS reported on Sunday. The cable instructed officials to emphasize to their respective host governments that the U.S. “is not involved in Israel's unilateral action against targets in Iran and did not provide tanker support.” This position has not changed in recent days, as the strikes have intensified and President Donald Trump openly mulls becoming more deeply involved in the war. “American forces are maintaining their defensive posture, and that has not changed. We will defend American interests,” said spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer on Tuesday. Officials have been open about the U.S.'s defensive positions in helping to strike down missiles fired at Israel. However, direct U.S. involvement in conducting strikes on Iran, as Cruz suggests is happening, would be a major escalation of the war. If you're saying the United States government is at war with Iran right now, people are listening!” It's possible that Cruz is suggesting deeper U.S. involvement to push the Trump administration into striking Iran, as many conservative lawmakers have done in recent days — in hopes of pushing the dangerous pipe dream of regime change in Iran. “I think it is very much in the interest of America to see regime change,” Cruz told Fox News on Sunday. Despite his confidence that he could install a better government in Iran, earlier in the interview, Cruz is caught unable to even name basic facts about Iran's population. In a follow up, Carlson says, “okay, what's the ethnic mix of Iran?” When Carlson asks what proportion of the population is Persian, Cruz becomes incensed. “I'm not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran,” Cruz says sarcastically, his voice raised. Carlson's interview circulated widely online for exposing Cruz's blasé ignorance of the country he wants to wage war against. Early on, Carlson was a proponent of the U.S.'s invasion, and only changed his mind later because of racist beliefs that Iraq and Afghanistan aren't “worth invading” because “the people aren't civilized.” This is, as commentators have noted, a drastically different approach to anti-interventionism from the left's anti-war and anti-imperialist foundations.

If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. While it is widely known that American progressives overwhelmingly oppose the war on Iran at which President Donald Trump is increasingly hinting, new polling published Tuesday revealed that a thin majority of respondents who voted for the Republican president are also against U.S. involvement in the widening Israel-Iran war. According to the Economist/YouGov survey of 1,512 U.S. adults conducted between June 13-16, 60% of all respondents oppose U.S. involvement in the war, while just 16% supported military action and 24% were unsure. In fact, a majority of respondents across all gender, race, age, and income categories opposed military action against Iran.

NEW Economist/YouGov Jun 13-16: Israel-Iran % who think the U.S. military should | shouldn't get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran U.S. adult citizens 16% | 60% Democrats 15% | 65% Independents 11% | 61% Republicans 23% | 53% today.yougov.com/politics/art…[image or embed] The survey also found that more Republican-identified respondents supported U.S. negotiations with Iran than did Democrats, 61% to 58%. Fifty-six percent of all those surveyed back talks, while 18% oppose negotiations. Reflecting disenchantment among people who voted for Trump because they believed his claim to be a “peace president,” Trump's favorite pollster, Rich Baris, director of Big Data Poll — who calls neoconservative Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) “war whores” — warned of dire electoral consequences should the U.S. go to war. The poll also found that a strong majority of Iranian Americans want a new nuclear agreement that prevents Iran from developing nuclear weapons. While there were hopes of a renewed deal during the tenure of former U.S. President Joe Biden, no agreement was reached, and Iranians continue to suffer under economic sanctions that critics have said are killing people and crippling the country's economy. “Regardless, these results reinforce what we already know — our community is overwhelmingly against war and demands a foreign policy rooted in diplomacy, not destruction. We will share additional results from this timely survey next week.” “If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump said during a March NBC News interview. Legislation that would compel Trump to get congressional approval to attack Iran under the War Powers Resolution of 1973 was introduced Tuesday by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and co-sponsored by at least 14 mostly progressive Democrats, while Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have introduced similar measures in the Senate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday and speculated about appointing himself to lead the U.S. central bank. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday knocked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for what he expected would be a decision not to lower interest rates and said the man he put in the role during his last term had done a poor job. Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, mused about appointing himself to lead the U.S. central bank, based on his dissatisfaction with Powell. “Maybe I should go to the Fed,” Trump said. “Am I allowed to appoint myself at the Fed? I'd do a much better job than these people.” Trump has long criticized Powell and sparked market concern earlier this year when he suggested the central bank chief's termination couldn't come fast enough. Trump has since walked back from that rhetoric, saying he would not fire Powell before his term as chair ends next year, but he has not held back on his broader criticism and has made clear that he will not ask Powell to stay on as the central bank's leader. I don't know why that is, but I guess maybe he was a Democrat ... he's done a poor job,” Trump said. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 28 people have been killed and 140 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported on June 18 that search and rescue operations in the Solomianskyi district lasted more than 39 hours, involving over 400 State Emergency Service rescuers and 200 pieces of equipment. Initial data from Ukraine's National Police cited 15 dead and 124 injured, but the death toll was revised several times — first down to 10, then up to 16 by the State Emergency Service. Early on June 18, more victims were found under the rubble of one residential building, raising the number of fatalities to 23. The almost nine-hour-long strike saw Moscow's forces launch large numbers of kamikaze attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukraine's capital. The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed that Russia launched 472 aerial weapons overnight, including nearly 280 Shahed-type attack drones and two Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Air defenses also intercepted one Kinzhal missile, while another was reportedly lost from radar tracking. President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault "one of the most horrifying attacks on Kyiv," saying more than 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched across Ukraine overnight. "Such attacks are pure terrorism," he said in a statement on social media. Zelensky confirmed that damage had been reported in eight districts of Kyiv, with emergency workers still searching for survivors beneath the rubble of a destroyed apartment block. In a video posted on Telegram, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said cluster munitions had been found in one area of the city. He later added that June 18 would be an official day of mourning in Kyiv. Many of the deaths and injuries occurred when a Russian missile hit a nine-storey residential building in the Solomianskyi district, "completely destroying" one section, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. "I saw the missile because it was low," Olena Kushnirova, a 46-year-old  nurse who lives in a neighboring building to the one that was hit, told the Kyiv Independent. "I grabbed my daughter by the hand and shouted 'run!' We ran to the toilet, and then there was a very powerful explosion." Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also condemned the attack, calling it a "massive and brutal strike" timed deliberately to coincide with the G7 summit. He sends a signal of total disrespect to the United States and other partners who have called for an end to the killing," Sybiha said. "Only strong steps and real pressure on Moscow can prove him wrong." "People started running outside, shouting, some in panic, because the attack wasn't over yet. Drones struck the institute's 10th floor and broke windows on three other floors. At least one woman was injured and multiple homes were damaged, according to the regional administration. The company announced it was forced to cancel all current orders and suspend new ones indefinitely following the destruction of its Kyiv site. Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) freight train carrying grain. Several railcars overturned, temporarily halting operations and spilling grain from the damaged wagons. Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national postal service, reported the destruction of two of its branches in Kyiv during the attack, according to CEO Ihor Smiliansky. The company's team is working to "quickly restore services," he said. The attack followed a series of drone strikes overnight on June 16 targeting Kyiv Oblast, including both the capital and surrounding settlements. In the Obukhiv district, a 60-year-old man was injured, according to regional authorities. Russian attacks against Ukraine have intensified in May and June, with Moscow launching several record-breaking mass strikes against Kyiv and other cities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nippon Steel has finalized its deal to buy 100% of US Steel, the iconic steelmaker that was once the world's most valuable company and a cornerstone of American industrial might. Under the terms of the deal ﻿first announced in December 2023, Nippon will buy US steel for $55 per share, or $14.1 billion. The company will also retain its name and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania headquarters. That includes giving President Donald Trump veto power over any decision to idle plants, reduce production or staffing levels. Despite the terms disclosed Tuesday, the acquisition comes despite Trump's past opposition the deal, saying he would only allow it because it was an “investment” by Nippon, not an outright purchase. “It's an investment, and it'll be a partial ownership (by Nippon),” Trump said last month, days after announcing he would approve the deal. The deal was previously blocked by President Joe Biden in his final weeks in office, citing national security grounds, and it was opposed by Trump when he was on the campaign trail. But once Trump took office, he said Nippon improved the deal and promised additional investment totaling $14 billion in the company's facilities, although only $11 billion in investment through 2028 is in the agreement Nippon and US Steel signed with the US government. “I'm going to be watching over it. Trump went on to say that US would keep its blast furnaces operating at full capacity for at least the next decade, and there would be “no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.” In a statement Sunday it questioned the promises and protections that the deal provides, even with Trump and future presidents having veto power over some moves. “Perhaps the historic “USS” logo will remain, but it seems it will be no more than a smoke screen to allow a wholly-owned privately held subsidiary of a Japanese corporation to be called ‘American. US Steel was once a symbol of American industrial dominance. It was also crucial to the US economy throughout much of the 20th century providing the steel needed to build cars, appliances, bridges and skyscrapers, as well as weapons that helped win War War II. But it has suffered through decades of decline since its post-World War II height. It is no longer even the largest US steelmaker, and a relatively minor employer, with 14,000 US employees — 11,000 of whom are members of the USW.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We were far more acquainted with drops in demand from repeated stock market bubbles and financial crises. As both the U.S.-led global order and market liberalization were ascendant, it was not supply chain disruptions and oil prices that posed the greatest threat to people's livelihoods, but the interrelated challenges of asset bubbles, currency crises and sovereign defaults, all of which are primarily demand-side risks. It is rather astonishing how stark this pattern was in that period. What these events had in common was that, in each case, an asset value collapsed, and the loss of wealth induced people and businesses to cut back their purchases, slowing economic activity. Unlike supply side shocks, demand shocks are not inflationary (prices do not rise if no one wants to buy things), and thus pose a far simpler challenge for central banks and finance ministries looking to get the economy back on track. If the leaders at the G7 summit this week were under any illusions that this was still the world we lived in, Israel's unprecedented strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and key military officials last week should have jolted them out of it. Iran's leader rejects call to surrender, says U.S. intervention would cause ‘irreparable damage' Because oil, and energy more broadly, is a critical input to all production of goods and services, large oil price increases are the quintessential supply shock. Experts do not see these events as likely yet, but U.S. President Donald Trump's increasing willingness to get his country involved militarily is forcing Iran into a corner with fewer and fewer options. But as geopolitical tension rises, so does its twin problem – the elevated risk of supply side shocks. This was somewhat common before the nineties, as repeated wars and political crises in the Middle East put crude supplies at perpetual risk. But modern day Europeans are also familiar with this problem, since shipments of Russian gas halted from when Russia invaded Ukraine, sending European energy prices skyrocketing in 2022. Even Canada considered halting oil shipments in its trade war with the U.S. When international relations sour, energy supplies are among the first to go. Opinion: For all the importance of G7, Canada's fortunes truly lie with China and India China controls well over half the world's supply of rare earth metals, which serve as crucial inputs for everything from cars to computer chips, and around 85 per cent of processing capacity. Semiconductor chips are the key component in nearly all modern electronics, and more than 60 per cent of all semiconductors are manufactured in Taiwan, most by a single company. A war over, or blockade of, Taiwan could easily send prices soaring and grind production of many dependent goods and services to a halt. That we have returned to an era of politically driven supply side risks only adds increased urgency for our global leaders to work toward a more stable foreign-policy framework.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Ambassador to Israel and the S. Daniel Abraham Professor of Middle East Policy Studies at Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs. STEVEN N. SIMON is a Visiting Professor and Distinguished Fellow at Dartmouth College. It has also evidently avoided striking fuel-storage facilities for fear of unleashing a public health crisis. That means that the outcome of the war will depend as much on decisions made by U.S. President Donald Trump as it will on further Israeli airstrikes. But Trump should not enter the war as a combatant on Israel's side. The United States does have an interest in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. In 2015, it secured an agreement with Iran that would have blocked the Islamic Republic's quest for that for at least a decade, if not longer. Washington believed that negotiating an outcome in which Iran had a stake would be a more durable solution, and much less expensive than opting for war. It is no more in Washington's interest now than it was in 2015 to go to war for a result that could be achieved with far less risk through negotiations. If Israel is determined to substantially damage Fordow, the Israel Defense Forces could do so by sending troops to Iran or by making it impossible to enter the facility or relocate centrifuges there. Achieving either goal, however, would be tricky and costly, and it is understandable that Israel would want to outsource the job to the Americans. Iran would almost certainly retaliate by killing American civilians. U.S. involvement would pose risks for the president's political agenda, as well. And the U.S. president needs to act strategically if he wants to save any portion of his substantial investments in Middle East peace—and prevent the war from incapacitating the United States' ability to meet other consequential challenges in Europe and Asia. Then, on Tuesday, Trump debuted much more hawkish language, calling for Iran's “unconditional surrender,” threatening to kill Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and using “we” when describing Israel's attacks. Trump is preternaturally cautious about taking military action, and even the prospect of U.S. casualties on these ships or bases—and opposition from Gulf monarchies who will become targets themselves—will give him pause. But Iran's conventional response options are dwindling fast, and more direct U.S. involvement would likely lead Tehran to undertake asymmetric actions—terrorist attacks—against Israelis, Jews, and Americans worldwide. Influential elements of Trump's MAGA base, such as the broadcaster Tucker Carlson, are already warning him not to reverse course on his “America first” policy. These supporters do not want him to supply Israel with arms, let alone send U.S. forces or aircraft to fight in the Middle East alongside Israel. Trump has pushed back against these critics, but they are not conceding the point; a cadre of Republicans in Congress are also counseling restraint. And once his conservative opposition senses broader public support, the free pass Trump has enjoyed from congressional Republicans may well be revoked on other issues important to him. If a rancorous debate breaks out over Middle East policy, Republican discord could, in particular, threaten the passage of Trump's signature “big beautiful bill.” And it would revive concerns about the United States' military adventures in the region. Even if the Trump administration helps Israel incapacitate the Fordow facility, it will be immensely difficult to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop his military campaign before he is convinced that Iran's nuclear program cannot easily or quickly be reconstituted. In the past, Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies have estimated that after intense attacks against Iran's key nuclear facilities, the Islamic Republic could reestablish its program in about a year. Netanyahu has talked about destroying the program entirely, but in the absence of U.S. intervention, he has not defined a realistic and realizable way to achieve that goal. It is thus unclear whether even a medium to long-term disabling of Iran's nuclear program would satisfy Netanyahu. To do this, he will need to mobilize a multilateral effort to keep nuclear-related material out of Iran's hands, develop a negotiating strategy that takes advantage of the weakness that Iran has shown in the recent fighting, and conclude a credible agreement that effectively ends Iran's quest for a nuclear weapons capability. If Trump puts outright pressure on Israel to stop its aerial strikes, Israel's supporters in both U.S. political parties will rise in protest, imperiling the rest of his political agenda. But if Trump attempts to simply sit the war out, it will grind on with unpredictable consequences. Until now, Trump has combined tough rhetoric and threats with the demand that Iran return to the negotiating table and accept a deal that excludes any uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. Only a determined American president can pull off this complex, coercive diplomatic effort. First, the president's senior military and intelligence advisers need to engage with Israel and seek agreement on a battle damage assessment that would judge whether enough damage has been done to Iran's nuclear program to justify stopping Israel's attacks. This assessment would factor in the Israeli assassinations of key Iranian military leaders, nuclear scientists, engineers, and administrators, as well as the damage inflicted on infrastructure. The fact that even future Israeli strikes are likely to leave Fordow's centrifuge halls and Iran's uranium hexafluoride storage site more or less intact will make this a difficult conversation. But the Trump administration must persuade Israel that Iran's capabilities can be adequately hobbled without destroying Fordow or continuing its attacks indefinitely. Second, Trump must work with Netanyahu to define an end goal for the war that can be achieved quickly: a significant and specific measure of destruction of Iran's existing nuclear facilities and stockpile. Netanyahu's goals, thus far, appear much broader—the total destruction of Iran's nuclear program and, increasingly, regime change. Netanyahu must be advised that he cannot expect U.S. support for a policy aimed at regime change. An all-out effort along the lines of Operation Staunch—an embargo launched in the 1980s that weakened Iran's hand in its war with Iraq—would probably be required. If progress can be made on these elements of the strategy, the United States should then draft a UN Security Council resolution proposing a cease-fire plan. If negotiations toward a deal do resume, Trump needs to take a realistic approach, accepting that his deal may end up looking more like a strengthened version of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement than something brand new. Insisting that Iran forgo enriching any uranium at all on its soil—a stance Trump's negotiators had taken after much back and forth—makes sense at the outset of resumed talks. But it will be very difficult for Trump to sustain that position given Iran's entrenched stance on enrichment. It will also be enormously difficult for Netanyahu—who has exposed Israel to punishing Iranian missile barrages with the aim of destroying Iran's program altogether—to concede both the survival of the Islamic Republic and any prospect of enrichment in Iran. A major multilateral push to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions will divert intelligence resources important to other targets, especially China and Russia, and probably necessitate a reversal of planned cuts to the U.S. intelligence apparatus. And any nuclear deal with Iran that allows the country to participate in uranium enrichment even outside its own territory will require Trump to spend political capital with his base. But these risks are worth it to avoid renewed war. Israel's attack has already created a strategic shift in the Middle East. Once this war is over, Trump can turn his attention to a goal he has already articulated: translating that strategic transformation into the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states. But if Trump dithers—or, worse, fully joins Israel's war—he will destroy his ability to broker a more peaceful Middle East, an aim he has repeatedly stressed is precious to him. He must act, and in the right way, before Israel's appetite for regime change leads to another “forever war”—and before the logic of escalation leads Iran to shift from launching missiles to launching terror attacks, including against Americans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australia has, for the first time, imposed sanctions on Russia's so-called "shadow fleet" of oil tankers, targeting 60 vessels used to circumvent international sanctions and sustain the Kremlin's war effort in Ukraine, the Australian government said on June 18. Australia's Foreign Ministry said the sanctioned vessels operate under "deceptive practices, including flag-hopping, disabling tracking systems and operating with inadequate insurance," enabling illicit Russian oil trade that undermines international sanctions. "Russia uses these vessels to circumvent international sanctions and sustain its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine," the ministry said in a statement. With this move, Australia has now sanctioned more than 1,400 Russian individuals and entities since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, the government said. According to a recent study by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), Russia currently operates 435 tankers outside the control of Western regulators to evade sanctions such as the G7-EU price cap on Russian oil. These vessels are typically un- or underinsured and pose a rising environmental risk due to their age and operational opacity. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the new measures also target hybrid threats and human rights violations, with more sanctions under consideration. Some EU member states and observers have criticized the package for lacking stronger provisions to disrupt Russia's sanction evasion schemes. Now, the EU seeks to approve its 18th sanctions package, which will add 77 more shadow fleet vessels to comply with the cap to prevent Russia from circumventing sanctions and propose imposing a ban on imports of petroleum products made from Russian oil. The United States has signaled reluctance to pursue additional sanctions despite Moscow's continued aggression in Ukraine and rejection of ceasefire proposals supported by Western allies.</p>

The company, which claims 104 million monthly users in the EU, did not devote enough resources to content moderation to take down illegal goods on sale on its platform, regulators said. The official added: “General measures they have in place to avoid the dissemination of illegal products do not work properly – it shows a systemic failure.” The European Commission said these were preliminary findings, pending further investigation and responses from AliExpress. AliExpress also promised greater transparency over its advertising systems and availability of its data to researchers, which Brussels said addressed concerns in these areas. The investigation comes under the DSA, which is intended to protect people from online harms such as disinformation, illegal content and dangerous products. AliExpress said it had “proactively engaged and closely collaborated with the European Commission throughout this process” and would continue to do so. “We are confident that a positive and compliant result will be achieved through continuing our mutual dialogue with the commission to address any remaining concerns on the DSA.” found dangerous and illegal children's toys for sale on several websites including AliExpress. The consumer group bought 23 toys from seven platforms and found problems with more than half the items, including toys from AliExpress that broke into small pieces, or had sharp edges that could puncture a small child's skin. AliExpress said at the time it was working with regulators to prevent non-compliant products from being sold. The European Consumer Organisation, whose members include Which?, welcomed Brussels' actions on Wednesday.</p>

Plus, Alex Padilla makes speech about being handcuffed Don't already get First Thing in your inbox? Israel's war on Iran appeared to be approaching a pivotal moment on Tuesday night after five days of bombing and retaliatory Iranian missile strikes, as Donald Trump demanded “unconditional surrender” from Tehran and weighed his military options. Trump convened a meeting of his national security team in the White House situation room after a day of febrile rhetoric in which the president gave sharply conflicting signals over whether US forces would participate directly in Israel's bombing campaign over Iran. He told journalists in the morning that he expected the Iranian nuclear program to be “wiped out” long before US intervention would be necessary. Later, he took to his own social media platform, Truth Social, to suggest that the US had Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in its bomb-sights, and could make an imminent decision to take offensive action. Some Tehran residents are fleeing the capital, with witnesses citing strong explosions hitting buildings in western and eastern parts of Tehran on Tuesday evening, the Associated Press reports. Alex Padilla took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to deliver a deeply personal speech, formally entering into the congressional record his account of being restrained and forcibly removed as he attempted to ask a question at a press conference held by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, in Los Angeles last week. In a news conference after the arrest, Meg Barnette said she was “extraordinarily proud” of her husband and called the ordeal “shocking and unacceptable.” A federal appeals court on Tuesday seemed ready to keep Donald Trump in control of California national guard troops after they were deployed following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids. US district judge Charles Breyer said Trump had deployed the guard illegally and exceeded his authority. But the administration quickly appealed, and a three-judge appellate panel temporarily paused that order. A volcano in eastern Indonesia has spewed a colossal ash tower into the sky, forcing the cancellation of dozens of flights to and from Bali. Alistair Kitchen was last week detained at Los Angeles airport before being deported back to Melbourne. Federal police have formally accused Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro of presiding over an illegal spying network that allegedly snooped on political rivals, journalists and environmentalists. An analysis published in the journal Heart suggested heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome, 20% higher for stroke, and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Researchers at the University of Toulouse reviewed studies including about 200 million people. But what is behind the “6ft fixation” on dating apps, Leah Harper asks, and could it be blocking true connection? “I've worked with couples where there is a significant height difference and it makes no difference to their physical, emotional or sexual compatibility,” says one relationship therapist. If 312 surface coalmines, closed since 2020, were filled with solar panels and developed into energy plants, the report claims, it could generate enough energy to power Germany.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meanwhile, Iran deploys a hypersonic missile to strike Israel. Contracts to be signed at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), which kicks off on Wednesday, may reach 7.5 trillion rubles ($95.5 billion), marking a 20% rise year-on-year, experts interviewed by Izvestia estimate. More than 20,000 delegates from over 140 nations are planning to attend the forum, running through June 21, with Bahrain enjoying the status of guest country at SPIEF 2025, which will be themed "Shared Values: The Foundation of Growth in a Multipolar World." This year's forum will differ by featuring deeper international cooperation and a more active investment strategy by both regions and individual companies, experts say. The traditional plenary session, to be chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin, will crown SPIEF. Also, events in the format of business dialogues with foreign partners from Africa, Bahrain, India, Iran, China, and EU countries will be held at the forum. The Russian side plans to sign a declaration on strategic cooperation with Indonesia, Ushakov added. A number of nations will be represented by heads of government and ministers, including Hungary's top diplomat Peter Szijjarto, Qatari Finance Minister Ali bin Ahmed Al Kuwari, and Cuban Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment Oscar Perez-Oliva. "While SPIEF 2024 focused on identifying growth points in the evolving multipolar system, SPIEF 2025 will emphasize such shared values as trust, equal rights, and transparency as a foundation to build new international relations amid global fragmentation," Freedom Finance Global analyst Vladimir Chernov noted. Contracts will likely be tied to the expansion of Russian exports, including in the fields of energy and defense, independent expert Andrey Bakhota suggested. "The most valuable agreements at the forum usually involve high-tech services that Russia offers to other nations - in constructing nuclear power plants, maintaining advanced weapons systems, or education," he explained. Bakhota said this year's forum may even yield 8 trillion rubles ($102 billion) worth of contracts. Among other major agreements, Finam expects projects in technological sovereignty, import substitution, digital economy, infrastructure modernization, and enhanced cooperation with partners from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. So far, Trump has not put forward any specific proposals to either Israel or Iran. He reiterated that Tehran should have signed a nuclear deal with the United States. Meanwhile, Trump slammed a statement from French President Emmanuel Macron on why he had to leave the G7 summit even as he called on everybody to "evacuate Tehran," the city with a population of roughly 14 million, minutes before he departed from Canada. According to him, this is how Trump shows his weariness with both Europe and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Since the launch of Operation Rising Lion targeting Iran's nuclear program, over 15,000 centrifuges at Iran's biggest underground enrichment plant in Natanz have been damaged. Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi said there was a possibility of both radiological and chemical contamination within the Natanz facility. Meanwhile, Shlomi Binder, who heads the IDF Intelligence Directorate, told his officers that they will soon "break ground" in other areas of Iran. The conflict between Israel and Iran is escalating rapidly with complete unpredictability, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on June 17. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Israel's attacks on civilian nuclear facilities in Iran are illegal, as they are pushing the world toward a nuclear disaster. Since the latest escalation, Iran has fired more than 400 missiles and hundreds of drones on the Jewish state, IDF Spokeswoman Anna Ukolova told Izvestia. On Tuesday morning, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced a fresh and more devastating wave of missile strikes against Israel, in which it fired a new missile that the Zionist regime failed to detect until it struck. Analysts think Tehran might have used its Fattah hypersonic missile in the attack. Only several countries, namely Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, possess hypersonic missiles, military expert Dmitry Lyamin told Izvestia. "Systems that can not only fly at hypersonic speed but also make maneuvers are considered such weapons today," the expert explained. Exactly how many such missiles Iran has in service is classified, he emphasized. Also, he added, Tehran may have a hypersonic missile not previously disclosed. Global portfolio wealth managers are becoming less fearful of trade wars, the latest survey conducted by Bank of America showed, with US trade talks with Britain and China inspiring their cautious optimism. However, the hostilities between Israel and Iran may now take center stage. Given that BofA's latest survey was conducted before Israel launched a surprise missile attack on Iran, it did not cover the recent escalation in the Middle East. Alyona Nikolayeva, portfolio manager at Astero Falcon, said the latest flare-up may disrupt expectations of a "soft landing of the economy" among most portfolio managers. Even as missile attacks will heighten geopolitical risks, trade war risks will not be automatically pushed aside, portfolio managers interviewed by Kommersant believe. This is because, over the past two years, Iran and Israel have exchanged strikes for a third time already, with the two previous rounds being quite brief and not escalating into a broader conflict. According to Igor Kozak, managing investment director at TKB Investment Partners, a potential blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could be critical for the global economy and markets, pushing oil prices to $130 per barrel. If prices remain at that level for an extended period, a likely outcome in a sustained oil shortage, global inflation will rise, forcing central banks worldwide to return to monetary tightening. In January-May 2025, Russian coal exports unexpectedly returned to growth, despite an unfavorable market situation. Coal supplies to overseas countries saw a 1% year-on-year increase to 81.3 million metric tons, data from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) showed. The growth is attributed to increased exports to China and Turkey, as well as the expansion of trading, CCI analysts note. Over the past three years, Russian coal exports have been declining amid sanctions, issues with railway infrastructure, and falling global commodity prices. This year, Russian coal exports have been rising due to a flexible pricing policy of coal suppliers and a partial reduction in logistics costs, Sergey Suverov, an investment strategist at Aricapital, told Vedomosti. According to Dmitry Baranov, lead expert at Finam Management, the positive trend stems from low market prices that encourage additional purchases and favorable freight rates. Some importers chose to build coal reserves in advance amid emptying warehouses and expectations of a hotter-than-usual summer, he explained. Independent industry expert Maxim Khudalov said that the evolution of trading schemes has enabled Russian companies to circumvent sanctions barriers and increase supplies, even though this has reduced export margins. According to the expert, Russia's eastern regions, capable of maintaining exports to China even amid low coal prices, have stronger export prospects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Iran-Israel conflict has pushed Ukraine to the sidelines, as US President Donald Trump is more interested in playing his game in the Persian Gulf, Viktor Medvedchuk, head of the Other Ukraine movement and former leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party banned in Ukraine, said. According to him, Washington is pulling back from pumping Kiev with weapons, as the US sees this as a threat to its own economy. He noted that even Vladimir Zelensky "has realized that the US's incredible generosity is over." "It wasn't hard to predict that the US would abandon Zelensky's Ukraine at the most inconvenient moment for the Kiev regime. In the politician's opinion, it would be more advantageous for European intelligence services to stage a provocation, although they are clearly late to act. "Israel is much more successful in drawing the US into its war with Iran," he noted. Medvedchuk added that Trump is more interested in the conflict in the Middle East, as he is forced to "play by the British rules in Ukraine." "The other option is to play his own risky game in the Persian Gulf. So far, Trump is choosing the second scenario," he stated. Medvedchuk also stressed that, against this backdrop, the US leader "does not want to declare Russia an ‘evil empire,' as he is counting on its mediation in resolving the Iranian issue."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. JEREMY SHAPIRO is Research Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Next week, when European and North American leaders gather in The Hague for the NATO summit, the main topics of discussion will be familiar: transatlantic burden sharing and national defense spending targets. This focus on dollars and euros is understandable given U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for more European contributions, but it misses a more profound question. For over 75 years, NATO has operated under an implicit bargain: the United States leads, and Europe follows. The clearest manifestation of that arrangement is that the post of supreme allied commander for Europe, NATO's top military position, has always been held by an American. During the Cold War, that practice made sense. But today, a changing strategic landscape and the direction of U.S. domestic politics mean that the United States will not fill that role much longer. Not long ago, this would have been considered a fringe position. But according to NBC News, the Trump administration considered whether to give up the commander's role, known as SACEUR, as part of a broader restructuring and cost-cutting initiative. Europe and the United States should use this summit to prepare for a European SACEUR. Opponents of such a move raise several concerns, including the legal and cultural difficulties of putting a European in control of the tens of thousands of U.S. forces still in Europe; the risk that the U.S. nuclear deterrent in Europe may not seem as credible to adversaries if Washington is not in command; and the general lack of European readiness to assume command. In 1949, Europe lay in ruins, and the United States provided not just military leadership but also economic lifelines and political cohesion. Today, the political and economic reality is very different, and yet the asymmetric command structure persists, preventing Europeans from assuming the role they need to take in defending their own continent. The United States, meanwhile, is changing its strategic focus away from Europe. A bipartisan consensus in Washington holds that China is the country's principal long-term challenge, and as a result, American attention and resources are flowing to the Pacific. Perhaps more fundamentally, Americans increasingly believe that Europe should be able to take care of itself. The success of Trump's “America first” movement, not to mention his frequent threats to abandon the defense of Europe, should send a clear message that no matter what steps European governments take regarding defense, the era of U.S. leadership on the continent is coming to an end. European leaders can either prepare for such a change or remain dangerously dependent on a partner whose attention tends to wander. It would be a tangible expression of Europe's willingness to assume responsibility for its own defense. A European commander would not require ending the U.S. role in NATO. It would signal, instead, that Europeans are ready to lead, not just passively follow American commands. As the United States looks to move its focus and resources toward Asia, giving up the commander position would allow the United States to remain part of NATO while also increasing Europe's responsibility for its own defense. Currently, the supreme allied commander wears two hats; he also serves as the head of U.S. European Command, which oversees all U.S. forces in Europe. Because a European commander would lack that authority over the U.S. military presence in Europe, some fear that there would be friction in crisis scenarios. NATO's history is full of examples of shared command structures, such as the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. One possible solution would be for a European commander to be supported by a U.S. deputy commander who would retain authority over American forces, manage nuclear coordination, and ensure compliance with U.S. law. Some argue that only an American general or admiral can effectively command U.S. troops. As in those cases, while a European commander could exercise NATO operational authority, the United States would retain the ultimate authority over its forces. A carefully structured arrangement, including a formal role for the U.S. deputy commander, could ensure compliance with U.S. legal frameworks while maintaining integrated NATO operations. The worry is that NATO's opponents would not believe that the U.S. government would ever support a European supreme allied commander's request for nuclear support. That credibility could be preserved under a European commander with a clear division of responsibilities: the European commander would oversee conventional operations, while nuclear responsibilities remained firmly under U.S. purview through the deputy commander. NATO's established protocols for the use of nuclear weapons would remain fundamentally unchanged. Adversaries would understand that NATO's deterrent remained intact, even as its military leadership evolved. Another objection is that no European exists who has the talent and experience to fill the post of supreme allied commander. American four-star generals and admirals are groomed to lead combatant commands such as the European Command usually after overseeing tens of thousands of forces and handling large-scale multinational and joint operations. By contrast, no European officer today has commanded multinational forces on that scale in decades. No British general, for example, has commanded even a single deployed division (roughly 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers) since 2003 in the Iraq war. The process does not need to be rushed. The current supreme allied commander, U.S. General Christopher Cavoli, assumed the role in July 2022 and will likely hand over the reins to U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Alexus Grynkewich sometime this summer. Coincident with his appointment, the allies should agree at next week's summit that the next SACEUR will be European, as part of the expected progress in European capability development. A multiyear road map could include increased European command roles in NATO operations, expanded joint exercises, and a formal restructuring of the command hierarchy to accommodate shared leadership. For decades, Europe has relied on American leadership not only because of U.S. power but also because doing so absolved Europeans of having to make difficult command decisions, resolved internal European disputes over who would lead within Europe, and helped cement the U.S. presence in Europe. France, Germany, Poland, and others are boosting defense budgets. NATO's own defense planning process is pushing members to close capability gaps. The pieces of a more capable European pillar in NATO are slowly falling into place. What's needed now is a strong signal to adversaries and allies alike that Europe is both paying more and ready to lead. The appointment of a European commander would be that signal. It would place Europe at the center of its own defense while preserving U.S. engagement in a more sustainable form. Do Americans trust Europeans to command the alliance? Do Europeans trust themselves to command, and can they trust one another to agree on who should be the commander? After all, how can Europeans lead if they can't even take command? A NATO that evolves into a partnership of equals, however, will be stronger, more cohesive, and more resilient in the face of future threats. The time to start that evolution is now.
