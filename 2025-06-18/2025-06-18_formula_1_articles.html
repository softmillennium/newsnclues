                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cooldown Room | 'Quote or Nope' with Guenther Steiner 2025 Canadian Grand Prix: Gasly accuses Stroll of pushing him off track Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur explains what went wrong for the Scuderia in Montreal. Charles Leclerc came home fifth and Lewis Hamilton sixth, both inheriting a position thanks to the late retirement of Lando Norris. But Ferrari were not on the pace of Mercedes, Red Bull or McLaren – and that wasn't purely down to the car. Leclerc crashed on Friday in Free Practice 1, which cost him the entirety of FP2 as well. Those questions intensified during the race, with Leclerc querying the decision to put him onto a two-stop strategy. And Ferrari's cause was not helped by Hamilton picking up floor damage after hitting an animal. "And at the end the fight is so tight – I'm not speaking about lap time or race time, I'm speaking about that you can change the position for almost nothing from one weekend to another one. Vasseur added that, with the margins so small in 2025, executing the perfect weekend matters almost more than car set-up or any upgrades a team might bring. But it's the same for everybody, we have to do a better job.” Vasseur hinted that Ferrari would have some small upgrades in Austria – but was keen to stress that sharpening up the operation across the whole weekend would have far bigger an impact than any upgrades. “If we want to achieve, if we want to start from the first rows and to have a clean weekend as [in] Monaco, we need to do a very smooth weekend in terms of execution, and it's where we failed massively in Canada,” he concluded. Ferrari have slipped back to third in the Teams' Championship, 16 points behind Mercedes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Canadian Grand Prix: Gasly accuses Stroll of pushing him off track Yuki Tsunoda gave his honest reflections after ending the Canadian Grand Prix in P12 as he continues to get to grips with the Red Bull. Tsunoda's prospects for race day took a hit on Saturday when he was handed a 10-place grid penalty for overtaking McLaren's Oscar Piastri under red flag conditions in Free Practice 3, meaning that – after qualifying in 11th – he would start from the back of the field. Asked if the result had been the maximum that was possible from where he started – particularly given the traffic that he faced at times – Tsunoda conceded: “Yeah, pretty much, that's it. At least [a] positive is the car performance now, and the pace in the car felt a bit more normal or better than last previous races, so at least there's a bit of motivation there.” Since moving to Red Bull from Racing Bulls at the third race weekend of the season in Japan – as part of a driver swap with Liam Lawson – Tsunoda has been open about the challenge of getting to grips with the RB21, having at one point compared it to “a science room”. While there have been positive moments during this process – with points coming in Bahrain, Miami and Imola – Tsunoda acknowledged in Montreal that it also brings pressure, though admitted that he hopes to use this as an opportunity to prove himself. “[I] lost a lot of time in FP3, especially with the new upgrades when you want to especially learn about the car. [In] these moments I'm having a lot of pressure, sometimes I'm not enjoying them that much but it's part of the time that [is] an opportunity to improve myself and prove myself more.” Tsunoda will be hoping for better when F1 heads to the Red Bull Ring for his team's home event, the Austrian Grand Prix, on June 27-29.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Canadian Grand Prix: Gasly accuses Stroll of pushing him off track Nico Hulkenberg converted his P11 grid slot to an eighth-place finish in Canada, as he scored more vital points for Kick Sauber. For Sauber, it is further proof that their upgrade direction is the right one, with Hulkenberg able to use his updated car to good effect when fighting his midfield rivals. "Would be nice if we can continue the trend from here but obviously definitely some momentum on our side. “A bit as I suspected in race trim the car comes alive a bit more, the update really paying dividends and just having better consistency and a better balance in the car so yeah quite pleasant, made some good gains. A couple of overtakes to do, pretty fun racing and managing tyres basically.” Hulkenberg's race craft remains sharp, the German more than happy to pounce on that opening lap when his rivals tangled, before executing a one-stop strategy that saw him make his hard tyres last 51 laps. While his drive lacked the showiness of his Barcelona race, where he overtook Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, it was his third score of the season and first in a race that didn't feature variables like rain or mid-race Safety Cars. “We've had two very different tracks here and in Barcelona" he said. "On both we were competitive in the midfield so there's no reason to think why not.”</p>
