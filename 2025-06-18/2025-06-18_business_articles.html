                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve kept a steady hand on interest rates, maintaining them at their target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The central bank is calling for two rate cuts this year, but policymakers see higher inflation. They have also cut their outlook for gross domestic product. At his press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers are "well positioned to wait" before moving further on rates. He also said that "we're beginning to see some effects" of tariffs on inflation. "The U.S. economy has defied all kinds of forecasts for it to weaken, really over the last three years, and it's been remarkable to see … again and again when people think it's going to weaken out. Eventually it will, but we don't see signs of that now," he said. Federal Reserve Chair Powell said on Wednesday that tariffs are an unavoidable cost increase to businesses and consumers. "Everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming months from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs," Powell said. And some of it will fall on the end consumer." Byron Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments, said the Federal Reserve is likely making a trade-off when it comes to keeping tariff inflation low. In emailed comments, Anderson wrote that the Fed's decision to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday was unsurprising. "The Fed has flipped from a long-term data stance when inflation was raging, to this short-term data focus toward rising inflation, as we are seeing cracks in soft data coming from growth, consumers, labor markets, and housing," he said. "The Fed seems obsessed with tariff inflation and are willing to sacrifice employment and GDP growth before adjusting this stance." Anderson added: "CPI and PCE should see further disinflation from housing over the next year as inventories continue to increase and prices start to decrease." Fed Chair Powell said the "dot plot" should be interpreted with a grain of salt as the macroeconomic environment remains highly risky. "I think what you see people doing is looking ahead at a time of very high uncertainty and writing down what they think the most likely case is. No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction, and everyone would agree that they're all going to be data dependent," Powell said. The projection reflects 19 individual members' expectations for rates, and it indicates an expectation of two rate reductions this year. A good example of that would be goods being sold at retailers today may have been imported several months ago before tariffs were imposed. So we're beginning to see some effects, and we do expect to see more of them over the coming months," he said. With a bevy of economic variables still unsettled, Fed Chair Powell said the central bank is content to sit tight until it learns more. "For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policies," Powell said at his post-meeting news conference. Powell noted that Trump's tariffs have the potential both to cause one-time price increases that the Fed likely would look through, or a longer-lasting hit to inflation. Fed Chair Powell highlighted a recent uptick in inflation expectations in his opening remarks and said that trend may be tied to tariffs. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2% inflation goal," Powell said. The Federal Reserve's meeting had a dovish tone, with expectations for two rate cuts still in place for this year despite upward revisions to near-term inflation forecasts, said Simon Dangoor, head of fixed income macro strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. "We expect the Fed to remain on hold at next month's meeting but think a path could open up to a resumption of its easing cycle later this year should the labor market weaken." "We went from four people calling for no rate cuts to now seven people calling for no rate cuts," he said on "Power Lunch." "We're moving towards a no-rate-cut environment going forward," he added. The Federal Reserve could wind up holding interest rates steady through the end of this year, said David Kelly, JPMorgan Asset Management chief global strategist. "Even if you get a sugar rush from fiscal stimulus, from this bill going through Congress, that sugar rush will fade. Sugar rushes do," Kelly said in an interview with CNBC's "Power Lunch." Inflation should be cooling down, and maybe then they can give us some lower rates," he said. "Right now, do not hold your breath waiting for low rates from the Federal Reserve because they don't seem to have any intention of delivering them." The federal funds rate sets what banks charge one another for overnight lending, but also has a domino effect on almost all of the borrowing and savings rates Americans see every day. The Fed's decision to hold rates steady means "borrowing rates are high, with mortgage rates near 7%, many home equity lines of credit in double-digit interest rate territory, and the average credit card rate still above 20%," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. "But savers continue to be rewarded with inflation-beating returns on the top-yielding savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit." From credit cards and mortgage rates to auto loans and savings accounts, here is a breakdown of all the ways the Fed's moves influence your wallet. The central bank also stuck with its forecast for two rate cuts. Read more about the Fed's decision from CNBC's Jeff Cox here. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 150 points, or 0.35%. As the Federal Reserve's rate decision neared, Trump critiqued Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "stupid." Speaking outside the White House on Wednesday morning, Trump said he didn't expect central bank policymakers to cut rates at the conclusion of their June meeting. "So we have a stupid person," Trump said of Powell. Fed funds futures trading suggests the Federal Reserve will likely stand pat on rates Wednesday, keeping them at the target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Read more from CNBC's Jeff Cox on Trump's comments over rate policy here. Policymakers are widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of their June meeting, but traders are eager to hear their latest outlook on the path forward for rates. The Federal Open Market Committee will be issuing its Summary of Economic Projections, which includes policymakers' forecasts on inflation, economic growth and the unemployment rate. The forecast comes at a critical time for the U.S. economy, which is grappling with uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariff policy, mixed economic data and now a conflict between Israel and Iran that is pushing energy prices higher. The Federal Reserve is largely expected to stay put on interest rates, maintaining them at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, which is where they've been since December. Even as rates are off their highs and the Fed put through three cuts in late 2024, borrowing costs remain relatively high for consumers. During the week of June 13, rates on 30-year fixed mortgages are at 6.89%, according to MND. Home equity loan rates are also high, sitting at 8.4% as of June 13, compared to 5.96% in March 2022, per Bankrate. Credit card borrowers are also paying more on their balances, with rates hovering at 20.12%, per Bankrate. Higher rates have been good news for savers, however. Five-year certificates of deposit have seen their annual percentage yields rise to 1.71% as of June 13, up from 0.50% in March 2022, Haver found.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In two groundbreaking clinical trials last year, Gilead's injection proved to be capable of virtually eliminating new HIV infections when taken every six months. Patients take it less frequently than all existing HIV prevention medications, including daily pills from Gilead and another injection from GSK received every other month. That makes Yeztugo a valuable and far more convenient tool for addressing an epidemic that led to around 1.3 million new infections and contributed to the deaths of 630,000 people globally in 2023, according to the World Health Organization. But the magnitude of its impact will also depend on how easy it is to get, said Jeremiah Johnson, executive director of PrEP4All, an organization focused on expanding access to HIV prevention medications. Lenacapavir, the generic name of Yeztugo, has an annual list price of $28,218 in the U.S. before insurance, a Gilead spokesperson said in an email. That is in line with existing branded medications approved for the same use: pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which reduces the risk of getting HIV. A month's supply of Truvada and Descovy, Gilead's daily pills for PreP, are both around $2,000 without insurance, which amounts to around $24,000 per year. One dose of GSK's Apretude, which is taken once monthly for the first two months and then once every other month thereafter, costs roughly $4,000 before insurance. "We are working to make Yeztugo accessible for anyone who needs or wants it and expect to see broad insurance coverage," the Gilead spokesperson said, adding that there is broad insurance coverage for existing prevention options. The company said it has a copay savings program for eligible insured patients that may reduce out-of-pocket payments for Yeztugo to as little as zero dollars. Lenacapavir is already approved for treating HIV under the brand name Sunlenca, which has a price tag of more than $42,200 per year. Mizuho analysts have estimated that lenacapavir could reach peak sales of around $4 billion globally for both HIV prevention and treatment. Gilead in October granted licenses to six generic manufacturers to produce and sell lower-cost versions of the injection in 120 low- and lower-middle-income countries. PrEP has been available for a decade in the form of daily pills, but infections have climbed or remained roughly flat in many areas. Pills can be difficult for many people to take consistently for several reasons, including inconvenience and stigma around HIV and PrEP in many communities, particularly outside the demographic of white men who have sex with men. "Unfortunately, there's still enormous amount of stigma and cultural challenges when it comes to HIV prevention," Johanna Mercier, Gilead's chief commercial officer, said in an interview. She said Gilead aims to ensure that more people, especially those not currently using PrEP, are aware of that convenience advantage and efficacy of the company's injection. In one late-stage trial, 99.9% of patients who took Gilead's injection did not contract an infection. There were only two cases among more than 2,000 patients, effectively reducing the risk of HIV infection by 96% and proving 89% more effective than Gilead's daily pill Truvada. The study enrolled cisgender men, transgender women, transgender men and gender nonbinary individuals who have sex with partners assigned male at birth. Another trial on cisgender women found that none of the participants who received Gilead's injection contracted an HIV infection, demonstrating 100% efficacy. In the U.S., ensuring access to underserved populations will also require broad insurance coverage. While most PrEP users are under commercial plans, the federal Medicaid program is also crucial to reaching lower-income communities. Mercier said, as of now, Gilead believes that Medicaid will continue to cover HIV services and support. "There are pretty incredible programs out there, not only Medicaid and other government programs, that really have safety nets to make sure that people who need or want access, both for HIV treatment and prevention, are set up," she said, also pointing to Gilead's programs for uninsured individuals. But PrEP4All's Johnson said the "entire foundation for HIV prevention in America is under attack at this moment." Other proposed federal funding cuts could make it harder to get Gilead's injection into the hands of physicians and patients, Johnson said. For example, the White House's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 includes deep cuts to several HIV prevention programs, particularly those run through the CDC. While some funding streams are continuing, Johnson said they are doing so "in a way that would completely destabilize the entire field of HIV prevention." He said if Congress does not push back on the proposed cuts, people currently taking PrEP "could start to slip off" and HIV infections could rise in many communities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A multitrillion-dollar tax package issued Monday by the Senate Finance Committee would offer a tax break for drivers on auto loan interest, but it doesn't seem to be available for used cars, tax experts said. The Senate GOP tax plan is part of a broader domestic policy bill that Republicans are trying to get to President Trump's desk by the Fourth of July, and aims to partially fund tax cuts by slashing spending on health programs like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. One of the legislation's many provisions would let taxpayers deduct up to $10,000 of auto loan interest from their taxable income in any given year. The average driver paid $1,332 of annual loan interest charges on new cars bought in 2024, according to AAA. The tax break — which President Trump proposed when campaigning for president last year — would be available from 2025 through 2028. Qualifying vehicles must be U.S.-assembled cars, minivans, vans, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, or motorcycles for personal use. The deduction would only be available for loans secured after after December 31, 2024, according to the Senate legislation. Unlike a tax plan passed by the House in May, Senate Republicans appear to limit the tax deduction to new — and not used — passenger cars, tax experts said. That phrasing is "pretty clear" in its meaning that only loans on new cars are eligible for the tax deduction, said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. "They don't say the word 'new cars' but I don't see another way of interpreting that language," Gardner said. That would limit the usefulness of the tax break for low- and middle-income taxpayers, who more often buy used cars, Gardner said. A survey of low- and middle-earning households published in 2023 by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, showed 61% had bought a used vehicle, while 39% bought a new one. Average household income was $115,000 for new-vehicle buyers in 2023, compared to $96,000 for a used-car buyer, according to Cox Automotive. Cox estimates more than 20 million households will buy a used car in 2025. In March, it forecast about 16 million new-vehicle sales this year, though said tariffs levied by the Trump administration cloud the sales outlook. Deductions reduce the amount of taxable income that households pay, and high earners generally pay a higher federal tax rate than lower-earning households.

The deduction's value falls by $200 for each $1,000 of income over those thresholds. Meanwhile, the Trump administration put 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts. Those tariffs are expected to push up car prices, and in turn erode the deduction's value for households, Gardner said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

A Waymo autonomous taxi in San Francisco.

Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo has applied for a permit to test its robotaxis in New York City, underscoring its intent to operate in one of the largest ride-hailing markets in the US despite an absence of local regulations supporting commercially operated autonomous vehicles.

The company has applied for a permit with the city's Department of Transportation to operate its vehicles autonomously in Manhattan with a trained human specialist supervising behind the wheel, spokesperson Ethan Teicher said in a statement Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets. Traders are also bracing for the Federal Reserve's latest rate policy decision, due later today. British lender TSB has attracted acquisition interest from larger rivals NatWest and Santander, according to two media reports. Spanish financial news outlet Vozpopuli reported overnight that TSB's parent Sabadell had been approached by U.K. bank NatWest, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland, expressing takeover interest. According to the news outlet's sources, NatWest is expected to make a 2.3 billion euro ($2.65 billion) offer for TSB. British broadcaster Sky News also reported that Santander had approached Sabadell with similar intentions for TSB. Shares of a little-known Swedish company Bambuser are up around 75% this morning after it revealed details of a deal with China's Alibaba. Bambuser said it has partnered with Alibaba Cloud, the technology subsidiary of the Chinese giant, to make its live video shopping technology available in the Chinese market. Livestream shopping is a phenomenon that originated in China in 2016, where companies and individuals market their wares over a live video stream. "To support its entry into the Chinese e-commerce market, Bambuser leverages Alibaba Cloud's secured cloud infrastructure and innovative video solutions to bring its complete video commerce platform to the brands in the market," the company said in a statement. The deal with Alibaba is expected to help Bambuser gain access to a large market in China —  where 55% of users engage in live video shopping, the most globally. "As a leading cloud service provider, we aim to collaborate with Bambuser to foster retail business growth in China, the largest e-commerce landscape in the world," said Esmie Wang, general manager of the EU at Alibaba Cloud Intelligence. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will give an update on its key interest rate on Thursday, a day after U.K. inflation cooled slightly to 3.4%. "Make no mistake: despite the still elevated levels of inflation, this will be welcome news for the MPC," Deutsche Bank's Sanjay Raja said in a note after the print was released. "The Bank's preferred measure (excluding indexed and volatile components, rents, and foreign holidays) [dropped] below 4% y/y for the first time since February 2022." Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, noted that the conflict between Israel and Iran could also impact inflation moving forward. The ongoing labour market loosening should give the MPC a little more confidence in its 'gradual and careful' approach to dialling down restrictive policy." Jordan Rochester, head of FICC strategy at Mizuho Bank EMEA, agreed that the British labor market could influence sentiment at the Bank of England. "It is the labour market news that has provided the recent dovish surprise and could prove to be the justification for a dovish shift in voting/language tomorrow," he said. Sweden's central bank cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday to 2% amid weakening inflation, but pointed to geopolitical risks ahead. "The economic recovery that began last year has lost momentum, and inflation is expected to be somewhat lower than in the previous forecast," it said in a press release, noting "favourable conditions for stronger economic activity in Sweden," partly because of increasing real household wages. Annual Swedish inflation most recently came in at a cooler-than-expected 2.3% in May, according to the country's statistics office. The central bank — known as Riskbank — aims to keep inflation at a lower 2%. We're around 25 minutes into Wednesday's trading session, and so far there's no consensus movement among regional stocks. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen marginally lower, with sectors in mixed territory. Major bourses are also pointing in different directions, with Germany's DAX index slightly below the flatline while the FTSE 100 and the French CAC 40 last seen up by around 0.1%. Ahead of a business update on Wednesday, Airbus raised the upper end of its dividend payout ratio and confirmed its full-year guidance. Yields on 2- and 20-year gilts were down by around 1 basis point, while 5- and 30-year gilt yields remained unchanged. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. U.K. inflation cooled slightly to 3.4% in the year to May, data from Britain's Office for National Statistics showed on Wednesday. The reading was in line with analyst expectations. A month earlier, inflation unexpectedly surged to 3.5%. Global investors continue to assess ongoing fighting between Israel and Iran tensions after continued missile attacks and airstrikes on Monday. Oil prices have risen on supply worries, and the price of gold has also increased amid a flight to safe haven assets after the conflict erupted last week. Those prices rose further overnight, and U.S. stock futures turned lower, after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a further escalation in attacks could be coming as he urged Iranians to evacuate Tehran. The U.S. Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision is due Wednesday afternoon. Fed funds futures are pricing in an almost 100% likelihood that the central bank will keep rates unchanged, as per CME's FedWatch tool, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's continued pressure on Fed Chief Jerome Powell for a rate cut. Investors will be keeping a close eye on Powell's post-meeting comments and for the central bank policymakers' forecast on rate policy, as the Federal Open Market Committee will be sharing members' "dot plot" of rate expectations. In Europe, U.K. investors will be keeping a close eye on inflation data from the U.K. for May, with economists expecting the consumer price index to have risen 3.4% in the year to May. Elsewhere, Sweden's Riksbank publishes its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday. There are no other data or major earnings reports due.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon-owned autonomous vehicle startup Zoox on Wednesday opened a sprawling new manufacturing facility in the San Francisco Bay Area, paving the way for more robotaxi production as it plans a commercial rollout of its fleet later this year. The facility is currently producing one robotaxi per day, but Zoox said it expects to accelerate that rate over the coming year. At full scale, it will have the capacity to assemble 10,000 robotaxis a year, with roughly three robotaxis being produced per hour, the company said. Zoox did not provide a timeline for reaching that production level. "We don't need to crank out a vehicle every minute because we're not selling these things," Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said on the facility's production floor during a tour. Zoox needs more of its toaster-shaped robotaxis to roll off the assembly line in order to fulfill its mission of deploying a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S. Zoox, founded 11 years ago and purchased by Amazon for $1.3 billion in 2020, began testing its robotaxis on public roads in 2023. The company currently has a few dozen robotaxis on public roads in Foster City, California, San Francisco and Las Vegas. Zoox expects to eventually operate between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in small- to medium-sized cities where it offers ride-hailing services, Evans said. Zoox is racing to catch up to Alphabet's Waymo, which operates the only fully public driverless ride-hailing service in the U.S. Waymo has aggressively expanded into new U.S. markets in recent years, and provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. Evans said Zoox is "very proud" of Waymo's progress, adding that it helps validate the work that Zoox and others are doing to deploy an autonomous ride-hailing service. Elon Musk's Tesla is poised to launch its robotaxi service in Austin on June 22, though Musk cautioned that date could shift as the company is "being super paranoid about safety." Zoox is gearing up to launch public rides in Las Vegas, its first commercial market, later this year. Similar to other ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, Zoox riders will be able to hail a robotaxi via an app. Unlike Waymo, which uses Geely Zeekr minivans, Zoox has developed its own custom-built "carriage-style" vehicles, where up to four passengers face each other and there's no steering wheel. Evans called the robotaxis "high-end computers on wheels." The cost of each vehicle should come down as Zoox scales up its fleet, Levinson said during the tour. Zoox said the new facility, spanning roughly 3½ football fields, is the first site "dedicated solely to producing purpose-built robotaxis" in the U.S., a well-timed move given President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies. The facility was occupied by bus manufacturer Gillig prior to Zoox's arrival. About half of the company's suppliers are based in the U.S., but it also sources some parts from countries including China and Italy. Zoox may open additional manufacturing facilities elsewhere in the U.S. and internationally over time, Evans said. The company also operates a small manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, which will now be used to assemble its test fleet of retrofitted Toyota SUVs and to configure the sensor pods that sit atop its robotaxis, enabling them to see in all directions. Once the vehicle is assembled, it goes through end-of-line testing. "Because the vehicle looks so different, we need to announce ourselves," Evans said.

OpenAI:

OpenAI has been shifting away from relying on Scale AI for data-labeling work.

OpenAI is phasing out the work it does with data-labeling startup Scale AI, cutting ties with the company days after Meta Platforms Inc. invested billions of dollars in it and hired its founder. 

Scale accounted for a small fraction of OpenAI's overall data needs, according to an OpenAI spokesperson who confirmed the firm's decision to phase out work with the company. The ChatGPT maker was already in the process of winding down its reliance on Scale before Meta, an OpenAI competitor, took a 49% stake in the firm, the spokesperson said, adding that OpenAI had been seeking other providers for more specialized data needed to support increasingly advanced artificial intelligence models. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a head-scratching move, since the company is unprofitable, and shares have moved on seemingly no news. Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based firm specializing in traditional Chinese medicine, saw its US-listed stock soar 398% over the first two days of the week. The company, which offers a proprietary oral formula it says can help treat disorders like ADHD and autism, has not generated any revenue, according to a regulatory filing from October. Regencell, which trades under the ticker "RGC" on the Nasdaq, soared 283% on Monday after its 38-for-1 stock split went into effect. While stock splits don't generate any value for the company — with overall market cap staying unchanged — they are often viewed as a bullish driver, since a lower per-share price can make a stock more appealing to retail investors. That made it — at least temporarily — worth more than more well-known companies like Lululemon, Kraft Heinz, and Reddit. Though Regencell is still less talked about than flagship stocks like Tesla and Apple, users on Reddit were quick to identify the surge this week, with some speculating that Regencell was the market's newest "meme stock." "Regencell is doing some weird stuff again," one user wrote on the subreddit r/shortsqueeze. "I'm trying to decide if I should pull out before a possible crash," another user, who said they were a longtime investor, said on the r/pennystocks subreddit. Didn't have a clue what this company is," another user wrote on a separate thread on r/shortsqueeze about Regencell this month. "I've been watching it go the last two weeks and keep telling myself that it will crash as soon as I buy back in." Regencell stock was also surging around the time Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continued his anti-vaccine push, with the Health and Human Services Secretary removing all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week, an independent panel that helps shape vaccination policies in the US. Regencell says it has a proprietary Traditional Chinese Medicine formula, a liquid-based oral formula it says can help treat ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder. "We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable," the firm said in its October filing. The company only has a small number of shares available to trade, one factor that can explain the large swings in its stock. That's a far lower percentage than the average for the more widely traded stocks that populate major indexes. Most of the company is owned by Regencell's CEO, Yat-Gai Au. His net worth has surged to as much as $33 billion this week, according to Bloomberg, vaulting him into the ranks of the world's richest people. RBC, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley also owned miniscule amounts of the stock. Initial public offerings from Chinese or Hong Kong-based firms have been in the spotlight recently. A report from The Wall Street Journal this week said that more than 20 China-based companies and 17 Hong Kong-based companies that went public on the Nasdaq since 2020 have lost 50% of their value or more in a single trading day over the last two years. In 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority issued a warning about a "heightened threat of fraud" related to small-cap companies that had recently gone public on US exchanges. Many of the companies associated with fraud had operators based in China or broker-dealers based in Hong Kong, the regulator said. The small remaining float leaves stocks vulnerable to market manipulation, it said, referring to such companies as "ramp-and-dump schemes."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Nobitex, was hacked for more than $90 million Wednesday, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. The funds were drained from platform wallets into addresses bearing anti-government messages explicitly referencing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, pointing to a politically motivated cyberattack, Elliptic said. Blockchain research firm Chainalysis said the stolen crypto included bitcoin, ethereum, doge, ripple, solana, tron, and ton. Pro-Israel hacking group Gonjeshke Darande, or "Predatory Sparrow," claimed responsibility for the attack and said it would release the exchange's source code. Predatory Sparrow also claimed credit for a separate cyberattack on Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah this week. Fighting erupted between Israel and Iran on Friday and the countries have continued to trade missile fire. Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened the U.S. with "irreparable damage" Wednesday in response to President Donald Trump's demand that the country surrender. Past investigations have connected the platform to sanctioned IRGC-linked ransomware operatives and individuals close to Khamenei. Blockchain data also shows activity between the Nobitex exchange and wallets associated with Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Houthis. Elliptic said it's continuing to monitor virtual asset flows tied to Iranian entities and has updated its compliance tools to reflect emerging threats in the region's crypto ecosystem.

Apollo has been a major backer of Wolfspeed since at least 2023.

Struggling chipmaker Wolfspeed Inc. will be taken over by creditors including Apollo Global Management Inc. under a proposal that would put it into bankruptcy just long enough to slash billions in debt, according to people familiar with the plan.

The company will soon announce a deal with lenders for a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information is private. In the weeks after that restructuring support agreement is signed, the company would ask creditors to vote on the deal and then file a Chapter 11 case, according to one of the people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bob McGrew, the former chief research officer at OpenAI, said professional software engineers are not going to lose their jobs to vibe coding just yet. McGrew, who left OpenAI in November, said on the latest episode of Sequoia Capital's "Training Data" podcast that product managers can make "really cool prototypes" with vibe coding. But human engineers will still be brought in to "rewrite it from scratch." And the classic answer is that it's a liability," McGrew said of software made with vibe coding. McGrew said that in the next one or two years, coding will be done by a mix of human engineers working with AI tools like Cursor and AI agents like Devin working in the background. He added that while the liability that comes with using agents to code has gone down, it is "still, net, a liability." Human engineers are needed to design and "understand the code base at a high level," McGrew said. This is so that when something goes wrong or if a project "becomes too complicated for AI to understand," a human engineer can help break the problem down into parts for an AI to solve. McGrew did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. In October, Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, said on an earnings call that the search giant was using AI to write more than 25% of its new code. That's not a typo," Tan wrote in an X post. On Tuesday, Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon, said in a memo to employees that AI will "reduce our total corporate workforce" and provide "efficiency gains." "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," Jassy said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In his memo, which was posted online, Jassy did not announce immediate layoffs. He said that, in the next few years, "efficiency gains" from AI would translate to a smaller corporate workforce. Marlo Lyons, a certified executive coach, told Business Insider that jobs will inevitably change — including outright disappearances. Amazon is now one of the largest companies to explicitly state that AI will impact its employees' jobs. Shopify's CEO said in April that, before hiring anyone new, employees must prove AI can't do the job better. Duolingo plans to phase out contractors and replace them with AI. And Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, has said that the company might not hire engineers in 2025 because those already on the payroll are getting so much more done thanks to AI tools. Office workers appear to be particularly at risk. In late May, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, suggested AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said earlier this month that he expects the impact of AI on white-collar jobs to be so significant that it will lead to a recession. "I think when we look into tech layoffs, it's so apparent that something is changing." Melissa Swift, the founder and CEO of work consultancy Anthrome Insight, told BI that productivity hasn't always increased to the same degree as tech advances. Those who aren't keeping up risk being left behind. And refusing to acknowledge the risk doesn't make it go away, Lyons said. "So if you're redesigning the workplace, and how things are getting done — whether it's a workflow or structures of teams, or the same thing with AI — you can hold on with white knuckles, but it's still going to happen around you," Lyons said. Of course, not all the jobs affected by advancements in AI will mean the workers filling them will be laid off. Jassy acknowledged in his statement that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs." Schneider said some jobs will change so that typical back-office, rote tasks will fall to AI and allow more workers to take on people-facing roles. "Honestly, I wouldn't want to underestimate people's drive," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese jewelers are snapping up platinum as they seek to bounce back from a slump in gold jewelry sales, an industry group said. Surging gold prices, which hit a record high above $3,500 an ounce in April, have deterred even buyers from China, who have a cultural attachment to the yellow metal. Meanwhile, gold bar and coin consumption surged nearly 30%, showing that investor demand for haven assets remains strong. They need to find a new metal for jewelry so that they can survive," Weibin Deng, the regional head for Asia Pacific at the World Platinum Investment Council, told Business Insider. Spot gold prices have also surged, up roughly 30% over the same period. The price of platinum is still about one-third of gold, making the white precious metal a compelling proposition for Chinese consumers. In China, jewelry is generally priced by weight rather than on a per-piece basis, said Deng. Goldman Sachs analysts wrote on Tuesday that platinum's blistering rally lacks fundamental support. They said the metal's issues include price-sensitive Chinese demand, slowing auto demand, and the expectation that there will be no significant decline in supply. "Instead, interest has shifted to other precious metals as investors seek catch-up opportunities," they wrote. The WPIC is stepping up marketing and public education to position platinum as a precious metal that has investment value and room to run, Deng said. Deng said the council is also working with Chinese jewelers to be more efficient in terms of fabrication and market operations to lower prices for consumers Deng said it's more expensive to work on platinum than gold as it requires more energy to melt the white metal. Another challenge: The gold market is far more liquid. It's easier for consumers to sell or trade in gold jewelry with a small discount. WPIC is partnering with jewelers in China to develop similar resale channels for platinum pieces. It's used in everything from car parts to electronics. But according to Deng, it's platinum's visibility in jewelry that plays a crucial role in how consumers perceive it as a precious metal. To make the platinum jewelry market sustainable, consumers need to view platinum the same way — as a store of value," he said. The BofA analysts wrote last week that even a 1% switch in gold to platinum jewelry could help double the white metal's supply deficit to 1.6 million ounces, which would help support prices.</p>
