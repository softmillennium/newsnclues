                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is refusing to be drawn on whether he will order U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday he doesn't want to carry out a U.S. strike on Iran but suggested he stands ready to act if it's necessary to extinguish Iran's nuclear program. Trump continued his increasingly pointed warnings about the U.S. joining Israel in striking at Tehran's nuclear program as Iran's leader warned anew that the United States would be greeted with stiff retaliation if it attacks. The stakes are high for Trump — and the world — as he engages in a push-pull debate between his goals of avoiding dragging the U.S. into another war and preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. “I'm not looking to fight,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “But if it's a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.” Trump earlier on Wednesday told reporters that it's not “too late” for Iran to give up its nuclear program. “I may do it, I may not do it,” Trump said of a potential U.S. strike in another exchange with reporters at the White House on Wednesday. Khamenei earlier in the day warned that any U.S. strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them” and that his country would not bow to Trump's call for surrender. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told lawmakers that the Pentagon was providing possible options to Trump as he decides next steps on Iran. Trump had said Tuesday the U.S. knows where Khamenei is hiding but doesn't want him killed — “for now.” “He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill! Trump's increasingly muscular comments toward the Iranian government follow him urging Tehran's 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives as he cut short his participation in an international summit earlier this week to return to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team. Iran's mission to the United Nations rejected Trump's claim in a statement on social media. The only thing more despicable than his lies is his cowardly threat to ‘take out' Iran's Supreme Leader. The U.S. president said earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to serve as a mediator with Iran. But Trump said he told Putin to keep focused on finding an endgame to his own conflict with Ukraine. The comments represented a shift for Trump, who earlier this week said he was “open” to Putin's offer to mediate. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said earlier Wednesday that Moscow has cautioned Washington against offering direct military assistance to Israel. “We are warning Washington against even speculative, hypothetical considerations of the sort,” Ryabkov said, according to the Interfax news agency. The Russia-Iran relationship has deepened since Putin launched a war on Ukraine in February 2022, with Tehran providing Moscow with drones, ballistic missiles, and other support, according to U.S. intelligence findings. Trump is also facing growing skepticism about deepening U.S. involvement in the Mideast crisis from some of his most ardent supporters. Steve Bannon, who served as a senior adviser to Trump during his first administration, said the administration should tread carefully. This is not something you play around with. And the American people have to be on board. You can't just dump it on them.” Bannon and other Trump allies, including Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk and conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, have raised concerns that direct U.S. involvement in the conflict could be seen as a betrayal to some members of Trump's coalition and cause a schism in MAGA world. To be certain, some Trump backers are supportive of the president taking military action against Iran and play down the risk of the U.S. getting mired in a conflict. “My supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them more than they were even at election time when we had a total landslide,” Trump said.

Summer will make a dramatic entrance in the U.S. this week with a heat dome that will bring stifling temperatures and uncomfortable humidity to millions. The heat will be particularly worrisome this weekend across wide stretches of Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin and Iowa, where forecasters are warning of extreme temperature impacts. This will be the first stretch of true summertime weather for many from Midwest to the East Coast, said Tom Kines, a meteorologist at the private weather company AccuWeather. “A lot of those folks have been saying, where's summer? Well, buckle up, because it's coming,” said Kines. Moisture blown northward from the Gulf of Mexico is fueling the muggy weather, said Jacob Asherman, a Weather Prediction Center meteorologist. This influx of Gulf moisture is fairly typical during late spring and summer, he said. The heat will be widespread into next week. On Friday, Denver could reach 100°F (38°C), according to the weather service. Parts of Nebraska and Kansas will be in the highest category on the scale on Saturday, meaning that anyone without effective cooling or sufficient hydration could face health risks. On Sunday, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri and Illinois also see a category 4 rating. Michael Mullenax, 10, from Lee's Summit, Mo., cools off in a mister at Kauffman Stadium before a baseball game between the Kansas City Royals and the Miami Marlins, June 24, 2024, in Kansas City, Mo. The air is saturated with water on humid days, which makes it harder for sweat to evaporate. Hot and humid days can be dangerous when the body is unable to cool itself off and can exacerbate pre-existing health conditions and even lead to heat stroke. Minimizing direct sun exposure, wearing loose and light-colored clothing, staying hydrated and spending time in air-conditioned spaces are ways to cool down during extreme heat, according to the NWS. Phoenix and nearby desert regions experience this so-called “dry heat” due to being located far away from large water bodies, mountains that block moist air masses and weather patterns that bring scarce precipitation. Sweat evaporates faster in dry climates compared to humid ones. This can be dangerous because it is easy to underestimate how dehydrated you are, according to Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System. Plants feel the effects of hot weather and some people in the Midwest are familiar with “ corn sweat,” which is when crops move water to their leaves and other surfaces so it can evaporate, according to the Ohio State University. Madison County, Iowa, farmer Ryan Marquardt said corn sweat is “not as bad as a sauna, but it definitely would have a sauna effect. It's humid in there (the cornfield), so you're gonna sweat.” Associated Press writer Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota, contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza's viral Spanish-language national anthem performance became a flashpoint for L.A. Dodgers fans frustrated by the team's public silence during increased federal immigration arrests and raids. The Dodgers said there were “no consequences or hard feelings.” (June 18) LOS ANGELES (AP) — As fans removed their caps and stood for the national anthem Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, they were met with a surprising rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza stood in front of the crowd, closed her eyes and belted the song out — in Spanish. Her 90-second rendition, and a behind-the-scenes video she shared on social media of team representatives discouraging it beforehand, quickly went viral and have become a flashpoint for Dodgers fans frustrated by the team's lack of vocal support for immigrant communities impacted by the deportation raids across the U.S., including numerous neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. Protests over the arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have captured international attention and mostly been held in areas a short drive from Dodger Stadium. Los Angeles Dodgers' Enrique Hernández stands for the national anthem with his daughter before a baseball game against the San Francisco Giants in Los Angeles, Sunday, June 15, 2025. Manager Dave Roberts has said he doesn't know enough about the issue to comment, but Dodgers hitter Kiké Hernández separately spoke out on Instagram over the weekend. “I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.” In her viral TikTok video, Nezza is shown speaking with an off-camera Dodgers employee who tells her, “We are going to do the song in English today, so I'm not sure if that wasn't transferred or if that wasn't relayed.” She's received an outpouring of support since Saturday from celebrities like Jason Mraz, Kehlani, Chiquis, Ava DuVernay, The Kid Mero, Becky G and more. “Don't you dare turn your backs on us now. We, as a city, have embraced you and need your support more than ever. Think about who fills up your stadium,” said Becky G, addressing the Dodgers in her Instagram story. Dodger Stadium has a long history with immigrant communities in Los Angeles. Many proudly wear Dodger blue jerseys and merchandise as an extension of their love for the city — the team still sells special “Los Dodgers” jerseys on its official website — and attend the stadium's multiple heritage nights honoring Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and more immigrant communities, including those from outside Latin America. The franchise is also frequently praised for its history seeking out diverse talent, including Jackie Robinson (baseball's first Black player), Fernando Valenzuela (a Mexican icon who transcended baseball) and Chan Ho Park (the first Korean in the big leagues). But the relationship is not without tension, with some Mexican American and Latino residents resentful of the team's forceful eviction of Latino families in the 1950s to build Dodger Stadium in what is popularly known as Chavez Ravine. Fans have since called for a boycott online, while others say they'd be willing to return if the team spoke out. You've been so much a big part of our lives. … We would like to understand that you love us just the same. Or are we just money to you?” asked Power 106's Brown Bag Mornings host Letty Peniche in an Instagram video. Los Angeles resident Alora Murray is considering a temporary boycott. For them to not kind of be with us, I feel like us boycotting or not going to games will send that message.” Fans cheer as Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tanner Scott prepares to throw during the ninth inning of a baseball game against the San Francisco Giants in Los Angeles, Saturday, June 14, 2025. Longtime Dodger fan Emeli Avalos says she doesn't believe the team is apolitical since they released a statement to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. “If it's really about staying out of politics, then why do they support that? But when people down the street from them are getting taken, kidnapped, why do they stay silent?” she said. In a popular TikTok video, Avalos is seen speaking with Dodgers security. Another video of a fan being confronted by security for holding a banner with “ICE” crossed out circulated online over the weekend, furthering criticism of the team. When asked about the incidents, a Dodgers spokesperson pointed to the team's stadium guidelines, which state the team “does not allow signs or banners of any kind.” Also prohibited is any attire the Dodgers deem — at their sole discretion — to be obscene, profane, vulgar, indecent, violent, threatening, abusive or prejudiced against any individual or group. Nezza does not think she will return to the stadium, despite the Dodgers' statement, but says she hopes her performance will inspire others to use their voice and speak out. “It's just shown me like how much power there is in the Latin community,” she said.</p>

Emmanuel Acho, LeSean McCoy and James Jones react to the Tush Push staying put after a proposal to ban the call failed by two votes during the NFL spring meetings. Josh Allen is not seeing eye-to-eye with his own team about one of the biggest controversies in the sport. However, the quarterback himself, who has a knack for finding the end zone with his legs himself, said he believes that it should remain a part of the game. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, #17, rushes for a touchdown during the second quarter against the Baltimore Ravens in a 2025 AFC divisional round game at Highmark Stadium. "I'm a big believer in if you can't stop it, keep running it, right?" "I think that there's a few teams that do it better than others, but then you look at a few teams that try to do it, and it doesn't have the same success. And just because a couple teams do it better than others, I don't feel like it should be banned. "I understand the merit of what it brings, and so I don't really sway one way or the other. And if that was the rule that was passed, you know, we'll find a different way. But I feel like if you can use it to your benefit, use it to your benefit. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, #17, scores a touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams during the first half at SoFi Stadium. The proposal added that a penalty would be assessed on any offensive player who violated the rule. Proponents of the play and those who oppose it both presented strong arguments, while the league expressed worry about safety. Rich McKay, the NFL Competition Committee chair, said in April the issues go beyond safety, because there was not enough data to say whether it is a dangerous play. Washington Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu called the play "cheap." Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, #17, looks to pass during the first half of an NFL wild-card playoff football game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, Jan. 15, 2023 in Orchard Park, New York.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vox helps you cut through the noise with clear, useful journalism. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It was obvious, if you listened to the Supreme Court's oral argument in United States v. Skrmetti last December, that the Court would vote — most likely along party lines — to uphold state laws banning many forms of transgender health care for minors. So nothing about Chief Justice John Roberts's majority opinion in Skrmetti is really surprising. All six of the Court's Republicans voted to uphold these laws, and all three of the Court's Democrats dissented. It relies on old and widely criticized precedents to undermine legal principles that are well established by more recent cases. At times in his opinion, Roberts seems to misread statutory language that he just quoted a paragraph or two earlier. It appears, in other words, that the six justices in the majority started with the outcome that they wanted — bans on transgender health care for minors must be upheld — and then contorted their legal reasoning to fit that result. Even if you share that goal, the decision in this case was unnecessary. As Justice Elena Kagan points out in a brief dissenting opinion, the issue before the Supreme Court Skrmetti concerned a threshold question: whether the Tennessee law at issue in this case should receive a heightened level of scrutiny from the courts before it was either upheld or discarded. Instead, Roberts's Skrmetti opinion went further to rule on the legality of the bans, and consists of about two dozen pages of excuses for why the Court's previous anti-discrimination decisions somehow do not apply to Tennessee's law. Roberts's actual opinion contains some language suggesting that the general rule against sex discrimination is weaker when the government regulates medical practice, but those sections of his opinion are so difficult to parse that they fall short of the broad changes he discussed at oral argument. Ultimately, Roberts's Skrmetti opinion largely reveals something that close observers of this Supreme Court already know. They are often so eager to reach ideological or partisan results that they hand down poorly reasoned opinions and incomprehensible legal standards. The first of two questions is whether Tennessee's ban on trans health care for minors classifies patients based on their sex assigned at birth. In United States v. Virginia (1996), the Supreme Court held that “‘all gender-based classifications today' warrant ‘heightened scrutiny. It prohibits people under the age of 18 from receiving many medical treatments to treat gender dysphoria or other conditions related to their transgender status — including bans on puberty blockers and hormone therapy. Significantly, Tennessee's law is also quite explicit that the purpose of this law is to ensure that young people do not depart from their sex assigned at birth. But a child who is assigned male at birth may not. Under Virginia, in other words, Tennessee's law — which relies on a sex-based classification — must be subject to heightened scrutiny. To be clear, the mere fact that courts must give heightened review to Tennessee's law does not mean that the law will necessarily be struck down. As the Court held in Craig v. Boren (1976), “to withstand constitutional challenge…classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.” Some laws do survive this level of scrutiny. Roberts's opinion raises several policy arguments for Tennessee's law, claiming that the procedures targeted by Tennessee are “experimental,” that they “can lead to later regret,” and that they carry “risks.” A court applying heightened scrutiny could consider these arguments and whether they justify upholding the law. But Roberts bypasses this inquiry altogether, instead denying that the Tennessee law engages in sex-based classifications at all. The law, Roberts claims, only “incorporates two classifications.” It “classifies on the basis of age” by banning certain treatments only for minors. And it “classifies on the basis of medical use” by prohibiting doctors from prescribing those treatments to address gender dysphoria or similar conditions affecting transgender people, while simultaneously permitting those treatments to address other conditions. Roberts is correct that Tennessee's law does draw lines based on these two classifications. But a law can do more than two things at once. And this law explicitly states that it exists to classify every child as either a boy or a girl, and then to lock them into that classification until their 18th birthday. The second legal question before the Court in Skrmetti was whether all laws that discriminate against transgender people are themselves subject to heightened scrutiny. Roberts, however, dodges this question by claiming that Tennessee's law “does not classify on the basis of transgender status.” Instead, he argues, the law classifies people based on whether they have conditions such as “gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence.” Roberts might as well have argued that Jim Crow laws do not discriminate on the basis of race, but instead discriminate based on the color of a person's skin. To justify this distinction, Roberts points to the Court's decision in Geduldig v. Aiello (1974), which held that discrimination against pregnant people is not a form of sex discrimination because not all women become pregnant. But, even if it is true that not all transgender people experience gender dysphoria or a similar condition, post-Geduldig decisions have long held that the government cannot evade a ban on discrimination by claiming that it is merely discriminating based on a trait that closely correlates with a particular identity. As the Court said in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic (1993), “a tax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews” — even though many Jews do not wear yarmulkes. That said, the Court's decision not to rule on whether laws that classify on the basis of transgender status must receive heightened review is probably a blessing for transgender people, even if it is a small one. While Roberts's reasoning on this question is muddled, his opinion leaves open the possibility that a future Court may resolve this question in favor of transgender people — although that is highly unlikely to happen unless the Court's membership changes significantly. Notably, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who is close to the center of the current Court, wrote a separate concurring opinion arguing that discrimination against trans people does not trigger heightened scrutiny. It twists the Constitution in knots to uphold Tennessee's law. Trump shut down the agency that protects civil servants from illegal firings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Officials charged seven men with the theft of 24 bags containing $100 million worth of gold, diamonds, gems, luxury watches, and other items from a Brink's armored truck driving through California on July 11, 2022. Ranging in age from 31 to 60, the men were all Los Angeles-area residents, living in Boyle Heights, Westlake, and Rampart Village, California. The Hollywood-style robbery, which Justice Department officials said was the biggest jewelry grab they had ever seen, started when the goods were loaded onto a Brink's truck following a gem and jewelry show south of San Francisco. The shows featured everything from decorative beads to rare Rolex watches. On the truck was millions of dollars' worth of jewelry Jean Malki, a veteran jeweler with four decades under his belt, had wrapped, including a necklace containing 25 carats of yellow diamonds, a rare Australian-mined black opal, and a Burmese ruby, he told New York magazine at the time. Malki and a handful of other jewelers handed their entire collection to a Brink's guard, who packed it into his truck and told them they would get it the next day at a show about five hours south in Pasadena, California. When the driver returned less than half an hour later, he saw that 24 bags containing precious gems such as the ones Malki and 14 others had packed were gone. Some of the defendants allegedly did not grasp how large their haul was. Others were locked in a legal battle with Richmond, Virginia-based Brink's that prevented them from receiving any insurance payouts. Almost three years later, federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment against seven co-conspirators who allegedly carried out the theft at the Flying J Travel Center, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles. “It was a long time coming, and there were times when the victims and members of the team wondered whether we'd see this success,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Butler said Tuesday. Some of the stolen jewelry, including watches, was recovered after search warrants were executed. Butler said search warrants are still being pursued and that many of the stolen jewels remain missing. Two of the defendants arrested appeared in federal court on Tuesday. The co-conspirators, some of whom use aliases, are Carlos Victor Mestanza Cercado, Jazael Padilla Resto, Pablo Raul Lugo Larroig, Victor Hugo Valencia Solorzano, Jorge Enrique Alban, Jeson Nelon Presilla Flores, and Eduardo Macias Ibarra. Some of the defendants have also been charged with smaller heists throughout San Bernardino County. If convicted, Mestanza, Padilla, Lugo, Valencia, and Alban would face up to 20 years in federal prison for each robbery charge. All the defendants would face up to five years for the theft conspiracy charge and 10 years for each theft charge. The California caper drew comparisons to infamous international heists, including the 1983 Brink's-Mat gold bullion job near London Heathrow Airport, 2003's Antwerp diamond theft in Belgium, and 2015's Hatton Garden burglary in London.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, a stunning setback to transgender rights. The justices' 6-3 decision in a case from Tennessee effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump's Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.” In a dissent for the court's three liberal justices that she summarized aloud in the courtroom, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims. The decision comes amid other federal and state efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use. In April, Trump's administration sued Maine for not complying with the government's push to ban transgender athletes in girls sports. The Republican president also has sought to block federal spending on gender-affirming medical care for those under age 19 — instead promoting talk therapy only to treat young transgender people. And the Supreme Court has allowed him to kick transgender service members out of the military, even as court fights continue. Trump's administration has also called for using only therapy, not broader health measures, to treat transgender youths. Several of the states where gender-affirming care has not been banned for minors have adopted laws or state executive orders seeking to protect it. The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Susan Kressly, said in a statement the organization is “unwavering” in its support of gender-affirming care and “stands with pediatricians and families making health care decisions together and free from political interference.” Five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled transgender, gay and lesbian people are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace. But the justices Wednesday declined to apply the same sort of analysis the court used in 2020 when it found “sex plays an unmistakable role” in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate. Roberts joined that opinion written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was part of Wednesday's majority. Justice Amy Coney Barrett also fully joined the majority but wrote separately to emphasize that laws classifying people based on transgender status should not receive any special review by courts. Barrett, also writing for justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that “courts must give legislatures flexibility to make policy in this area.” The Supreme Court is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Dec. 17, 2024. Mo Jenkins, a 26-year-old trans woman who began taking hormone therapy at 16, said she was disheartened but not surprised by the ruling. “My transition was out of survival,” said Jenkins, a Texas native and legislative staffer at the state capitol in Austin. Texas outlawed puberty blockers and hormone treatment for minors in 2023. “Trans people are not going to disappear,” Jenkins said. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti on social media called the ruling a “Landmark VICTORY for Tennessee at SCOTUS in defense of America's children!” There are about 300,000 people between the ages of 13 and 17 and 1.3 million adults who identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute, at think tank at the UCLA School of Law that researches sexual orientation and gender identity demographics. Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors but allows the same drugs to be used for other purposes. The lowest level is known as rational basis review, and almost every law looked at that way is upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures. The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, which applies in cases of sex discrimination. Roberts' 24-page majority opinion was devoted almost entirely to explaining why the Tennessee law, called SB1, should be evaluated under the lower standard of review. The law's restrictions on treating minors for gender dysphoria turn on age and medical use, not sex, Roberts wrote. But in her courtroom statement, Sotomayor asserted that similar arguments were made to defend the Virginia law prohibiting interracial marriage that the Supreme Court struck down in 1967.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian Air Force MiG-31K jet carries a high-precision hypersonic aero-ballistic missile Kh-47M2 Kinzhal during the Victory Day military parade to celebrate 73 years since the end of WWII and the defeat of Nazi Germany, in Moscow, on May 9, 2018. The Israeli Iron Dome air defense system fires to intercept missiles during an Iranian attack over Tel Aviv, Israel, early Wednesday, June 18, 2025. BARCELONA (AP) — Iran is boasting that it has hypersonic missiles and says it already has begun firing the cutting-edge weapons at Israel. Here's a closer look at these advanced weapons: Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard claimed Wednesday that it had fired what it said were hypersonic “Fattah 1” missiles toward Israel. But whether these missiles are hypersonic is a matter of debate. Simply put, hypersonic weapons are any missile that travels beyond Mach 5, five times the speed of sound. Ballistic missiles, fired high up or outside the earth's atmosphere, routinely reach this speed. But in modern warfare, experts say hypersonic weapons must also have advanced navigation systems – making them nimble and capable of changing their trajectory. This can challenge traditional defense systems, said Jack Watling, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. Traditional ballistic missiles fly on a trajectory that missile-defense systems like the U.S.-made Patriot can anticipate. Cruise missiles, which can hug terrain, or hypersonic missiles, which are fired to a lower altitude, have less predictable trajectories and are harder to stop. If it's a hypersonic glide vehicle, it can fly lower and hills get in the way,” Watling said. Experts say the U.S. and China are the only countries that have developed new-generation hypersonic missiles — but neither have used them in battle. Other nations such as Russia, North Korea and Pakistan have tested or used missiles with similar but less sophisticated technology. The U.S. says it is putting hypersonic missiles on a stealth destroyer and is developing and testing other programs. China tested its first hypersonic missile in 2017 and has since developed an array of hypersonic weapons that the U.S. Defense Department says could threaten Hawaii, Alaska and even the continental U.S. Most countries can't make missiles that would weather the temperature and momentum stresses of these incredibly fast munitions, Watling said. Most of the missiles Iran has deployed against Israel travel at hypersonic speed, but are barely maneuverable, so are not considered true hypersonic missiles, said Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at the Israeli think tank INSS and a former scientist in Israeli defense industries. He said Iran has two fast and maneuverable missiles, the Khorramshahr and Fattah 2, that would be “more difficult” to intercept. Russia has claimed to have used hypersonic missiles in its war against Ukraine, but experts say that while fast they do not maneuver enough to be considered true hypersonic weapons. Russia President Vladimir Putin boasted of the development and use of the Orenshik in Ukraine — claiming that flies “like a meteorite” at 10 times the speed of sound, and that it was immune to any missile defense system. Ukrainian military officials said it reached Mach 11. Russia has also claimed its Kinzhal missile is hypersonic, but Ukraine has been able to intercept them with the U.S.-made Patriot missile defense system. During the recent fighting between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir, Pakistan said it destroyed a Russian-built S-400 air defense system in India's border Punjab state with hypersonic missiles launched from a warplane. Brazil, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Iran, Japan, South Korea and North Korea all have hypersonic weapons programs. The European Union is studying how to develop an interceptor for hypersonic missiles as it ramps up defense spending to counter the Russian threat.</p>

Plenty of golfers had their fair share of displeasure at this past weekend's U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania. Shane Lowry outwardly proclaimed, "f--- this place" after missing a putt, and on Sunday, despite J.J. Spaun's late charge to take home his first major, only three people finished under par in the final round. "Everyone had to play the same course," Schauffele told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. Schauffele admitted there were "weird breaks" that occurred throughout the weekend when golfers toed the line with danger. I thought it was more playable because it rained a little, and the fairways and greens were more forgiving," he added. You saw J.J. take control out of that rain delay, which is what you're supposed to do to win and be a major champ there." Schauffele will be one of several major champs at TPC River Highlands in Cromwell, Connecticut, this weekend for the Travelers Championship, where the last seven winning scores have been -22, -23, -19, -13, -19, -17, and -17, a polar opposite to U.S. Open scores. The 2024 PGA and Open champion won the Travelers in 2022, and while everybody wants to shoot lower, Schauffele said having both types of golf is a good balance. I've never shied away from the U.S. Open challenge, and I've never shied away from -25 winning a tournament," Schauffele said. "If you had to play Oakmont in U.S. Open conditions every week for 20 weeks, you'd wear yourself out, and vice versa. If you had to play a course where 25-under is winning for 20 weeks, you'd also wear yourself out. This year's Travelers has exactly what Schauffele wants as he aims to catch fire ahead of The Open, the FedEx Cup, and the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in what's been a "weird" season for him. "They definitely have done some things to make TPC River Highlands more difficult," Schauffele said. "Used to be lower rough, fairways used to be wider, they changed a couple holes to make it more difficult and less scoring-friendly… You're rewarded for really good shots, but there's water on a lot of holes, there's deep rough on some short-sided pins, a guy next to you can be shooting low, but you can be at even par not feeling great. I wouldn't call it a layup – you still have to be playing really good golf." Xander Schauffele, left, shakes hands with his caddie, Austin Kaiser, after winning the Travelers Championship golf tournament. However, it will be a stark difference from what went down in western Pennsylvania. "It'll be weird to be able to make seven or eight birdies in a round versus at Oakmont."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Burgeoning disagreements among Senate Democrats regarding the conflict between Israel and Iran have presented themselves as the latest challenge facing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). Israel's recent attack on Iran has only served to intensify Schumer's troubles. Schumer has remained silent on a war powers resolution that Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee, introduced on Monday. And when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who caucuses with Democrats, introduced a bill this week seeking to bar funding for military force against Iran, Schumer declined to sponsor it, despite backing the same legislation in previous years. Despite Kiane and Sanders's outspoken stance, Schumer has yet to offer a public statement on the conflict since Trump signaled that military involvement could be coming earlier this week. Senior members of his administration have also declined to rule out such options. Schumer's muted positioning over the past few days comes as his views on Israel differ sharply from members of his caucus, such as Sanders, making it difficult for the increasingly unpopular Senate minority leader to navigate politically as he seeks to hold on to power. When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week launched a series of strikes against Iran directed at destroying its nuclear program, ballistic missile capabilities, and military leadership, Schumer initially issued a strong statement affirming the Jewish nation's right to defend itself from nuclear threats, while calling for diplomatic solutions to de-escalate the situation, similar to the Trump administration's approach. “The United States' commitment to Israel's security and defense must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran's response,” he wrote. I have long said that Israel has a right to defend itself and that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,” the Senate's Democratic leader continued. Such language has already set Schumer up for likely conflicts with conference members such as Sanders, who said, “This attack was specifically designed to sabotage American diplomatic efforts: Israel assassinated the man overseeing Iran's nuclear negotiating team, despite the fact that further talks with the United States were scheduled for Sunday. An unfavorable 2026 Senate map could become even more challenging as Democratic incumbents keep retiring, with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) continuing this trend in April. Some Democrats have proposed that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) should challenge him for his Senate seat. Earlier this year, the GOP took its largest-ever advantage over Democrats in favorability ratings. As Democrats shed support, particularly from male and Hispanic voters, another poll this spring put the party's favorability rating at a record low of 29%.</p>

Attorney Mehek Cooke on President Donald Trump's authority to activate National Guard troops to mitigate chaos in Los Angeles and a judge extending a block on Trump's Harvard international student ban. The Department of Defense is sending thousands more National Guard troops to protect federal property amid anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots in Los Angeles. "By direction of the Secretary of Defense and in coordination with U.S. Northern Command, 2,000 additional California Army National Guard soldiers have been activated in a Title 10 status to support the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property in the greater Los Angeles area," according to a Tuesday release from U.S. Northern Command. Demonstrators holding signs and flags face California National Guard members standing guard outside the Federal Building as they protest in response to federal immigration operations in Los Angeles on June 9, 2025. The task force, which has been the subject of controversy since it was deployed to the West Coast city after an eruption of violence stemming from immigration operations carried out by ICE, will now be comprised of 4,100 National Guardsmen and 700 active duty Marines. Gavin Newsom last week sued the Trump administration for deploying troops to California in the first place, accusing the president of having "commandeered" 2,000 of the state's National Guard members "illegally, for no reason" without consulting with California's law enforcement leaders. "The INCOMPETENT Governor of California was unable to provide protection in a timely manner when our Ice Officers, GREAT Patriots they are, were attacked by an out of control mob of agitators, troublemakers, and/or insurrectionists," Trump said on TRUTH Social in response to the lawsuit. Gavin Newsom, left, and President Donald Trump have clashed over the National Guard's role in the Los Angeles riots. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled in favor of Newsom. An appellate court is currently reviewing the matter. Northern Command said that the troops will not be used in a civilian law enforcement capacity, but rather they will "provide Task Force 51 with adequate numbers of forces to provide continuous coverage of the area in support of the lead federal agency." Demonstrators protest outside a downtown jail in Los Angeles following two days of clashes with police during a series of immigration raids on June 8, 2025 in Los Angeles. "This is clean up from the Pentagon," Newsom spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo told Fox News Digital in a Wednesday morning statement. "This isn't a new deployment — it's the same group of soldiers who have been diverted from critical wildfire work and work at the border, now twiddling their thumbs for Donald Trump's political theater. The description of what they are and aren't going to be doing is meant to be consistent with their legal position, rather than the immigration enforcement support we've seen them doing in Los Angeles." About two weeks ago, riots erupted in Paramount, California, just south of Los Angeles, after ICE conducted immigration sweeps in the city. Those riots quickly spread north, leading to several nights of showdowns between law enforcement and unruly bad actors. Several "Kill Trump" messages were graffitied in the city's downtown. Meanwhile, violent behavior continues to flare up. Detectives are investigating whether the looting episode is related to a "street takeover." Fox News' Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.

Fox News' Alexandria Hoff reports on the government findings regarding the risks associated with gender surgeries on ‘Special Report.' At issue in the case, United States v. Skrmetti, was whether Tennessee's Senate Bill 1, which "prohibits all medical treatments intended to allow 'a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex' or to treat 'purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity,'" violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that the law question is not subject to heightened scrutiny "because it does not classify on any bases that warrant heightened review." "This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field," he said. At issue in the case, United States v. Skrmetti, is whether the equal protection clause prohibits states from allowing medical providers to deliver puberty blockers and hormones to facilitate a minor's transition to another sex. United States v. Skrmetti was one of the most closely watched cases of the Supreme Court's term, with potential ripple effects for ongoing legal battles over transgender rights – including bathroom access and participation in school sports. The ruling could also serve as a legal pretext in future cases involving LGBTQ+ protections, including whether sexual orientation qualifies as a "protected class" on par with race or national origin. "The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best," he added. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process." All three liberal justices notably dissented in the case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent that cited a long history of laws discriminating against others, noting that transgender persons in the U.S. make up less than 1% of the country's population. There are an estimated 1.3 million adults and 300,000 adolescents aged 13 to 17 who identify as transgender, according to the UCLA law school's Williams Institute. She noted that SB1 "expressly classifies on the basis of sex and transgender status, so the Constitution and settled precedent require the Court to subject it to intermediate scrutiny." "The majority contorts logic and precedent to say otherwise, inexplicably declaring it must uphold Tennessee's categorical ban on lifesaving medical treatment so long as ‘any reasonably conceivable state of facts' might justify it," Sotomayor said, adding: "By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims." US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and US Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor look on prior to US President Joe Biden's State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on March 7, 2024. The court's ruling comes after many other states have moved to ban or restrict medical treatments and procedures for transgender adolescents, drawing close attention to the case. During the December oral arguments, justices on the Supreme Court appeared reluctant to overturn Senate Bill 1, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting that state legislatures, rather than courts, are best equipped to regulate medical procedures. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, however, countered that with evidence from underage individuals who were denied treatment. "Some children suffer incredibly with gender dysphoria, don't they? Some on the left have called for an end to trans inclusion efforts (Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images) Also at issue was the level of scrutiny that courts should use to evaluate the constitutionality of state bans on transgender medical treatment for minors, such as SB1, and whether these laws are considered discriminating on the basis of sex or against a "quasi-suspect class," thus warranting a higher level of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. That was another focus of the oral arguments in December, as petitioners and respondents battled for more than two hours over the level of scrutiny that the court should apply in reviewing laws involving transgender care for minors, including SB1. Tennessee argued then that its law can still withstand even the test of heightened scrutiny, contending in a court brief that it does have "compelling interests" to protect the health and safety of minors in the state, and "in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession." President Donald Trump signed an executive order, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," on National Girls and Women in Sports Day. Speaking to reporters after oral arguments in December, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said that the Constitution "allows the states to protect kids from unproven, life-altering procedures based on uncertain science." President Donald Trump cracked down on the issue almost immediately after being sworn in to his second White House term in January. Just weeks after his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order preventing biological men from competing in women's sports. The order, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed on National Girls and Women in Sports Day. The Trump administration's policies on transgender rights have inevitably become the targets of legal challenges launched by advocacy groups, medical organizations and individuals who claim they are discriminatory. Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the Supreme Court ruling on social media Wednesday. "This Department of Justice will continue its fight to protect America's children and parental rights," she said on X. Fox News Digital's Haley Chi-Sing contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Vice President JD Vance weighed in to defend his boss, President Donald Trump, on Iran, he was coming from a different place than many of his predecessors. Unlike Dick Cheney under George W. Bush, Vance isn't more hawkish than his senior partner or viewed as pushing for war behind the scenes. When Vance endorsed Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, the Ohioan said he was doing so in part because there were no new wars in Trump's first term. Bush under Ronald Reagan, Vance isn't seen as less of a true believer than the boss or a throwback to an older form of Republicanism. During Trump's first term, Mike Pence was also a throwback to an earlier Republican era and a bridge between MAGA and the mainstream conservative movement. Unlike Dan Quayle under Bush the elder, Vance isn't seen as a lightweight. But Vance has written an acclaimed book, Hillbilly Elegy, and many articles about wonkish policy topics. He has proven an effective messenger for their successful 2024 campaign and the Trump administration. Vance is an important figure in a political movement indisputably spawned by Trump. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) was still seen as a threat. Vance's endorsement also came before the first Trump indictment. Kamala Harris went down with the ship last year defending Joe Biden. But Vance is doing so from an unusual vantage point, as an important movement leader in his own right who by all appearances is being actively groomed as a successor. (Trump has downplayed, and sometimes even denied, 2028 succession plan talk.) That's why Vance is in a position to try to reassure MAGA dissenters about any perceived Trump apostasies, though it may involve the expenditure of political capital the vice president will need later. When MAGA influencers began speaking out against Trump's support of Israel's military strikes on Iran and any U.S. involvement, Vance said, “I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue.” Many of these same MAGA influencers had vouched for Vance over other potential VP picks or lobbied Trump to add him to the 2024 Republican ticket. Vance has more credibility as a Trump defender than other subordinates in the administration. He also has a lot more riding on the outcome.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stood defiant in the face of President Donald Trump's threats, saying any intervention would be met with “irreparable damage.” In a televised address, Khamenei sought to reassure Iranians amid increasing signals that the United States could join Israel in its assault on Iran. “The Americans should know that any U.S. military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage.” “This nation will not surrender to anyone in the face of imposition,” Khamenei added. His remarks about an imposed peace were primarily a reference to Trump's Tuesday Truth Social post that said, “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” In an interview with Al Jazeera, Iran's Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said, “Any American intervention would be a recipe for an all-out war in the region.” Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Ali Bahreini said Trump's calls for unconditional surrender were “very hostile,” and he promised that Iran was ready to “respond very firmly” if the U.S. intervened. And that line will be defined by our relevant authorities, including military forces,” he said. A response from Iran could include attacks on vulnerable U.S. bases scattered across Iraq, Syria, and other Middle Eastern countries. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” he said in a post on Truth Social, referring to Khamenei. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Israel is relying on the U.S.'s 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs to hit Iran's underground Fordo nuclear enrichment facility, buried hundreds of feet underground in the side of a mountain. Reports increasingly indicate that Trump may soon order limited strikes against Iran's nuclear program. “The movement right now is away from diplomacy and toward U.S. involvement,” a Trump administration official told Politico's Dasha Burns.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Francis Collins led the NIH for a decade before its dismantling. He led the Human Genome Project that sequenced the entire human genome by 2003, and then in 2009, he became director of the National Institutes of Health, where he served under three presidents and led the agency's research on a Covid-19 vaccine. (Those firings are still being challenged in the courts, but as of now, the employees remain out of work.) Trump administration officials have barred researchers from studying certain topics like vaccine hesitancy or the health effects of wildfires. “I had experienced transitions before, and those were bumpy sometimes,” Collins told me in a recent interview. “But I didn't expect science to be under this kind of full-bore attack, which is really what happened almost immediately after inauguration day.” In the past few months, Collins saw scientists placed under communications gag orders, restrained from speaking freely even when no media were present. Collins, who had stepped down as NIH director in 2021 and had taken over a lab studying diabetes, soon felt he could no longer do his job as a scientist should. “So I pulled my folks together in a conference room. I never thought it would end this way. My wife came to pick me up on that last Friday, and I just walked out of the building and got in the car and said, ‘I guess this is it. Just four years ago, Collins was President Donald Trump's NIH director. Now, in Trump's second term, he's resigning under pressure. How did we get from a world where the NIH was universally recognized as a jewel of scientific research to a world where the government is essentially tearing it down from the inside? I spoke to Collins on Vox's Unexplainable podcast about how so many Americans lost trust in science and how we might be able to get it back. Our interview has been edited for clarity and length. I'm constantly hearing that Americans have lost trust in science. You can look at all the surveys about trust. Americans have lost trust in almost every institution. But I think it was more than that. I think Covid did a lot of harm to people's trust in science because, first of all, it was a huge, disastrous experience for the world. So we often had to change recommendations over time because we learned more about the virus and about the pandemic, and people began to wonder, do these guys know what they're talking about? So suddenly this has become such a target for an attack: whether science is something that's good for our country or not. Your most recent book, The Road to Wisdom, is all about trust. It depends on the particular demographic you're talking about. I'm a person of faith, and certainly people of faith have tended to be among the most skeptical of science, and that goes back 150 years or more — the sense that maybe science is trying to do damage to our Christian faith. But what group was most resistant to accepting the vaccines? I'm a white evangelical Christian, so those are my people, but it broke my heart to see how that happened. And I think Covid did something, took what had been a tendency for science to be political and turned it into a really big deal. Not in the slightest, but that's how it was. When it's becoming clear that more than 50 million Americans aren't getting the vaccine, one of the most remarkable scientific achievements in human history, did that tell you anything about the pursuit of science and how it works? It certainly woke me up to the fact that we apparently had not done a very good job in explaining to people that when science is tackling some really hard problems and occasionally gets the wrong answer, it's going to get self-corrected because science is about truth. Science is not just a bunch of people who are coming up with answers that they like. And maybe here's also where I began to realize Unfortunately, it seems to be doing so right now. It seems like you believed that all you had to do was develop the vaccine, get to the thing that worked, and then people would take it? Then there's this whole other piece of convincing people that you and the scientific community at large didn't do. I was naive about science communication and how it works. You're gonna fill their deficit, and then everything will be fine. But no, it doesn't work that way, especially when there's already skepticism and distrust. You're seen as an elitist who maybe has an ax to grind or something you're trying to put over on them, and you may even do more harm than good by going after somebody's misunderstandings head-on. They're just gonna dig their heels in more thoroughly. I guess what I've learned is we need to do a lot more listening and really understand where people are coming from, and also be prepared to tell stories instead of going down the road with statistics. But this is not the seminar room, people. You were in charge of the NIH during Covid. I wish every time that myself or anybody who was putting forward a public health message would have started off saying, “Look, this is an evolving situation. We still don't know answers to a lot of things we need to know about this pandemic. The other thing is  our one-size-fits-all approach just didn't feel like it made any sense to the public. People in rural communities, who were far away from the carnage that was happening in New York City or Washington, DC, as the virus was running wild, were left wondering: “Why do I have to close my business? I haven't even seen any cases here yet.” I think we lost a lot of people in states that didn't necessarily have heavy academic research centers, who couldn't quite imagine how they should believe us because we didn't seem like we understood what life was like on a small farm in Nebraska. During Covid, my number one goal was to save lives. I assumed there were other people worrying about the economic effects of this and the effects on children's learning when they were kept out of school. It didn't feel like that was my thing. But it became clear to me that that may have been something I was a little bit wearing blinders about. Maybe those other factors about economic harms and harms to children's learning should have been a bit more front and center to the conversations that I was part of. I wish we could do the experiment, and maybe we could figure out a way to do it in some controlled space. There didn't seem to be any penalty for stating something that's absolutely false, though, and I haven't heard anybody apologize for that. When I think about your willingness to have difficult conversations, to accept responsibility for mistakes, it seems like this is something that most people are not doing. I've heard you mention maybe we could have something like a truth and reconciliation commission. Do you think that could have any effect? So amnesty, I don't think we're there. Truth and reconciliation, people were okay with that. Because they can imagine that other people are gonna have to ask for forgiveness for what they did. I hope that this truth and reconciliation option is out there right now. It doesn't quite feel like people are ready to go there. It seems to me like what we need is more people embracing uncertainty, more people talking about their mistakes. Whether it's people with their friends who they disagree with, or whether it's the highest scientists in our scientific agencies. When you're in this circumstance where there seems to be a real pitch battle between the various tribes, it makes it hard for anybody to say, “I might be wrong.” The fact that I've been willing to say that has resulted in a lot of attacks, even from people who I thought were my friends. They said, “Oh no, you can't show weakness like that.” Well, yeah, we really do need to do that, but we need to all do it and not just expect a few people who are then gonna get whacked for it. It's hard right now, and you don't see a lot of that in our country. I would say you're at a really paradoxical time because this is the most incredibly exciting moment for biomedical research. We're on this exponential curve of gathering insights. So if that's your dream to be part of, don't give it up. But the case here is so compelling that I don't believe those facts can be suppressed for very long. You can already look at polls in which the American public says, “I don't think they should be harming medical research.” That's right there. Seventy-seven percent of Americans raise that point in one poll. That's people on both sides of the aisle. If America wants a space program, it needs SpaceX. How Musk's SpaceX became too big to fail for US national security. From disaster warnings to drug development, how AI is generating real-world wins. A step forward in academia's existential fight against scientific fraud. The real cost of forcing foreign students away from elite universities like Harvard.</p>
