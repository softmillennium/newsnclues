                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PA REAL LIFE: Claire secretly got into tarot card reading at 11 . Claire Stone, tarot expert to the stars of Real Housewives of Cheshire and Love Island, who has shared her top tips for manifesting love ahead of Valentine's Day, and revealed what her clients really want to know about their futures. All usage is subject to a fee or incorporated into your outlet's agreed content package. A tarot reader to the stars of Real Housewives Of Cheshire and Love Island has shared her top tips for manifesting love ahead of Valentine's Day, and revealed what her clients really want to know about their futures. Self-described as The White Witch of Cheshire, Claire Stone, 44, said she was a psychic and author who was born with abilities such as astral projection and being able to communicate with spirits and angels. From as young as seven years old, Claire said she remembers playing with a snake spirit animal that she would chase around the living room and that her cousins would follow, but she did not realise at the time that they could not see it. As a result, Claire became scared of the angels and spirits who she said visited her, screaming out to them one night to leave her alone, which she said they did. At 11, Claire said she secretly got into tarot card reading after her friend got a book about it for Christmas, which gave her a lot of comfort at a tumultuous time in her life. She said she was grappling with agoraphobia and instability at home and had reached breaking point by her early teens. Claire told PA Real Life: “I had just had enough of this crap life and I was so fed up. I was really, really scared, but I was equally as intrigued to reawaken that as well,” she said. This is when Claire said she dived head-first into her psychic interests and bought her own deck of tarot cards to do readings for herself and her friends, alongside communicating with angels. It started out as “ridiculous” questions such as, “Will I get a Berghaus coat for Christmas?” and “Does this boy fancy me?”, until Claire said she was giving readings to her friends' older siblings, their parents, and neighbours. By 19, Claire went to college and studied aromatherapy, reflexology, Indian head massage, and reiki, before qualifying as a professional holistic therapist. “I was giving someone a massage one day and all I could think in my head was about green wellington boots,” Claire said. So I asked if green wellies meant anything to her. “She immediately burst into tears because it was the anniversary of her dad's death. That's why she had treated herself to a massage. Claire's career led to producers from the television series The Real Housewives Of Cheshire approaching her to be a featured guest. She said: “I've been on the show loads of times and sometimes it's ridiculous, like doing past-life readings on dogs. Claire said she had become friends with the cast, including doing readings and helping with feng shui to help try and manifest love. “She had this gorgeous painting of a glamorous woman looking over her shoulder, but it was a single woman,” Claire said of one Housewives cast member. “I told her that she needed to get rid of that picture and replace it with something like a couple with their arms around each other or a statue of a couple embracing. I also got her to put two rose quartz crystals under the bed.” Claire said crystals were one way to help manifest love into your life, something she said she got asked a lot about, especially around Valentine's Day. One way to manifest love, she said, is to create a “love corner” in your home: a feng shui principle often implemented in your bedroom or the far right-hand corner of your living space. Claire said that if you were single and you had a double bed but only one bedside table, your romantic energy was blocked because you were not symbolically inviting a partner into your space. Another was through tarot, such as embracing the “two of cups” card, which represented harmony, romantic partnership, and mutual attraction. Claire suggested placing this imagery in your love corner or changing your phone screen background to it to invite the energy in. She said: “People will say things like, ‘I'll never meet anyone' or ‘all men are bastards', but you're never going to attract love until you've got rid of that. The most common question Claire said she gets during her £111 tarot card reading sessions is about work and business, then a lot about whether exes will come back into her clients' lives. For the latter, Claire said: “I'm very cautious with this because I know it's quite unhealthy for people to be hung up on past partners, so I tell them we can do a cord-cutting ritual together, which is a ceremony where you are releasing the energy of your ex-partner. Or you could write everything down and then burn it. Again, it's very much about changing the way you think.” Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A group of teens plays around with an Aztec death whistle, leading to expected results, in Whistle, which premiered at last year's Fantastic Fest and opens in Prague and cinemas worldwide this weekend. The result is a wildly entertaining supernatural chiller that embraces the inherent silliness of its well-worn template and dials things up to 11. Backed by some engaging performances and showstopping scenes of gore, Whistle is as entertaining as the so-bad-its-good classic Wish Upon … only the filmmakers know exactly what they're doing here. 'ed and killed your dad,” varsity basketball star Dean (Jhaleil Swaby) teases her before taking a knee to the groin. Two scenes later, these characters are the best of friends. Also among the core friend group: prom queen type Grace (Ali Skovbye), Dean's girl and Rel's crush, and Ellie (Sophie Nélisse), who immediately shares some meaningful glances with Chrys that develop into a romance. Decidedly not in their friend group: “youth pastor” Noah (Percy Hynes White), who deals drugs to his flock, corners Chrys with an offer of free goofballs on her first day in school, and turns into a villain of utterly baffling motivation. But Chrys and co. have more pressing matters to attend to: namely, that Aztec death whistle she finds in her locker, left over from Horse (Stephen Kalyn), who spontaneously combusted in the locker room in Whistle‘s opening scene. Mr. Craven (Nick Frost) gives us another taste of what the whistle can do before Grace blows it at a pool party and casts their fate. That sets Whistle up for some bravura gore sequences, which include characters being pursued by their own mangled corpses from car wrecks and industrial accidents. When the corpse catches up to you, the moment of death is re-created, resulting in some genuinely impressive—and stomach-churning—effects work as characters are isolated and violently maimed; unlike other recent horror films (Primate), Whistle doesn't play its card too early, resulting in some showstopping sequences at the climax. The script (by Owen Egerton) is wall-to-wall clichés, but director Hardy turns that into a strength by pushing everything so over-the-top his film becomes a satire full of not-so-subtle in-jokes. Viewers expecting something as serious-minded as Talk to Me might be put off by what's on display, but those who can appreciate the film's sarcastic tune will find a lot to like. Strong performances also help: Whistle has an unusually engaging central performance from Keen—evoking memories of a Beetlejuice-era Winona Ryder—that breaks through a real lack of characterization in the script and exceeds anything we might usually expect from these kinds of films. Whistle succeeds not by reinventing the teen horror formula but by fully committing to it, embracing its clichés with a knowing wink and escalating them into gleeful excess. Anchored by a strong central performance from Keen and elevated by outrageous gore sequences, the film finds its identity as a self-aware supernatural chiller that understands exactly how ridiculous the premise is—and blows right into it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The prime minister's name comes up dozens of times but the records themselves do not support online claims that Carney and Epstein were linked. The prime minister's name comes up dozens of times but the records themselves do not support online claims that Carney and Epstein were linked. Many of the conspiracy theories linking Prime Minister Mark Carney to Jeffrey Epstein were sparked by this 2013 photo of Carney, in purple, standing next to Ghislaine Maxwell, a close Epstein associate, at a music festival. The latest trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein reveals to new extents the relationships the notorious sex offender held with prominent and powerful figures, from Elon Musk to Bill Gates to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew. The disclosure has also revived conspiracy theorists' attempts to connect the late financier to a particularly prominent Canadian: Prime Minister Mark Carney. Fringe social media accounts, doubling down on claims they made during the last federal election, are pointing to Carney's name cropping up in the records as proof the two men were linked — even though a mere cursory read of the records that name Carney show they do not support the claim. There is one email in which Epstein's associates discuss attending an event at which Carney is speaking. There's another in which a financial activist mentions the scrutiny Carney was facing at the time regarding a different scandal involving an investment firm that went under, taking the live savings of some clients with it. The Epstein files shine a light on the relationships the notorious sex offender held with wealthy and powerful figures, among them former U.S. president Bill Clinton, Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger and Virgin Group chairman Richard Branson. There is no correspondence between Carney and Epstein, and no suggestion that Carney had any involvement with Epstein's crimes. (“The Prime Minister did not know and has never met Mr. Epstein,” a spokesperson said in a statement.) Other Canadian political figures, including Justin Trudeau and Stephen Harper, also show up in the latest Epstein drop for similar reasons. Carney's mention in the Epstein files, even when it's just via news briefs, fuels a persistent conspiracy theory about him, particularly how his time at the Bank of England feeds into narratives about shadowy financial elites, says Amarnath Amarasingam, an associate professor who studies conspiracy theories and online communities at Queen's University. “A lot of conspiracy theories equate power with nefarious activity and control, so that's a lot of what we are seeing here.” Online conspiracy mongers have tried to link Carney to Epstein as early as the election campaign last summer. (A source close to Carney told the Star at the time that Maxwell went to school with Carney's wife's sister and that she and Carney were “not friends.”) Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in an undated photo. Despite any actual evidence linking Carney and Maxwell outside of a family connection, the conspiracy gained steam thanks to AI-generated images of Carney and Epstein. In Spring 2025, there was what the Canadian Digital Media Research Network called “a surge in suspicious posts on social media spreading false claims.” The online discourse leaked into the real world, when then-Liberal leader Carney was heckled at a campaign rally in March. They're less a cohesive set of documents than a hodgepodge of records from different departments, including files from FBI investigations, unclassified records, communications and court records. There are duplicates and redactions — meaning names or photos that have been blacked out — are inconsistent. Transparency into the online files has some limitations, as some documents, including those that are written by hand, are not searchable. In 2021, Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking for her role in helping to recruit underage victims and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Sorry, there was an error processing your request.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Footage showing a UFO-like object is going viral on social media, reigniting curiosity about parallel universes. The recently surfaced video is from 2012 and it shows glowing tri-orbs moving over the Persian Gulf. As per a report by the New York Post, the videos are leaked footage recorded by the US military purportedly showing UFO-like objects operating over the Middle East. The video captured in 2012 shows three lights or orbs in a triangular formation. The video was taken by an MQ-9 Reaper drone's infrared sensors. ‘LEAKED' US AIR FORCE VIDEO OF UFOs IN MIDDLE EAST — NYP pic.twitter.com/jnrd47LKMe— RT (@RT_com) February 7, 2026 The one-minute clip showing mysterious glowing objects was released recently by reporters and prominent UFO researchers George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell, NYP reported. George Knapp spoke about the footage on his podcast and said, “This is a military-recorded, sensor-generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. And clearly, you watch this, and that's not what it is." The objects demonstrate abrupt changes of direction and the thermographic Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) detected no heat or other signatures that mark traditional propulsion systems, according to the Knapp and Corbell report in Weaponized.</p>
