                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pudgy Penguins Hit New York City With Valentine's Day Pop-Up Event The Pudgy Penguins team is helping fans celebrate Valentine's Day in the real world with Pudgy Petals, a three-day immersive pop-up event in New York City that highlights gifting and connection via its colorful characters. The team told Decrypt that the brand—which has expanded from NFTs to games, real-world toys, and beyond—is using Valentine's Day as a cultural entry point to continue to translate its internet-native IP into a broader brand. Pengu and Polly are taking over NYC this Valentine's Day! Join us at our Pudgy Petals pop-up store from February 12-14 for a celebration of our Valentine's Day collection, love, and all things Pudgy. “The Plushie Bouquet marks our first Valentine's Day expression,” Pudgy Penguins Director of Business Development Steve Starobinsky told Decrypt. “The item is intentionally positioned as a long-lasting symbol of companionship designed to be kept and revisited rather than discarded after a few days like traditional flowers or candy. The event includes on-site bouquet customization with flash tattoos, free aura readings, and couples photo booths. Thursday, February 12, aligns with both New York Fashion Week and the New York Toy Fair, tapping into a creative crowd already circulating downtown Manhattan. Friday, February 13, is branded as Polly's Galentine's, with a focus on friendship and groups. “Every detail of the pop-up is intentionally designed to encourage guests to linger, participate, document the experience, and share it socially,” Starobinsky said. Beyond the Valentine's theme, Pudgy Petals represents a broader brand evolution. Pudgy Penguins, which began as an internet-native phenomenon and NFT project, is continuing its shift into physical retail and experiential spaces that require no familiarity with crypto. The pop-up prioritizes emotional storytelling and accessibility, rather than technology. “Pudgy Petals is not a one-time activation,” Starobinsky added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold is seen as a store of wealth, but what does Bitcoin offer? Gold is a metal that has long been used as currency. At one point, paper currency was backed by a gold reserve. That's no longer the case, but gold is still seen as a store of wealth because it is a physical asset. In the digital world, things are different. Investors have taken to cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC +2.69%) as a store of wealth. Geopolitical and economic concerns have investors on edge. Sure, the S&P 500 is trading near all-time highs, but that hasn't stopped Wall Street from buying gold as a hedge against a market or economic crash. To be fair, gold has risen dramatically over the past year, though sometimes in a volatile fashion. As a commodity, gold is prone to material price swings. That means you can use it to buy things in a worst-case scenario, no matter what happens on Wall Street or Main Street. Unlike gold, however, Bitcoin isn't a physical asset. That limits its use in the worst scenarios, like a total economic collapse. Bitcoin has been around for a few years, but compared to gold, it is still a brand-new asset class. It's largely untested as a store of wealth. Until Bitcoin has been through a deep bear market or recession, there's no way to know whether it will be a store of wealth like gold has historically been. Only the most aggressive investors should own Bitcoin, thinking that it is a store of wealth like gold. Of course, it's also true that only the most aggressive investors should allocate more than a small portion of their assets to gold. Speculating on gold or Bitcoin price moves isn't for the faint of heart. Reuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bitcoin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a rocky week, the bitcoin price is trading above $71,000. The recovery comes as institutional investors appear to be treating sub-$70,000 bitcoin as a renewed buying opportunity, even while retail traders search for signs the market has reached a bottom. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said in a CNBC interview that bitcoin's pullback is landing differently with large investors than with long-time holders. “I think long-time holders are feeling unsure,” Horsley said. Horsley added that some institutional buyers are now seeing price levels they believed they had permanently missed, as bitcoin gets “swept up” in a broader macro-driven selloff across liquid risk assets. While institutions have been stepping in, retail participants have been scanning the market for confirmation that the sell-off has fully exhausted itself. “Retail traders are trying to meta-analyze the market, looking for signs of others quitting to time their own entries,” Santiment wrote. Adding to all this, ProCap Financial CIO Jeff Park suggested bitcoin price's next major bull-market catalyst may not come from Federal Reserve rate cuts — but from bitcoin's ability to rise even in a tightening environment. Last week, crypto exchange Bithumb said it accidentally sent out more than $40 billion worth of Bitcoin during a promotional rewards event after a payout error gave some users thousands of BTC instead of a small cash reward. A small amount — about 125 BTC worth roughly $9 million — remains unrecovered, and Bithumb said it will cover the losses with corporate funds. Bitcoin price was trading above $71,400 at the time of publication, stabilizing after days of extreme volatility that rattled both crypto and broader financial markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He argued that falling Bitcoin prices force financial institutions that issue these notes to sell the underlying asset to manage their risk exposure. Finance professionals refer to this process as delta hedging. The products include specific risk-management features, such as principal-protection levels. While this mechanism is standard in traditional equity markets, Hayes noted that it creates a feedback loop in the crypto sector where selling begets further selling. “I will be compiling a complete list of all issued notes by the banks to better understand trigger points that could cause rapid price rises and falls,” Hayes wrote. However, Hayes clarified that he does not believe there is a "secret plot" to crash the market. He emphasized that these derivatives do not inherently instigate market movements but rather amplify volatility in both upward and downward directions. Meanwhile, other market participants have attributed the decline to broader macroeconomic headwinds and even quantum computing security concerns. Bi posited that the seller was likely a large, Asia-based player. This entity reportedly evaded early detection by market watchers because it lacks deep ties to crypto-native counterparties. According to Bi's theory, the entity was likely engaged in leveraged market-making strategies on Binance, funded by the Japanese yen carry trade. These two analysis underscores a fundamental shift in the digital asset sector. It shows that complex trading strategies, rather than retail sentiment alone, increasingly influence Bitcoin's price action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the fast-moving world of tech, one thing never changes: waves of massive hype followed by harsh reality checks. From the promise of  revolutionizing everything to the current frenzy around AI, the industry has a habit of selling dreams that often turn into nightmares. If you've been in tech for a while, you've seen it all – clouds that aren't clouds, services that lock you in, and coins that vanish overnight. This post dives deep into these , focusing on blockchain and crypto, and asks: when will the next bubble burst? Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, tech felt like steady progress. But after the 2008 financial crash, things shifted. Companies needed quick wins to boost stock prices, and marketers stepped in with big promises. A seasoned Linux developer at a recent conference nailed it: we've had over 15 years of non-stop hype cycles. These aren't just buzzwords – they cost businesses billions and waste developers' time. Let's count the major waves, starting with the early ones and building to blockchain and beyond. It kicked off around 2002 with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Spin up virtual machines on demand, no hardware hassles. But dig deeper: the cloud is just servers in a data center run by a big company. You're trusting them with your data, paying premium prices, and locked into their ecosystem. For most businesses, buying your own servers or using private hosting works fine and cheaper. By 2004, SaaS exploded with tools like Gmail and early Salesforce. Why install software when you can subscribe? Fast-forward, and it's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) – all promising freedom from IT headaches. You're renting access to your own data. No control over servers, updates, or storage. One outage, and your business stops. Classic pitfalls from network computing fallacies: assume networks are fast and reliable? Lesson: If you care about your data, manage it yourself. Handy for testing apps in isolation. Kubernetes (K8s) followed in 2014 – a tool to orchestrate containers at massive scale. Only if you're handling millions of users spiking at once – which won't happen for most. Pro Tip: One Big Server approach often wins for simplicity and cost. Enter 2008: Bitcoin's whitepaper drops amid the financial crisis. Blockchain truth: It's a slow, energy-guzzling database that's super distributed – great for theory, terrible for speed. In blockchain and crypto, hype met reality hard. Early adopters made bank, but retail investors got wrecked. But DeFi scams and 90% of tokens hitting zero? SEO keywords like ‘blockchain myths' and ‘crypto bubble burst' trend because people are waking up. LLMs promise to code, write, create. But it's transformer models predicting next words – glorified autocomplete. Can't count past 10 reliably, hallucinates facts. Both sold as world-changers but deliver meh. AI needs massive data centers (hello, cloud hypocrisy), and outputs are ‘kinda true' slop. Gentoo and NetBSD banned it for code – smart move. Own your stack: Bare metal > containers > cloud for most. Crypto caveat: Blockchain shines in niches like secure ledgers, but avoid shiny tokens. Stick to Bitcoin or Ethereum for stores of value. Use it for drafts, not decisions. The tech industry thrives on BS, but savvy pros see through it. In blockchain and crypto, we've learned: decentralization is hard, scams are easy. Build real value, ignore the noise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has urged the cryptocurrency industry to resist drifting away from its foundational practices, arguing that innovation in blockchain technology should build on established principles rather than discard them in pursuit of short-term trends. Buterin's remarks were shared in a recent public appearance and later highlighted by the X account Coinvo. The comments come amid rapid experimentation across the crypto sector, where new financial products, scaling solutions, and governance models are being introduced at an accelerating pace. In his remarks, Buterin emphasized that many of crypto's early design choices were responses to real-world problems, not outdated habits that should be abandoned lightly. According to Buterin, decentralization, transparency, and simplicity remain core strengths of crypto systems. While technological progress is essential, he argued that innovation should refine these concepts rather than replace them with opaque or overly centralized alternatives. His comments appeared aimed at a growing segment of the industry focused on rapid product deployment and financialization. Buterin clarified that “old habits” does not mean resisting change or rejecting new technology. Instead, he referred to long-standing practices such as open-source development, cautious protocol upgrades, and community-driven governance. These practices, he said, help ensure that blockchain systems remain resilient and trustworthy over time. Industry analysts note that these principles often slow development but reduce the risk of catastrophic failure, an increasingly relevant concern as blockchains handle larger volumes of value. The crypto industry has evolved dramatically over the past decade, expanding from simple peer-to-peer transactions into complex ecosystems involving decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and institutional-grade infrastructure. With that growth has come pressure to optimize for speed, scale, and profit. His remarks reflect a broader debate within the industry about whether crypto should prioritize mainstream adoption or remain focused on its original mission. The comments gained wider visibility after Coinvo shared excerpts of Buterin's remarks on X, prompting discussion across developer forums and social media platforms. Mainstream coverage has similarly framed Buterin's message as guidance rather than condemnation. Supporters argue that Ethereum's cautious, research-driven approach has allowed it to adapt without sacrificing its core values. Critics contend that the pace of change has left room for faster-moving competitors. For developers, Buterin's message reinforces the importance of thoughtful design and long-term thinking. Buterin's remarks are part of a wider conversation about maturity in the crypto sector. The debate is likely to intensify as regulatory scrutiny grows and institutional participation increases. While Buterin did not call for specific policy changes or technical rollbacks, his comments add weight to ongoing discussions about responsible innovation. hokanews will continue to monitor statements from industry leaders and provide updates as verified information becomes available.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) has declined noticeably over the past week, with price data from CoinMarketCap reporting a net 14% decline within this period. Typically, when funding is highly positive or negative, it means that too many traders are on one side, positions are overleveraged, and then the market becomes unstable. At that point, even a small price move in the opposite direction can trigger liquidations, causing sharp and fast price moves. Although Ethereum's funding rate was deeply negative over the week, analyst Amr Taha noted there has been a flip as ETH derivatives data shows a clear shift toward bullish positioning. Notably, Funding rates have turned strongly positive on BitMEX (Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange), reaching 0.049%, their highest level since October and well above the previous peak near 0.03. Extreme Optimism In ETH Could Spark Sharp Moves At the same time, ETH funding on Binance has moved from deeply negative levels at -0.025% on February 5 back towards neutral, indicating that short positions are being replaced by new long exposure. In essence, the market has moved from fear to optimism. While this shift reflects a rise in bullish sentiments, history shows that periods of extreme positive funding driven by leverage often increase the risk of liquidations and sharp corrective moves, rather than supporting sustained upside. In all, Ethereum Derivatives traders have become aggressively bullish, and while that can push price higher in the short term, history shows it often increases the risk of sudden corrective moves rather than a sustained uptrend. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 32.39% and valued at $37.39 billion. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jakarta, Pintu News – The Crypto Clarity Act is a draft policy andregulatory framework that aims to provideregulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency industry. This initiative emerged as a response to the regulatory uncertainty that has overshadowed industry players, investors, and blockchain technology developers. With the Crypto Clarity Act, regulators are expected to have clearer boundaries of authority, while market participants gain legal certainty. The Crypto Clarity Act refers to a legislative effort that regulates the classification of crypto assets more strictly. The main focus is to distinguish whether a crypto asset is categorized as a security, commodity, or another form of digital asset. This clarity of classification is a key foundation for supervision and enforcement. Through this approach, the Crypto Clarity Act seeks to reduce overlapping authority between regulatory agencies. It also aims to create consistent standards so that technological innovation is not hampered by legal uncertainty. Also Read: 5 BTC History Facts February often bounces back after January slump! Over the years, the crypto industry has faced regulatory uncertainty that has led to legal disputes and market confusion. This has resulted in slow institutional adoption and increased legal risks. With a clearer legal framework, regulators can focus on consumer protection, while industry players can operate with more stable regulatory certainty. The main objective of the Crypto Clarity Act is to provide a clear legal definition of crypto assets. This regulation also touches on aspects of consumer protection and information transparency. Businesses are required to provide adequate disclosure regarding the risks and structure of crypto products. With this framework, the responsibilities of each party become more defined and measurable. For investors, the Crypto Clarity Act provides stronger legal protection. This is important for making more rational investment decisions. With clearer regulations, the potential for gray and fraudulent practices is expected to be reduced. Investors also gain greater transparency regarding the obligations of market participants and applicable compliance standards. Companies can design business models that are compliant with regulations from the start. This encourages healthier and more sustainable ecosystem growth. On the other hand, overly strict regulation remains a concern. The risk of over-regulation can stifle innovation if not implemented adaptively. These challenges demand international coordination to keep crypto regulation relevant and effective. With clearer definitions and classifications, it has the potential to enhance investor protection while encouraging innovation. Its success will largely depend on the balance between oversight and regulatory flexibility.
