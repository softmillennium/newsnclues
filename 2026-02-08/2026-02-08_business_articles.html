Thailand's ruling conservative party clinched a surprisingly solid election win Sunday night, marking the first victory this century for a party aligned with the country's royalist establishment and a clear defeat for an emerging progressive movement. 

The Bhumjaithai Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, is set to secure 194 seats out of a possible 500 in the House of Representatives, according to preliminary results from the country's Election Commission, with votes from about 82% of the polling stations counted. The pro-democracy People's Party, which had been leading in the pre-poll surveys, was on track for 108. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Morgan McSweeney said he took responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Mandelson, 72, to Britain's most important diplomatic post in 2024. "The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. "When asked, I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice." Starmer is facing a political storm and questions about his judgment after newly published documents, part of a huge trove of Epstein files made public in the United States, suggested that Mandelson sent market-sensitive information to the convicted sex offender when he was the U.K. government's business secretary during the 2008 financial crisis. Starmer's government has promised to release its own emails and other documentation related to Mandelson's appointment, which it says will show that Mandelson misled officials. The prime minister apologized this week for "having believed Mandelson's lies." A number of lawmakers said Starmer is ultimately responsible for the scandal. "Keir Starmer has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions," said Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party. Mandelson, a former Cabinet minister, ambassador and elder statesman of the governing Labour Party, has not been arrested or charged. Metropolitan Police officers searched Mandelson's London home and another property linked to him on Friday. Police said the investigation is complex and will require "a significant amount of further evidence gathering and analysis." The U.K. police investigation centers on potential misconduct in public office, and Mandelson is not accused of any sexual offenses. They argue that he should have known better than to appoint Mandelson in the first place. The new revelations include documents suggesting Mandelson shared sensitive government information with Epstein after the 2008 global financial crisis. They also include records of payments totaling $75,000 in 2003 and 2004 from Epstein to accounts linked to Mandelson or his husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva. Aside from his association with Epstein, Mandelson previously had to resign twice from senior government posts because of scandals over money or ethics. Starmer had faced growing pressure over the past week to fire McSweeney, who is regarded as a key adviser in Downing Street and seen as a close ally of Mandelson. Starmer on Sunday credited McSweeney as a central figure in Labour's recent election campaign and its 2004 landslide victory. His statement did not mention the Mandelson scandal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, quit on Sunday, saying he took responsibility for advising Starmer to name Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the U.S. despite his known links to Jeffrey Epstein. After new files revealed the depth of the Labour veteran's relationship with the late sex offender, Starmer is facing what is widely seen as the gravest crisis of his 18 months in power over his decision to send Mandelson to Washington in 2024. The loss of McSweeney, 48, a strategist who was instrumental in Starmer's rise to power, is the latest in a series of setbacks, less than two years after the Labour Party won one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern British history. With polls showing Starmer is hugely unpopular with voters after a series of embarrassing U-turns, some in his own party are openly questioning his judgment and his future, and it remains to be seen whether McSweeney's exit will be enough to silence critics. The files released in the U.S. on January 30 sparked a police investigation for misconduct in office over indications that Mandelson leaked market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was a government minister during the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010. In a statement, McSweeney said: "The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. "When asked, I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice." The leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, said the resignation was overdue and that "Keir Starmer has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions". Nigel Farage, head of the populist Reform UK party, which is leading in the polls, said he believed Starmer's time would soon be up. Starmer has spent the last week defending McSweeney, a strategy that could prompt further questions about his own judgment. In a statement on Sunday, Starmer said it had been "an honour" working with him. One Labour lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said McSweeney's resignation had come too late: "It buys the PM time, but it's still the end of days. "Starmer sacked Mandelson as ambassador in September over his links to Epstein. The government agreed last week to release virtually all previously private communications between members of his government from the time when Mandelson was being appointed. If previously secret messages about how London planned to approach its relationship with Donald Trump are made public, it could damage Starmer's relationship with the U.S. president. McSweeney had held the role of chief of staff since October 2024, when he was handed the job following the resignation of Sue Gray after a row over pay and donations. Starmer on Sunday appointed his deputy chiefs of staff, Jill Cuthbertson and Vidhya Alakeson, to serve as joint acting chiefs of staff.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has likely strengthened its majority in the country's Lower House, with the LDP capturing between 274 and 328 in the 465 seat chamber, according to an early projection by broadcaster NHK. This was broadly in line with what polls had suggested, with Nikkei and Asahi Shimbun predicting that the LDP and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party would secure more then 300 seats in the Lower House. NHK projected the coalition would win up to 366 seats. People trudged through heavy snow in several parts of the country to cast their votes. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female leader, dissolved the Lower House on Jan. 23, a move that was seen as an attempt to quickly strengthen the ruling coalition's position in the chamber by capitalizing on her high public approval ratings. "Takaichi now has the LDP and the technocrats exactly where she always wanted them," economist Jesper Koll said in a Substack post. "The LDP is now beholden to her; and the elite technocrats now know she'll be in power for at least two or three more years … so they have no choice but to invest their career in her success," Koll added. Polls compiled by Japanese media outlet Nippon.com showed that Takaichi remained popular heading into the election, although her support had slipped slightly in the recent weeks. The outlet reported that just one domestic poll in January indicated more than 70% support, compared to three in December, while six polls showed support in the 60% range, up from four in the previous month. Meanwhile, the Central Reform Alliance, made up of the former Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito, the LDP's former coalition partner, was likely to pick up between 37 and 91 seats. The CDP was the largest opposition party before its merger with Komeito, holding 148 seats, while Komeito controlled 24 seats. Japan has endured inflation above the Bank of Japan's target for 45 consecutive months, declining real wages and persistent yen weakness. Real wages fell for 11 consecutive months year-on-year in 2025, and on a yearly basis, real wages have fallen every year since 2022. While a weaker currency benefits exporters, it has also amplified imported inflation. Takaichi had earlier laid out a record $783 billion budget for the next fiscal year starting April 1, on top of a $135 billion stimulus package introduced last year to help households with rising living costs. "Watch for more state-directed initiatives to create 'national champions', levering the $550 [billion] U.S.-Japan investment deal to create a sense of urgency amongst reluctant CEOs," Koll said. "Japan's M&A boom will get turbo-charged to create greater economies of scale, and thus more credible global competitiveness — all this in the name of higher national economic security."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest earnings reports from major technology companies have revived investors' concerns about payoffs on elevated artificial intelligence (AI) spending. While some companies failed to impress investors, others proved their ability to capitalize on solid growth opportunities offered by the ongoing AI boom. With their expertise and in-depth analysis, top Wall Street analysts can help investors select stocks that can outperform the broader market and deliver impressive growth. Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) is this week's first pick. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AAPL stock, with an "outperform" rating and a price target of $289. However, Daryanani pointed out that Gaming revenues fell on a year-over-year basis for a third consecutive month, with January revenues down 3%. He explained that this weakness was due to tougher year-over-year comparisons. He expects Gaming revenues to see easier comparisons through the rest of the first half of calendar year 2026. Daryanani highlighted that despite ongoing weakness in the Gaming category, revenues from the other five categories of App Store revenue grew by double digits, led by Music (up 21%), Other (21%), Photo and Video (18%), Social Networking (11%) and Entertainment (10%). The analyst stated that Apple continues to deliver robust growth in Services revenue despite subdued App Store data, with the December quarter seeing 14% growth compared to the App Store's 6.5% growth. Daryanani also noted that Apple's recently reported revenue and EPS (earnings per share) for the December quarter exceeded expectations, with the company delivering better-than-expected gross margin, driven by limited memory impact and robust Services growth. ), helping to offset <10% growth in App Store revs," said Daryanani. 160 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Database software provider MongoDB (MDB) is next on the list. Bank of America analyst Koji Ikeda is optimistic about the company's growth prospects. He recently reaffirmed a buy rating on MDB stock and raised his price forecast to $500 from $480. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on MongoDB stock with a price target of $380. Commenting on concerns over whether MongoDB's Atlas revenue growth will keep accelerating, Ikeda sees the potential for continued strength. His optimism is backed by the success of the company's top-down enterprise and bottom-up product-led growth approach and an expanding product lineup for artificial intelligence (AI) and legacy app modernization. The analyst also expects MongoDB to gain from higher consumption, driven by rising enterprise workloads. Ikeda highlighted the strengths of MongoDB database, saying it is fast, scalable and document-based, differentiating it from conventional relational databases like Oracle. While MDB stock is trading at a higher valuation compared to infrastructure software peers, Ikeda believes that a premium is justified, given the 30% Atlas growth compared to 11% for peers and MongoDB's leading position in the database market. 689 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Data storage company Western Digital (WDC) recently announced better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and issued solid guidance. Following Western Digital's Innovation Day, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan reaffirmed a buy rating on WDC stock with a price target of $345. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on Western Digital with a price target of $285. Mohan noted that Western Digital expects the AI and cloud storage market to grow exabytes (EB), a measure of data storage, at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of over 25% through 2030. Additionally, Mohan emphasized Western Digital's revised long-term growth targets. Over the next three to five years, the company aims to grow its nearline exabytes at mid-20% CAGR, with overall revenue above 20% CAGR. Mohan highlighted that a favorable mix shift to higher capacity HDDs, stable pricing, and a focus on cost improvements could fuel gross margin above 50%, an operating margin of more than 40%, and EPS higher than $20. Meanwhile, Western Digital is planning capital spending at 4% to 6% of annual revenue and a free cash flow margin of more than 30%. Overall, Mohan is bullish on WDC's prospects based on "secular growth of the HDD market," as well as further gross margin upside. 110 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

That dream became a reality when Lily, who's a remote special education teacher, got pregnant, and the couple faced the soaring costs of childcare and Lily's grandparents' growing needs. Lily and Alex's son, Xander, was born in April 2025. Every time Eliza publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox!

The number of people in the US living in multigenerational households — or those with two or more adult generations — quadrupled between 1971 and 2021, according to Pew Research. "When I considered how much I enjoyed my work and teaching and the level of care my grandparents were needing, and seeing the impacts of that on my mom as their primary caregiver, I became more and more convinced that the intergenerational model would be most beneficial for everybody in the family," Lily said. Mornings in the Telloyan-Van Loh house start around 6:30 am, when Xander wakes up. Lily and Naomi make breakfast as Alex, who works in cybersecurity, leaves for the office. Naomi, who also works part-time as a remote educator, takes care of her grandson and her parents while the other adults are working. The childcare arrangement has allowed Lily to keep her job, which she loves. "Running the numbers, it seems like a wash, honestly, to pay for childcare on a teacher's salary," she said. Eva, who's 87, has dementia and needs constant attention. Professional long-term care, like assisted living, would strain the family's finances and wouldn't give Naomi the peace of mind she has with her parents under her roof, she said. She takes classes on caregiving at the local library. "I don't know how we would do it the other way," said Naomi, 58, said of Eva's care. "And, for me, knowing that she's safe, knowing that she's comfortable, knowing that she's happy, and I can see her and hear her, and I take care of everything she needs — to me that's worth more than money in the bank." They've divided up the house so each couple has their own space. "I had to learn really early on — and I'm still not great at that — that we shouldn't really keep a running record, or try to keep things even when it comes to workload, we just all chip in and do our best as we are able," Lily said. Sam often tells Naomi he worries that he and Eva are a burden on her and the family. But Naomi insists that she wouldn't have it any other way. "We have this kind of ongoing conversation, too, about the balance between duty and desire for motivation," Naomi said. "Some people think it's your duty, you have to do this." Lily chimed in, "The best case scenario is when you desire to do your duty." Logistics get a bit complicated when it comes to entertaining friends. The family has a shared calendar they use to plan their social engagements and travel six months in advance. Small things like a messy closet can create tension, so they're quick to address even minor infractions. Lily and Naomi said they sometimes feel misunderstood by friends. "When my friends hear about our lifestyle, we get a lot of negative comments, like, 'Oh, you need to be more independent.' Or like, 'Oh, are you doing this for financial reasons? Or are you saving up for a house?'" "I think now we're in a pretty stable place."</p>

However, America's sweet tooth doesn't retire — it just hunts for its next obsession. As restaurant chains face higher costs and more cautious consumers who have less patience for one-note indulgences, the sudden disappearance of a once-dominant dessert brand underscores how little room there is for concepts that don't necessarily drive frequent repeat visits. Asit Sharma, a senior investing analyst at The Motley Fool, put it bluntly: "Sprinkles Cupcakes just punched way beyond its weight in the public imagination than it ever did on the ground."

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sprinkles is credited with being the world's first cupcake-only bakery, helping to popularize the craze that spawned dozens, if not hundreds, of copycats. "We know that expansion isn't always the first priority of a private equity firm when it takes over a chain; profits are, so that's not surprising," Sharma said. "Dessert chains in particular are really prone to fads — frozen yogurt is a perfect example," Jonathan Maze, editor in chief of Restaurant Business, said. "We've had two frozen yogurt booms, one in the 80s and 90s, and then one coming out of the Great Recession," Maze added. In the boom phase, he said, "You just get a lot of copycat concepts. Gourmet doughnuts followed a similar trajectory in the late 2000s before cupcakes gained steam. The cupcake trend, Maze said, although once promising, in part due to its early, pre-social media, viral appeal, "just didn't quite have the legs that people thought it did — but that happens fairly routinely." That question carries new weight in a tighter economy, where consumers are increasingly choosy about when — and how often — they treat themselves. Sharma's immediate answer: "I think it's got to be the international bakery craze." He described noticing both Korean and Vietnamese concepts start to crop up across both coasts — with brands like Paris Baguette, 85°C Bakery Cafe, and Tous les Jours trending online and growing their footprints nationwide. Nothing Bundt Cakes also shows promise as a contender to become the next "it" sweet after years of being a quiet hit. The company, which had the most positive review sentiment for quality and taste of all food brands on Yelp's "Most Loved Brands of 2025" list, is on track to open 1,000 units by 2027. Maze, meanwhile, thinks cookies have an advantage that cupcakes and fro-yo never fully did: they're an everyday treat that doesn't require a dedicated occasion to enjoy. That accessibility has led to names like Crumbl, Insomnia Cookies, and Levain Bakery gaining momentum quickly. "Cookies are actually pretty fascinating, to be perfectly honest," Maze said. He also credited Insomnia Cookies' model for creating specific demand after the brand designed its own occasion — late-night cookie cravings — and answered the make-or-break question for any specialty dessert chain: how often will customers really show up? "The biggest challenge with that sector by a long shot is that you only get a Blizzard or doughnuts so often," Maze said. That dynamic is what doomed frozen yogurt, dulled the cupcake boom, and now leaves the dessert category in a moment of reshuffling, as chains chase recipes that feel special enough to justify the splurge in a stretched economy. What comes next — cookies, international bakeries, bundt cakes, or something still incubating on TikTok — will face the same test.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Sunday that the man suspected of shooting top Russian military intelligence officer Vladimir Alexeyev in Moscow has been detained in Dubai and handed over to Russia. Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev, deputy head of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence arm, was shot several times in an apartment block in Moscow on Friday, investigators said. He underwent surgery after the shooting, Russian media said. The FSB said a Russian citizen named Lyubomir Korba was detained in Dubai on suspicion of carrying out the shooting. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Ukraine of being behind the assassination attempt, which he said was designed to sabotage peace talks. Ukraine said it had nothing to do with the shooting. Alexeyev's boss, Admiral Igor Kostyukov, the head of the GRU, has been leading Russia's delegation in negotiations with Ukraine in Abu Dhabi on security-related aspects of a potential peace deal.

Will Lewis' two-year tenure as publisher of the Washington Post is over. His time leading the nearly 150-year-old newspaper, which was bought by billionaire Jeff Bezos in 2013, was marked by buyouts and shrinking coverage. "Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus," Bezos said in a statement on Saturday, his first public comments since the layoffs. Below is the text of memos emailed to Post staff announcing Lewis' departure and the appointment of Chief Financial Officer Jeff D'Onofrio as acting publisher. During my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customers each day. "The Washington Post is announcing Jeff D'Onofrio as its acting Publisher and CEO, effective immediately. D'Onofrio, a strategic business leader and proven architect of the new media landscape, joined The Post in June 2025 as Chief Financial Officer following leadership roles across global companies including Raptive, Tumblr, Yahoo and Google. He succeeds William Lewis, who has served as Publisher and CEO for the past two years. "I am honored to become part of charting that future and to take the lead in securing both the legacy and business of this fierce, storied American institution." Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. D'Onofrio served as Chief Financial Officer for Raptive, the largest digital ad management company serving over 6,000 creators and publishers. Immediately prior to his role at Raptive, D'Onofrio was Chief Executive Officer at Tumblr and held other key leadership positions there including President, Chief Operating Officer, and CFO. His expert fluency in both today's media business landscape also grew from his leadership and management roles at Google, Zagat, Yahoo!, and Major League Baseball (MLB Advanced Media)."</p>
