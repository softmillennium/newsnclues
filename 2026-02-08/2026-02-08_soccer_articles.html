                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States' Men's Under-17 National Team went on a 10-0 rout Saturday evening against Saint Kitts and Nevis in its second match of the 2026 CONCACAF U-17 World Cup Qualifying. Thus, the United States needed to beat Saint Kitts and Nevis by eight or more goals to bring its own goal differential above that mark going into the final match of the qualifier. Philadelphia Union II's striker Malik Jakupovic, who had scored two goals off the bench against Saint Vincent on Thursday, and Union Academy's goalkeeper Matthew White started in the match. He scored his third goal in two matches after a ball perfectly whipped in by Myles Gardner on the right sideline. Gardner assisted Jakupovic's first goal in the U17s previous match, too. He received the ball from a long, lobbed pass by Mattheo Dimareli from about the halfway mark. The Union striker nearly got his hat trick a minute later, but the goalkeeper, Victor Hart, made an impressive kick save to keep it out. A goal from Myles Gardner was called offside in the 26th minute. The challenge required a stoppage in play so that Dimareli could receive treatment. After the goal, the hosts made a change at right back, bringing on T'Quandre Burroughs for Jermaine Powell, who received a yellow earlier. Brian Collins made his first international appearance by coming on for him. Within a minute of kickoff, another St. Kitts' Jaheem Hazel went down and required attention. Collins brought down Mattheo Dimareli just outside of the box in what looked like a DOGSO foul. Saint Kitts and Nevis did not have a third keeper on their roster. The United States made its first substitutions in the 61st minute, bringing on Peter Molinari and Paul Sokoloff for Landry Walker and Vincente Garcia. Saint Kitts and Nevis' Joshua Finch took a hit while trying to make a tackle and required the stretcher to get off the pitch. Roko Pehar missed an open net on the following corner kick. Dimareli scored his second three minutes later, having been left unmarked at the back post. Malik Jakupovic added to his outing with an assist on that goal. The United States' final change was Prince Forfor for Mattheo Dimareli. A handball in the box by Saint Kitts' Adondre Eddy gave a third penalty to the United States. Jakupovic made easy work of it to bag his fourth. That did not stop Jakupovic, who went on to get a fifth in the 84th minute from outside the box. By then, the US coaching staff seemed to require their team to make a certain number of passes between them before they could push forward and attack. The result eliminated Saint Kitts and Nevis from qualification contention. The U17MNT will finish this year's CONCACAF World Cup Qualifier against the Dominican Republic on Tuesday, February 10th at 1 PM.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The $12 million Main Street Promenade project is officially in its final sprint. The initiative, which permanently closes seven blocks of Main Street (from Commerce to Rusk) to vehicular traffic, aims to turn the corridor into a pedestrian-first "outdoor living room" just in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. "The construction has sort of impeded vehicular traffic to an extent," Chatton said. "But with the FIFA World Cup, of course, we will get international business and an opportunity to expose people to Houston and the way we do hospitality." Chatton, whose shop sits in a historic protected building, hopes the millions of international fans expected to descend on Houston in June will see a side of Texas they aren't expecting. "People's notions of Texas are pretty linear," Chatton said. "It will be nice to showcase the diversity that exists in Houston." While construction was a hurdle when it was directly in front of their doors, that phase is complete for his block. "Now that they're finished, it's getting back better." "Once we get different people from all around the world, getting our flavor... we'll be on a different level." The project grew out of a successful pilot program during the COVID pandemic, proving that Houstonians were hungry for more walkable, outdoor spaces. When the final brick is laid in May 2026, the Promenade will feature expanded dining patios, shaded canopies, and public art.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid manager Alvaro Arbeloa has accused Clasico rivals Barcelona of generating the “biggest scandal in the history of Spanish football”. Barca were initially found to have made payments totalling €8.4 million (£7m/$10m) to Jose María Enríquez Negreira - a former vice president of the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA) of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) - between 2001 and 2018. Barcelona maintain that they hired Negreira as an external consultant to provide technical reports on refereeing, with the man himself denying any suggestion that was paid to influence decisions made in competitive fixtures. Bribery charges were dismissed by a Spanish court in May 2024, but the investigation continues under the charge of sports corruption. For me that is what should worry a lot of people.” Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Arbeloa is doing his best to ensure that off-field matters do not become a distraction for Real, as they chase down Barcelona in another thrilling La Liga title race. He has endured the odd shock defeat during his tenure - against Albacete and Benfica - but has overseen three successive victories in La Liga. He said of the challenges that his side face heading into a clash with Valencia on Sunday: “Great teams have to do a lot of things well to win. We can't just master one, we have to be able to do many things well on the pitch: we have to be able to do them at the same time, have automatisms, think all the same way… And that can only be achieved by working and putting in hours. This week we've been focused on continuing that improvement in all aspects of the game.

The Brazilian forward was dismissed during a humbling 4-2 defeat to Benfica in Lisbon that saw opposition goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin score a 98th-minute header to keep his team alive in Champions League competition. Real are readying themselves for an immediate reunion with Benfica in continental action. Having failed to secure a top eight finish and automatic qualification for the last 16, they must face Jose Mourinho's men again in the knockout phase play-offs. The first leg of that contest will take place on February 17, with the Blancos having two domestic fixtures to work through prior to that. After facing Valencia at the Mestalla, they will then play host to Real Sociedad on February 14.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Sporting KC Training Centre will serve as a Team Base Camp Training Site during FIFA World Cup 26™ for reigning champions Argentina, the club announced today. This “home away from home” is designed to provide a hub where teams will arrive ahead of their first match and will be available for those teams to return to between matches. June 16: Argentina vs. Algeria in Kansas City, Mo. Argentina are three-time World Cup champions, winning the sport's biggest prize in 1978, 1986 and 2022. 2 in the FIFA rankings, La Albiceleste finished first in World Cup qualifying in South America and are led by head coach Lionel Scaloni – named The Best FIFA Football Coach in 2022 – and a star-studded pool of players headlined by Lionel Messi. The back-to-back MLS MVP has appeared in a record 26 World Cup matches and is poised to play in a record sixth World Cup this summer. “Following several inspection trips and after a thorough final report, it was concluded that Kansas City would be the ideal location for the tournament, considering the distances between cities and, more importantly, the amenities available to the team,” the Argentine Football Federation wrote in confirming Kansas City as their Team Base Camp for FIFA World Cup 26™. The Sporting KC Training Centre opened in 2018 as the team's official training ground and the $75 million state-of-the-art facility features five fields, highlighted by a super pitch spanning seven acres with three full-size natural grass fields in addition to two synthetic turf fields with LED sports lighting. Inside the world-class venue is a luxury of accommodations, including a gymnasium, sports performance lab, hydrotherapy pools, training room, locker rooms, team lounge, offices, classrooms and media studio. Located in Kansas City, Kansas, the Sporting KC Training Centre is less than a mile from Sporting Kansas City's home stadium, Sporting Park, which is designated as a Venue-Specific Training Site to host training sessions for national teams preparing to play matches in Kansas City during FIFA World Cup 26™.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi turned the clock back when scoring a stunning solo goal for Inter Miami in their latest pre-season friendly. The Argentine GOAT found himself lining up against Barcelona. MLS Cup winners Inter Miami have been working through a tour of South America. Messi is getting himself back up to speed after rewriting the history books again in 2025. A notable hat-trick will soon be chased down, while also looking to defend his Golden Boot award. Javier Mascherano's side continue to look to their talismanic captain for inspiration, with a contract extension in South Florida being agreed through 2028.

Messi has opened his goal account for the new year, and did so in spectacular style when lining up against Barcelona SC. He immediately set off towards the penalty area, despite seeing several yellow shirts blocking his path. Mascherano made a number of changes in the second half, with his skipper being replaced by Luis Suarez just before the hour mark.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bruno Fernandes has reached yet another milestone for Manchester United which underscores his importance to the Red Devils yet again. Fernandes took the headlines when he fired home from a Diogo Dalot cross with just ten minutes to go as he put the game beyond doubt. Thomas Frank's side had been reduced to ten men earlier in the game following a red card to Cristian Romero and never looked like turning the game around. The United skipper has once again been the star of their season for both Ruben Amorim and now Michael Carrick. The goal against Spurs marked his sixth goal in the Premier League this campaign and his 18th direct involvement. Fernandes notched up his 200th goal or assist for Manchester United on Saturday and, in doing so, became the second-quickest player to do so in the club's long history. Only Wayne Rooney, who scored 133 goals and registered 67 assists in 295 games, can top Fernandes' record of 104 goals and 96 assists in 314 games. Per Opta, Fernandes has also overtaken the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo (339 games), David Beckham (393), Ryan Giggs (424) and Paul Scholes (564). It puts him amongst some of the very best players to have ever pulled on a red shirt of Manchester United and he will not be forgotten any time soon. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. United have been resurgent under Carrick and their fourth win on the spin is testament to the work he has put in at Old Trafford. The Red Devils never accrued as many victories in a row under his predecessor Amorim. I thought Michael could be a great manager and he's just shown it. I think everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Carrick's side are also just three points off of Aston Villa and Manchester City ahead of them and will fancy themselves to overhaul their rivals. League leaders Arsenal, 12 points clear of United, appear too far ahead to even begin to suggest a potential title charge. United will know any slip up could spell trouble too, with Chelsea just one point below them. United can strengthen their grip on the top four with a win against the Hammers, but will have to play well to take the maximum points off a side with four wins from their last five games in all competitions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"It's not every day that we have a mini Olympics happening an hour and a half down the road from us," said Sarah Dubbert, president of Commerce Bank in Columbia. That will create a surge in tourism and spending and a test of readiness for small businesses across the state. Although the six matches will be hosted at Arrowhead Stadium, Dubbert believes cities such as Columbia will benefit as visitors travel before and after games. Beyond increased foot traffic, she said businesses should prepare for a more diverse customer base, including potential language barriers and cultural differences due to the large number of international visitors expected. For Columbia businesses, that intentionality — including staffing and inventory decisions as well as contactless payments — could determine how effectively they capitalize on the increased traffic tied to the World Cup. "We want to make sure that the small business community knows that we're promoting Columbia as a satellite city but also how to prepare their businesses as well," said Megan McConachie, communications and outreach supervisor for the city of Columbia. McConachie said Columbia is typically prepared to handle large crowds. "You know, we're very used to having large scale festivals, Mizzou football games, Mizzou graduations," McConachie said, "and so those are things that we're all very used to as a community having take place." What will make this summer different, though, is the preparation for international travelers of various cultural backgrounds. Commerce Bank is offering a Small Business Readiness Program aimed at encouraging owners to plan well in advance. One recommendation from Dubbert is to adjust staffing based on tournament schedules or other cultural norms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been told that Kobbie Mainoo's form is 'very embarrassing' for him after failing to get the best out of the England midfielder when he was in charge at Old Trafford. Mainoo made only a handful of appearances this season with Amorim in the dugout, but has started all four of United's wins under new boss Michael Carrick. Amorim's underwhelming stint as United boss came to an end early on in January. Despite improving the team's form this season, he was sacked after seemingly taking on the board over his job title. Following a 1-1 draw at Leeds, Amorim said: "To start with that, I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me." During Amorim's 14 months at the helm, United recorded their lowest-ever Premier League finish of 15th, lost to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final and he became derided for his comments lambasting his Red Devils group as 'maybe the worst' in the club's history. Amorim was also heavily criticised for his deployment of academy product Mainoo, who became a key starter under predecessor Erik ten Hag but couldn't nail down a place in the Portuguese's demanding 3-4-3 system. But the 20-year-old has found his best form again in recent weeks, and after impressing in Saturday's 2-0 win against Spurs, Ian Wright took the opportunity to praise Mainoo and lay into Amorim. "When you look at [Mainoo], someone who's not played, coming into a Man United side that's not in great form. To play in that midfield which is where all the questions have been around... just the quality. "You're listening to Bruno [Fernandes] saying they've been given the freedom to express themselves because they're good players. I'm just pleased we're seeing that now. "I think it's very embarrassing for Ruben Amorim if we're going to be totally honest. Because what we seen was a Man United youth product not given the opportunity to play and very, very close to leaving the club.

In the final week of the summer 2025 transfer window, the midfielder asked to be loaned out, aware that clubs such as Napoli, where fellow academy product Scott McTominay is thriving, were interested in his services. A move to the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona never materialised, though reports have suggested Mainoo would have pushed for a January exit too had Amorim remained in post but he will now sign a new contract with United.

He has been capped ten times by the Three Lions but hasn't represented his country since September 2024 - one month before Thomas Tuchel was unveiled as the team's permanent successor to popular head coach Gareth Southgate.</p>
