                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• DHS funding: Lawmakers will return to Washington on Monday with just days to find a funding solution on the Department of Homeland Security or see the agency shut down. • Racist video: President Donald Trump has faced backlash from Democrats and Republicans alike over a since-deleted racist video depicting the Obamas as apes. “Just as Super Bowl Sunday brings Americans together around a shared love of competition, tradition, and excellence, the 250th anniversary will unite our entire nation in celebration of the values and freedoms that make America exceptional,” said Keith Krach, Freedom 250 CEO. The PSA was produced in a partnership with Angel Studios, a media company that's produced films, many with religious themes, that President Donald Trump and prominent conservatives have promoted. “After 250 years, the American experiment still isn't finished. It's been built, tested, carried forward and fought for, and we passed it on, hand to hand, life to life,” says a voiceover in the video. “Generations ago, ordinary people risked everything to begin it – 250 years later, the work continues.” Trump has long touted his desire to shape the nation's 250th celebrations. In the past few weeks, his administration has rolled out a slate of events that align with the president's call for programming that renews national pride. Correction: This post has been corrected to reflect that the spot is being run as a public service announcement. An earlier version of this post incorrectly indicated Freedom 250 bought the spot. Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, one of seven Republicans who voted to convict President Donald Trump in his 2021 impeachment trial, wouldn't say last week whether he regrets that vote, which has put him in Trump's crosshairs. Trump successfully pushed Rep. Julia Letlow to challenge Cassidy in the Louisiana GOP primary this year, setting the stage for a potentially expensive primary battle for a safe Senate seat. CNN's Manu Raju on Thursday chased Cassidy down in the halls of Congress, where the lawmaker declined to weigh in on why Trump appears to be angry with him. Frankly, I don't think you can either,” Cassidy said. Pressed by Raju on how he looks back on his vote to convict Trump for his role in inciting the 2021 Capitol riot, Cassidy said he's “commonly asked by reporters how do I feel and how do I regret.” “All I can say, brother, is you live your life forward,” Cassidy said. “I do not believe that Director Gabbard is competent for her position. I don't believe that she is making America safer by not following the rules and procedures on getting whistleblower complaints to the Congress in a timely fashion,” Warner said today on CBS' “Face the Nation.” Gabbard accused Warner of “lying” yesterday after the Virginia Democrat expressed concerns about a delay in her office sharing information on a whistleblower complaint. The complaint includes claims that the distribution of a highly classified intelligence report had been “restricted for political purposes” and that an intelligence agency lawyer had failed to report a potential crime to the Justice Department. Olympic Skier, Hunter Hess, a real Loser, says he doesn't represent his Country in the current Winter Olympics,” Trump posted on Truth Social Sunday morning. Hess, who hails from Bend, Oregon, said during a press availability last week that “just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.” A number of conservatives have criticized Hess for his comments in recent days. “If you can't say you love America while competing on behalf of our nation then you shouldn't be at the Olympics,” wrote Katie Miller, a Trump ally and the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, on social media yesterday. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said today she does not plan on joining the open field in the race this year to be Alaska's next governor. Absolutely,” Murkowski told CNN's Manu Raju this week, adding, “I also feel that the role that I'm playing here in the United States Senate is a particularly important one for our state and for the country.” The Alaska Republican has broken with President Donald Trump and many of her GOP colleagues on several key issues, including on the confirmations of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and FBI Director Kash Patel, said she's “not happily” ruling out a gubernatorial bid. “The idea of being able to be home and shovel real snow instead of ice snow, big difference,” she said, referring to weather conditions in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump is set to attend a Super Bowl watch party in Palm Beach, Florida, today. The Seattle Seahawks will play the New England Patriots in Santa Clara, California, a place Trump previously said was “just too far away” for him to travel to in person. ET, and return to the White House some time after this. When Donald Trump first contacted Texas and said, I need you to find the additional congressional seats, and they went to a back room with a sharpie and started redrawing maps,” Moore told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Moore called on his state's Senate to back the proposal, saying that Trump's racist post on social media on Friday, which depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes, “highlights the kind of urgency that we have within this moment … we are watching a president who is just unchecked.” Go deeper: Moore confronts limits of his power in clash with state Dems House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries demanded President Donald Trump apologize for the racist video depicting the Obamas as apes that was shared on his Truth Social account on Friday. It was a disgusting video, and the president was rightly and appropriately and forcefully denounced by people all across the country, Democrats and even a handful of Republicans, who finally showed some backbone in pushing back against the president's malignant bottom feeder-like behavior,” Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Trump has said he doesn't think he needs to apologize since the White House said it was a staffer who shared the content. Jeffries also accused the president of “unlawfully withholding funds” from a major New York infrastructure project amid reports that Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last month that he would drop his freeze on billions of dollars in funding for a long-planned rail tunnel if Schumer agreed to rename New York's Penn Station and Washington's Dulles International Airport after Trump. Secretary Kennedy has been at the very front of this,” Mehmet Oz told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” “When the first outbreak happened in Texas, he said, ‘Get your vaccines for measles,' because that's an example of an ailment that you should get vaccinated against.” While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. encouraged people to get their measles vaccines in April during a Texas outbreak, he advocated against government mandates for vaccines. Bash also pointed out how Children's Health Defense, which Kennedy founded and ran up until April 2023, posted on X, “Despite the media's scare tactics, there's no reason to fear measles.” Asked by Bash if people should fear measles, Oz said, “Oh, for sure and we actually are pretty aggressive. CMS, we fund any vaccine you want to take. Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people equally susceptible to those illnesses, but Measles is one you should get your vaccine,” Oz said. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie today said Trump should “absolutely apologize” for sharing a since-deleted racist post on his social media network that depicted former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes. “He's gone too far,” Massie told CNN's Manu Raju on “Inside Politics.” “He's attacked my wife recently online, and I do think there are limits. For a while it's kind of funny, but once pass certain guardrails like attacking a man's spouse or getting into racist tropes – I think somebody at the White House, maybe (Chief of Staff) Susie Wiles needs to go to the president and just ask him for his phone.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he's not willing to accept anything less than Democratic leaders' demands and cast blame on Republicans for stalled negotiations on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security before a crucial deadline. “Not at this point,” Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash just days before DHS, which includes FEMA and TSA, will shutdown without a funding solution, declaring the top immigration enforcement agency is “completely and totally out of control.” So dramatic changes are necessary to the manner in which the Department of Homeland Security officers are conducting themselves before any funding bill should move forward,” he said. Democrats have put forward their list of requirements for a bill to fund DHS and reform ICE, including requiring immigration enforcement agents to wear body cameras and remove face masks and to use judicial warrants, an issue that has been a nonstarter for Republicans. “Either they're going to agree to dramatically reform the way in which ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies are conducting themselves, so that they're behaving like every other law enforcement agency in the country, or they're making the explicit decision to shut down the Coast Guard, shut down FEMA and shut down TSA,” he warned. Asked on CNN's “Inside Politics” if Lutnick, who appeared to have corresponded with Epstein multiple times, should testify, Massie responded, “No, he should just resign. Lutnick said in an interview last year that after a 2005 encounter at Epstein's home, he grew uncomfortable and vowed that he “will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again.” But the documents reveal Lutnick sought to meet with or call Epstein several times since 2005, including after Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008. A Commerce Department spokesperson told CNN last month, “Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing.” CNN's Kit Maher, Devan Cole, Aleena Fayaz and Camila DeChalus contributed to this reporting. US officials have held initial indirect talks with Iran over Tehran nuclear program, while President Donald Trump said he spoke with Honduran President Nasry Asfura. See below for a round-up of our reporting on the Trump administration's latest foreign policy developments. Talks between Greenland and the United States are not currently where Greenland would like them to be — and it is too early to say what the outcome will be, the Arctic island's foreign minister said yesterday. “There is going to be a long track, so where we are going to land at the end, it's too early to say,” Vivian Motzfeldt said during a news conference in Nuuk alongside Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand and Danish Foreign Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen. Trump praised his Honduran counterpart, Nasry “Tito” Asfura, saying the pair held a “very important meeting” yesterday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. It was my Great Honor to support Tito's Campaign. Once I gave him my strong Endorsement, he won his Election! Tito and I share many of the same America First Values,” Trump posted on Truth Social. Asfura, a conservative, narrowly edged out right-leaning centrist Salvador Nasralla late last year. Trump endorsed Asfura days before the election was held, warning that if he didn't win, “the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.” He said the two leaders “discussed many other issues,” including trade. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “is expected” to visit Washington to meet with Trump on Wednesday, “where he will discuss with him the negotiations with Iran,” the Prime Minister's office said in a statement yesterday. Abbas Araghchi described the program as a “sovereignty necessity.” CNN's Sophie Tanno, Isabelle D'Antonio, Eugenia Yosef, Max Saltman and Laura Sharma contributed to this post President Donald Trump drew swift condemnation for a racist video posted to his Truth Social account last Thursday depicting former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle. Here's what you need to know about the situation: GOP Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, wrote on X that he was “praying (the video) was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in an Instagram video Friday that the “disgusting video, posted by the so-called president, was done intentionally,” For his part, Trump said Friday evening that neither he nor his staff had seen all of the video before it was posted to Truth Social. It was fine,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, referring to the first part of the video that contained debunked claims about fraud in voting machines. “It was a very strong post in terms of voter fraud,” he said.

CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Lindsey Vonn ‘s defiant bid to win the Winter Olympic downhill  at the age of 41, on a rebuilt right knee and a badly injured left knee, ended Sunday in a frightening crash that saw her taken to safety by a rescue helicopter for the second time in nine days. She was treated for long, anguished minutes as a hush fell over the crowd waiting far below at the finish line. She was strapped to a gurney and flown away, possibly ending the skier's storied career. Ski Team did not disclose details of her injury but said Vonn “is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians.” “She'll be OK, but it's going to be a bit of a process,” said Anouk Patty, chief of sport for U.S. “This sport's brutal and people need to remember when they're watching (that) these athletes are throwing themselves down a mountain and going really, really fast.” Breezy Johnson, Vonn's teammate, became only the second American woman to win the Olympic downhill after Vonn did it 16 years ago. Vonn had family in the stands, including her father, Alan Kildow, who stared down at the ground while his daughter was being treated after just 13 seconds on the course where she holds a record 12 World Cup titles. Fellow American star Mikaela Shiffrin posted a broken heart emoji on social media. This combination of images shows the United States' Lindsey Vonn crashing during an alpine ski women's downhill race, at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026. “I can only say thank you for what she has done for our sport,” he said, “because this race has been the talk of the games and it's put our sport in the best possible light.” She returned to elite ski racing last season after nearly six years, a remarkable decision given her age but she also had a partial titanium knee replacement in her right knee, too.

The four-time overall World Cup champion stunned everyone by being a contender almost immediately. She came to the Olympics as the leader in the World Cup downhill standings and was a gold-medal favorite before her crash in Switzerland nine days ago, when she suffered her latest knee injury. Still, no one counted her out even then. She competed less than 48 hours later, racing in all four events she'd planned, with a top result of seventh in the super-G. United States' Lindsey Vonn crashes during an alpine ski women's downhill race, at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026. Cortina has had many treasured memories for Vonn beyond the record wins. She is called the queen of Cortina, and the Olympia delle Tofana is a course that had always suited Vonn. The drama was of a different sort this time. Not since perhaps Hermann Maier's cartwheeling crash at the 1998 Nagano Games had there been such a high-profile and spectacular fall in Alpine skiing at the Olympics. “It's such a huge loss and bummer,” American Megan Gunyou said. “I feel like hearing her story and just like the redemption of her first fall and like fighting to come back to the Olympics this year, I mean, I feel so sad for her.” “Really, your heart goes out for such a champion who is coming to the end of her career.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The governing coalition of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is almost certain to win a single-party majority in a key parliamentary election Sunday, NHK public television and other major networks say, citing their exit polls. Sanae Takaichi, Japan's prime minister and president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), receives an interview at the LDP headquarters Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026 in Tokyo, (Keisuke Hosojima/Kyodo News via AP) Yoshihiko Noda, left, and Kenta Saito, right, co-heads of the newly formed Japanese political party Centrist Reform Alliance, attend their press conference Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026 in Tokyo, (Yohei Fukai/Kyodo News via AP) Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Secretary-General Shunichi Suzuki and other lawmakers puts pins marking the names of candidates who won lower house elections at the LDP headquarters in Tokyo, Sunday Feb. 8, 2026. Takaichi, in a televised interview with public television network NHK following her sweeping victory, said she is now ready to pursue policies that would make Japan strong and prosperous. NHK, citing results of vote counts, said Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, alone secured 316 seats by early Monday, comfortably surpassing a 261-seat absolute majority in the 465-member lower house, the more powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament. That marks a record since the party's foundation in 1955 and surpasses the previous record of 300 seats won in 1986 by late Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. Takaichi said that she would firmly push forward her policy goals while trying to gain support from the opposition. Takaichi is hugely popular, but the governing LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the last seven decades, has struggled with funding and religious scandals in recent years. She called Sunday's early election only after three months in office, hoping to turn that around while her popularity is high. The ultraconservative Takaichi, who took office as Japan's first female leader in October, pledged to “work, work, work,” and her style, which is seen as both playful and tough, has resonated with younger fans who say they weren't previously interested in politics. Takaichi was betting with this election that her LDP party, together with its new partner, the Japan Innovation Party, would secure a majority. “With Takaichi shifting things more toward the conservative side, I think that brought this positive result,” he said. The LDP's right-wing partner, JIP leader Hirofumi Yoshimura, has said his party will serve as an “accelerator” for this push. Japan has recently seen far-right populists gain ground, such as the anti-globalist and surging nationalist party Sanseito. Takaichi has pledged to revise security and defense policies by December to bolster Japan's offensive military capabilities, lifting a ban on weapons exports and moving further away from the country's postwar pacifist principles. She has been pushing for tougher policies on foreigners, anti-espionage and other measures that resonate with a far-right audience, but ones that experts say could undermine civil rights. She now has time to work on these policies, without an election until 2028. Though Takaichi said that she's seeking to win support for policies seen as divisive in Japan, she largely avoided discussing ways to fund soaring military spending, how to fix diplomatic tension with China and other issues. In her campaign speeches, Takaichi enthusiastically talked about the need for proactive government spending to fund “crisis management investment and growth,” such as measures to strengthen economic security, technology and other industries. Takaichi also seeks to push tougher measures on immigration, including stricter requirements for foreign property owners and a cap on foreign residents. Sunday's election “underscores a problematic trend in Japanese politics in which political survival takes priority over substantive policy outcomes,” said Masato Kamikubo, a Ritsumeikan University politics professor. Sunday's vote coincided with fresh snowfall across the country, including in Tokyo. Record snowfall in northern Japan over the past few weeks blocked roads and was blamed for dozens of deaths nationwide.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by LSEG. R-CALF USA CEO Bill Bullard joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss President Donald Trump's plan to import beef from Argentina as U.S. ranchers face rising bankruptcies and a shrinking domestic market. President Donald Trump's beef import plan aims to cut prices, but cattle ranchers say it misses what's crushing them most — the power of meat packers. "Meat packers have created a system where they win no matter what — at the cost of everyone else," said Will Harris, a fourth-generation cattleman and owner of White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, Georgia. Harris, who plans to hand off the operation to his children, said his farm handles every step of production, from raising cattle to processing and selling beef, giving him a clear view of how prices are set. Sixth-generation cattle rancher Mark Kirkpatrick feeds heifers on the Stoker-Kirkpatrick Ranch in Post, Texas. Together, the packing titans process about 85% of the grain-fattened cattle that become steaks, roasts and other supermarket cuts. "The U.S. beef market is so highly concentrated that a small number of dominant packers control processing, distribution and pricing. This allows them to pay ranchers less for cattle while charging consumers more at the store. When cheap imported beef enters the system, it allows packers to increase their margins," Harris told Fox News Digital. It's a concern echoed deep into cattle country. Cattle rancher Cole Bolton and his wife in Texas. Those margins, Bolton said, have been squeezed for decades. "Ranchers have dealt with such thin margins of profitability for the last 20 years." While ranchers like Bolton and Harris say Trump's temporary expansion of U.S. beef imports from Argentina may help ease prices in the short term, both warn it is no substitute for rebuilding domestic production. "We must rebuild the American cattle herd, protect American farmers and ensure transparency, so consumers understand where their beef comes from. Brad Randel rounds up some of his Black Angus cattle to sell at auction on Sept. 12, 2022, in McCook, Nebraska. Years of drought, high feed costs and an aging ranching population have thinned herds, leaving the U.S. cattle supply at its lowest level in more than 70 years. "I think it's going to take a while to fix this crisis that we're in with the cattle shortage. My message to consumers is simple: Folks, be patient. We've got to build back our herds," Bolton told Fox News Digital. He noted that the cattle industry, over the last five years, has weathered one setback after another, from market turmoil to extreme weather conditions.

CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — For Breezy Johnson, the road to an Olympic gold medal was similar to the winning downhill run she turned in Sunday: It was full of jarring bumps that nearly knocked her off course, but not off target. They're not necessarily jealous of the journey it took to get those medals,” said Johnson, who has never won a World Cup race. “I don't think my journey is something that many people are envious of and it's been a tough road, but sometimes you just have to keep going because that's the only option. The tears began welling in the eyes of Johnson as racer after racer couldn't top her time, wiping them away with a mitten. That didn't hold up so well. She placed the pieces in her pocket. “It's definitely heavier than I expected,” Johnson said of her new hardware. “I think that's maybe why it broke.” Johnson was just the sixth racer of the day and found speed with a risk-taking trip along the iconic Olympia delle Tofana course on a sunny day in Cortina. She felt confident it was good enough for a medal, but not as sure if it would be gold. “But I hoped that it would be enough,” she said. “I just tried to keep it rolling. 13 racer, cut a corner too close and was spun around before crashing. The race was put on hold for more than 20 minutes. United States' Lindsey Vonn crashes into a gate during an alpine ski women's downhill race, at the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026. “I kind of wish the TV directors maybe wouldn't have replayed some of the crashes as much as they did,” Johnson said. “It's a little hard when you're surrounded by cameras and stuff, not wanting to watch that.” It's certainly been a bumpy road to the top for Johnson, given the knee injury and a 14-month ban that expired in December 2024. She returned to win the world championship last February. “I think that this was the best run Breezy's ever skied,” teammate Bella Wright said. “There was a lot of expectation, and she rose to the challenge.” Johnson figures to have another shot at gold in the team event and could be paired with Mikaela Shiffrin. Vonn's crash put a somber mood over the event. Vonn, who won the downhill at the 2010 Vancouver Games, was a gold-medal favorite before her crash in Switzerland last week when she suffered a ruptured ACL for her latest major knee injury. She returned to elite ski racing last season after nearly six years and after receiving a partial titanium knee replacement in her right knee. “My heart just goes out to her.” Like Vonn, Cande Moreno of Andorra also was taken away in a helicopter after a crash in which her left knee appeared to buckle while landing after a jump. “But I managed to let the skis go pretty well.” Both downhill golds this weekend were won by the reigning world champions after Franjo von Allmen of Switzerland won the men's race on Saturday. Both races also featured up-and-coming silver medalists (Aicher, Giovanni Franzoni of Italy) and Italian veterans in bronze position (Goggia, Dominik Paris). “So-so with my performance, but in the overall I got a medal again,” Goggia said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, right, talks with Britain's ambassador to the United States Peter Mandelson during a welcome reception at the ambassador's residence on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025 in Washington. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer talks with members of the audience after delivering a speech at Horntye Park Sports Complex in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, England, Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026. “The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. “When asked, I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice.” Starmer is facing a political storm and questions about his judgement after newly published documents, part of a huge trove of Epstein files made public in the United States, suggested that Mandelson sent market-sensitive information to the convicted sex offender when he was the U.K. government's business secretary during the 2008 financial crisis. Starmer's government has promised to release its own emails and other documentation related to Mandelson's appointment, which it says will show that Mandelson misled officials. The prime minister apologized this week for “having believed Mandelson's lies.” A number of lawmakers said Starmer is ultimately responsible for the scandal. “Keir Starmer has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions,” said Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party. Mandelson, a former Cabinet minister, ambassador and elder statesman of the governing Labour Party, has not been arrested or charged. Metropolitan Police officers searched Mandelson's London home and another property linked to him on Friday. The U.K. police investigation centers on potential misconduct in public office, and Mandelson is not accused of any sexual offenses. They argue that he should have known better than to appoint Mandelson in the first place. They also include records of payments totaling $75,000 in 2003 and 2004 from Epstein to accounts linked to Mandelson or his husband Reinaldo Avila da Silva. Aside from his association with Epstein, Mandelson previously had to resign twice from senior government posts because of scandals over money or ethics. Starmer had faced growing pressure over the past week to fire McSweeney, who is regarded as a key adviser in Downing Street and seen as a close ally of Mandelson. Starmer on Sunday credited McSweeney as a central figure in running Labour's recent election campaign and the party's 2004 landslide victory. His statement did not mention the Mandelson scandal.</p>

SAN FRANCISCO – The Super Bowl marks the biggest gambling day of the year, and as it becomes more prevalent, there are plenty of more options. DraftKings, of course, has taken notice of what fans may like, giving oddsmaker Johnny Avello quite the fun job for Super Bowl LX and the entire season leading up to it. Bets simply used to be spreads, moneylines or over/unders, but Avello saw a trend and ran with it. The DraftKings Super Bowl LIX host committee float on Feb. 8, 2025, in New Orleans, Louisiana. That would be touchdown scorers," Avello told Fox News Digital on radio row. "We started off three, four years ago with first touchdown scorer, and that was the bet: first touchdown scorer in every game. Avello also said he enjoyed taking a deep dive into next-gen stats, including the fastest ball carrier, farthest thrown ball, and other similar wagers that cannot be determined simply from the box score. The logo for DraftKings is displayed on a laptop computer in an arranged photograph taken in Little Falls, New Jersey, on Oct. 7, 2020. "We put up a prop: Will the Seahawks have a one-yard passing attempt, and will they complete it?" Avello said, noting that it's a play on Super Bowl XLIX, which, like this year, featured the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots. That game, of course, is best known for Russell Wilson's interception by Malcolm Butler on the 1-yard line with Marshawn Lynch in the backfield. Avello said most of the spread bets are on the favored Seahawks to cover the 4.5-point spread, but lots of moneyline bets are on New England. And that would not be great for DraftKings. Patriots are gonna win straight up." "So we're kind of balanced out on the game." New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye celebrates with the AFC Championship trophy after beating the Broncos in Denver, Colorado, on Jan. 25, 2026. "We do have a little bit of hazard on the Patriots to win the whole thing. We opened them, like, 70-1 to win the Super Bowl, but we also opened the Seahawks high, too. So we're in a little bit of jeopardy there." Follow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Carlile is one of the performers who have been outspoken against President Donald Trump and his administration's policies going back to his first term in office. She will join Bad Bunny and Green Day as anti-Trump critics performing at Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara, California. From left; Charlie Puth, Coco Jones and Brandi Carlile – who will perform the national anthem, "Lift Every Voice" and "America the Beautiful," respectively – speak during a news conference, Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026, in San Francisco ahead of the Super Bowl LX. She suggested in an interview with Variety on Friday she's going into the performance with her "own moral code" in mind, adding that the performance was important to her as a member of the LGBT community. "And I have my own moral code, my own moral imperative, that I have to answer to at the end of the day, as a wife and mother, and I believe in my ability and responsibility to do this, and that's why I'm here," she told the magazine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A few weeks back, in the run-up to Christmas, my family was doing what it always does during the holiday season: watching Home Alone. And, around the time that Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern's Wet Bandits began plotting their break-ins, I began wondering something: Were home robberies really so common in 1990, when the film was released, that audiences wouldn't blink at the idea of a comedy based around home burglary? That adds up to a rate of 435 robberies per 100,000 people, which was actually fairly low for the time. But in nearby Chicago, there were more than 50,000 burglaries, or around 1,800 per 100,000 people, that year. So, yes, the idea that a couple of bandits might break into your home while you were off on a Paris vacation wasn't far-fetched. (Although given that the McAllister family were so disorganized they twice lost one of their kids on Christmas vacation trips, I'm not all that confident about their home security approach.) But when Home Alone is remade — as I'm certain a remake-obsessed Hollywood will do eventually — they might need to change up the premise. Nationwide, burglary rates have fallen by more than 80 percent since 1990. Chicago has seen rates fall by similar levels, a story that is all the more remarkable given just how high those rates were in the 1990s. Wealthy Winnetka had less far to drop, but it's still down by over 60 percent. While the historic drop in violent crime in the United States has gotten a lot of attention recently, including in this newsletter, the dip in property crimes like robbery, burglary, and motor vehicle theft has gone under the radar. And while this has largely been a steady, long-term trend, there was a 9 percent decline between 2023 and 2024 — the sharpest single-year decline on record. For our stuff, as well as for our lives, there's an argument to be made that Americans are safer now than they have ever been. In that period in many cities, property crime was like background weather: something you planned around and simply had to live with, even if you didn't talk about it every day. Nationally, the overall property crime rate was just over 5,000 incidents per 100,000 people each year around 1990. If you do the math, that means the country was recording roughly one property crime for every 20 residents on average. Of course, the average wasn't how people lived. But that's still a staggering level of routine predation. On a dollar level, the average residential burglary in 1990 resulted in a loss of around $2,800 to $3,400, while total losses for all property crime was nearly $40 billion. But there was also a price on human lives. By one estimate, roughly one in four robberies — like your classic street mugging — resulted in some form of physical injury to the victim, while roughly one in 10 of all murders occurred in the course of a felony like robbery and burglary. And these numbers may just touch the surface. So even these ugly numbers likely understate how saturated daily life could feel with property crime. All of which raises the question: What changed? It's probably not because Americans suddenly became nicer. The bottom line is that we changed our environment in a way that made burglary and robbery harder to pull off, less profitable, and more likely to fail. More apartment buildings have controlled entry, buzzer systems, and cameras. The Wet Bandits wouldn't stand a chance today. A paper published in 2021 directly links the startling drop in burglary to security improvements like the above, which helps explain why property crime kept dropping in diverse cities, across different presidencies, up and down economic cycles, almost without stopping. If it takes longer to break in and burglars are more likely to be spotted, fewer people will try — and fewer will succeed. One nugget from the paper: The average age of burglars increased as younger people found it harder to do. Sometimes the math doesn't add up: Stolen tech often isn't worth that much on the resale market because products have gotten cheaper. One plus of living in a richer society — which America very much is compared to 1990 — is that the wages of crime pay less comparatively. At the same time, there's the simple fact that people carry — both on themselves and at home — far less paper cash than they used to. Notably, one study on Missouri linked the state's shift from paper welfare checks to electronic benefit transfer led to a decline in crime. And that's true in commercial operations too, as customers today are far more likely to pay with credit cards or their phone. Doorbell cameras don't just ward off potential burglars — they provide far more specific identification if someone still tries. The same goes for ubiquitous smartphones, which enable people to instantly call for help, share a suspect's photo, and even ping a lost device. (Good luck doing any of that in 1990 — Kevin McAllister's land line didn't even work!) All of this raises the perceived chance of getting caught, even if actual police clearance rates for property crimes remain very low. Ubiquitous cameras can bleed into a surveillance state, one whose negative effects we're seeing. The decline of cash reduces financial privacy and exacerbates social inequality. And the ubiquity of smartphones… well, you don't need me to tell you the downsides of that. It's also true that some of what we used to think of as “property crime” didn't vanish so much as change form. And some of the “new” street-level thefts are oddly specific, like taking e-commerce packages off your stoop, something that wasn't even conceivable in 1990. None of this negates the good news about burglaries and robberies. It just updates the definition of what “safe property” means in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was June 2018 – about a year after Russia's ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin had suddenly died. Churkin had been someone Epstein met with regularly in New York, according to new documents released by the Department of Justice, and Epstein had even offered to help Churkin's son, Maxim, get a job at a wealth management firm in New York. Now Epstein was looking to talk with a different Russian official: Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. On June 24, 2018, Epstein emailed Norwegian politician Thorbjørn Jagland, then the secretary general of the Council of Europe, “I think you might suggest to putin, that lavrov, can get insight on talking to me. Jagland answered that he would meet with Lavrov's assistant the following Monday and suggest it. he must be seen to get something its that simple.” The new tranche of documents showing more of Epstein's communications with international politicians, including Russian officials, has led to more speculation about the billionaire's motives. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in a cabinet meeting this week that his country will be launching an investigation into Epstein's possible ties with Russian intelligence. “This can only mean that they also possess compromising materials against many leaders still active today.” The Kremlin dismissed suggestions that Epstein was a spy for Russia. “The theory that Epstein was controlled by Russian intelligence services can be taken in any way, but not seriously,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. Peskov added that reporters should “not waste time” looking into allegations Epstein had links to Russian intelligence. Analysts cautioned to CNN that the documents suggest little more than Epstein trying to rub shoulders with influential figures and position himself as a sort of geopolitical power player. “I have a friend that can help you to take the necessary measures (and then present you) and ask [whether] it is interesting for him to meet with you,” Jagland wrote in an email to Epstein. Epstein replied: “He is in a unique position to do something grand, like sputnik did for the space race, You can tell him that you and I are close , and that i advise Gates . Through a spokesperson, billionaire Bill Gates has publicly described meeting with Epstein as a “serious error in judgment” but denied any improper conduct. But in another email to Barak on May 21, 2013, Epstein claimed without providing evidence that he denied a request from Putin to meet during a Russian economic conference in St. Peterburg. CNN has reached out to the Kremlin for comment on Epstein's correspondence with Barak. More than a year later, in July 2014, an email to Epstein suggests that he had an upcoming scheduled meeting with Putin and had invited the LinkedIn founder to join. Some of Epstein's communications with prominent Russians came at a sensitive time in US-Russia relations – after the US intelligence community accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 presidential election, which Donald Trump won. In June 2018, Jagland emailed Epstein that he hoped to stay at his residence in Paris and that he would be coming from Moscow, where he planned to meet with Putin, Lavrov and Dmitry Medvedev, then the prime minister of Russia. “i m just sorry im not with you to meet the Russians,” Epstein replied. On Thursday, Norway's investigative unit Økokrim announced   it had opened an investigation into Jagland based on information in the Epstein documents. Epstein referred to Sergey Belyakov, who Russian state news agency TASS said graduated from the FSB Academy in Moscow in 1999, as “my very good friend” in a 2015 email to billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel. After attending the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) in 2015, Barak, the former Israeli prime minister, reported back to Epstein that he'd met with several Russian officials, including Lavrov; the head of Russia's central bank, Elvira Nabiullina; and several other heads of Russian banks. “Thx for (setting) the whole thing together,” Barak wrote in an email to Epstein. Barak's office told CNN in a statement, the former Israeli prime minister's visits to SPIEF “were always under invitation” of Putin's office. The statement said Epstein was interested in Russian affairs and in meeting Putin but Barak “never raised” Epstein's name with the Kremlin but “occasionally discussed” world affairs with him and “mentioned some people he met.” In a 2016 exchange between Belyakov and Epstein, Belyakov tells Epstein that he has started a new position with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) – the country's sovereign wealth fund – and that he was looking to attract investment for Russian projects. “I will do anything [that] is helpful to you,” Epstein wrote to Belyakov in another email later that same week. Epstein had also turned to Belyakov for help at least once. In a 2015 correspondence, Epstein wrote to Belyakov that a Russian “girl” from Moscow was attempting to blackmail a “group of powerful” businessmen in New York and “it is bad for business for everyone involved.” Epstein then told Belyakov when the woman arrived in New York and what hotel she was staying at, asking, “Suggestions?”. Epstein also claimed to offer advice for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. In a 2018 email with Jide Zeitlin, the former CEO of Coach and a private investor, Zeitlin thanks Epstein for his “thoughts re Deripaska,” who had been sanctioned by the US just a month earlier. Epstein then forwarded the correspondence to Steve Bannon, formerly Trump's chief strategist. “Just keeping you in the loop,” Epstein wrote to Bannon. An email from November 2010 included in the files references an effort by someone claiming to be an assistant for Epstein attempting to set up a meeting between Epstein and someone referred to as “Oleg.” “I'm writing to see what the possibilities are of =effrey and Oleg to meet in Moscow next week Tuesday or Wednesday? Or =ossibly Oleg has plans to be in Paris next week?” The person wrote. Deripaska's spokesperson told Bloomberg he didn't personally know Epstein; CNN has reached out for a comment. Bucher was known in Russia as a member of Nashi, a pro-Putin youth group, where she even got her own TV show. Bucher has since said she left the movement and gave up her Russian citizenship in 2022 after the invasion of Ukraine. She and Epstein appeared to have a close relationship. In 2017, she    asked Epstein in an email if he'd heard anything about potential sanctions on companies with research and development in Russia because it could affect “some good friends.” He then told her he'd introduce her to Thiel. Bucher later sent Epstein videos of her singing and told him she was “recharged” from not “doing any substances for a while.” She credited Epstein for helping her establish her Day One Ventures fund in 2018. “Been thinking about all good things you taught me,” she said in a 2019 text message to Epstein. “I would never create my fund without the ideas and knowledge you shared with me and I do much love my work. thank you for being such a great friend Jeffrey!” In 2022, The Washington Post reported that Bucher's pitches to investors boasted of her connections to Russian oligarchs, but she has dismissed those allegations and denied having any Russian funding. While it's not clear exactly how often Epstein traveled to Russia, flight logs analyzed by CNN and published by the Justice Department confirm he did visit the country. Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell traveled to Russia between November 22 and 24 of 2002, flying from Copenhagen to Moscow's Vnukovo Airport on Epstein's personal aircraft, according to flight logs and a 2018 email published by the Justice Department. Sakharov worked on the Soviet hydrogen bomb and later became known as a dissident. Epstein later reapplied for a Russian visa in 2018, according to emails released by the Justice Department. Another email indicates that his team asked about transferring his valid Russian visa to a new passport in March 2019, just months before his arrest on federal charges related to sex trafficking of minors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions of Americans are expected to watch the Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday, but don't expect President Donald Trump to be one of them. Instead, Trump and many conservatives are likely to tune out the official NFL performance in favor of Turning Point USA‘s alternative halftime show, featuring country music stars Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett. It's the latest sign Republicans aren't just fighting for votes — they're using their political might to create an alternative mainstream. In recent weeks, Trump has snubbed society's tastemakers by adding his name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and showcasing new MAGA surrogates such as rap queen Nicki Minaj. First lady Melania Trump, meanwhile, has released an eponymous documentary that is expanding into theaters across the country. “You want to be everywhere all the time,” GOP strategist Ford O'Connell said. It comes exactly one week after several musicians, including Bad Bunny, took to the Grammy stage to denounce Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in Minnesota. “Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say, ICE out,” said Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, who goes by the stage name Bad Bunny, while accepting the Grammy for Best Música Urbana Album. Republicans say that Bad Bunny's flamboyant sartorial choices, along with his progressive views, created an opening for a counter-halftime program — one that could appeal to every segment of society. “The Super Bowl is almost like another holiday in our American society,” Florida-based Republican strategist Dewayne Moore said. “So one of the biggest, one of the biggest platforms, one of the biggest stages, on a Sunday that will bring 136 million viewers, we're going to put an individual, a man who will wear a dress, a man who will paint his fingernail. “I think it's a terrible choice,” the president said. Yet,  an alternative halftime show is a perfect opportunity for anyone who wants to get their message out, Republicans argue. American conservatives have long been disaffected with the liberalization of American society and pushed to reshape culture to reflect a more traditional, Christian values-based society. Trump, who became a celebrity before he became a politician, was able to ride that dissatisfaction to the White House in 2016 and 2024. Both elections featured increasing defections of middle and working-class Americans from the Democratic Party over its embrace of “woke” politics. That year, Bush won the popular vote, Republicans kept control of Congress, and 11 states voted to enshrine bans on the practice in their constitutions. Jacob Neiheisel, an expert on political communication and campaigns at the University at Buffalo, said the difference was not in how Republicans campaigned but what they did when in office. “They're using those levers for change in a way that we haven't seen conservative administrations do before,” Neiheisel added. “I think the Trump and the conservative movement more generally is a lot more comfortable using power to enact change.” The results of trying to reshape culture have been mixed during Trump's second term. Trump's controversial takeover of the Kennedy Center in 2025 and the later name change were met with fierce criticism from Democrats and a drop in subscription numbers. “He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for,” host Andrew Schulz said during a Flagrant podcast episode in July 2025. A front-page Vanity Fair spread in December 2025 featuring several high-level members of the administration led to a full-out defense of chief of staff Susie Wiles after her candid remarks about the White House were published. Scholar and right-leaning podcaster Steve Turley said the Trump administration does not just want cultural acceptance. “I don't know if they're trying to crave approval as much as they're actually trying to conquer,” the Turley Talks host said. Your little Grammy get-together, bunch of people talking about stolen land, is nothing compared to what we can put together. There are some Republicans who claim that trying to go tit-for-tat with the Left is a distraction and urge the White House to focus on its massive fundraising and media operations instead. “At some point, this stops being cultural commentary and starts looking like insecurity,” said Hunter S. Gaylor, a former fundraiser for then-Sen. Marco Rubio. Yes, the entertainment industry leans left — everyone knows that. But responding by turning a football game into a partisan split screen is exactly how everything gets dumbed down into theater. Conservatism isn't supposed to mirror the Left's obsession with politicizing every square inch of American life.” “Not every cultural moment needs to be conquered,” he added. The ad, which will air after the national anthem, is financed by Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner and Dell CEO Michael Dell.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's Investigative Committee has accused Ukrainian intelligence of being behind the assassination attempt on a Russian general in Moscow on Friday – and says the alleged perpetrator was arrested in Dubai after fleeing Moscow. One other suspect – described as an accomplice – was also detained, the Committee said. He had arrived in Russia in December “on the instructions of the Kyiv special services,” it said. Early on Friday morning an attacker fired several shots at Lt. Gen. Vladimir Alekseyev in a residential building on Volokolamskoye Highway in Moscow and fled the scene. Alekseyev had regained consciousness after surgery, TASS reported Saturday. “Doctors cautiously say that his life is not in danger,” it added, citing medical sources. The Investigative Committee said a Makarov pistol with a silencer was discovered at the scene. The Kremlin said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and thanked him for assistance on apprehending the suspect. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha told Reuters on Friday that Kyiv had nothing to do with the attack. In 2023, Alekseyev was sent by the Russian military to negotiate with Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner private mercenary group, during the Wagner group's mutiny. He was one of several GRU officials sanctioned by the United States in 2016 for wide-ranging malicious cyber activity directed at undermining US democratic processes. He was also sanctioned by the European Union in January 2019 following a nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England, which the British government said was carried out by GRU agents to poison a former Russian spy. The EU sanctions describe Alekseyev as “responsible for the possession, transport and use in Salisbury… of the toxic nerve agent ‘Novichok' by officers from the GRU,” along with sanctioned Russian military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov. Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, who ran the armed forces operational training department, died after a device installed under the chassis of a car exploded, Russia's Investigative Committee said. The 56-year-old had previously “carried out the tasks of organizing and conducting an operation in Syria,” when Russian forces were backing the Assad regime, TASS said. Other senior Russian officers killed in Moscow have included Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy head of the main operational department of the General Staff, who was the victim of a car bomb attack near Moscow in April last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The father of the teenager who allegedly killed four people at his Georgia high school in 2024 is set to stand trial on murder and manslaughter charges in the latest case testing the limits of who is responsible for a school shooting. Colin Gray, the father of Colt Gray, has pleaded not guilty to nearly 30 charges, including two counts each of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. The case stems from the September 2024 shooting at Apalachee High School, when then-14-year-old Colt Gray allegedly used an AR15-style rifle to kill two students and two teachers and injure nine others. More than a year earlier, law enforcement had questioned the teen and father about “online threats to commit a school shooting,” though no charges were filed, authorities said. Even so, Colin Gray bought a firearm for his son as a Christmas present in December 2023 – the same firearm he used in the mass shooting, according to two law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation. The indictment alleges Gray allowed his teenage son access to a firearm and ammunition after receiving “sufficient warning” that his son would harm and endanger others, actions that constitute “criminal negligence” by “consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk.” The trial is part of a broader push to hold more people accountable for a school shooting, a group that has grown to include parents and responding law enforcement officers. Testimony is also likely to include emotional stories from those who were in the school that day. This case bears similarities to the trials of James and Jennifer Crumbley, whose then-15-year-old son killed four students in 2021 at his high school in Oxford, Michigan. Prosecutors accused the parents of allowing their son access to the firearm and ignoring warnings about his declining mental health and risk to others. That was believed to be just the first and second time that a parent was held criminally responsible for a mass school shooting committed by their child. Andrew Fleischman, a criminal defense attorney in Atlanta, said the jury's sympathy for the victims and desire to blame someone could make it a difficult case for Colin Gray's defense. “The state is going to probably argue that, but for this father's negligence, these kids would all be alive,” he said. “There are lots of ways that you can show that you are not being fully criminally negligent,” Fleischman said. Colin Gray has remained behind bars since his arrest a day after the shooting. If convicted, he faces 10 to 30 years in prison on each murder charge and 1 to 10 years on each manslaughter charge. The trial is set to begin with jury selection Monday and is expected to last about three weeks. Colt Gray, now 16, has been indicted on 55 felony counts, including four counts of malice murder, and will be tried as an adult, according to court documents. He has pleaded not guilty, although a defense attorney last year raised the possibility he may change his plea. The mass shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta, began the morning of September 4, 2024. Colt Gray had enrolled at the school on August 14 and had already missed nine days of classes leading up to the shooting, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said. Colt left Algebra class at 9:45 a.m., and gunshots were soon heard in a nearby classroom, a student told CNN at the time. The gun had been hidden in his backpack, authorities said. The first report of an active shooter came in around 10:20 a.m., authorities said. “I heard gunshots outside my classroom and people screaming, people begging not to get shot,” said then-14-year-old student Macey Right. A resource officer confronted the shooter, who immediately surrendered and was taken into custody, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith said. The suspect told investigators, “I did it,” while being questioned, according to Smith. ‘A rite of passage': Why some parents buy guns for their children Colt Gray had been questioned by law enforcement in May 2023 regarding “several anonymous tips about online threats to commit a school shooting at an unidentified location and time,” according to a joint statement from FBI Atlanta and the Jackson County Sheriff's Office. In video of the police interview, Colin Gray told officers that he had guns in the house and his son had access to them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump‘s Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner boarded the USS Abraham Lincoln on Saturday, just one day after high-stakes negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. Bradley Cooper met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his team in Oman on Friday for the nuclear talks, discussions that were inconclusive but were framed by principal figures as a positive step to reaching a deal. With more rounds expected, the three U.S. negotiators visited a U.S. aircraft carrier over the weekend that has been operating off Iran's coast for weeks as tensions remain high between the two nations. “Proud to stand with the men and women who defend our interests, deter our adversaries, and show the world what American readiness and resolve look like, on watch every day,” Witkoff posted on X, along with multiple photos of him aboard the aircraft carrier. While the timing of the trip is odd, especially given Trump has still not ruled out a military response to Iran's violent crackdown on protesters last month, the purpose of it was supposedly solely to express gratitude for the U.S. service members in the Middle East, according to CNN. The USS Abraham Lincoln was originally deployed to the Indo-Pacific region late last year, but was redirected to the Middle East as tensions soared with Iran. It is part of a “massive” armada Trump has sent to the region in a show of force to the regime. At least for now, Trump has signaled he wants to reach a deal with Iran rather than resort to military action, calling the Friday talks “very good” and even suggesting an “acceptable” deal is on the table. While it is unclear what that deal includes, the United States has expressed a desire for a more encompassing agreement that focuses on Iran's nuclear program, ballistic missile production, and support for terrorist proxies in the region. Iran, however, has drawn a red line on the latter two, restricting negotiations to just its nuclear program, while also insisting it is not pursuing nuclear weapons despite ample evidence from nuclear watchdogs that it is.</p>
