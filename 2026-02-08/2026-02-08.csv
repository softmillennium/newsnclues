            Top Senate Republicans are ratcheting up pressure on President Donald Trump to pick a side in the party's nastiest primary battles before it's too late, with anxiety spiking as the midterm cycle threatens to turn sour for the GOP.
    


            GOP leaders are making a last-ditch push for Trump — who has relished his status as kingmaker for nearly a decade — to get off the sidelines and save potentially hundreds of millions of dollars set to be spent on a mission to save Sen. John Cornyn in Texas and to help clear the field in Georgia, according to a half-dozen Republican lawmakers and campaign operatives. The fear: The money will drain critical resources that could be spent elsewhere as Democrats now see a narrow but clear path to net the four seats they need to win the majority.
    


            The rising concerns come as Republicans stare down mounting midterm problems across their Senate map, with the party now forced to defend traditionally red turf in states like Alaska and even Iowa. Meanwhile, the party has watched Trump pick sides in other contested primaries that have caused internal tensions, like in Louisiana, where he endorsed against the Senate GOP incumbent over a personal grudge.
    


            The GOP's primary problem is felt most acutely in Texas, where Cornyn is just over a month out from a three-way primary race that seems destined to head to a costly two-month-long runoff. And if he loses, senior Republicans fear it could cost at least $200 million to defend the seat in Texas if state Attorney General Ken Paxton emerges as the party's nominee, according to multiple GOP sources.
    


            “It's a very difficult race, and one that's going to be a lot more expensive to hold the seat,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN about the impact of Trump remaining neutral. Asked why Trump is ignoring the pleas, Thune said: “I'm probably not the right person to answer that question.”
    


            But there's also growing concern over Georgia, where Republicans at all levels have privately urged Trump to defuse a three-way battle to take on Jon Ossoff, the lone Senate Democrat running in a state Trump won in 2024. Even in Kentucky, several GOP candidates are urging the president to weigh in on a race they fear could, with the wrong candidate, elect a second statewide Democrat.
    


            The fight over a Trump endorsement for marquee races has gotten so intense that one House Republican running to become Tennessee's next governor threatened to prolong last week's government shutdown to receive a personal assurance that the president would not publicly back his GOP opponent.
    


            The concerted push to unsnarl the GOP's toughest primaries has intensified since this month's Texas special election scare, and as the third contender in the Senate GOP race, Rep. Wesley Hunt, has tried to climb into the two-person runoff there.
    


            The warnings have been a topic in multiple meetings with top Republicans in Washington since then, including one in which the Senate GOP's campaign chief, Sen. Tim Scott, laid out national headwinds across the map, according to an attendee. He also presented internal polling to stress that Cornyn needed to win the primary in Texas or risk costing the party gobs of cash.
    


            Scott, Thune and other top senators have repeatedly warned the president, both publicly and privately, about what could happen if he stays out, multiple sources told CNN.
    


            Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, added that Trump is “considering making a decision” after the fierce lobbying push from the Senate GOP top brass.
    


            “The issue of a runoff is more money that's spent there is money that's not spent in other places, which is why I'm supporting Sen. Cornyn and plan to see him win on the first ballot,” Barrasso told CNN.
    


            Cornyn himself said he approached Trump again last week about an endorsement, after that Democratic upset in a deep-red slice of Texas that sent shockwaves through Washington.
    


            In an interview with CNN, Cornyn warned that Democrats could win the seat if the wrong Republican — namely, his chief opponent, Paxton — makes it to the general election.
    


            “I think if Republicans nominate the attorney general, I think they absolutely do,” Cornyn said when asked whether Democrats had a chance of flipping the seat. “At minimum … we'd have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to salvage that seat that could be used in places like Georgia, Michigan and New Hampshire and elsewhere.”
    


            In response to Cornyn's remarks, Paxton adviser Nick Maddux told CNN that the Texas attorney general won statewide by 10 points in 2022 despite heavy spending against him “and the same thing is going to happen in 2026 because Republican voters are fired up to go to the polls and support him.”
    


            “We must be laser-focused on turning out low-propensity, Trump-supporting America First voters. John Cornyn is the worst possible choice on that front,” Maddux said, arguing that “$50+ million's been lit on fire to help” Cornyn instead of going to battleground races.
    


            Trump has helped avoid Republican infighting in other key races this cycle. That includes the president's move in recent days to formally back former Sen. John E. Sununu in his comeback bid in New Hampshire over his own former ambassador to New Zealand, Scott Brown.
    


            He also helped out the House GOP by weighing in for an establishment-approved candidate in a crowded Georgia special election next month — where many feared a pugnacious hardliner named Colton Moore could win the seat and cause huge problems for leadership.
    


            But Trump has privately suggested he will not endorse in Georgia's Senate race — one of the GOP's biggest pickup opportunities in a state he won in 2024.
    


            Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, one of those three GOP candidates, pulled aside the president last week after a bill signing at the White House to speak about his race, telling CNN he made his case to Trump.
    


            Asked by CNN whether he sought the president's endorsement, Carter said: “You bet I did.” But in that 20-minute conversation, Carter said Trump suggested he didn't want to choose between Carter and fellow GOP Rep. Mike Collins — whose votes Trump needs to advance his agenda in the narrowly divided House.
    


            “He likes both of us,” Carter said. “I think he's gonna sit this one out.”
    


            Carter suggested Trump can't risk alienating any House member with each vote in the chamber needed to pass legislation.
    


            Asked whether a contested primary — and possibly a runoff — made it harder for Republicans to beat Ossoff, Carter said: “You can make that argument, but you can't make that argument to a majority of one.”
    


            Collins, when asked about Carter's personal appeal to Trump, said he didn't fault his opponent for trying.
    


            “He's a Republican. Ain't he? I mean, anybody that's smart is gonna want the president's endorsement,” Collins quipped.
    


            Asked whether he believed that Trump would endorse in the race, Collins added: “President Trump always has a knack for endorsing people at the right time.” (Former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley is also running in the GOP primary and has the support of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.)
    


            But Trump has contributed to other headaches for the GOP.
    


            Last month, Trump went against Thune's wishes and helped coax a GOP challenger into the race against Sen. Bill Cassidy in Louisiana. The president backed Rep. Julia Letlow over Cassidy, who once voted to convict Trump in his impeachment trial after the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. (Cassidy allies insist the fight isn't over. The incumbent has a huge cash advantage, with more than $10 million through the end of last year.)
    


            Cassidy is running aggressively on his legislative record, including bringing back money to his home state by supporting a Biden-era infrastructure bill — which Trump sought to sabotage and Letlow voted against.
    


            “I brought over $13 billion in infrastructure, much of which my opponents either opposed or voted against,” Cassidy said. “Much of that $13 billion, my opponents either opposed or criticized me for. Now they like to take credit.”
    


            But Letlow, in a statement to CNN, gave a response that highlighted a different vote Cassidy took — his decision to convict Trump in his 2021 impeachment trial.
    


            “President Trump endorsed me because I've worked with him to advance an America First agenda, including delivering real infrastructure dollars for my district. Meanwhile Bill Cassidy worked with President Biden to pass an infrastructure bill full of Green New Deal Mandates — in the same year he voted to impeach President Trump.”
    


            Pressed by CNN on whether he regretted that vote, Cassidy said: “I'm commonly asked by reporters, how do I feel, and how do I regret? And all I can say, brother is, you live your life forward.”

            Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's high-stakes gamble on a snap election has paid off, with voters handing her ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) a majority Sunday, according to public broadcaster NHK.
    


            After an election framed as a referendum on Takaichi herself, her ruling coalition secured more than two-thirds of the 465 seats in Japan's lower house, the latest count showed. And her LDP party itself had already cleared the 233-seat threshold to command a majority on its own.
    


            In an interview with NHK, Takaichi thanked those who “braved the cold and walked through the snowy roads to cast their votes.”
    


            “I wanted the voters to give me a mandate because I advocated for responsible, proactive fiscal policy that would significantly shift economic and fiscal policy,” she added.
    


            The hardline conservative, who enjoys US President Donald Trump's endorsement, has seen high approval ratings since she was elected less than four months ago, making history as the first woman to lead Japan.
    


            She has won over the public with her strong work ethic, savvy social media game and charisma, marked in viral moments such as a recent impromptu drum session to K-pop hits with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung.
    


            In calling an early election, she hoped to translate her own popularity into a stronger mandate for her party, which has been weakened in recent years by a scandal involving the misuse of political funds. She had asked the Japanese electorate for a fresh mandate to push through her fiscal expansion agenda for the world's fourth-largest economy.
    


Writing on X Sunday, Takaichi thanked Trump for his endorsement earlier this month and said the potential of the US-Japan alliance was “LIMITLESS.”
    


            Sunday's remarkable result means Takaichi's party and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, will have the numbers to chair all lower house committees.
    


            The largest opposition party, the Centrist Reform Alliance, was on track to lose more than half of the 167 seats it currently holds.
    


            The election outcome will give Takaichi a fresh mandate to tackle challenges such as Japan's rapidly aging population, the rising cost of living, a weak yen, and soured relations with China.
    


            Takaichi, a longtime lawmaker, rose to the top of Japanese politics last fall after her predecessor Shigeru Ishiba resigned amid pressure from his own party following a series of bruising defeats for the LDP.
    


            She won the LDP presidency on October 4, her third attempt at the job, and was elected prime minister on October 21 – a surprising triumph in Japan's deeply patriarchal political system.
    


            Her decision to dissolve parliament three months later, she said in a January 19 press conference, was a “profoundly weighty decision,” adding that “by doing so, I am also putting my position as prime minister on the line.”
    


            Takaichi has enjoyed unusually high approval ratings during her short tenure, in which she has made waves for her relaxed, friendly interactions with other world leaders.
    


            During a meeting with the US president just one week into her term, Trump and Takaichi looked more like old friends than world leaders.
    


            “She is a delight,” Trump told business leaders after they met. “I got to know her pretty well in a short period of time.”
    


            Days before the election, Trump gave his “total endorsement” of Takaichi, writing in a post to Truth Social that she “has already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise Leader, and one that truly loves her Country.” He added he plans to welcome Takaichi to Washington in March.
    


            Trump also enjoyed a close bond with Takaichi's mentor, the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
    


            Takaichi's decisive leadership style and support for traditional values have drawn comparisons to Margaret Thatcher, whom she cites as inspiration.
    


            But it hasn't all been sunny for Japan's first woman leader. She has been scrutinized for her relentless work schedule, which included calling a 3 a.m. meeting with aides.
    


            Comments she made about Taiwan, the democratic island claimed by China, also cratered Tokyo's relationship with Beijing.
    


            Takaichi broke Japan's long tradition of ambiguity on Taiwan when she told parliament in November that a Chinese attack on the island – which lies just 60 miles (97 kilometers) from Japanese territory – could trigger a military response from Tokyo.
    


            China retaliated by canceling flights, restricting imports of Japanese seafood and ramping up military patrols, among other measures.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Covid, Ukraine and US tariffs cost Germany $1 trn","https://www.rt.com/news/632163-german-economy-crises-cost/","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 10:29:00 GMT","



Germany has lost more than $1 trillion in GDP output over the past six years as successive crises pushed the economy into prolonged stagnation, according to the German Economic Institute (IW).

A study released on Saturday cited the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ukraine conflict, and US tariff policies as the main drivers of the losses.

The IW compared Germany's pre-crisis 2019 economic trajectory with hypothetical growth absent pandemics and geopolitical shocks against actual real GDP performance from 2020 to 2025.

The institute estimated the shortfall in price-adjusted GDP over the six-year period at €940 billion ($1.1 trillion). In household terms, this represents income Germany failed to earn, translating into a loss of over €20,000 in added value per employed person.

Economic losses from 2020 to 2022 totaled €360 billion, largely due to Covid-19 and compounded from early 2022 by the Ukraine conflict, which saw Germany take part in the Western sanctions on Russia and abandon cheap Russian energy, which previously accounted for 55% of its gas imports.

As the conflict dragged on, losses rose to €140 billion in 2023 and over €200 billion in 2024, when Germany entered back-to-back recessions.

While 2025 saw minor 0.2% growth, economists described it as a “prolonged period of stagnation.” The IW estimated a record €235 billion output loss that year, exacerbated by US President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies.

“The current decade has so far been characterized by extraordinary shocks and enormous economic adjustment burdens, which now significantly exceed the burden levels of previous crises,” IW researcher Michael Groemling stated, adding that the crises have “paralyzed economic development.”

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged last year that the economy was in a “structural crisis,” but prioritized a military buildup, pledging to make the army “Europe's strongest conventional army” amid the perceived ‘Russian threat' – which Moscow has called “nonsense.”

His government abolished the constitutional debt brake to fund the buildup and passed the 2026 budget with a record €108.2 billion for defense and €11.5 billion in military aid for Ukraine. It also committed to raising defense spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2029 as part of broader NATO-led militarization.

Merz has blamed the work ethic of Germans, the social welfare system, previous government policies, and EU regulatory bodies for the economic slump. His policies have driven his approval rating to a record low of 25% this month, down from 38% when he took office in May 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Russia and India are about to put their joint civil aviation fleet on the global map","https://www.rt.com/india/632145-russia-india-sj100-aircraft-agreement/","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 04:07:00 GMT","

By Air Marshal Anil Chopra (Retired), an Indian Air Force veteran fighter test pilot and is the former Director-General of the Center for Air Power Studies in New Delhi.

Russia recently unveiled the Superjet SJ‑100 and the turboprop Il‑114‑300 at the Wings India 2026 airshow in Hyderabad. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), India's state‑run defence‑aerospace company, had earlier signed an agreement with United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) to potentially manufacture the SJ‑100 jets in India. 

The agreement was reaffirmed and clarified during the Wing India airshow. At the same event, UAC signed a deal to supply six Ilyushin Il‑114‑300 aircraft to Indian regional carrier Flamingo Aerospace.

Both developments signal a new chapter in India‑Russia cooperation, now extending into civilian aircraft manufacturing – a sector that was not even on the agenda a few years ago.

Wings India is a premier industrial biennial India and is considered Asia's largest event on civil aviation. An array of 34 aircraft were showcased at the event, which was inaugurated by India's civil aviation minister, Ram Mohan Naidu, who said that the government was keen on boosting the aviation manufacturing sector in the country. 

Regular passenger planes, VIP planes, corporate helicopters and ambulances were among the planes on display. The models showcased were Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, Boeing 737 Max, Dhruv ALH-NG helicopter, A321 Neo, A220, Aurus Business Jet, Hindustan 228 aircraft, Diamond Da40NG Tecnam P 2006 and Tecnam P2010.

Visitors thronged to see the two Russian regional airliners on static display. Both the Il-114-300 and the SJ-100 are equipped exclusively with Russian produced systems and components, including Russian-made TV7-117ST-01 and PD-8 engines manufactured by Russia's United Engine Corporation. Both aircraft are presented with fully fitted interiors and passenger cabins. 

Russian officials and diplomats, including Ambassador to India Denis Alipov, attended the airshow and witnessed the signing of the UAC‑India agreement, underscoring Russia's keen interest in the growing Indian market.

UAC's and HAL's presence at Wings India 2026 was beyond symbolism. The companies showcased their full civil aircraft portfolios, signalling readiness to compete with global American and European giants that currently dominate the civil aircraft market. 

India today has the fastest-growing civil aviation sector, with the third-largest global air passenger market in 2025. Aviation contributes 5% of national GDP. It also greatly promotes tourism and cargo movement. India currently has 160 airports with scheduled flights, compared to 74 in 2014. 

Over 161.3 million domestic air passengers travelled in India in 2025, up 6.12% from the year before. The current airliner fleet of around 800 aircraft will more than double in five years, and is projected to reach 2,250 by 2035. After reforms in the sector were introduced, India allowed 100% foreign direct investment in most sectors of civil aviation. The two largest Indian airlines, IndiGo and Air India, have announced plans to acquire over 500 aircraft each in the coming decade.

HAL has been making the HS-748 ‘Avro' and Dornier D-228 aircraft in India under licensed production. Both have also been used for civil aviation. Also, National Aeronautics Laboratory has designed and test-flown the ‘Saras' small transport aircraft. This work is still in slow progress. 

The Tata Group companies are already building aero-structures for many helicopters and also C-130J transport aircraft for global customers. Meanwhile, a Tata consortium is building 40 Airbus C-295(formerly EADS CASA), twin-turboprop tactical military transport aircraft,  as well as  significant numbers of its sub-systems in India. The first Made-in-India C-295 aircraft will roll out of the new facility in September 2026. The indigenous content will be the highest ever in India, with 96% of the work that Airbus does in Spain gradually being done in India. 

There are more than 125 domestic MSME suppliers spread across different states supporting the project which is expected to also held the South Asian nation in pushing the development of its own its commuter aircraft. Tata Group is also working with GE to manufacture CFM International LEAP engine components in India. 

To collaborate on opportunities in aircraft manufacturing, supply chain, aftermarket services and pilot training, global aerospace leader 

Adani Defence & Aerospace, a defense wing of Adani conglomerate, has recently signed a memorandum with global aerospace leader Embraer to develop an integrated regional transport aircraft ecosystem in India. The potential partnership will leverage Embraer's deep engineering and aircraft manufacturing expertise alongside Adani's aviation value-chain footprint.

India's HAL and Russia's UAC had signed a MoU on October 27, 2025, in Moscow to manufacture SJ-100 regional passenger jets in India. This partnership aims to produce the 103-seater twin-engine aircraft for domestic, short-haul routes under India's regional airport development initiative UDAN. 

India has been wanting to have its own Indian regional jet airliner program for some time. New Delhi finally found a partner in Russia's UAC to make the SJ-100 in India. HAL will initially have the right to produce the aircraft for domestic customers in India. HAL estimates that there is a market for over 200 regional jets in India over the next decade, with a further 350 required by the Indian Ocean Region countries. The move is seen as a pivotal step toward self-reliance in civil aviation, potentially injecting competition into a market long monopolized by Boeing and Airbus, and to some extent by Embraer.

UAC is currently under US, UK, and EU sanctions. India has said it does not subscribe to unilateral sanctions and has criticized the targeting of its ties with Moscow as unjustified and unfair, while accusing the West of double standards because the EU and US still buy billions of dollars' worth of Russian goods. 



In due course, the sanctions will be over. Regional jets have yet to make significant inroads in the Indian market, with carriers preferring larger narrow-body aircraft. India's major regional jet operator is Star Air, which operates seven Embraer E175s and two ERJ-145s. 

The SJ-100 currently has 71 firm orders, all from Russian carriers. UAC is meanwhile conducting certification tests of the SJ-100, with Russian Aviadvigatel PD-8 engines. Some airlines have been attracted by its low introductory price. The later variants will have winglets, and cabin density up to 108 seats.  

Undoubtedly, the SJ-100 has had its teething supply-chain troubles. But that is true for many airliners including the Boeing 737 Max. Western sanctions have made things more complex. China remains dependent on Western aero-engines for its home-grown C919 and C929 airliners. India will have to negotiate with its partners to get appropriate aero-engines for its own aircraft, the international certification will need to be renegotiated as well. However, overall, SJ-100 could be win-win for India and Russia.

India is a rising economic power with soon-to-be the world's third largest economy. It also has the largest population with growing consumption. Russia, which is currently under heavy sanctions, and facing manpower shortages,  remains a tried and tested friend. While Russia can bring in technology, India could set-up the manufacturing hub with local skilled-manpower, software, private sector strengths, bring in funding, and also global business best-practices. The civil aircraft production can be oriented for both Indian and Russian market as well as for rest of the world

While 100% foreign direct investment has been cleared in most sectors of civil aviation, India has not yet leveraged large airliner orders. The country does have manufacturing and assembly skills, but lacks original design capabilities. 

The narrow-body airliner market is huge. India is now insisting that foreign OEMs set up assembly lines in India and give component orders to local manufacturers. 

India has a huge maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) market for civil and military aircraft and engines. Local MRO services currently only handle 15-20% of demand, according to industry data, with 80-85% outsourced, highlighting significant potential for domestic growth.  

A 2023 CRISIL report states that India's MRO sector still faces obstacles such as difficulty obtaining credit, inadequate infrastructure, high taxes, licensing and certification issues, and high rental costs. But the Indian government has introduced several policies to support making the country a global MRO hub. These include reducing taxes on MRO services from 18% to 5%, land lease policies for longer durations to lower rental costs, and discontinuing the 13% government-charged royalty on revenue. These should reduce costs by 10–20%.

Setting up an MRO is highly capital intensive, with a long break-even time. It requires continuously reskilled manpower and repeat investments in tooling, and certification from safety regulators and global OEMs such as Airbus, Boeing, and many others.

The Indian government's top think-tank, NITI Aayog, has recommended an incremental approach, by first setting up joint ventures in India with global players, and gradually ascending the work-value chain. Ultimately, India must aspire to be an international-class MRO hub like Singapore. A surge in local MRO facilities will be good for airline operations, safety, and costs. Russians would also have to set up MRO facilities for SJ-100 with Indian partners in India. 

India also needs to set up an independent authority on the lines of the Aeronautical Development Agency to push the development of civil aviation aircraft. It should function under the prime minister's office as it would involve inter-ministerial support. It may subsume the transport aircraft building facilities of state-run giants and also be tasked to work on building the medium-airlift military transport aircraft for the Indian Air Force. The agency must also drive building MRO facilities.

India must insist on foreign OEMs to set up engine manufacturing through a joint-venture route. Aircraft avionics is another area where India is way behind.

The National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) 2016, and its later versions, aim to create an integrated ecosystem for the growth of the Indian civil aviation sector, making flying more affordable and accessible, while also enhancing safety, security, and sustainability. It focuses on regional connectivity, ease of doing business, and promoting tourism and employment. The policy must be updated to incorporate India's thrust for developing local manufacturing. 

The West is moving out of China. Europe has a high cost of production. India is the next best destination for building and maintaining civil aircraft. India also has large land banks near airports, especially the newer greenfield ones. Government policies are becoming more attractive for promoting manufacture and shifting MRO to India. Finally, India has to invest much more in R&D. Developing your own designs and having your own patents is important. The Russia-India SJ-100 project could be great platform to make a beginning.

Murdoch tabloid leads charge as big freeze persists – could the mayor please do something about the weather?

It snowed two weeks ago in New York. Since then, the temperature has barely risen above freezing – a temperature science naturally dictates is necessary to melt snow and ice.

But science isn't enough for some US political critics, however, who have instead blamed Zohran Mamdani, New York's new socialist mayor, for the snow not having melted and still clogging up some of the city's streets.

The New York Post, the rightwing tabloid and a frequent Mamdani critic, has led the charge. This week the newspaper claimed that “slushy streets” were “ruining travel for everyone”.

“New Yorkers are feeling left out in the cold more than a week after fierce Winter Storm Fern dumped over a foot of snow on the city – and left behind iceberg-sized snow piles blocking roadways, bike lanes, sidewalks and parking spots,” the Post said.

The newspaper found and interviewed several people who blamed Mamdani for the fact snow was on the ground, including one man who complained that he had fallen off his bicycle due to ice.

Kelly Jane Torrance, the New York Post's editor-at-large, went on Sky News Australia on Thursday to double down on the criticism. “It's just incredible how badly he has mismanaged his very first snowstorm,” Torrance said.

“The snow is still here. A lot of it. It's … we've got record cold temperatures really in the next day or so,” she added. The mayor of New York has little power over the temperature of the city.

Calling Mamdani “pro-criminal”, Torrance suggested that New York is “facing this possible breakdown in public order”.

On Monday, the New York police department reported that January, Mamdani's first month in office, saw record low crime figures for New York, with the fewest murders, shootings, and shooting victims in the city's history.

The snow-related criticism spread among social media users. On Threads, a user called @lowerdeckmike, who has regularly posted content criticizing Mamdani, posted a picture of some snow and wrote: “More than a week after 11 o ches [inches] of snow fell on Manhattan. It's still all on the ground.”

Michael Rapaport, an actor who in 2001 appeared in Dr Doolittle 2 and now hosts a podcast, has been a frequent critic of Mamdani.

On Monday, Rapaport posted a video of him walking around New York and wrote: “A week after the snowstorm and this is what we got Zoron the Shoveler! Filthy black snow, garbage soup, ice rinks on every corner, cars buried like fossils. People slipping, breaking ankles, nobody shoveling, nobody salting, nobody doing SH*T.”

Rapaport added: “This is New York City. Three minutes from the mayor's house. Start spreading the news… this place is a dirty snow covered dump. Clean it the f*** up Mayor!”

The message did not serve as the rallying cry that Rapaport might have hoped.

“What's up with the trend of every influencer republican jumping on mamdani for the snow piling up? Real NYers know whenever it snows nyc looks like this… duhhh way before Zohran,” one person responded to his post.

Another wrote: “If you pooped your pants would you blame the Mayor??”

It didn't deter Rapaport. On Thursday he posted a video showing snow on a New York street.

“I need to know who's responsible for the dog doo doo,” Rapaport said, as he trained his camera on what appeared to be dog feces. “Who's responsible for the dirty, disgusting, sloppy snow 10 days since the storm?”

Rapaport, 55, added: “Why is every step off the curb risking your life?”

Debra Messing, the Will & Grace actor who posted Islamophobic content about Mamdani during his mayoral campaign, was also upset.

“The streets are a disaster. It hasn't snowed in 5 days and the streets still haven't been cleared,” she wrote on social media.

“I've lived here for 15 years (this go around) and this has never happened. The plows have always worked around the clock to get the city back to working.”

In fact, the past 15 years have seen other mayors criticized for their response to the snow. Bill de Blasio was accused of neglecting the wealthy Upper East Side in the wake of a storm in 2014, instead giving Brooklyn and Queens snow-plowing priority, while his predecessor Michael Bloomberg faced scrutiny when some streets went unplowed for days following 20in of snow.

On Friday, Mamdani told Hot 97 the issue is “not just the snowstorm, but the cold front”.

“Typically after snow falls in New York City we'll have the temperatures rise, we'll have the sun assist with melting the snow. Instead what we've seen is the snow becoming harder, it turning into ice,” the mayor explained.

He said 2,500 sanitation workers were working 12-hour shifts to remove snow and collect garbage.

“It's going to continue until every single street is clean and clear in this city, because that's what New Yorkers deserve.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Exit polls point to public endorsement of new prime minister on day of blizzards and freezing conditions

Japan's conservative governing party is on course to dramatically strengthen its grip on power after exit polls predicted a landslide victory in Sunday's elections, in what will be seen as an early public endorsement of the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi.

The Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was projected to win between 274 and 328 seats out of a total of 465, according to an exit poll by the public broadcaster NHK, well above the 233 it needed to regain the majority it lost in 2024. NHK projected a supermajority for the LDP and its junior coalition partner, the Japan Innovation party, which will ease Takaichi's legislative agenda.

The elections for the lower house of parliament were held on a freezing day when many parts of the country were again hit by heavy snow.

Takaichi, who called the snap election soon after becoming Japan's first female prime minister last autumn, had vowed to resign if her coalition failed to secure a simple majority.

She will not have long to savour her party's victory, however. There are concerns over her management of Japan's public finances and her ability to defuse a bitter row with China over the future of Taiwan.

Takaichi sought to appeal to voters with a $135bn stimulus package aimed at easing the cost-of-living crisis, later promising to suspend the 8% consumption (sales) tax on food for two years – a ¥5tn ($30bn) hit to annual revenue.

Her spending plans have rattled financial markets and caused currency volatility, prompting some commentators to question her approach given that Japan's debt is more than twice the size of its GDP – the heaviest debt burden of any advanced economy.

Speaking as exit polls showed her party cruising to victory, Takaichi said: “We have consistently stressed the importance of responsible and proactive fiscal policy. We will prioritise the sustainability of fiscal policy. We will ensure necessary investments. Public and private sectors must invest. We will build a strong and resilient economy.”

After a whirlwind introduction to diplomacy – including meetings with Donald Trump and Xi Jinping late last year – Takaichi sparked a row with Beijing in November when she suggested that Japan could become involved militarily in the event of a Chinese attempt to invade Taiwan.

China urged tourists not to visit Japan – advice they have heeded – and young people not to study there, citing “safety concerns”. The dispute has disrupted cultural exchanges, and even brought an end to decades of “panda diplomacy”.

Takaichi's refusal to withdraw her remarks may have angered Beijing, but it has played well with many voters.

Margarita Estévez-Abe, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said Sunday's election victory could give Takaichi room to repair the damage to Sino-Japanese ties.

“Now she doesn't have to worry about any elections until 2028, when the next upper house elections will take place,” Estévez-Abe said. “So the best scenario for Japan is that Takaichi kind of takes a deep breath and focuses on amending the relationship with China.”

But if she follows through with the consumption tax cut, the market reaction could be swift and hostile, according to some analysts.

If Takaichi won big, she would have more political room to follow through on key commitments, including on consumption-tax cuts,” said Seiji Inada, the managing director at the consultancy FGS Global. “Markets could react in the following days, and the yen could come under renewed pressure.”

Blizzard conditions in some regions made visiting a polling station in Sunday's election, the first held in mid-winter for 35 years, a test of endurance for many voters.

Kazushige Cho, a 54-year-old teacher, said he had been determined to vote for the LDP despite the atrocious weather. “She has shown strong leadership and pushes various policies forward,” Cho said outside a polling station in a small town in Niigata prefecture where the snow had reached a depth of more than 2 metres. “I think things could turn out quite well.”

The weather, which is expected to contribute to a low turnout, caused widespread disruption on Sunday, halting services on dozens of train lines and forcing the cancellation of 230 domestic flights, according to the transport ministry.

Turnout stood at 21.6% with four hours left before polls closed – 2.65 percentage points lower than at the same time in the 2024 lower house election, the Nikkei business newspaper said, citing the internal affairs ministry.

Takaichi's personal popularity – particularly with younger voters – has transformed the LDP's fortunes since winning the race to succeed Shigeru Ishiba as the party's president in October.

Under Ishiba, the LDP and its then coalition partner Komeito lost their majorities in both houses of parliament amid public anger over a slush fund scandal and the rising cost of food and other basics.

The party, which has governed Japan for most of the past 70 years, was helped, as in previous elections, by a fractured and uninspiring opposition.

The main opposition Centrist Reform Alliance – formed weeks before by two existing parties – was expected to suffer heavy losses on Sunday, leaving questions hanging over its future.

The final count will not be known until late on Sunday. If the Takaichi-led coalition achieves an absolute majority of 261 seats, it will control parliamentary committees, making it easier to pass budget and other legislation.

A super-majority of 310 seats would allow the coalition to override the upper house, where the LDP-led alliance lost its majority in July last year.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Jeff Bezos's axing of more than 300 jobs at the storied newspaper has renewed fears about the resilience of America's democracy to withstand Trump's attacks

The email landed in Lizzie Johnson's in-tray in Ukraine just before 4pm local time. It came at a tough time for the reporter: Russia had been repeatedly striking the country's power grid, and just days before she had been forced to work out of her car without heat, power or running water, writing in pencil because pen ink freezes too readily.

“Difficult news,” was the subject line. The body text said: “Your position is eliminated as part of today's organizational changes,” explaining that it was necessary to get rid of her to meet the “evolving needs of our business”.

Johnson's response may go down in the annals of American media history. “I was just laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone,” she wrote on X. “I have no words.”

The Washington Post's Ukraine correspondent may have been rendered speechless over Wednesday's move by Jeff Bezos, the Amazon billionaire and Post owner, to cut more than 300 newsroom jobs. The bloodletting, which has raised renewed fears about the resilience of America's democracy to withstand Donald Trump's attacks, swept away the paper's entire sports department, much of its culture and local staff and all of its journalists in such arid news zones as Ukraine and the Middle East.

Others, though, managed to find their tongues. “It's a bad day,” said Don Graham, son of the Post's legendary Watergate-era owner Katharine Graham, breaking the silence he has maintained since selling the paper to Bezos for $250m in 2013.

“I am crushed,” was the lament of Bob Woodward, one-half of the paper's double act with Carl Bernstein that exposed Watergate.

“This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organizations,” said Marty Baron, the Post's lionised former executive editor. Not one to mince his words, Baron castigated Bezos for his “sickening efforts to curry favor with President Trump”, saying it left an especially “ugly stain” on the paper's standing.

Several hundred people rallied in front of the Post's offices on Thursday, voicing support for their laid-off colleagues. “It's disappointing on an immense scale. They don't seem to give a damn about this institution and the people that make it run,” said Patrick Nielsen, an engineer at the paper.

Howls of dismay were also uttered by prominent Post alumni in interviews with the Guardian. Robert McCartney, a 39-year veteran of the Post until he retired five years ago, said it was a “tragedy and an outrage”.

Like many Post insiders, McCartney has been astonished by the stark contrast between Bezos's handling of the newspaper during Donald Trump's first term in office and his conduct now in Trump 2.0.

McCartney was a senior journalist on the paper during Bezos's initial eight years of ownership, through Trump's first presidency. Back then, he, like many others, was grateful for Bezos's tutelage.

“We saw him as a savior. He pumped money into the Post, didn't meddle in the newsroom and stood up to Trump,” he said.

Fast-forward to 2026, and a very different Bezos has emerged. In 2017, soon after Trump's first inauguration, the Post introduced its new strapline: “Democracy dies in darkness.”

That wording still runs proudly beneath the masthead. At the end of a week like this one, though, America looks a notable shade darker.

Marcus Brauchli, the Post's executive editor until 2012 who now runs investment firm North Base Media, said that this was a terrible moment to be hammering one of the country's great custodians of public accountability: “These are historic times, given the cyclone bearing down on the world order and American system of government. This is when journalism matters most. I mean, laying off reporters in Ukraine, now.”

It is not as though Bezos needs the money. He is the fourth-richest person on the planet, according to Forbes, with a $245bn fortune.

As Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for the New York Times, pointed out, Bezos could cover five years of the Post's $100m annual losses by dipping into his earnings from a single week.

The optics of Wednesday's train wreck of an announcement were also diabolical: the job of facing the distraught staff on Zoom was delegated to the Post's beleaguered current executive editor, Matt Murray.

Bezos was nowhere to be seen. Yet there he was, earlier in the week, beaming broadly as he welcomed Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to the Florida headquarters of his space company, Blue Origin.

Nor did Will Lewis, Bezos's consigliere as publisher of the Post, have the courage to present himself as the guillotine came down. A day after he had presided over the evisceration of the paper's sports department, he was spotted attending the red carpet at an NFL Super Bowl event in San Francisco.

On Saturday night, however, Lewis abruptly resigned, acknowledging “difficult decisions” as he praised Bezos's leadership of the paper.

The lay-offs came just five days after the launch of the first lady documentary, Melania, bankrolled by Amazon MGM Studios. Bezos sank $75m into that pile of “gilded trash” yet, unlike the Post, seems unfazed by the film's paltry return on investment.

“What Bezos did for Melania while gutting his own newspaper,” wrote the historian Simon Schama, will come to be seen “as the most glaring symptom of cultural collapse in a democracy hanging on to truth by the barest of threads”.

This fateful juncture has been looming for a while. The first warning signs came in October 2024, when Bezos yanked the Post's planned endorsement of Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris just 11 days before the presidential election.

A wave of public revulsion ensued, leading to the cancellation of at least 250,000 Post subscriptions.

Soon after, the billionaire unilaterally imposed new strictures on the paper's opinion content. He introduced what he called his “two pillars”: “personal liberties and free markets.”

That drove many of the paper's top commentators rushing for the exit, among them the economics columnist Eduardo Porter, who now writes for the Guardian. “This layering of dogma undermined critical thinking,” Porter recalled. “It turned the Post into something more akin to a church, with tight constraints on thought.”

This week's day of the long knives has left many people desperately seeking explanations. There were clearly business motives at play: you don't get to be a gazillionaire like Bezos without caring about profit lines, and the Post has been battered in recent years by harsh industry headwinds.

But there are other, more sinister, interpretations. McCartney thinks back to 2019 when Amazon lost a $10bn Pentagon cloud-computing contract during Trump's first term.

Amazon complained in a lawsuit that this was a blatant act of retaliation by Trump, punishing Bezos for the Washington Post's piercing coverage of his administration. Could it be that the bruising experience led Bezos to change tack, concluding that shining a light in defense of American democracy came at too high a price for the jewels in his business empire, Amazon and Blue Origin?

“It's very likely that the desire to appease Trump, to placate him, is playing a role in these decisions,” McCartney said.

That's a chilling thought for such a beacon of accountability journalism as the Washington Post. And it is set against the already parlous state of US media.

Since 2000, some 3,500 newspapers have closed shop, abandoning one in four Americans who now live in news deserts with no local newspaper. The most recent casualty was the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which will publish its final edition in May. It was founded in 1786, three years before George Washington donned the mantle of first president.

While many papers have been folding, others have fallen into the hands of a new breed of super-wealthy tech and venture capitalist owners who, like Bezos, see journalism as an asset to monetize: the Los Angeles Times was acquired in 2018 by a biotech billionaire, Patrick Soon-Shiong.

Like Bezos, Soon-Shiong has displayed symptoms of Trump Appeasement Syndrome. He too refused to allow his paper to endorse Harris days before the 2024 election.

Historic newspapers brought low, news deserts proliferating: this is fertile ground on which misinformation and the Maga pestilence can grow. Trump has cultivated it relentlessly to his advantage.

Long hostile towards what he calls the “fake news media”, Trump has taken his vendetta against truth-seekers to a new level. He has stripped public media channels NPR and PBS of more than $1bn in federal funding, launched full-frontal attacks on individual journalists and outlets exposing his corruption and lies and sustained a bullying campaign against corporate owners designed to browbeat them into subservience.

CBS News is the consummate example. Trump leaned on Paramount, which owned the news network, with a $10bn lawsuit over a 60 Minutes pre-election interview with Harris. Paramount settled for $16m, even though the suit was widely ridiculed as spurious.

Front of Paramount's mind, no doubt, was its upcoming merger with Skydance Media that required federal – ie Trump's – approval.

Following the merger, David Ellison became CEO of Paramount Skydance. He is son of the billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who is a close friend and adviser of Trump's.

The younger Ellison went ahead and appointed the anti-woke commentator Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News, sending shockwaves through the storied network's dazed and demoralised staff. Weiss, who came to the job with no TV industry experience, has swiftly confirmed their fears.

She pulled a 60 Minutes segment on the notorious Cecot mega-prison in El Salvador to which the Trump administration had been deporting immigrants. Among her early hires as CBS News contributors are a Trump loyalist and former US marine, a prominent vaccine skeptic buddy of the health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, and fellow anti-woke firebrand Niall Ferguson.

The cumulative malaise that is descending over US media leaves the country's democratic institutions vulnerable to attack. It can't be exclusively blamed for Trump's excesses.

There are plenty of other willing accomplices and capitulators, including universities like Columbia, corporate law firms and the gung-ho conservative activists who now control the supreme court.

But from Trump's perspective, a media on its knees surely helps. The results are present everywhere you look.

Trump is unleashed, unchained. He feels so comfortable in his regal skin that he can berate a respected female CNN reporter questioning him on the Epstein files for never smiling.

He can peddle unashamedly in racism, posting a video depicting the first Black president and his first lady as monkeys.

He can send a masked paramilitary into the streets of Minneapolis, resulting in Americans getting killed for exercising their first amendment rights. And when the polls for November's midterm elections look challenging for him, he can prepare for another blitzkrieg on the very foundations of American democracy: the ballot box.

There's a paradox in all this. Many of the democratic norms that Trump is obliterating – take for example his destruction of the norm of Department of Justice independence in his persecution of his political opponents – were laid down in the 1970s in the wake of the Watergate scandal.

That's the same Watergate scandal that was brought into the light by that pair of courageous reporters at a newspaper called the Washington Post.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A prince, an ambassador, senior diplomats, top politicians. All brought down by the Jeffrey Epstein files, and all in Europe, rather than the US. 

The huge trove of Epstein documents released by the US Department of Justice has sent shock waves through Europe's political, economic and social elites — dominating headlines, ending careers, and spurring political and criminal investigations. 

Former British ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson was fired and could go to prison. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces a leadership crisis over the Mandelson appointment. Senior figures have fallen in Norway, Sweden and Slovakia. Even before the latest batch of files, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, brother of British King Charles III, lost his honors, princely title and taxpayer-funded mansion.

Apart from the former Prince Andrew, none of them faces claims of sexual wrongdoing. They have been toppled for maintaining friendly relationships with Epstein after he became a convicted sex offender. 

“Epstein collected powerful people the way others collect frequent flyer points,” said Mark Stephens, a specialist in international and human rights law at Howard Kennedy in London. “But the receipts are now in public, and some might wish they'd traveled less.” 

The documents were published after a public frenzy over Epstein became a crisis for US President Donald Trump's administration and led to a rare bipartisan effort to force the US government to open its investigative files. However, in the US, the long-sought publication has not brought the same public reckoning with Epstein's associates — at least so far. 

Rob Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said that in Britain, “if you're in those files, it's immediately a big story.” 

“It suggests to me we have a more functional media, we have a more functional accountability structure, that there is still a degree of shame in politics, in terms of people will say: ‘This is just not acceptable, this is just not done,'” he said. 

British figures felled by their ties to Epstein include the former Prince Andrew — who paid millions to settle a lawsuit with one of Epstein's victims and is facing pressure to testify in the US — and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, whose charity shut down this week. 

Like others now ensnared, veteran politician Mandelson long downplayed his relationship with Epstein, despite calling him “my best pal” in 2003. The new files reveal contact continued for years after the financier's 2008 prison term for sexual offenses involving a minor. In a July 2009 message, Mandelson appeared to refer to Epstein's release from prison as “liberation day.” 

Starmer fired Mandelson in September last year over revelations about his Epstein ties. British police are investigating whether Mandelson committed misconduct in public office by passing on sensitive information to Epstein. 

Starmer has apologized to Epstein's victims and pledged to release public documents that would show Mandelson lied when he was being vetted for the ambassador's job. That might not be enough to stop furious lawmakers trying to eject the prime minister from office over his failure of judgement. 

Experts caution that Britain should not be too quick to pat itself on the back over its rapid reckoning with Mandelson. The US has a better record than the UK when it comes to declassifying and publishing information. 

However, Alex Thomas, executive director of the Institute for Government think tank, said that “there is something about parliamentary democracy,” with its need for a prime minister to retain the confidence of the parliament to stay in office, “that I think does help drive accountability.” 

A few high-profile Americans have faced repercussions over their friendly ties with Epstein. Most prominent is former US secretary of Treasury Larry Summers, who went on leave from academic positions at Harvard University late last year. 

Brad Karp quit last week as chair of top US law firm Paul Weiss after revelations in the latest batch of documents, and the NFL said it would investigate Epstein's relationship with New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch, who exchanged sometimes crude e-mails with Epstein about potential dates with adult women. 

Other US Epstein associates have not yet faced severe sanction, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who exchanged hundreds of texts with Epstein, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, who accepted an invitation to visit Epstein's island, and Elon Musk, who discussed visiting the island in e-mails, but says he never made the trip. 

Former US president Bill Clinton has been compelled by Republicans to testify before US Congress about his friendship with Epstein. Trump, too, has repeatedly faced questions about his ties to Epstein. Neither he nor Clinton has ever been accused of wrongdoing by Epstein's victims. 

The Epstein files reveal the global network of royals, political leaders, billionaires, bankers and academics that the wealthy financier built around him. 

Across Europe, officials have had or resign or face censure after the Epstein files revealed relationships that were more extensive than previously disclosed. 

Joanna Rubinstein, a Swedish UN official, quit after the revelation of a 2012 visit to Epstein's Caribbean island. Miroslav Lajcak, national security adviser to Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, quit over his communications with Epstein, which included the pair discussing “gorgeous” girls. 

Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have set up wide-ranging official investigations into the documents. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said a team would scour the files for potential Polish victims, and any links between Epstein and Russian secret services. 

Epstein took an interest in European politics, in one e-mail exchange with billionaire Peter Thiel calling Britain's 2016 vote to leave the EU “just the beginning” and part of a return to “tribalism.” 

Gregoire Roos, director of the Europe program at the think tank Chatham House, said the files uncover Epstein's “far-reaching” network of contacts in Europe, “and the level of access among not just those who were already in power, but those who were getting there. 

“It will be interesting to see whether in the correspondence he had an influence in policymaking,” Roos said. 

Meanwhile, Norway's economic crimes unit has opened a corruption investigation into former Norwegian prime minister Thorbjorn Jagland — who also once headed the committee that hands out the Nobel Peace Prize — over his ties with Epstein. 

His lawyer said Jagland would cooperate with the probe. 

Also ensnared are high-profile Norwegian diplomat couple Terje Rod-Larsen and Mona Juul, key players in the 1990s Israel-Palestinian peace efforts. Juul has been suspended as Norway's ambassador to Jordan after revelations including that Epstein left the couple's children US$10 million in a will drawn up shortly before his death by suicide in a New York prison in 2019. 

Norwegians' respect for their royal family has been dented by new details about Epstein's friendship with Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit, who is married to the heir to the throne, Prince Haakon. The files include jokey exchanges and e-mails planning visits to Epstein properties, teeth-whitening appointments and shopping trips. 

The Norwegian princess on Friday apologized “to all of you whom I have disappointed.”

The Washington Post on Saturday said its CEO and publisher Will Lewis was leaving effective immediately, just days after the storied newspaper owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made drastic job cuts that angered readers. 

Although newspapers across the US have been facing brutal industry headwinds, Lewis' management of the outlet was sharply criticized by subscribers and employees alike during his two-year tenure as he tried to reverse financial losses at the daily. 

Lewis, who is English, has been replaced by Jeff D'Onofrio, a former CEO of social media platform Tumblr who had joined the Post as chief financial officer last year, the paper announced.

In an e-mail to staff shared on social media by one of the newspaper's reporters, Lewis said it was “the right time for me to step aside.” 

A statement from the Post said only that D'Onofrio was succeeding Lewis “effective immediately.” 

Hundreds of Post journalists — including most of its overseas, local and sports staff — were let go in the sweeping cuts announced on Tuesday last week. 

The Post did not disclose the number of jobs being eliminated, but the New York Times reported approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off. 

The paper's entire Middle East roster was let go as was its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent as the war with Russia grinds on. Sports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back and the paper's daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported.

Bezos, one of the world's richest people, and Lewis have come under scrutiny for intervening directly in the paper's editorial processes.

Bezos reined in the newspaper's liberal-leaning editorial page and blocked an endorsement of Democratic US presidential candidate Kamala Harris days before the 2024 election .

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that 250,000 digital subscribers left the Post after it refrained from endorsing Harris, and it lost about US$100 million in 2024, as advertising and subscription revenues fell.

Editor's Note: The story was updated to include the most recent statement from the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces. 

Ukrainian air strikes have damaged a key hub for Russia's intercontinental ballistic missiles over the past month, officials say, damaging a hangar and other infrastructure. 

The General Staff wrote in a Feb. 5 post on Telegram that the Armed Forces of Ukraine had inflicted a series of strikes on the Kapustin Yar airfield in Russia's Astrakhan Oblast over the course of January.

""Based on current information, on the territory of the testing ground a part of the buildings have taken on various degrees of damage, one of the hangars was significantly damaged, and part of the personnel was evacuated from the territory,"" the post reads.

On Feb. 8, the General Staff released further details, confirming damage to a technical facility used for servicing medium-range ballistic missiles, an assembly building, and a logistics warehouse.

Kapustin Yar is a Soviet-built airfield that has long served as hub for Russia's ballistic missile program. 

The Oreshnik is a much-ballyhooed intermediate-range ballistic missile that seems to be a modification of the surface-to-surface Rubezh missile, itself a modification of various ballistic weapons designed by the Soviet Union. 

Russia first used an Oreshnik in Ukraine on the city of Dnipro in Nov. 2024. As far as public information goes, Russia most recently used an Oreshnik to hit Lviv Oblast in Western Ukraine on Jan. 9. It remains a largely experimental weapon, with Russia's stockpiles the subject of much speculation, though certainly limited. 

Russia's rare deployments of Oreshniks typically accentuate political statements. British intelligence referred to the Lviv strike as retaliation for alleged Ukrainian attacks on Russian President Vladimir Putin's residence, and that Russia ""highly likely only has a handful of Oreshnik missiles.""

The General Staff attributed Ukraine's January strikes to ""using long-range strike weapons of Ukrainian production, particularly the FP-5 'Flamingo.'"" 

The Flamingo is a cruise missile advertised as having a distance of some 3,000 kilometers, capable of carrying a 1,000 kilogram warhead, and being manufactured within Ukraine at a rate of up to eight daily. Fire Point, the missile maker, said in August that the missile was already in mass production. 

The General Staff has noted a handful of strikes on Russian-held territory as being the work of the Flamingo. Fire Point has also been a major recipient of funding from European benefactors, and is currently trying to kick off production of its own rocket fuel at a plant in Denmark. 

Evidence of successful strikes have been relatively scarce, however, leaving manufacturer Fire Point under persistent scrutiny. As the Kyiv Independent first reported, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine was investigating Fire Point when President Volodymyr Zelensky tried to pass legislation that would put the bureau under the control of his appointed prosecutor general. 

Defense Industry Reporter

Kollen Post is the defense industry reporter at the Kyiv Independent. Based in Kyiv, he covers weapons production and defense tech. Originally from western Michigan, he speaks Russian and Ukrainian. His work has appeared in Radio Free Europe, Fortune, Breaking Defense, the Cipher Brief, the Foreign Policy Research Institute, FT's Sifted, and Science Magazine. He holds a BA from Vanderbilt University.

Explosions were heard in Kyiv around 5:30 p.m. local time on Feb. 8 amid a ballistic missile threat, The Kyiv Independent's journalists on the ground reported.

Zelensky also announced the upcoming production of Ukrainian drones in Germany.

“We don't know what happened with that particular general — maybe it was their own internal Russian infighting,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.

Ukraine's energy system remains under severe strain, and nuclear plants are still partially discharged as of Feb. 8 following Russia's mass attack on Ukraine's power grid overnight on Feb. 7.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur examines SpaceX's move to curb Russia's illegal use of Starlink satellite internet — a technology that has been vital to Ukraine's defense since 2022.

The General Staff attributed the strikes to ""using long-range strike weapons of Ukrainian production, particularly the FP-5 'Flamingo.'"" 

Those targeted include are citizens and residents of Russia, Hong Kong, Kyrgyzstan, and the United Arab Emirates.

Russian forces launched 101 drones at Ukrainian cities overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

The number includes 1,040 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

""An agent of our movement set fire to a hardware module at the base of a communication tower. As a result of the destruction of the ground equipment, all the infrastructure installed on the mast was completely de-energized and put out of action,"" the Atesh partisan group announced.

""The Armed Forces of Ukraine attacked our region using long-range Neptune missiles and HIMARS multiple rocket launcher systems,"" Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz claimed. ""As a result of the attack, power supply was disrupted in seven municipalities.""

Blackouts and heating outages were reported in the Russian city of Belgorod on Feb. 7 after alleged attacks on a local thermal power plant and electrical substation. 

""This is a level of attack that no terrorist in the world has ever dared,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said the following evening. 

The controversy erupted after promotional photos appeared on social media showing models styled as schoolgirls in a classroom setting, wearing outfits widely perceived as sexualized versions of high school uniforms. 

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban criticized Ukraine for calling on the EU halt imports of cheap Russian energy. ""Anyone who says this is an enemy of Hungary, so Ukraine is our enemy,"" he said at a rally on Feb. 7.

The pro-Ukrainian Atesh partisan group disabled communication infrastructure in Russia's Belgorod Oblast, the group claimed early on Feb. 8.

""An agent of our movement set fire to a hardware module at the base of a communication tower. As a result of the destruction of the ground equipment, all the infrastructure installed on the mast was completely de-energized and put out of action,"" the Atesh group announced.

The act of sabotage was conducted near Ukraine's border with Russia and ""effectively blinded the enemy in this sector,"" the group said in a Telegram post.

Meanwhile, with control equipment disabled, the front line in the area has created an opportunity for Ukrainian forces to circumvent signal jamming, Atesh claimed.

""The tower served as a platform for electronic warfare antennas that suppressed drone signals. The destruction of this technical post opened a 'window' for the unimpeded operation of Ukrainian"" drones, the group said.

On Feb. 5, Russian forces were cut off from access to Starlink satellite internet across the front line with the introduction of a new ""white list.""

Ukraine and SpaceX worked to block Russian access to the Starlink service within Ukraine using a mass registration scheme on the government services application Diia.

Lindsey Vonn crashes into a gate during the women's downhill race on Sunday.Jacquelyn Martin/The Associated Press

On a dramatic day in the women's downhill event at the Milano Cortina Olympics, Lindsey Vonn suffered a grizzly crash, while fellow American Breezy Johnson earned the gold medal. 

Vonn's fifth Olympics ended as many feared it would when she said she would race on a torn ACL – with the star American alpine ski racer being airlifted off the mountain on Sunday after a gruesome fall.

Just 13.4 seconds into her run, Vonn's legs failed her on the Olympic course in Cortina d'Ampezzo. Wearing the No.13 bib, Vonn rolled and twisted into a sideways crash with a burst of screams. 

The atmosphere at the famous Olimpia delle Tofane where Vonn has amassed 12 World Cup victories fell silent, from fans to media, and the other skiers in the event. Medics rushed to help Vonn before a lengthy delay in the event for a helicopter to fly her off the mountain. It was one of a few crashes in Sunday's event.

Vonn's American teammate Johnson, who had already put down the blistering run of one minute and 36.10 seconds while racing in the No.6 bib that would earn her Olympic Gold, watched from the leader's seat.

Germany's Emma Aicher earned the silver medal (1:36.14), while Italian Sophia Goggia took bronze (1:36.69). But Vonn's accident subdued the celebratory emotions.

The three-time Olympic medalist was trying to make a comeback at age 41, after a retirement of some six years. 

She'd been having a dream season until she torn her anterior cruciate ligament racing in a World Cup event in Crans-Montana, Switzerland on Jan. 30, less than two weeks out from the Winter Games. She had insisted she would race on it, vowing her Olympic dream was not over. She was willing to gamble, and she lost.

“The work that we put in, the career, obviously my heart aches for her,” said Johnson. “It's a tough road, and it's a tough sport, and I think that's the beauty and the madness of it: that it can hurt you so badly, but you keep coming back for more.” 

Andorra's Cande Moreno and Austria's Nina Ortlieb also crashed during their runs. Ortlieb was able to stand up and walk off the course, while Moreno needed to be airlifted.

It was Vonn who dominated the attention. She'd been one of the marquee names in these Winter Games. On Sunday, media buses were heaving with reporters and photographers from all over the world, winding the tree and mountain-lined roads into Cortina d'Ampezzo, and crawling up to the fashionable 2026 Olympics winter resort nestled in the Italian Dolomites.

The fog of the past few days at Tofane Alpine Ski Centre had passed, and it was an idyllic sunny setting. The grandstands were jammed. A DJ was pumping dance music. Snoop Dogg was in the crowd. It was billed as one of the most competitive Olympic women's downhill races ever.

The crash is likely to end Vonn's Olympic campaign in Italy, and it was possibly the last race of her storied career. 

“My heart is just hurting for her, because I grew up watching her, and I'm such a fan, and I really was rooting for her,” said Canadian skier Cassidy Grey of Calgary, who finished 26th on Sunday and was in the chairlift traveling to the start gate when she looked down and saw Vonn with the medical team.

The other Canadian in Sunday's downhill, Ottawa's Valerie Grenier, 29 was disqualified from the event after a fluke mishap with one of her pole straps right before her race caused a late push out of the start gate. 

She did the race anyway, but Grenier knew the whole time she was likely to be disqualified for the late exit.

A reward of up to €1 million has prompted a wave of tip-offs, Germany's interior minister said. In other news, experts say pandemic, war, and trade-related disruptions cost the German economy €1 billion.

These updates have been closed. Thank you for reading. 

Below, you can review headlines from Germany from Saturday, February 7, 2026:

A sudden tire failure on a moving truck on the A9 in the Saale-Orla district of Thuringia has caused a major crash involving 28 vehicles, in an incident police said was remarkable for leaving no one injured.

A spokesperson for the autobahn police said it was ""like a miracle"" that nobody was hurt, adding that ""the scale was not everyday.""

The driver was traveling Friday when a tire was damaged without warning, sending debris across the roadway. Police said 27 other vehicles, including cars and trucks, collided with the tire parts.

The cause of the initial tire damage remains unclear. Police estimated losses at around 150,000 euros, and the highway was closed for several hours into the night.

Thousands of people are demonstrating in Berlin against Iran's authoritarian government and in solidarity with people in Iran.

Organizers said the ""Freedom for Iran"" rally has been backed by around 340 international organizations and political figures and was promoted through social media, flyers, and large newspaper ads.

Police said about 8,000 people gathered at the start, with more demonstrators still arriving. Organizers said they expected up to 100,000 participants, adding that some travelers were coming by bus after flights from Sweden and Denmark were canceled. Police reported a peaceful event and said around 380 officers were deployed.

Organizers said many demonstrators were relatives of people killed or detained during recent protests in Iran. Many waved Iranian flags, while others held up photos of Maryam Rajavi, president of the banned National Council of Resistance of Iran. Some wore yellow vests reading ""Free Iran.""

Protests erupted in Iran in late December amid a deep economic crisis and soaring inflation, later widening into political demonstrations against the ruling system. Security forces responded violently, and Iranian human rights groups have reported more than 3,400 deaths, though exact figures are difficult to verify under Iran's information restrictions.

Damaged cables at a rail crossing have been causing disruptions in regional train service between Thuringia's state capital Erfurt and Sangerhausen in neighboring Saxony-Anhalt.

German rail operator Deutsche Bahn said trains were still being canceled Saturday morning, and a spokesperson could not say when the problem would be fixed.

Federal police said the disruption was almost certainly caused by severed signal cables found in opened cable shafts near the town of Artern, after Deutsche Bahn alerted authorities early Friday afternoon.

Police temporarily detained three suspects near the scene, and the men, aged 23 to 28, are now being investigated on suspicion of disrupting public services and causing property damage.

Germany is not planning to open a consulate in Greenland, unlike its neighbor France.

The Foreign Ministry in Berlin said the German government was already represented on the island through an honorary consul and that opening a consulate is not planned at this time.

France said it was opening a consulate general in Greenland on Friday, becoming the first EU country to do so, after President Emmanuel Macron announced the move in Nuuk last June. Canada also opened a consulate on the same day.

Tensions over Greenland have been escalating after US President Donald Trump repeatedly raised the idea of taking control of the Danish territory, though he later backed away from threats to use military force and from plans for punitive tariffs against Germany and other European countries.

Denmark and the United States are now holding talks aimed at resolving the dispute.

Investigators are securing evidence after customs officials uncovered an illegally operated cigarette factory in a warehouse in Kalbe, in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt.

A spokesperson for the Hanover Customs Investigation Office said the site was comparatively large and that forensic work and the removal of seized items were expected to take the entire weekend.

Officials said a complete production line was discovered, with more than 30 million untaxed cigarettes, several tons of tobacco, and materials such as filters and packaging confiscated.

Authorities said the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) was assisting with transporting the large volume of evidence, after customs officers found the cigarettes stacked on around 80 to 90 Euro pallets.

The raid followed a truck inspection on Friday on the A2 highway near Auetal in Lower Saxony, where about 12 million cigarettes were seized.

Customs officials said the suspected counterfeit cigarettes caused an estimated tax loss of more than €8 million (just under $9.5 million).

Four people were provisionally arrested, though officials initially gave no details on the suspects.

Germany's team outfit at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics has caused a stir, with athletes reacting humorously over the unusual look featuring oversized ponchos and bucket hats.

""From now on, we're fishing for medals!"" Team Germany wrote alongside a photo from the nations' parade at Milan's San Siro stadium.

At the second host venue in Cortina d'Ampezzo, German athletes continued the joke. Bobsledder Joshua Tasche threw himself in front of his teammates and wriggled like a fish on a hook.

The stunt was not clearly visible on television. ""Unfortunately it didn't quite work out because we were standing in front,"" skeleton racer Axel Jungk told Eurosport. Online, however, the moment was celebrated from another camera angle.

Bobsleigh pilot Adam Ammour posted a video, writing: ""The German fishing team is ready for the Olympics.""

Outfitter Adidas designed the outfit, which had already sparked debate before the ceremony. Figure skating legend Katarina Witt joked on German broadcaster ARD: ""We're still wondering about our jackets. Is it a poncho, a blanket, or an air mattress?""

Internationally, the German outfits drew plenty of attention. American newspaper USA Today placed Team Germany first in a photo feature of the most striking looks at the opening ceremony.

German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt says investigators have been receiving a large number of tips since authorities offered a reward over a suspected far-left arson attack on Berlin's power grid.

Dobrindt told Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland that the Federal Criminal Police Office, known as the BKA, is now following up on the information, adding that it is still too early to say whether any lead will prove decisive.

A reward of up to €1 million ($1.18 million) has been offered for information provided by February 24 that helps solve the attack, with Dobrindt stressing that payments will be made only for valid tips that lead directly to the arrest of the perpetrator or perpetrators.

He said officials believe there are differing views within the far-left extremist scene about the success of the attack, which left thousands of Berlin residents without electricity and heating for days during freezing temperatures, and suggested this could prompt insider information.

The minister said rewards are time-limited to ensure crimes are not left unresolved and that potential accomplices do not have months to decide whether to come forward.

""We believe that there are very different assessments within the left-wing extremist scene about the success of the attack, which left thousands of Berliners without electricity and heating for days in sub-zero temperatures,"" he added.

""That's why I can well imagine that clues about the perpetrators could come from this scene.""

In a public appeal, the BKA and federal prosecutors have asked for information about the arson attack on January 3, which damaged several high-voltage cables and caused power outages for about 45,000 households in southwest Berlin.

Germany's economy minister is rejecting a proposal to tie EU public funding to strict ""Made in Europe"" requirements, warning that Europe's response to global competition cannot be isolation.

Economy Minister Katherina Reiche told the German news agency DPA that Europe needs simpler rules and to allow faster investment decisions. Reiche is a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union party. 

Reiche said Europe's approach should be ""Made with Europe,"" combining the bloc's own strengths with reliable trade partners worldwide to boost competitiveness.

""Europe needs simple rules, faster investment processes and tangible cuts in bureaucracy,"" Reiche said. 

EU Industry Commissioner Stephane Sejourne had argued that whenever European public money is used, it must support production in Europe and high-quality jobs.

He wrote in a guest commentary published across several European outlets that companies seeking public contracts, direct state aid, or other financial support should carry out a substantial share of their production on European soil.

The EU is pushing to strengthen competitiveness, a key topic expected at a special summit on February 12.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators are expected in Munich ahead of the Munich Security Conference, with organizers registering a combined total of about 120,000 participants so far, according to the city administration.

Officials said 21 events protesting a spectrum of issues have been registered so far across the city between Wednesday and Sunday. That marks a sharp increase compared with previous years, when protests drew more modest crowds.

The largest rally is expected on Saturday at the Theresienwiese, where the group The Munich Circle has registered 100,000 participants for a demonstration against Iran's leadership, though authorities said it remains unclear how realistic that figure is and what conditions may be imposed.

Additional protests are planned in the city center, including a march between Marienplatz and Stachus against the security conference, expected to draw around 4,000 people, and separate rallies of about 3,000 each at Odeonsplatz and Max-Joseph-Platz focusing on opposition to war, calls for peace, and demands for ""free vaccination choice.""

Other demonstrations are set to address Yemen and far-right extremism in Germany, with officials noting that more events could still be registered and participant estimates may rise.

The Munich Security Conference, widely seen as the world's leading forum on security policy, runs from February 13 to 15, with organizers saying 65 heads of state and government have confirmed attendance, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while Friedrich Merz is expected to attend for the first time as chancellor.

Germany's economic losses from years of overlapping crises have been mounting to nearly €1 trillion, according to estimates by the German Economic Institute (IW).

The employer-aligned research institute said the inflation-adjusted shortfall in gross domestic product since 2020 has totaled about €940 billion (about $1.1 trillion) over six years, reflecting the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the effects of Russia's war against Ukraine, and confrontational US policy.

IW calculated that this equals a value-added loss of more than €20,000 per employed person.

Around one-quarter of the total was attributed to last year, which was shaped by tariff conflicts with US President Donald Trump's administration.

Official data showed Germany narrowly avoided a third consecutive year without economic growth in 2025, with real output rising by 0.2%.

IW researcher Michael Groemling said the current decade has been marked by ""extraordinary shocks and massive economic adjustment burdens"" that now exceed the strain of earlier crises.

By comparison, IW estimated the economic cost of the 2001–2004 stagnation period at roughly €360 billion, while the 2008–2009 financial crisis produced value-added losses of around €525 billion.

Here are these and other headlines from Germany from Sunday, February 8, 2026:

Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil voiced clear support for German bids to host future Olympic Games and said money should not be a concern.

""We can afford Olympic Games,"" said Klingbeil in remarks published in the tabloid Bild am Sonntag. 

""I am convinced that big sporting events like these make our country stronger and are wonderful occasions that benefit our country and ultimately also offer Germany an opportunity to present itself in a positive light,"" he said, pointing to the impact of the 2006 World Cup as well as the 2024 Olympics hosted by neighboring France in 2024 as positive examples.

Klingbeil said the fact that four German municipalities had stepped forward in hopes of hosting, ""shows just how important the Olympic Games are considered to be in Germany."" 

Germany is looking to launch campaigns for the 2036, 2040 or 2044 games; with Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and the Rhine-Ruhr region all putting their hats in the ring to compete for the honor.

With a decision set for September, Klingbeil said candidates could count on support from the federal government. 

""Of course the whole country will profit. Regardless of where the games will be — It will set the whole country in motion,"" Klingbeil said.
 
The summer games have taken place in Germany twice before. The Nazi regime hosted the 1936 Olympics in Berlin while West Germany hosted the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Meanwhile, the 1936 Winter Olympics was also held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on Sunday confirmed that seven individuals working for the party had been denied entry passes for the German Bundestag. 

The passes were reportedly denied over security concerns raised during mandatory police background checks. 

Germany's domestic intelligence agency is consulted in cases where individuals have access to particularly sensitive government information.

News of the situation was first published in December by the weekly magazine Der Spiegel.

A party spokesman said five of the seven had been working for individual parliamentarians and two were employed by AfD's parliamentary group. 

Bundestag President Julia Klöckner has proposed canceling the salaries of individuals denied access to the building and its IT systems.

Klöckner said such individuals should not be the recipient of public funds.

The body has not yet voted on the proposal, which Bernd Baumann, parliamentary secretary of the AfD parliamentary group, has criticized.

Mercedes chief Ola Källenius is warning that Germany has been heading in the wrong economic direction for 10 to 15 years and could face a political shift to the far right if it fails to change course.

Speaking to German magazine Der Spiegel, Källenius said that without a turnaround, ""the right-wing populists will come, who have no solution for anything.""

He pointed to what he described as a weakening willingness to perform, saying it was like going into a World Cup believing training was sufficient while others train twice as much.

Källenius said Germany has some of the highest labor costs in the world and can no longer rely on productivity gains alone to offset them. He argued that while the country does not want ""Asian conditions,"" it must move on energy, taxes, and labor costs toward making entrepreneurship and investment worthwhile again, or capital will flow elsewhere.

He defended the right to part-time work in cases such as childcare or caregiving but said Germans overall need to work more, warning that the country's ""unique productivity machine"" could otherwise slow further.

A majority of people in Germany have been saying they are ready to support Ukraine more strongly in its defense against Russia, according to a new Insa survey for the German tabloid Bild.

The poll found that 52% of respondents said the West should increase help for Ukraine if Russia is not willing to agree to a ceasefire and peace talks.

It said 28% favored both military and financial support, while 12% wanted only financial aid and another 12% wanted only weapons. About 35% said Ukraine should not be supported further, and 13% gave no answer.

The survey also showed continued concern about a wider war, with 54% saying they worry Russia could attack a NATO country such as Poland or Lithuania after Ukraine, though that was 8 points lower than in September. About 34% said they had no such worries, and 12% did not respond.

A 75-year-old woman was attacked and fatally injured in her row house in Munich. Police arrested a 23-year-old suspect near the scene.

Officers detained the suspect shortly after the attack on Saturday night. Police said early findings indicate there was no prior relationship between him and the victim.

Witnesses reported hearing cries for help around 10:15 p.m. in the Bavarian capital's Untergiesing district and called emergency services. Police found the woman inside the home with fatal injuries.

Investigators said it remains unclear why the suspect was in the house, and they are also examining whether he will be placed in pretrial detention. Both the suspect and the victim are German citizens.

Anger over scam texts, chat messages and fraudulent calls has been easing, though it remains widespread, according to new figures from Germany's Federal Network Agency.

The regulator said it received 85,158 complaints about number misuse last year, down from a record 154,624 in 2024. The agency did not give a specific reason for the sharp decline.

Most attempts involved scam SMS messages, such as fake parcel notices claiming a customs fee is still owed, as well as contact via chat apps or direct calls.

Parcel-related fraud, which was especially common in 2024, has decreased, with criminals apparently shifting tactics. The agency shut down around 6,200 phone numbers for misuse, roughly the same as the year before, and imposed bans on more than 2,000 numbers from demanding illegitimate payments.

Federal Network Agency President Klaus Müller said ""we are effectively protecting consumers from number misuse,"" adding that authorities rely on tips from the public to track and combat these abuses.

Many people also complained about automated recorded messages, expensive waiting loops, router hacking and fake hotlines. The so-called ""grandchild scam,"" in which fraudsters pose as relatives urgently needing money or personal data, has been declining for several years, the agency said.

The drop in complaints may also reflect stronger warning systems from network operators. Vodafone launched a spam alert in May that displays ""Caution: possible fraud"" when a call comes from a number flagged as suspicious. Deutsche Telekom has introduced a similar system.

Germany and the European Union must fundamentally rethink their relationship with the United States, the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) advocates, as President Donald Trump's approach to international affairs raises doubts about the US's reliability as a partner and ally.

The SPD, the junior coalition member in Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative-led government, argues in a policy paper set to be adopted by the party executive board that Germany must carry out a realistic reassessment of the trans-Atlantic relationship.

Since the last major foreign policy positioning in December 2023, the SPD says the geopolitical situation has shifted, noting that ties with the US under President Joe Biden were still shaped by a deep shared values base. However, it said, Trump's leadership has cast that dependability into question.

SPD leader Lars Klingbeil, Germany's finance minister, said the US administration's noticeable turning away from alliances under Trump is now a reality, telling German news agency DPA that Europe should offer partnership but also build its own strength.

Klingbeil, who is also Germany's vice chancellor, said he wants a Europe that is politically and economically strong, an attractive center, and a reliable partner for other regions. He added that Germany was moving forward with France and other European countries.

He also promoted a ""Buy European"" principle, arguing that European products should be preferred in areas such as defense in order to strengthen independence and protect jobs in Germany and across Europe.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Thailand election: PM Anutin Charnvirakul claims victory","https://www.dw.com/en/thailand-holds-parliamentary-election-and-constitutional-referendum/a-75858485","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 16:47:18 GMT","

Early projections have Thailand's prime minister winning by a clear margin, with the opposition conceding defeat in Thailand's parliamentary elections.

Thailand's conservative Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on Sunday claimed victory in the country's parliamentary elections after television projections showed his party winning nearly 200 seats.

The vote was a three-way race between the reformist People's Party, the conservative Bhumjaithai Party of incumbent Prime Minister Charnvirakul and Pheu Thai, the party backed by the still-influential Shinawatra family.

""We are likely to take first place in the election,"" Charnvirakul told reporters at his party headquarters in Bangkok.

""The victory today belongs to all Thais, no matter whether you voted for us or not.""

""We acknowledge that we did not come first,"" People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut told reporters at his party headquarters in Bangkok. ""We stand by our principle of respecting the party that finishes first and its right to form the government.""

Going into the polls, analysts had been predicting a close race that was unlikely to yield an outright winner and were anticipating difficult coalition negotiations following the vote.

The vote was held with the country's economy and its vital tourist sector struggling, and amid heightened tensions with neighbor Cambodia that have resulted in deadly clashes along the border.

The country has churned through three prime ministers in under three years since the last general election in 2023.

Thailand, which has seen 13 successful military coups since becoming a constitutional monarchy in 1932, has a long history of political instability.

Ahead of the vote, surveys suggest that the People's Party (PP) would win the most votes for the 500-seat lower house.

Its candidate for prime minister is 38-year-old entrepreneur Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut.

The PP is the successor to the progressive and reformist Move Forward party, which won the last election in 2023 by a landslide.

But Move Forward's candidate for prime minister was blocked, and the party was later dissolved after the Constitutional Court found that its reformist agenda amounted to an attempt to overthrow the monarchy.

The PP softened that reformist messaging during the campaign for this election.

Even if the People's Party were to win the most votes on Sunday, analysts say it is unlikely to win enough of a majority to govern.

The other major players are Pheu Thai and conservative Bhumjaithai, led by incumbent Prime Minister Anutin, who is widely expected to retain his job in a coalition deal.

Pheu Thai, which has long dominated Thai politics, has seen its influence decline after Anutin's predecessor, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was removed from office last year.

Paetongtarn's father, Thaksin, and the political dynasty he leads have shaped Thai politics for more than two decades.

Thaksin, a telecoms tycoon and former prime minister, is currently serving a one-year prison sentence for corruption and abuse of power.

Thais also voted Sunday in a constitutional referendum on whether the current military-backed charter from 2017 should be replaced.

The ballot asked voters if they ""approve that there should be a new constitution,"" with options of ""Yes,"" ""No,"" or ""No opinion.""

The referendum is not an immediate vote on a new constitution. A majority ""Yes"" vote would give parliament a public mandate to start a multi‑stage drafting process that would require two more referendums before a new charter could be adopted.

Sir William Lewis has stepped down as publisher of The Washington Post after the newspaper laid off a third of its workforce.

Sir William, a former editor of The Telegraph, had become the target of criticism over the cuts.

In a message to staff, he defended the “difficult decisions” he took to guarantee the newspaper's future.

In addition to cutting a third of The Post's workforce, its leadership announced on Wednesday that the books section would be abolished, its international footprint reduced and its sports coverage ended “in its current form”.

Sir William told staff on Saturday it was “the right time for me to step aside” and thanked Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and The Post's billionaire owner, who hired him in 2023 to reverse declining readership.

“During my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customers each day,” he said.

Sir William was editor of The Telegraph when it broke the story of the MPs' expenses scandal in 2009.

He joined Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation the following year, served as publisher of The Wall Street Journal from 2014 to 2020, and was hired by Mr Bezos in Nov 2023.

At the time, the Amazon founder praised Sir William's “love of journalism and passion for driving financial success” and said he would “build the right future for The Post”.

Jeff D'Onofrio, the newspaper's chief financial officer and the former head of the blogging platform Tumblr, has replaced Sir William with immediate effect.

Mr D'Onofrio takes the reins at The Post at a time which staff have painted as one of the biggest crises in the 149-year-old newspaper's history.

Mr Bezos, commenting for the first time since the cuts were announced on Wednesday, did not mention Sir William in his statement.

However, he said Mr D'Onofrio, alongside Matt Murray, the executive editor, and Adam O'Neal, the opinion editor, would lead The Post “into an exciting and thriving next chapter”.

The newspaper “has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity”, he added. 

“Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success.”

Mr D'Onofrio said in a letter to Post staff on Saturday that he looked forward to leading the paper “into a sustainable, successful future with the strength of our journalism as our north star”.

Decisions would be driven by customer data, “sharpening our edge in delivering what is most valuable to our audiences”, he added.

The Post lost a wave of subscribers in late 2024 after announcing it would not endorse a candidate during the US presidential election, despite its critical coverage of Donald Trump's first term.

            Jeffrey Epstein had a message he wanted to get to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            It was June 2018 – about a year after Russia's ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin had suddenly died. Churkin had been someone Epstein met with regularly in New York, according to new documents released by the Department of Justice, and Epstein had even offered to help Churkin's son, Maxim, get a job at a wealth management firm in New York.
    


            Now Epstein was looking to talk with a different Russian official: Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. On June 24, 2018, Epstein emailed Norwegian politician Thorbjørn Jagland, then the secretary general of the Council of Europe, “I think you might suggest to putin, that lavrov, can get insight on talking to me. vitaly churkin used (to) but he died. ?!”
    


            Jagland answered that he would meet with Lavrov's assistant the following Monday and suggest it.
    


            Epstein replied: “churkin was great. he understood trump after [our] conversations. it is not complex. he must be seen to get something its that simple.”
    


            While Epstein's interest in scouting models from Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe had previously come to light, the latest release of documents related to the disgraced financier offers new insight into his attempts to draw closer to high-ranking Russian officials, including Putin, who Epstein tried to meet or speak with multiple times.
    


            The new tranche of documents showing more of Epstein's communications with international politicians, including Russian officials, has led to more speculation about the billionaire's motives. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in a cabinet meeting this week that his country will be launching an investigation into Epstein's possible ties with Russian intelligence.
    


            “More and more leads, more and more information, and more and more commentary in the global press all relate to the suspicion that this unprecedented pedophilia scandal was co-organized by Russian intelligence services,” Tusk said.
    


            “I don't need to tell you how serious the increasingly likely possibility that Russian intelligence services co-organized this operation is for the security of the Polish state,” Tusk added. “This can only mean that they also possess compromising materials against many leaders still active today.”
    


            The Kremlin dismissed suggestions that Epstein was a spy for Russia.
    


            “The theory that Epstein was controlled by Russian intelligence services can be taken in any way, but not seriously,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. Peskov added that reporters should “not waste time” looking into allegations Epstein had links to Russian intelligence.
    


            Analysts cautioned to CNN that the documents suggest little more than Epstein trying to rub shoulders with influential figures and position himself as a sort of geopolitical power player.
    


            The documents do not indicate whether Epstein ever succeeded in connecting with the Russian leader.
    


            On May 9, 2013, according to the documents, Epstein wrote to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak that Jagland “is going to see putin in sochi ” on May 20 and that Jagland asked if Epstein would make himself available to meet with the Russian president “to explain how russia can structure deals in order to encourage western investment.”
    


            “I never met him, wanted you to know,” Epstein added in his email to Barak.
    


            A few days later, Jagland told Epstein on May 14, 2013, that he planned to pass a message to Putin on Epstein's behalf that Epstein could be useful. “I have a friend that can help you to take the necessary measures (and then present you) and ask [whether] it is interesting for him to meet with you,” Jagland wrote in an email to Epstein.
    


            Epstein replied: “He is in a unique position to do something grand, like sputnik did for the space race, You can tell him that you and I are close , and that i advise Gates . this is confidential, . I would be happy to meet him , but for a minimum of two to three hours, not shorter.”
    


            Through a spokesperson, billionaire Bill Gates has publicly described meeting with Epstein as a “serious error in judgment” but denied any improper conduct.
    


            But in another email to Barak on May 21, 2013, Epstein claimed without providing evidence that he denied a request from Putin to meet during a Russian economic conference in St. Peterburg. Epstein said that if Putin wanted to meet with him, he would “need to set aside real time and privacy.” (It's unclear if Putin indeed ever requested to meet with Epstein.)
    


            CNN has reached out to the Kremlin for comment on Epstein's correspondence with Barak.
    


            More than a year later, in July 2014, an email to Epstein suggests that he had an upcoming scheduled meeting with Putin and had invited the LinkedIn founder to join. Joi Ito, then the director of the MIT Media Lab, wrote to Epstein, “I wasn't able to convince Reid to change his schedule to go to meet Putin with you. ;-)”
    


            Ito previously issued an apology for his association with Epstein and for accepting funding for the MIT Media Lab.
    


            Some of Epstein's communications with prominent Russians came at a sensitive time in US-Russia relations – after the US intelligence community accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 presidential election, which Donald Trump won.
    


            In June 2018, Jagland emailed Epstein that he hoped to stay at his residence in Paris and that he would be coming from Moscow, where he planned to meet with Putin, Lavrov and Dmitry Medvedev, then the prime minister of Russia.
    


            “i m just sorry im not with you to meet the Russians,” Epstein replied.
    


            On Thursday, Norway's investigative unit Økokrim announced   it had opened an investigation into Jagland based on information in the Epstein documents.



            In a statement, Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet said his client would cooperate with the investigation and provide “key findings and the relevant documentation” to the agency. “Based on what we have uncovered so far, we remain confident about the outcome,” Brosveet said.
    


            Jagland has denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.
    


            The documents suggest that Epstein had a close relationship with at least one Russian who had ties to the FSB – Russia's main security service and successor to the KGB. Epstein referred to Sergey Belyakov, who Russian state news agency TASS said graduated from the FSB Academy in Moscow in 1999, as “my very good friend” in a 2015 email to billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel.
    


            The documents show Epstein had offered to introduce him to Belyakov, who was running the St. Petersburg Economic Forum Foundation at the time, responsible for organizing Russia's largest economic conference.
    


            After attending the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) in 2015, Barak, the former Israeli prime minister, reported back to Epstein that he'd met with several Russian officials, including Lavrov; the head of Russia's central bank, Elvira Nabiullina; and several other heads of Russian banks.
    


            “Thx for (setting) the whole thing together,” Barak wrote in an email to Epstein.



            Barak's office told CNN in a statement, the former Israeli prime minister's visits to SPIEF “were always under invitation” of Putin's office. The statement said Epstein was interested in Russian affairs and in meeting Putin but Barak “never raised” Epstein's name with the Kremlin but “occasionally discussed” world affairs with him and “mentioned some people he met.”
    


            In a 2016 exchange between Belyakov and Epstein, Belyakov tells Epstein that he has started a new position with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) – the country's sovereign wealth fund – and that he was looking to attract investment for Russian projects.
    


            “I will do anything [that] is helpful to you,” Epstein wrote to Belyakov in another email later that same week.
    


            Epstein had also turned to Belyakov for help at least once. In a 2015 correspondence, Epstein wrote to Belyakov that a Russian “girl” from Moscow was attempting to blackmail a “group of powerful” businessmen in New York and “it is bad for business for everyone involved.” Epstein then told Belyakov when the woman arrived in New York and what hotel she was staying at, asking, “Suggestions?”.
    


            CNN is attempting to contact Belyakov and has reached out to RDIF for comment.
    


            Epstein also claimed to offer advice for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. In a 2018 email with Jide Zeitlin, the former CEO of Coach and a private investor, Zeitlin thanks Epstein for his “thoughts re Deripaska,” who had been sanctioned by the US just a month earlier. Epstein then forwarded the correspondence to Steve Bannon, formerly Trump's chief strategist.
    


            “Just keeping you in the loop,” Epstein wrote to Bannon.
    


            An email from November 2010 included in the files references an effort by someone claiming to be an assistant for Epstein attempting to set up a meeting between Epstein and someone referred to as “Oleg.”
    


            “I'm writing to see what the possibilities are of =effrey and Oleg to meet in Moscow next week Tuesday or Wednesday? Or =ossibly Oleg has plans to be in Paris next week?” The person wrote. The names of both the sender and recipient are redacted in the released files.
    


            It's unclear whether Epstein and Deripaska were ever in contact or ever met. Deripaska's spokesperson told Bloomberg he didn't personally know Epstein; CNN has reached out for a comment.
    


            Another Russian in Epstein's orbit was Masha Drokova Bucher, a 37-year-old venture capitalist who was a publicist for Epstein in 2017, helping him in the wake of his 2008 conviction on solicitation of prostitution. Bucher was known in Russia as a member of Nashi, a pro-Putin youth group, where she even got her own TV show. She was featured in a 2012 documentary about the movement called Putin's Kiss, a reference to a famous moment when she kissed Putin on the cheek.
    


            Bucher has since said she left the movement and gave up her Russian citizenship in 2022 after the invasion of Ukraine.
    


            She and Epstein appeared to have a close relationship. In 2017, she    asked Epstein in an email if he'd heard anything about potential sanctions on companies with research and development in Russia because it could affect “some good friends.” He then told her he'd introduce her to Thiel.
    


            Bucher later sent Epstein videos of her singing and told him she was “recharged” from not “doing any substances for a while.” She credited Epstein for helping her establish her Day One Ventures fund in 2018.
    


            “Been thinking about all good things you taught me,” she said in a 2019 text message to Epstein. “I would never create my fund without the ideas and knowledge you shared with me and I do much love my work. thank you for being such a great friend Jeffrey!”
    


            In 2022, The Washington Post reported that Bucher's pitches to investors boasted of her connections to Russian oligarchs, but she has dismissed those allegations and denied having any Russian funding.
    


            Bucher has not responded to CNN's request for comment on her connections to Epstein. Thiel did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
    


            While it's not clear exactly how often Epstein traveled to Russia, flight logs analyzed by CNN and published by the Justice Department confirm he did visit the country. Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell traveled to Russia between November 22 and 24 of 2002, flying from Copenhagen to Moscow's Vnukovo Airport on Epstein's personal aircraft, according to flight logs and a 2018 email published by the Justice Department. The pair then flew to St. Petersburg, landing at Pulkovo Airport the same day. Then, on November 24, the flight log shows that both departed on the same aircraft for Ireland.
    


            A photo uploaded on Esther Dyson's Flickr account in 2005 shows Epstein in Sarov, Russia, standing in front of Andrei Sakharov's cottage. Sakharov worked on the Soviet hydrogen bomb and later became known as a dissident. The photo geolocated by CNN is timestamped April 28, 1998, though CNN cannot independently verify the date it was captured.
    


            Dyson, who was involved in startups in Eastern Europe and Russia at the time, confirmed the authenticity of the photo. Sarov is a Russian town housing a closed center for nuclear research – and Epstein was known to have had a keen interest in science and technology.
    


            Epstein later reapplied for a Russian visa in 2018, according to emails released by the Justice Department. Another email indicates that his team asked about transferring his valid Russian visa to a new passport in March 2019, just months before his arrest on federal charges related to sex trafficking of minors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A teen allegedly killed 4 people at his Georgia high school. Now his father is going on trial for murder","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/us/colin-gray-trial-apalachee-high-school-shooting","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 10:00:46 GMT","


            The father of the teenager who allegedly killed four people at his Georgia high school in 2024 is set to stand trial on murder and manslaughter charges in the latest case testing the limits of who is responsible for a school shooting.
    


            Colin Gray, the father of Colt Gray, has pleaded not guilty to nearly 30 charges, including two counts each of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter.
    


            The case stems from the September 2024 shooting at Apalachee High School, when then-14-year-old Colt Gray allegedly used an AR15-style rifle to kill two students and two teachers and injure nine others. He ultimately surrendered to police and has admitted to the shooting, according to authorities.
    


            More than a year earlier, law enforcement had questioned the teen and father about “online threats to commit a school shooting,” though no charges were filed, authorities said. Even so, Colin Gray bought a firearm for his son as a Christmas present in December 2023 – the same firearm he used in the mass shooting, according to two law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation.
    


            The indictment alleges Gray allowed his teenage son access to a firearm and ammunition after receiving “sufficient warning” that his son would harm and endanger others, actions that constitute “criminal negligence” by “consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk.”
    


            A defense attorney did not respond to a request for comment.
    


            The trial is part of a broader push to hold more people accountable for a school shooting, a group that has grown to include parents and responding law enforcement officers. Testimony is also likely to include emotional stories from those who were in the school that day.
    


A girl dad, a patient teacher and a student brimming with dreams. These are the victims of the Apalachee High School shooting



            This case bears similarities to the trials of James and Jennifer Crumbley, whose then-15-year-old son killed four students in 2021 at his high school in Oxford, Michigan. Prosecutors accused the parents of allowing their son access to the firearm and ignoring warnings about his declining mental health and risk to others.
    


            The Crumbleys were each convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. That was believed to be just the first and second time that a parent was held criminally responsible for a mass school shooting committed by their child.
    


            Andrew Fleischman, a criminal defense attorney in Atlanta, said the jury's sympathy for the victims and desire to blame someone could make it a difficult case for Colin Gray's defense.
    


            “The state is going to probably argue that, but for this father's negligence, these kids would all be alive,” he said. “That's very hard to get past.”
    


            Still, the case could depend on what specific steps the father took to address the risks: Did he safely secure the firearm and ammunition? Did he take steps to address his son's mental health in therapy or in school?
    


            “There are lots of ways that you can show that you are not being fully criminally negligent,” Fleischman said.
    


            Colin Gray has remained behind bars since his arrest a day after the shooting. If convicted, he faces 10 to 30 years in prison on each murder charge and 1 to 10 years on each manslaughter charge.
    


            The trial is set to begin with jury selection Monday and is expected to last about three weeks.
    


            Colt Gray, now 16, has been indicted on 55 felony counts, including four counts of malice murder, and will be tried as an adult, according to court documents. He has pleaded not guilty, although a defense attorney last year raised the possibility he may change his plea. A trial date has not been set.
    


            The mass shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta, began the morning of September 4, 2024.
    


            Colt Gray had enrolled at the school on August 14 and had already missed nine days of classes leading up to the shooting, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.
    


            Colt left Algebra class at 9:45 a.m., and gunshots were soon heard in a nearby classroom, a student told CNN at the time. The gun had been hidden in his backpack, authorities said.
    


            The first report of an active shooter came in around 10:20 a.m., authorities said.
    


            “I heard gunshots outside my classroom and people screaming, people begging not to get shot,” said then-14-year-old student Macey Right. “And then people sitting beside me (were) just shaking and crying.”
    


            A resource officer confronted the shooter, who immediately surrendered and was taken into custody, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith said. The suspect told investigators, “I did it,” while being questioned, according to Smith.
    


            Investigators with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation allege the firearm used in the attack had been purchased by his father despite an earlier concern from law enforcement about the teen.
    


‘A rite of passage': Why some parents buy guns for their children



            Colt Gray had been questioned by law enforcement in May 2023 regarding “several anonymous tips about online threats to commit a school shooting at an unidentified location and time,” according to a joint statement from FBI Atlanta and the Jackson County Sheriff's Office. The online threats included photographs of guns, according to the statement.
    


            The teen and his father were interviewed by the county sheriff's office, and Colt Gray denied making the threats online, the statement said. Jackson County alerted local schools to continue monitoring the issue, but law enforcement did not have probable cause to arrest or take other actions, according to the statement.
    


            In video of the police interview, Colin Gray told officers that he had guns in the house and his son had access to them.
    


            “We do a lot of shooting. We do a lot of deer hunting. He shot his first deer this year,” he said. “I'm trying to teach him about firearms and safety and how to do it all and get him interested in the outdoors.”

            Russia's Investigative Committee has accused Ukrainian intelligence of being behind the assassination attempt on a Russian general in Moscow on Friday – and says the alleged perpetrator was arrested in Dubai after fleeing Moscow.
    


            One other suspect – described as an accomplice – was also detained, the Committee said. Another alleged accomplice escaped to Ukraine.
    


            The Investigative Committee named the alleged assailant as a man in his mid-60s born in the Ternopil region of Ukraine. He had arrived in Russia in December “on the instructions of the Kyiv special services,” it said.
    


            Early on Friday morning an attacker fired several shots at Lt. Gen. Vladimir Alekseyev in a residential building on Volokolamskoye Highway in Moscow and fled the scene.
    


            Alekseyev had regained consciousness after surgery, TASS reported Saturday. “Doctors cautiously say that his life is not in danger,” it added, citing medical sources.
    


            The Investigative Committee said a Makarov pistol with a silencer was discovered at the scene.
    


            The Russian security service – the FSB – said Sunday that immediately after the shooting the suspect boarded a flight from Moscow to Dubai, where he was detained and returned to Russia.
    


            The Kremlin said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and thanked him for assistance on apprehending the suspect.
    


            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha told Reuters on Friday that Kyiv had nothing to do with the attack.
    


            Alekseyev, 64, is the first deputy head of Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate, the GRU.
    


            In 2023, Alekseyev was sent by the Russian military to negotiate with Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner private mercenary group, during the Wagner group's mutiny. At the time, he called Prigozhin's actions a coup as well as “a stab in the back of the country and the president.”
    


            He was one of several GRU officials sanctioned by the United States in 2016 for wide-ranging malicious cyber activity directed at undermining US democratic processes.
    


            He was also sanctioned by the European Union in January 2019 following a nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England, which the British government said was carried out by GRU agents to poison a former Russian spy. The EU sanctions describe Alekseyev as “responsible for the possession, transport and use in Salisbury… of the toxic nerve agent ‘Novichok' by officers from the GRU,” along with sanctioned Russian military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov.
    


            The attack on Alekseyev is the latest aimed at senior figures in the Russian military and security services.
    


            In December, a Russian general was killed in a car bombing in Moscow, with officials also pointing the finger at Ukraine.
    


            Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, who ran the armed forces operational training department, died after a device installed under the chassis of a car exploded, Russia's Investigative Committee said.
    


            The 56-year-old had previously “carried out the tasks of organizing and conducting an operation in Syria,” when Russian forces were backing the Assad regime, TASS said.
    


            Other senior Russian officers killed in Moscow have included Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy head of the main operational department of the General Staff, who was the victim of a car bomb attack near Moscow in April last year.

NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI pored over Jeffrey Epstein's bank records and emails. It searched his homes. It spent years interviewing his victims and examining his connections to some of the world's most influential people.

But while investigators collected ample proof that Epstein sexually abused underage girls, they found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men, an Associated Press review of internal Justice Department records shows.

Videos and photos seized from Epstein's homes in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands didn't depict victims being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.

An examination of Epstein's financial records, including payments he made to entities linked to influential figures in academia, finance and global diplomacy, found no connection to criminal activity, said another internal memo in 2019.

While one Epstein victim made highly public claims that he “lent her” to his rich friends, agents couldn't confirm that and found no other victims telling a similar story, the records said.

Summarizing the investigation in an email last July, agents said “four or five” Epstein accusers claimed other men or women had sexually abused them. But, the agents said, there “was not enough evidence to federally charge these individuals, so the cases were referred to local law enforcement.”




The AP and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential, that the Justice Department released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act and it is possible those records contain evidence overlooked by investigators.

But the documents, which include police reports, FBI interview notes and prosecutor emails, provide the clearest picture to date of the investigation — and why U.S. authorities ultimately decided to close it without additional charges.

The Epstein investigation began in 2005, when the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported she had been molested at the millionaire's home in Palm Beach, Florida.

Police would identify at least 35 girls with similar stories: Epstein was paying high school age students $200 or $300 to give him sexualized massages.

After the FBI joined the probe, federal prosecutors drafted indictments to charge Epstein and some personal assistants who had arranged the girls' visits and payments. But instead, then-Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta struck a deal letting Epstein plead guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. Sentenced to 18 months in jail, Epstein was free by mid-2009.

In 2018, a series of Miami Herald stories about the plea deal prompted New York federal prosecutors to take a fresh look at the accusations.

Epstein was arrested in July 2019. One month later, he killed himself in his jail cell.

A year later, prosecutors charged Epstein's longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, saying she'd recruited several of his victims and sometimes joined the sexual abuse. Convicted in 2021, Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term.

Prosecution memos, case summaries and other documents made public in the department's latest release of Epstein-related records show that FBI agents and federal prosecutors diligently pursued potential coconspirators. Even seemingly outlandish and incomprehensible claims, called in to tip lines, were examined.

Some allegations couldn't be verified, investigators wrote.

In 2011 and again in 2019, investigators interviewed Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who in lawsuits and news interviews had accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with numerous men, including Britain's former Prince Andrew.

Investigators said they confirmed that Giuffre had been sexually abused by Epstein. But other parts of her story were problematic.

Two other Epstein victims who Giuffre had claimed were also “lent out” to powerful men told investigators they had no such experience, prosecutors wrote in a 2019 internal memo.

“No other victim has described being expressly directed by either Maxwell or Epstein to engage in sexual activity with other men,” the memo said.

Giuffre acknowledged writing a partly fictionalized memoir of her time with Epstein containing descriptions of things that didn't take place. She had also offered shifting accounts in interviews with investigators, they wrote, and had “engaged in a continuous stream of public interviews about her allegations, many of which have included sensationalized if not demonstrably inaccurate characterizations of her experiences.” Those inaccuracies included false accounts of her interactions with the FBI, they said.

Still, U.S. prosecutors attempted to arrange an interview with Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He refused to make himself available. Giuffre settled a lawsuit with Mountbatten-Windsor in which she had accused him of sexual misconduct.

In a memoir published after she killed herself last year, Giuffre wrote that prosecutors told her they didn't include her in the case against Maxwell because they didn't want her allegations to distract the jury. She insisted her accounts of being trafficked to elite men were true.

Investigators seized a multitude of videos and photos from Epstein's electronic devices and homes in New York, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They found CDs, hard copy photographs and at least one videotape containing nude images of females, some of whom seemed as if they might be minors. One device contained 15 to 20 images depicting commercial child sex abuse material — pictures investigators said Epstein obtained on the internet.

No videos or photos showed Epstein victims being sexually abused, none showed any males with any of the nude females, and none contained evidence implicating anyone other than Epstein and Maxwell, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey wrote in an email for FBI officials last year.

Had they existed, the government “would have pursued any leads they generated,” Comey wrote. “We did not, however, locate any such videos.”

Investigators who scoured Epstein's bank records found payments to more than 25 women who appeared to be models — but no evidence that he was engaged in prostituting women to other men, prosecutors wrote.

In 2019, prosecutors weighed the possibility of charging one of Epstein's longtime assistants but decided against it.

Prosecutors concluded that while the assistant was involved in helping Epstein pay girls for sex and may have been aware that some were underage, she herself was a victim of his sexual abuse and manipulation.

Investigators examined Epstein's relationship with the French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, who once was involved in an agency with Epstein in the U.S., and who was accused in a separate case of sexually assaulting women in Europe. Brunel killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on a rape charge in France.

Prosecutors also weighed whether to charge one of Epstein's girlfriends who had participated in sexual acts with some of his victims. Investigators interviewed the girlfriend, who was 18 to 20 years old at the time, “but it was determined there was not enough evidence,” according to a summary given to FBI Director Kash Patel last July.

Days before Epstein's July 2019 arrest, the FBI strategized about sending agents to serve grand jury subpoenas on people close to Epstein, including his pilots and longtime business client, retail mogul Les Wexner.

Wexner's lawyers told investigators that neither he nor his wife had knowledge of Epstein's sexual misconduct. Epstein had managed Wexner's finances, but the couple's lawyers said they cut him off in 2007 after learning he'd stolen from them.

“There is limited evidence regarding his involvement,” an FBI agent wrote of Wexner in an Aug. 16, 2019, email.

In a statement to the AP, a legal representative for Wexner said prosecutors had informed him that he was “neither a coconspirator nor target in any respect,” and that Wexner had cooperated with investigators.

Prosecutors also examined accounts from women who said they'd given massages at Epstein's home to guests who'd tried to make the encounters sexual. One woman accused private equity investor Leon Black of initiating sexual contact during a massage in 2011 or 2012, causing her to flee the room.

The Manhattan district attorney's office subsequently investigated, but no charges were filed.

Black's lawyer, Susan Estrich, said he had paid Epstein for estate planning and tax advice. She said in a statement that Black didn't engage in misconduct and had no awareness of Epstein's criminal activities. Lawsuits by two women who accused Black of sexual misconduct were dismissed or withdrawn. One is pending.

Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in February 2025 that Epstein's never-before-seen “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now.” A few months later, she claimed the FBI was reviewing “tens of thousands of videos” of Epstein “with children or child porn.”

But FBI agents wrote superiors saying the client list didn't exist.

On Dec. 30, 2024, about three weeks before President Joe Biden left office, then-FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate reached out through subordinates to ask “whether our investigation to date indicates the ‘client list,' often referred to in the media, does or does not exist,” according to an email summarizing his query.

A day later, an FBI official replied that the case agent had confirmed no client list existed.

On Feb. 19, 2025, two days before Bondi's Fox News appearance, an FBI supervisory special agent wrote: “While media coverage of the Jeffrey Epstein case references a 'client list,' investigators did not locate such a list during the course of the investigation.”

CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Lindsey Vonn ‘s defiant bid to win the Winter Olympic downhill  at the age of 41, on a rebuilt right knee and a badly injured left knee, ended Sunday in a frightening crash that saw her taken to safety by a rescue helicopter for the second time in nine days. 

Vonn lost control within moments of leaving the start house, clipping a gate with her right shoulder and pinwheeling down the slope before ending up awkwardly on her back, her skis crisscrossed below her and her screams ringing out soon after medical personnel arrived. She was treated for long, anguished minutes as a hush fell over the crowd waiting far below at the finish line.

She was strapped to a gurney and flown away, possibly ending the skier's storied career. The U.S. Ski Team did not disclose details of her injury but said Vonn “is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians.”

“She'll be OK, but it's going to be a bit of a process,” said Anouk Patty, chief of sport for U.S. Ski and Snowboard. “This sport's brutal and people need to remember when they're watching (that) these athletes are throwing themselves down a mountain and going really, really fast.”

Breezy Johnson, Vonn's teammate, became only the second American woman to win the Olympic downhill after Vonn did it 16 years ago. The 30-year-old Johnson held off Emma Aicher of Germany and Italy's Sofia Goggia on a bittersweet day for the team.






“I don't claim to know what she's going through, but I do know what it is to be here, to be fighting for the Olympics, and to have this course burn you and to watch those dreams die,” said Johnson, whose injury in Cortina in 2022 ruined her hopes of sking in the Beijing Olympics. “I can't imagine the pain that she's going through and it's not the physical pain — we can deal with physical pain — but the emotional pain is something else.”

Vonn had family in the stands, including her father, Alan Kildow, who stared down at the ground while his daughter was being treated after just 13 seconds on the course where she holds a record 12 World Cup titles. Others in the crowd, including rapper Snoop Dogg, watched quietly as the star skier was finally taken off the course. Fellow American star Mikaela Shiffrin posted a broken heart emoji on social media.

Vonn's crash was “tragic, but it's ski racing,” said Johan Eliasch, president of the International Ski and Snowboard Federation. 

“I can only say thank you for what she has done for our sport,” he said, “because this race has been the talk of the games and it's put our sport in the best possible light.”

All eyes had been on Vonn, the feel-good story heading into the Olympics. She returned to elite ski racing last season after nearly six years, a remarkable decision given her age but she also had a partial titanium knee replacement in her right knee, too. Many wondered how she would fare as she sought a gold medal to join the one she won in the downhill at the 2010 Vancouver Games.

The four-time overall World Cup champion stunned everyone by being a contender almost immediately. She came to the Olympics as the leader in the World Cup downhill standings and was a gold-medal favorite before her crash in Switzerland nine days ago, when she suffered her latest knee injury. In addition to a ruptured ACL, she also had a bone bruise and meniscus damage.

Still, no one counted her out even then. In truth, she has skied through injuries for three decades at the top of the sport. In 2006, ahead of the Turin Olympics, Vonn took a bad fall during downhill training and went to the hospital. She competed less than 48 hours later, racing in all four events she'd planned, with a top result of seventh in the super-G.

Cortina has had many treasured memories for Vonn beyond the record wins. She is called the queen of Cortina, and the Olympia delle Tofana is a course that had always suited Vonn. She tested out the knee twice in downill training runs over the past three days before the awful crash on Sunday in clear, sunny conditions. 

“This would be the best comeback I've done so far,” Vonn said before the race. “Definitely the most dramatic.”

The drama was of a different sort this time. Not since perhaps Hermann Maier's cartwheeling crash at the 1998 Nagano Games had there been such a high-profile and spectacular fall in Alpine skiing at the Olympics.

“Dear Lindsey, we're all thinking of you. You are an incredible inspiration, and will always be an Olympic champion,” International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry said.

News of the crash spread quickly, including to the fan zone down the mountain in Cortina.

“It's such a huge loss and bummer,” American Megan Gunyou said. “I feel like hearing her story and just like the redemption of her first fall and like fighting to come back to the Olympics this year, I mean, I feel so sad for her.”

Dan Wilton of Vancouver, Canada, watched the race from the stands. 

“It was frightening,” he said. “Really, your heart goes out for such a champion who is coming to the end of her career. Everyone wanted a successful finish.”

The governing coalition of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is almost certain to win a single-party majority in a key parliamentary election Sunday, NHK public television and other major networks say, citing their exit polls.

TOKYO (AP) — The governing party of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi secured a more than two-thirds majority in a key parliamentary election on Sunday, Japanese media reported, citing preliminary results. 

Takaichi, in a televised interview with public television network NHK, said that after the sweeping victory she is now ready to pursue her policies. 

NHK, citing results of vote counts, said Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, alone secured 316 seats by early Monday, comfortably surpassing a 261-seat absolute majority in the 465-member lower house, the more powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament. That marks a record since the party's foundation in 1955 and surpasses the previous record of 300 seats won in 1986 by late Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. 

A smiling Takaichi placed a big red ribbon above each winner's name on a signboard at the LDP's headquarters, as accompanying party executives applauded.

Despite the lack of a majority in the other chamber, the upper house, the huge jump from the preelection share in the superior lower house would allow Takaichi to make progress on a right-wing agenda that aims to boost Japan's economy and military capabilities as tensions grow with China and she tries to nurture ties with the United States.

Takaichi said that she would firmly push forward her policy goals while trying to gain support from the opposition. 




“I will be flexible,” she said.

Takaichi is hugely popular, but the governing LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the last seven decades, has struggled with funding and religious scandals in recent years. She called Sunday's early election only after three months in office, hoping to turn that around while her popularity is high.

The ultraconservative Takaichi, who took office as Japan's first female leader in October, pledged to “work, work, work,” and her style, which is seen as both playful and tough, has resonated with younger fans who say they weren't previously interested in politics.

The opposition, despite the formation of a new centrist alliance and a rising far-right, was too splintered to be a real challenger. The new opposition alliance of LDP's former coalition partner, Buddhist-backed dovish Komeito, and the liberal-leaning Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, is projected to sink to half of their combined preelection share of 167 seats.

Takaichi was betting with this election that her LDP party, together with its new partner, the Japan Innovation Party, would secure a majority. 

Akihito Iwatake, a 53-year-old office worker, said he welcomed the big win by the LDP because he felt the party went too liberal in the past few years. “With Takaichi shifting things more toward the conservative side, I think that brought this positive result,” he said. 

The prime minister wants to push forward a significant shift to the right in Japan's security, immigration and other policies. The LDP's right-wing partner, JIP leader Hirofumi Yoshimura, has said his party will serve as an “accelerator” for this push.

Japan has recently seen far-right populists gain ground, such as the anti-globalist and surging nationalist party Sanseito. Exit polls projected a big gain for Sanseito.

Takaichi has pledged to revise security and defense policies by December to bolster Japan's offensive military capabilities, lifting a ban on weapons exports and moving further away from the country's postwar pacifist principles. 

She has been pushing for tougher policies on foreigners, anti-espionage and other measures that resonate with a far-right audience, but ones that experts say could undermine civil rights.

Takaichi also wants to increase defense spending in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's pressure for Japan to loosen its purse strings.

She now has time to work on these policies, without an election until 2028.

Though Takaichi said that she's seeking to win support for policies seen as divisive in Japan, she largely avoided discussing ways to fund soaring military spending, how to fix diplomatic tension with China and other issues.

In her campaign speeches, Takaichi enthusiastically talked about the need for proactive government spending to fund “crisis management investment and growth,” such as measures to strengthen economic security, technology and other industries. Takaichi also seeks to push tougher measures on immigration, including stricter requirements for foreign property owners and a cap on foreign residents. 

Sunday's election “underscores a problematic trend in Japanese politics in which political survival takes priority over substantive policy outcomes,” said Masato Kamikubo, a Ritsumeikan University politics professor. “Whenever the government attempts necessary but unpopular reforms ... the next election looms.”

Sunday's vote coincided with fresh snowfall across the country, including in Tokyo. Record snowfall in northern Japan over the past few weeks blocked roads and was blamed for dozens of deaths nationwide.

PARIS (AP) — France's former Culture Minister Jack Lang has resigned as head of a Paris cultural center over alleged past financial links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that prompted a tax investigation.

He is the highest-profile figure in France impacted by the release of Epstein files on Jan. 30 by the U.S. Department of Justice. He is known for his role as a culture minister under Socialist President François Mitterrand in the 1980s and 1990s.

Lang, 86, was summoned to appear at the French Foreign Ministry, which oversees the Arab World Institute, on Sunday, but he submitted his resignation.

He “is very sad and deeply hurt to be leaving a position he loves,” his lawyer Laurent Merlet said Sunday on RTL radio. “He put the interests of the Arab World Institute first,” Merlet said, adding that his client denied the allegations and called them inaccurate.

The Foreign Ministry confirmed his resignation Saturday evening. 

The financial prosecutors' office said it had opened an investigation into Lang and his daughter, Caroline, over alleged “aggravated tax fraud laundering.” 

French investigative news website Mediapart reported last week on alleged financial and business ties between the Lang family and Jeffrey Epstein through an offshore company based in the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea.

Jack Lang's name was mentioned more than 600 times in the Epstein files, showing intermittent correspondence between 2012 and 2019. His daughter was also in the released files.

Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has “taken note” of Lang's resignation and began the process to look for his successor, the foreign ministry said.

Lang headed the Arab World Institute since 2013.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — It's almost time to crown an NFL champion.

After two weeks of hype and anticipation, the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will face off in Super Bowl 60 at Levi's Stadium on Sunday.

Will Drake Maye and the Patriots (17-3) capture their seventh Lombardi Trophy? Or will Sam Darnold and the Seahawks (16-3) earn their second?

The matchup features two stingy defenses, two balanced offenses and two quarterbacks who've taken vastly different routes to get here.

Led by defensive tackle Leonard Williams, linebacker Ernest Jones, cornerback Devon Witherspoon and rookie safety Nick Emmanwori, the Seahawks allowed the fewest points in the NFL and have standout players at every level.

The Patriots advanced to a record 12th Super Bowl because their defense has been dominant in the playoffs, allowing only 8.7 points per game.

Darnold has All-Pro wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, veteran wideout Cooper Kupp and running back Kenneth Walker around him.

Running backs TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson and wide receiver Stefon Diggs give Maye plenty of support on New England's offense.

The 23-year old Maye will be the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl. He's aiming to become the youngest to win it.

The Patriots won six rings with coach Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. AP NFL Coach of the Year Mike Vrabel, who was a linebacker on three of those teams, is seeking his first as a head coach.




Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald is only in his second season and first with Darnold, who's on his fifth team in eight years in the NFL. The 2018 No. 3 overall pick has finally found a home after bouncing around the league.

This is a rematch of the Super Bowl 11 years ago. Brady and the Patriots won that one, 28-24, after Russell Wilson's pass from the 1-yard line in the final minute was intercepted by Malcolm Butler.

According to BetMGM Sportsbook, the Patriots are 4 1/2-point underdogs against Seattle.

MILAN (AP) — Russian figure skater Petr Gumennik has been forced to change his short program music two days before the men's program at the Milan Cortina Olympics after joining a growing list of figure skaters dealing with copyright issues.

Gumennik, who is participating as a neutral athlete at the Winter Games, had been working all season to music from “Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,” a psychological thriller film. But the 23-year-old Russian national champion learned in the last few days that he did not have proper permission to perform to the music, leaving him in limbo as the Winter Games began.

Given such a tight timeframe, Gumennik also was unable to get clearance for his music from last season, which came from the space opera film “Dune.” So, he pivoted to “Waltz 1805” by Edgar Hakobyan, for which Gumennik was able to get permission.

The men's competition begins Tuesday night with the short program.

This past week, Spanish skater Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate was forced to work feverishly to obtain approval for music to his short program, set to a medley from the animated comedy film “Minions.” Sabate had been performing the fan-favorite program all season, only to learn that Universal Studios was poised to reject the use of it during the Winter Games.

Sabate began to work on a backup program while getting approval for two cuts of music. He obtained the third by reaching out to the artist, a fellow Spaniard. And he was granted use of the final piece, “Freedom” by Pharrell Williams, on Friday.




“It hasn't been an easy process,” Sabate said, “but the support of everyone who has followed my case has been key to keeping me motivated and optimistic these past few days.”

Loena Hendrickx of Belgium also was concerned about copyright issues after having performed to “Ashes” by Celine Dion from the film “Deadpool 2.” She ended up switching to “I Surrender,” another song by Dion that was easy to get permission to use.

The copyright issue has become a big problem in figure skating in recent years. For decades, athletes could only use music without words, most of which was considered public domain. But when the International Skating Union relaxed its rules in 2014, and skaters began to use more modern music, some artists began to object to their work being used without permission.

The ISU has tried to develop systems to avoid copyright issues, but they continue to pop up with alarming frequency.

“It is a very, very, very serious problem,” ISU President Jae Youl Kim said. “We don't want athletes to be worried about the music.”

What may have worked against Gumennik is that Russian skaters have been barred from international competition since their nation's invasion of Ukraine, so few people have been able to see him skate — and hear his music — outside of his own country.

Last May, the ISU announced that Gumennik had been vetted for any ties to the Kremlin and cleared to compete as a neutral athlete should he qualify for the Winter Games. Gumennik wound up winning Skate to Milan, an event held in late September as a sort of last-chance qualifier, earning him a spot in his first Olympics.

Adeliia Petrosian, another Russian competing as a neutral athlete, will participate in the women's event in Milan.

Gumennik's free skate music is from “Onegin,” a Russian historical romance film, for which he has approval. Petrosian has not reported any issues with her music, a Michael Jackson medley for her short program and classical music for her free skate.

A chaotic scene unfolded in Milan Saturday as police deployed water cannons and tear gas against demonstrators just steps away from an Olympic ice hockey rink.

A group known as the Unsustainable Olympics Committee organized demonstrations highlighting concerns related to the environmental, economic and social impact of the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. 

Demonstrators also protested the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Italy, The Associated Press reported.

The clash with police occurred near Milan's Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, a newly built venue that has faced scrutiny over construction delays and rink-size concerns.

(Reuters/Claudia Greco )

Global Guardian, an international security firm, issued a travel alert Saturday, according to AP. 

""Anticipate heightened security and associated disruptions in the affected area over the next several hours,"" the security alert said. ""Plot route bypasses. Avoid all protests."" 

The alert also said at least five individuals were taken into custody.

At a larger, peaceful demonstration, which police said numbered about 10,000, people carried cardboard cutouts representing trees felled to build the new bobsled run in Cortina. A group of dancers performed to the beat of drums. Music blasted from a truck leading the march, including a profanity-laced anti-ICE anthem.

""Let's take back the cities and free the mountains,"" a banner by the Unsustainable Olympic Committee said. Another group called the Association of Proletariat Excursionists organized the cutout trees.

Folks in the U.S. are expected to spend about $129 per person on Super Bowl 60, which is less than last year.

Brandi Carlile will be among the artists who will be performing ahead of Super Bowl LX's kickoff on Sunday between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots.

Carlile is one of the performers who have been outspoken against President Donald Trump and his administration's policies going back to his first term in office. She will join Bad Bunny and Green Day as anti-Trump critics performing at Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara, California.

The singer will perform a rendition of ""America the Beautiful"" before the game kicks off. She suggested in an interview with Variety on Friday she's going into the performance with her ""own moral code"" in mind, adding that the performance was important to her as a member of the LGBT community.

""And I have my own moral code, my own moral imperative, that I have to answer to at the end of the day, as a wife and mother, and I believe in my ability and responsibility to do this, and that's why I'm here,"" she told the magazine. ""And the throughline to being queer and being a representative of a marginalized community and being put on the largest stage in America to acknowledge the fraught and tender hope that this country is based on, it's something you don't say no to. You do it.""

Super Bowl LX performers Bad Bunny and Green Day have been critical of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and their operations against illegal immigrants in the U.S.

Variety said in its interview with Carlile that the song ""America the Beautiful"" may be heard in a different way in ""calmer times."" ""But even without hearing every verse that was written, there may be something about it that, in a time of trouble and division, will be moving for people who are really tuned into it. You're feeling that.""

Carlile responded, ""Yeah. And I think if we're gonna save this country as a people, we have to be reminded on some level that deep down we love it.""

Despite the criticism she may hear from her own fans, Carlile said she wasn't going to get into arguments about why she was singing the patriotic song.

""… I'm not gonna waste my time in the pit fights,"" Carlile said. ""My activism isn't gonna be in the comments section. And, you know, I may not be everyone's kind of activist, but like I said, I have my own moral imperative that I have to go to sleep with at night.""

CNN host Audie Cornish and New York Magazine's Will Leitch suggested during a recent podcast that the U.S. could become the ""global villain"" of the 2026 Winter Olympics.

Mike Eruzione, an American Olympic gold medalist who played a major role in the team's ""Miracle on Ice"" moment in 1980, blasted Team USA skier Hunter Hess on Saturday.

Eruzione responded to Hess' controversial remarks about representing the U.S. on the world stage at this year's Olympic Games. Hess, and teammate Chris Lillis, expressed dismay about wearing the Stars and Stripes amid controversy over the Trump administration's use of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the country.

""Hunter Hess US snowboarder saying he doesn't represent his country but his family and friends,"" Eruzione wrote on X. ""Then don't put on the USA uniform maybe just put for family and friends. Some athletes just don't get it.""

Eruzione later deleted the post.

Lillis and Hess' statements caused significant backlash on social media.

Lillis said that while he ""would never"" want to represent another country in the Games, he's ""heartbroken"" over the administration's actions.

""I love the USA. I would never want to represent a different country in the Olympics. With that being said, a lot of times, athletes are hesitant to talk about political views and how we feel about things.

NEW NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY EXPLORES HOW THE 'MIRACLE ON ICE' UNITED AMERICA IN 1980

""I feel heartbroken about what's happening in the United States. I'm pretty sure you're referencing ICE and some of the protests and things like that,"" he continued. ""I think that, as a country, we need to focus on respecting everybody's rights and making sure that we're treating our citizens as well as anybody, with love and respect. I hope that when people look at athletes compete in the Olympics, they realize that that's the America we're trying to represent.""

Hess echoed that sentiment but took it further, saying he has ""mixed emotions"" about representing the U.S. in these Games.

""It brings up mixed emotions to represent the U.S. right now, I think. It's a little hard. There's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren't.

""I think, for me, it's more I'm representing my friends and family back home, the people that represented it before me, all the things that I believe are good about the U.S. If it aligns with my moral values, I feel like I'm representing it. Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the U.S.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has denied withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress, calling such claims from some “Gang of Eight” lawmakers “lies and baseless accusations.”

Gabbard issued a lengthy defense of her actions in dealing with the complaint, which dates back to May 2025 but was largely unknown until this week due to its highly sensitive nature. While details are thin, it accuses Gabbard of wrongdoing and alleges she withheld classified information “for political purposes.” Recent reporting has also revealed it was partly about an intelligence intercept of a call between two foreign nationals discussing someone close to President Donald Trump, a discussion that was about Iran.

“Senator Mark Warner and his friends in the Propaganda Media have repeatedly lied to the American people that I or the ODNI “hid” a whistleblower complaint in a safe for eight months. This is a blatant lie,” she posted on X on Saturday.

Gabbard said she has never been “in possession” of the complaint and “obviously” could not hide it in a safe, where it has been both before and after being hand-delivered to the Gang of Eight for solely a “read and return” review of its contents earlier this week. Gabbard also said the first time she saw it was just two weeks ago, when she reviewed it “to provide guidance on how it should be securely shared with Congress.”

She reiterated that neither the Biden-era inspector general of her office at the time the complaint was filed, Tamara Johnson, nor the current inspector general, Christopher Fox, have deemed the complaint to be credible. That conclusion from the two oversight heads notwithstanding, Gabbard maintained it still must be held in the safe because “the complainant chose to include highly sensitive information within the complaint itself rather than referencing the sensitive reporting and leaving the complaint at a lower level of classification.”

“Security standards for complaints that include such sensitive intelligence required the Inspector General to keep the complaint and the intelligence referenced secured in a safe from the time the complaint was made, until now,” she added.

Gabbard's first public defense in dealing with the whistleblower complaint comes as she has been hammered by some “Gang of Eight” lawmakers over the monthslong delay in notifying Congress about the complaint.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), who is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has led that charge, accusing her of stonewalling Congress.

“This was, again, a complete avoidance of and I think it was an effort to try to bury this whistleblower complaint,” Warner told NBC News on Thursday.

He has pressed Gabbard on a “21 day” requirement to give the complaint to Congress, which Gabbard said is only necessary if it is deemed “urgent” and credible.

“That was NOT the case here,” she added.

Gabbard also said Warner was only after “political gain” and that his claim of stonewalling “undermines our national security and is a disservice to the American people and the Intelligence Community.”

GABBARD SEIZES VOTING MACHINES FROM PUERTO RICO AS PART OF 2020 INVESTIGATION

The top Republican on that committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), has defended Gabbard's handling of the complaint, saying her office “took the necessary steps to ensure the material has [sic] handled and transmitted appropriately in accordance with law.”

Cotton also deemed the complaint not credible, speculating that it “seemed like an effort by the president's critics to undermine him.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump‘s Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner boarded the USS Abraham Lincoln on Saturday, just one day after high-stakes negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.

Witkoff, Kushner, and U.S. Central Command Cmdr. Bradley Cooper met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his team in Oman on Friday for the nuclear talks, discussions that were inconclusive but were framed by principal figures as a positive step to reaching a deal. With more rounds expected, the three U.S. negotiators visited a U.S. aircraft carrier over the weekend that has been operating off Iran's coast for weeks as tensions remain high between the two nations.

The visit including the three observing “live flight operations,” as well as a discussion with the pilot who shot down an Iranian drone that was flying “aggressively” toward the ship on Tuesday.

“Proud to stand with the men and women who defend our interests, deter our adversaries, and show the world what American readiness and resolve look like, on watch every day,” Witkoff posted on X, along with multiple photos of him aboard the aircraft carrier.

While the timing of the trip is odd, especially given Trump has still not ruled out a military response to Iran's violent crackdown on protesters last month, the purpose of it was supposedly solely to express gratitude for the U.S. service members in the Middle East, according to CNN. A regional source also said both the Iranians and Omanis, who mediated the nuclear negotiations, knew of the visit ahead of time.

The USS Abraham Lincoln was originally deployed to the Indo-Pacific region late last year, but was redirected to the Middle East as tensions soared with Iran. It is part of a “massive” armada Trump has sent to the region in a show of force to the regime.

At least for now, Trump has signaled he wants to reach a deal with Iran rather than resort to military action, calling the Friday talks “very good” and even suggesting an “acceptable” deal is on the table.

WILL TRUMP FALL FOR IRAN'S NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS BLUFF

While it is unclear what that deal includes, the United States has expressed a desire for a more encompassing agreement that focuses on Iran's nuclear program, ballistic missile production, and support for terrorist proxies in the region. 

Iran, however, has drawn a red line on the latter two, restricting negotiations to just its nuclear program, while also insisting it is not pursuing nuclear weapons despite ample evidence from nuclear watchdogs that it is.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

TRUMP, ANOTHER HAIR-ON-FIRE UPROAR, AND THE MIDTERMS. On Friday, the political and media world experienced a nervous breakdown over President Donald Trump's posting of a video that contained a racist image portraying former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes. The video contained a lot more — with a jungle theme, it portrayed former President Joe Biden as a gorilla eating a banana, New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani as a hyena, and former first lady Hillary Clinton as a warthog, while portraying Trump as a lion, the king of the jungle. But it didn't matter. There is a long history of racist tropes portraying black people as apes, and that is what the video did with the Obamas.

Trump took the video down and explained that he had not intentionally posted it, that it had briefly autoplayed after the video he intended to post, which was about the 2020 election. But at minimum, the damage done meant the loss of one, two, three or more days that might have been devoted to making the case for Republicans in the midterm elections, now less than nine months away.

In fact, on the day Trump posted the video, he held a White House event introducing the new TrumpRx program, which the administration bills as “a transformative new government platform that gives Americans direct access to dramatically lower prices on dozens of common, high-cost brand-name prescription drugs.” Targeting Americans with prescription costs not fully covered by insurance, the program has the admirable goal of pushing down the prices of drugs, rather than the common Democratic fix of offering taxpayer-paid subsidies for people to pay rising costs, thus ensuring that costs will rise even higher. 

It's hard to imagine an issue more suited to midterm campaigning, and Trump will certainly feature it on the stump in coming months. But the rollout was lost amid days of controversy over the video.

It was one small missed opportunity at a time when the White House needs to make the best use of its opportunities. Yes, a million things can happen before the midterms, especially in the Age of Trump, when it seems like a million things happen every day. Still, it's reasonable to say that right now things do not look good for Republicans and the GOP president.

Start by looking at the 2018 midterms in Trump's first administration. Republicans lost big in those elections — Democrats won a net 40 seats and control of the House. Republicans actually picked up two seats in the Senate to keep control there, which was important for Trump's ability to confirm his nominees. But losing 40 seats in the House ended whatever legislative agenda Trump might have had. It also ensured that majority Democrats would impeach him — twice, as it turned out.

Go back and look at the so-called generic ballot question — “If the House election were held today, would you vote for the Republican Party candidate or the Democratic Party candidate?” On this date, Feb. 8, in 2018, the RealClearPolitics average of polls on the generic ballot had Democrats at 44.6% and Republicans at 38.4% — a 6.2 percentage point lead for Democrats. 

The Democratic lead remained in place for the next nine months. It was about 7 points on Election Day, when House Democrats picked up those 40 seats.

Now look at today's generic ballot. In the RealClearPolitics average, Democrats are at 47.7% and Republicans are at 42.5% — a 5.2 percentage point lead for Democrats. And Democrats have led in generic ballot polling since early March 2025.

So the Republican deficit today is just a bit short of what it was in 2018, when the GOP lost big in House elections. And of course, Democrats don't have to pick up 40 seats. If they can gain just five or more seats, they will win control of the House. The Republican margin is astonishingly narrow. 

Then there is history. The president's party usually loses House seats in midterms. Only two presidents in the last 90 years — George W. Bush in 2002 and Bill Clinton in 1998 — have seen their party pick up seats, and both were in unusual circumstances. And then, finally, there is job approval. Trump's approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average of polls is 42.3%, which is not terribly concerning for him but well below the kind of approval that will help his party win House seats. An approval rating well below 50% will make winning the midterms harder.

Of course Trump knows all this. He has a plan to defy history and the polls. But messes like the video controversy make the job harder by the day.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Millions of Americans are expected to watch the Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday, but don't expect President Donald Trump to be one of them.

Instead, Trump and many conservatives are likely to tune out the official NFL performance in favor of Turning Point USA‘s alternative halftime show, featuring country music stars Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett.

The split reflects something bigger than musical taste. It's the latest sign Republicans aren't just fighting for votes — they're using their political might to create an alternative mainstream. 

TRUMP ‘WOULD MUCH PREFER' TO WATCH TPUSA SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW INSTEAD OF BAD BUNNY

In recent weeks, Trump has snubbed society's tastemakers by adding his name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and showcasing new MAGA surrogates such as rap queen Nicki Minaj. First lady Melania Trump, meanwhile, has released an eponymous documentary that is expanding into theaters across the country.

“You want to be everywhere all the time,” GOP strategist Ford O'Connell said. “That's the rule of politics. That's messaging one-on-one. You want to control the narrative.”

The Super Bowl is the largest sporting event in America, with more than 100 million people likely to tune into the Seattle Seahawks duke it out against the New England Patriots. It comes exactly one week after several musicians, including Bad Bunny, took to the Grammy stage to denounce Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in Minnesota.

“Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say, ICE out,” said Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, who goes by the stage name Bad Bunny, while accepting the Grammy for Best Música Urbana Album. “We're not savage, we're not animals, we're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.”

Republicans say that Bad Bunny's flamboyant sartorial choices, along with his progressive views, created an opening for a counter-halftime program — one that could appeal to every segment of society.

MAGA QUEEN OF RAP: NICKI MINAJ BECOMES TRUMP'S NEWEST WHITE HOUSE SURROGATE

“The Super Bowl is almost like another holiday in our American society,” Florida-based Republican strategist Dewayne Moore said. “So one of the biggest, one of the biggest platforms, one of the biggest stages, on a Sunday that will bring 136 million viewers, we're going to put an individual, a man who will wear a dress, a man who will paint his fingernail. Is that what we're trying to do in our American society now, is to raise up young men that think it's OK to dress like a woman?”

Trump put it more succinctly when announcing he would not attend the game over the NFL's Bad Bunny pick.

“I think it's a terrible choice,” the president said. “All it does is sow hatred. Terrible.”

Yet,  an alternative halftime show is a perfect opportunity for anyone who wants to get their message out, Republicans argue. 

American conservatives have long been disaffected with the liberalization of American society and pushed to reshape culture to reflect a more traditional, Christian values-based society. Trump, who became a celebrity before he became a politician, was able to ride that dissatisfaction to the White House in 2016 and 2024. Both elections featured increasing defections of middle and working-class Americans from the Democratic Party over its embrace of “woke” politics.

In 2024, even Democrats admitted that Trump's most impactful ad was one lambasting Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris for being “for they/them.”

Yet, Trump is not the first president to capitalize on social issues to win political office. In 2004, then-President George W. Bush campaigned for reelection, in part, on a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. That year, Bush won the popular vote, Republicans kept control of Congress, and 11 states voted to enshrine bans on the practice in their constitutions.

Jacob Neiheisel, an expert on political communication and campaigns at the University at Buffalo, said the difference was not in how Republicans campaigned but what they did when in office.

“They're using those levers for change in a way that we haven't seen conservative administrations do before,” Neiheisel added. “I think the Trump and the conservative movement more generally is a lot more comfortable using power to enact change.”

The results of trying to reshape culture have been mixed during Trump's second term. 

Trump's controversial takeover of the Kennedy Center in 2025 and the later name change were met with fierce criticism from Democrats and a drop in subscription numbers. This month, the president announced the institution will close for renovations starting July 4 and lasting approximately two years.

The administration's handling of hot-button issues from immigration to the release of the Epstein files has also drawn criticism, even from cultural influencers once thought to be sympathetic, like the “podcast bros” who helped Trump expand his outreach to younger voters in 2024.

“He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for,” host Andrew Schulz said during a Flagrant podcast episode in July 2025.

There have also been unforced errors. A front-page Vanity Fair spread in December 2025 featuring several high-level members of the administration led to a full-out defense of chief of staff Susie Wiles after her candid remarks about the White House were published.

Scholar and right-leaning podcaster Steve Turley said the Trump administration does not just want cultural acceptance.

“I don't know if they're trying to crave approval as much as they're actually trying to conquer,” the Turley Talks host said. “They're not looking for approval. They're saying our team is bigger than yours. Your little Grammy get-together, bunch of people talking about stolen land, is nothing compared to what we can put together. That's the sense I get.”

The MAGA movement has twice propelled Trump to the White House. But with the midterm elections in November and in the 2028 presidential election, the movement will need a charismatic leader not named Trump who can help the GOP keep control of the White House and Congress. That leader will need to know how to control and dominate the cultural scene, similar to Trump's ability to capitalize on American backlash against Democrats in 2016 and 2024.

“What I do know is they recognize that culture is a legitimate place of contestation,” Turley said. “Culture is political. It's been politicized in every way imaginable today, and for right or for wrong.”

There are some Republicans who claim that trying to go tit-for-tat with the Left is a distraction and urge the White House to focus on its massive fundraising and media operations instead.

“At some point, this stops being cultural commentary and starts looking like insecurity,” said Hunter S. Gaylor, a former fundraiser for then-Sen. Marco Rubio. “The Super Bowl halftime show isn't Congress, it isn't a campaign stop, and it doesn't need a political counterprogram. Yes, the entertainment industry leans left — everyone knows that. But responding by turning a football game into a partisan split screen is exactly how everything gets dumbed down into theater. Conservatism isn't supposed to mirror the Left's obsession with politicizing every square inch of American life.” “Not every cultural moment needs to be conquered,” he added. “Some just need to be ignored.”

W. JAMES ANTLE III: CAN TRUMP STAY FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMY?

But ignoring is easier said than done. Despite skipping the Super Bowl over Bad Bunny's performance, the administration will still run an ad promoting its “Trump Accounts” initiative during the game. The ad, which will air after the national anthem, is financed by Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner and Dell CEO Michael Dell.

Trump Accounts is a federally backed investment account program that provides babies born between 2025 and 2028 with $1,000 at birth.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Millions of files, zero accountability?

The Department of Justice has released more than 3 million files tied to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The rollout has been chaotic.

Many documents were heavily redacted, while others appeared to expose victims' personal information and photos that were not supposed to be public.

Officials say this is the full set of materials that will be made public and that additional criminal charges are unlikely. So now that the files are out: What have we actually learned, and will anyone be held accountable?

To find out, Today, Explained guest host Jonquilyn Hill spoke with Business Insider reporter Maddie Berg, who covers wealth and power.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What have we learned from this latest document dump?

I think the overarching thing I've really taken away is it's a really rare look about how rich and powerful people — mainly men — communicate, how the network works, how they do favors for each other.

And they talk about women in a way that is really scary. That's kind of the overarching theme I've taken away, is how permissive this rich and powerful class has been or was to Epstein.

Additionally, there have been revelations about figures. People like Elon Musk, who have said: I have cut ties with Epstein, I didn't know him, I never went to the island, etc., but we're seeing that he was emailing Epstein, asking for an invite to the island to go to a “wild” party.

We're seeing Howard Lutnick. He said he cut ties with Epstein in 2005, but their emails, which indicate he seemingly went to Epstein's Island in 2012.

We're seeing Brad Karp, the chairman of Paul Weiss, the law firm, step down overnight as chairman. He's still working as a lawyer there.

There's a lot of Woody Allen/Epstein overlap in this. He actually helped Woody Allen's daughter, one of them, get into Bard College, it seems like. So again, there's so much overlap in terms of who you think of as kind of creepy men.

Who are other powerful people mentioned in the files? 

The man formerly known as Prince Andrew has been connected to Epstein for years. In these emails, the evidence seems like sex trafficking. It seems like him asking Epstein to be set up with women.

Additionally, we're seeing Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew's ex-wife. Prince spoke to Epstein in a very friendly way. Same with the Crown Princess of Norway — and this is all, by the way, after 2008, when he was convicted of prostitution with a minor.

We're also seeing Peter Mandelson. He was the former British ambassador to the US. He resigned from his position in the House of Lords, and we're seeing fallout for that. Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the UK, is under fire at the moment because he apparently knew about some of Peter Mandelson's ties to Epstein when Starmer named him ambassador.

We've seen more repercussions to foreign leaders than to Americans. Why do you think that is?

A lot of the leaders in America, the names that are jumping out are business leaders. We're kind of going to see how that plays out.

We're seeing the NFL is looking into Steve Tisch, the owner of the Giants. We're going to really kind of see how the pieces fall as we learn more and more.

“I found it interesting how much these people put into writing. It was almost like they believed they were above the law or above repercussion.”

I also think that, repercussions-wise, the whole point of the document dump is not to find new evidence. It's for the Department of Justice to prove that it did not leave any stone unturned. It looked into everybody. It thought about prosecuting these people. It went down those rabbit holes. It couldn't find enough to criminally prosecute anyone else other than Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein.

Some of these correspondents might be creepy, it might be sleazy, it might be gross, it might be unethical; but there wasn't enough criminal goods in this to prosecute anyone else named.

What do consequences look like if they're not criminal charges? 

I think a lot of it is up to the public, if we're not okay with something that we read in this, whether it's from a politician or a business leader, to really push back and to say, This is not okay. We want this leader out. We want them out of government, out of their business, whatever it is. It's kind of up to the court of public opinion.

Now, that said, we are going to see some of these people testifying in front of Congress later this month. The Clintons are going to testify. Les Wexner, who was listed in a draft document by the DOJ as a co-conspirator or potential co-conspirator of Epstein's, will too. So we are going to see these people questioned by the government.

We might get more answers, and we might then, it won't be criminal charges necessarily, but we might get repercussions from the public, and there might be more consequences in that way.

What should the public take away from all of this whole thing?

I think it's important to understand how the very, very, very wealthy, the very, very powerful interact with each other. How they speak about women, how they use each other.

And also how many people can't be taken at their word. So many people denied having a connection to Epstein or visiting his island or talking to him after his conviction in 2008, but they were lying. And I think it's really important that we hold people to account, and we don't take their word at face value.

I found it interesting how much these people put into writing. It was almost like they believed they were above the law or above repercussion. And not everybody, obviously, but some very rich and powerful people think they're immune to consequences. And it's really up to the public now that this is out there, what consequences they face.

The decline of burglary and robbery, explained.

A few weeks back, in the run-up to Christmas, my family was doing what it always does during the holiday season: watching Home Alone. And, around the time that Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern's Wet Bandits began plotting their break-ins, I began wondering something: Were home robberies really so common in 1990, when the film was released, that audiences wouldn't blink at the idea of a comedy based around home burglary?

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

In 1990, in the Chicago suburb of Winnetka where the film is set, there were 53 burglaries, the vast majority of which were in residences like the McAllisters' house in the movie. That adds up to a rate of 435 robberies per 100,000 people, which was actually fairly low for the time. But in nearby Chicago, there were more than 50,000 burglaries, or around 1,800 per 100,000 people, that year. The nationwide burglary rate was over 1,200 per 100,000 people — part of an overall property crime rate that was near the highest the US had ever recorded.

So, yes, the idea that a couple of bandits might break into your home while you were off on a Paris vacation wasn't far-fetched. (Although given that the McAllister family were so disorganized they twice lost one of their kids on Christmas vacation trips, I'm not all that confident about their home security approach.)

But when Home Alone is remade — as I'm certain a remake-obsessed Hollywood will do eventually — they might need to change up the premise. Nationwide, burglary rates have fallen by more than 80 percent since 1990. Chicago has seen rates fall by similar levels, a story that is all the more remarkable given just how high those rates were in the 1990s. Wealthy Winnetka had less far to drop, but it's still down by over 60 percent.

While the historic drop in violent crime in the United States has gotten a lot of attention recently, including in this newsletter, the dip in property crimes like robbery, burglary, and motor vehicle theft has gone under the radar. The overall property crime rate has fallen by 66 percent in the US since 1990, even steeper than the decline in violent crime, and the lowest level since national data began in 1976. And while this has largely been a steady, long-term trend, there was a 9 percent decline between 2023 and 2024 — the sharpest single-year decline on record.

For our stuff, as well as for our lives, there's an argument to be made that Americans are safer now than they have ever been.

To understand what's changed, it helps to remember what “normal” looked like at the end of the 1980s and the start of the 1990s. In that period in many cities, property crime was like background weather: something you planned around and simply had to live with, even if you didn't talk about it every day.

Nationally, the overall property crime rate was just over 5,000 incidents per 100,000 people each year around 1990. If you do the math, that means the country was recording roughly one property crime for every 20 residents on average. Of course, the average wasn't how people lived. Then, as now, crime could be highly concentrated in some neighborhoods and virtually absent in others. But that's still a staggering level of routine predation.

On a dollar level, the average residential burglary in 1990 resulted in a loss of around $2,800 to $3,400, while total losses for all property crime was nearly $40 billion. (Both numbers are adjusted for inflation.) But there was also a price on human lives. By one estimate, roughly one in four robberies — like your classic street mugging — resulted in some form of physical injury to the victim, while roughly one in 10 of all murders occurred in the course of a felony like robbery and burglary. Based on homicide numbers at the time, that meant as many as 2,500 people may have lost their lives due to incidents that began as simple thefts or robberies.

And these numbers may just touch the surface. Police-reported crime is partly a measure of crime and partly a measure of reporting crime. In a high-crime environment, people often stop calling the police for “smaller” thefts — because the expectation becomes that nothing will happen, or because the hassle isn't worth it. So even these ugly numbers likely understate how saturated daily life could feel with property crime.

All of which raises the question: What changed? It's probably not because Americans suddenly became nicer. Instead, it's due to a confluence of factors in how we police crime, how we protect ourselves from it — and even the kind of stuff we own now.

The bottom line is that we changed our environment in a way that made burglary and robbery harder to pull off, less profitable, and more likely to fail.

For one thing, homes and apartments are simply harder to burgle than they used to be. We have better door and window locks. Better frames. Better outdoor lighting. More apartment buildings have controlled entry, buzzer systems, and cameras. Alarms got cheaper. And now, in many neighborhoods, a kind of informal surveillance mesh exists: doorbell cameras like Amazon's Ring, building cameras, storefront cameras, even the scourge that is Nextdoor. The Wet Bandits wouldn't stand a chance today.

A paper published in 2021 directly links the startling drop in burglary to security improvements like the above, which helps explain why property crime kept dropping in diverse cities, across different presidencies, up and down economic cycles, almost without stopping. Burglary is an opportunity crime. If it takes longer to break in and burglars are more likely to be spotted, fewer people will try — and fewer will succeed. One nugget from the paper: The average age of burglars increased as younger people found it harder to do.

Second, stealing stuff got a lot less lucrative — and a lot more traceable. In 1990, a burglar who found a stack of home electronics could convert it to cash pretty quickly. Today, a lot of our most valuable consumer tech is easy to disable from a distance and track. Sometimes the math doesn't add up: Stolen tech often isn't worth that much on the resale market because products have gotten cheaper. One plus of living in a richer society — which America very much is compared to 1990 — is that the wages of crime pay less comparatively.

At the same time, there's the simple fact that people carry — both on themselves and at home — far less paper cash than they used to. For any would-be mugger, the expected take is lower and the expected risk is higher. Notably, one study on Missouri linked the state's shift from paper welfare checks to electronic benefit transfer led to a decline in crime. And that's true in commercial operations too, as customers today are far more likely to pay with credit cards or their phone.

Third, cameras and coordination changed the game. Doorbell cameras don't just ward off potential burglars — they provide far more specific identification if someone still tries. The same goes for ubiquitous smartphones, which enable people to instantly call for help, share a suspect's photo, and even ping a lost device. (Good luck doing any of that in 1990 — Kevin McAllister's land line didn't even work!) All of this raises the perceived chance of getting caught, even if actual police clearance rates for property crimes remain very low.

Of course, all of these changes have their downside. Ubiquitous cameras can bleed into a surveillance state, one whose negative effects we're seeing. The decline of cash reduces financial privacy and exacerbates social inequality. And the ubiquity of smartphones… well, you don't need me to tell you the downsides of that.

It's also true that some of what we used to think of as “property crime” didn't vanish so much as change form. The classic late-20th-century nightmare was physical — a smashed window, a missing car, a stranger in your house. A lot of modern predation is more virtual and more bureaucratic: scams, account takeovers, and worst of all, identity fraud, which costs Americans tens of billions of dollars. And some of the “new” street-level thefts are oddly specific, like taking e-commerce packages off your stoop, something that wasn't even conceivable in 1990.

The price tag is not small. In 2024, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center logged $16.6 billion in reported losses, while the Postal Service estimates at least 58 million packages were stolen in 2024, adding up to as much as $16 billion in losses.

None of this negates the good news about burglaries and robberies. It just updates the definition of what “safe property” means in 2026. Maybe in the next Home Alone, the Wet Bandits will be cyberfraudsters (though at least I hope the McAllisters put an AirTag on that kid).

Will Lewis' two-year tenure as publisher of the Washington Post is over.

His time leading the nearly 150-year-old newspaper, which was bought by billionaire Jeff Bezos in 2013, was marked by buyouts and shrinking coverage. Most recently, on Wednesday, the Post laid off hundreds of journalists, many of them covering foreign affairs.

""Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus,"" Bezos said in a statement on Saturday, his first public comments since the layoffs. ""Jeff, along with Matt and Adam, are positioned to lead The Post into an exciting and thriving next chapter.""

Below is the text of memos emailed to Post staff announcing Lewis' departure and the appointment of Chief Financial Officer Jeff D'Onofrio as acting publisher.

""All - after two years of transformation at The Washington Post, now is the right time for me to step aside. I want to thank Jeff Bezos for his support and leadership throughout my tenure as CEO and Publisher. The institution could not have a better owner.

During my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customers each day.

With gratitude, Will""

""The Washington Post is announcing Jeff D'Onofrio as its acting Publisher and CEO, effective immediately.

D'Onofrio, a strategic business leader and proven architect of the new media landscape, joined The Post in June 2025 as Chief Financial Officer following leadership roles across global companies including Raptive, Tumblr, Yahoo and Google. He succeeds William Lewis, who has served as Publisher and CEO for the past two years.

""The Post's resolute commitment to writing the first rough draft of history anchors and imprints its future,"" said D'Onofrio. ""I am honored to become part of charting that future and to take the lead in securing both the legacy and business of this fierce, storied American institution.""

""The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity. Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus,"" said Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post. ""Jeff, along with Matt and Adam, are positioned to lead The Post into an exciting and thriving next chapter.""

D'Onofrio served as Chief Financial Officer for Raptive, the largest digital ad management company serving over 6,000 creators and publishers. He oversaw the finance, human resources and data and analytics teams, while negotiating key partnerships and acquisitions that helped power Raptive to impressive revenue and profit growth.

Immediately prior to his role at Raptive, D'Onofrio was Chief Executive Officer at Tumblr and held other key leadership positions there including President, Chief Operating Officer, and CFO. His expert fluency in both today's media business landscape also grew from his leadership and management roles at Google, Zagat, Yahoo!, and Major League Baseball (MLB Advanced Media).""

When Lily Telloyan was in middle school, her household grew from two generations to four. Her grandparents and great-grandmother were getting older, so her parents moved the whole family under one roof in Lansing, Michigan.

Nearly 20 years later, four generations of the family are living together again.

After spending her college years in Indiana and then moving in with her husband, Alex, in Lansing, Lily started thinking about multigenerational living again. She hoped she could one day raise her own kids the way she'd been brought up.

""Even when I was dating my husband, I told him, this is my crazy dream,"" the 29-year-old said. ""If he'd said that wasn't what he was into, I think I would have questioned the longevity of our relationship.""

That dream became a reality when Lily, who's a remote special education teacher, got pregnant, and the couple faced the soaring costs of childcare and Lily's grandparents' growing needs. In November 2024, Lily and Alex moved in with Lily's parents, Naomi and Tim Van Loh, and her grandparents, Sam and Eva Telloyan. (Lily and Alex took Eva and Sam's last name when they married). Lily and Alex's son, Xander, was born in April 2025.

They're just one of a growing share of American families moving back in together — or never separating in the first place. The number of people in the US living in multigenerational households — or those with two or more adult generations — quadrupled between 1971 and 2021, according to Pew Research. Cost savings are driving the trend. Families can split rent and mortgage payments, and save on childcare costs and long-term care costs for older relatives.

""When I considered how much I enjoyed my work and teaching and the level of care my grandparents were needing, and seeing the impacts of that on my mom as their primary caregiver, I became more and more convinced that the intergenerational model would be most beneficial for everybody in the family,"" Lily said.

Mornings in the Telloyan-Van Loh house start around 6:30 am, when Xander wakes up. Lily gets him dressed before her dad, a pastor at a local church, supervises morning playtime. Alex walks the family dog, Snoopy, while Naomi helps her parents get up and ready for the day. Lily and Naomi make breakfast as Alex, who works in cybersecurity, leaves for the office. Lily hands the baby to her mom when she starts her workday. All of that happens before 9:30 am.

Naomi, who also works part-time as a remote educator, takes care of her grandson and her parents while the other adults are working. The childcare arrangement has allowed Lily to keep her job, which she loves. ""Running the numbers, it seems like a wash, honestly, to pay for childcare on a teacher's salary,"" she said.

Eva, who's 87, has dementia and needs constant attention. Professional long-term care, like assisted living, would strain the family's finances and wouldn't give Naomi the peace of mind she has with her parents under her roof, she said. She takes classes on caregiving at the local library.

""I don't know how we would do it the other way,"" said Naomi, 58, said of Eva's care. ""And, for me, knowing that she's safe, knowing that she's comfortable, knowing that she's happy, and I can see her and hear her, and I take care of everything she needs — to me that's worth more than money in the bank.""

All six adult members of the family contribute financially to the household. They split living expenses, including utilities, property taxes, and groceries, evenly, though Naomi and Tim bought the house for $420,000 in 2021 and have since paid off the mortgage. Between the four working adults and Eva and Sam's Social Security benefits, their household income is around $230,000.

They've divided up the house so each couple has their own space. Naomi and Tim have the primary bedroom, Lily and Alex have two bedrooms and small offices downstairs, and Sam and Eva have their own bedroom and sitting room. Alex renovated the downstairs

Caregiving responsibilities are harder to divide equally. ""I had to learn really early on — and I'm still not great at that — that we shouldn't really keep a running record, or try to keep things even when it comes to workload, we just all chip in and do our best as we are able,"" Lily said.

Sam often tells Naomi he worries that he and Eva are a burden on her and the family. But Naomi insists that she wouldn't have it any other way. She says she enjoys taking care of her parents, despite the challenges.

""We have this kind of ongoing conversation, too, about the balance between duty and desire for motivation,"" Naomi said. ""Some people think it's your duty, you have to do this.""

Lily chimed in, ""The best case scenario is when you desire to do your duty.""

There are also more mundane challenges. Logistics get a bit complicated when it comes to entertaining friends. The family has a shared calendar they use to plan their social engagements and travel six months in advance. Small things like a messy closet can create tension, so they're quick to address even minor infractions.

""When I'm irritated, I think to myself, 'This is what I signed up for because I like all the benefits,"" Naomi said. ""I mean, every life has irritation, right? Even if you live alone, you might irritate yourself.""

While multigenerational living is increasingly common, four generations in one home is still unusual. Lily and Naomi said they sometimes feel misunderstood by friends.

""When my friends hear about our lifestyle, we get a lot of negative comments, like, 'Oh, you need to be more independent.' Or like, 'Oh, are you doing this for financial reasons? Or are you saving up for a house?'"" Lily said. ""It takes people a little bit of time to realize this was plan A.""

For now, they're sticking with plan A.

""I said to everybody, this is the last move of my entire life,"" Lily said. ""I think now we're in a pretty stable place.""

For months, investors have been growing increasingly anxious about how artificial intelligence will potentially transform the economy. Last week, those concerns suddenly spilled over into the stock market. 

The culprit was AI startup Anthropic, which released new tools designed to automate work tasks in various industries, from legal and data services to financial research. The announcements sparked fears that the innovations would doom countless businesses. In response, investors dumped a broad range of stocks, from Expedia Group Inc. to Salesforce Inc. to London Stock Exchange Group Plc.

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi speaks at a Liberal Democratic Party election rally in Kawagoe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, on Feb. 3.

Japanese voters went to the polls Sunday to deliver a verdict on Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's government as she seeks to shore up her grip on power and gain a clear mandate for spending and investment plans that have unsettled some investors.

Takaichi has staked her job on the outcome of the election, saying she will step down if her ruling coalition fails to win a majority in the more powerful lower house. She currently holds a razor-thin majority of 233 out of the 465 seats in the chamber. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Growing numbers of emerging-market companies are borrowing overseas at cheaper rates than their countries of origin, a sign that sovereign risk is becoming less of a drag for the stronger, export-focused names.  

Corporates from Mexico, Turkey and other developing nations have borrowed in dollar bond markets this year at an average 5.828% yield, versus the 6% demanded of sovereigns for similar-maturity debt, according to Bloomberg's analysis of new bond issues through Feb. 4. In the case of Ukrainian agri-business MHP SE, investors were willing to accept yields several percentage points below that of the sovereign.

Thai voters headed to the polls on Sunday in what is seen as a three-cornered contest, with most pre-poll surveys signaling a fractured mandate that could trigger a fresh bout of political paralysis.

About 53 million voters are eligible to cast ballots in the snap election and a concurrent referendum on a new constitution. The race is seen as a high-stakes showdown between the ruling conservative Bhumjaithai Party, the progressive People's Party and a populist Pheu Thai Party poised to tip the balance if no party wins outright.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has likely strengthened its majority in the country's Lower House, with the LDP capturing between 274 and 328 in the 465 seat chamber, according to an early projection by broadcaster NHK. 

This was broadly in line with what polls had suggested, with Nikkei and Asahi Shimbun predicting that the LDP and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party would secure more then 300 seats in the Lower House. 

NHK projected the coalition would win up to 366 seats.

People trudged through heavy snow in several parts of the country to cast their votes.

Before parliament was dissolved, the LDP-JIP coalition held a combined 230 seats, and with three independents voting with the LDP, this effectively gave the ruling coalition a one seat majority in the chamber. 

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female leader, dissolved the Lower House on Jan. 23, a move that was seen as an attempt to quickly strengthen the ruling coalition's position in the chamber by capitalizing on her high public approval ratings. 

""Takaichi now has the LDP and the technocrats exactly where she always wanted them,"" economist Jesper Koll said in a Substack post.

""The LDP is now beholden to her; and the elite technocrats now know she'll be in power for at least two or three more years … so they have no choice but to invest their career in her success,"" Koll added.

Polls compiled by Japanese media outlet Nippon.com showed that Takaichi remained popular heading into the election, although her support had slipped slightly in the recent weeks. 

The outlet reported that just one domestic poll in January indicated more than 70% support, compared to three in December, while six polls showed support in the 60% range, up from four in the previous month. 

Meanwhile, the Central Reform Alliance, made up of the former Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito, the LDP's former coalition partner, was likely to pick up between 37 and 91 seats. 

The CDP was the largest opposition party before its merger with Komeito, holding 148 seats, while Komeito controlled 24 seats.

The election comes amid heightened tensions between Japan and China, as well as persistent concerns over the yen's weakness and inflation in the country.

Japan has endured inflation above the Bank of Japan's target for 45 consecutive months, declining real wages and persistent yen weakness.

The most recent inflation reading stood at 2.1%, while full-year inflation reached 3.2%. Real wages fell for 11 consecutive months year-on-year in 2025, and on a yearly basis, real wages have fallen every year since 2022.

The yen weakened further at the start of 2026, briefly approaching the 160 level against the U.S. dollar. While a weaker currency benefits exporters, it has also amplified imported inflation.

Takaichi had earlier laid out a record $783 billion budget for the next fiscal year starting April 1, on top of a $135 billion stimulus package introduced last year to help households with rising living costs.

""Watch for more state-directed initiatives to create 'national champions', levering the $550 [billion] U.S.-Japan investment deal to create a sense of urgency amongst reluctant CEOs,"" Koll said. ""Japan's M&A boom will get turbo-charged to create greater economies of scale, and thus more credible global competitiveness — all this in the name of higher national economic security.""

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's chief of staff resigned Sunday over the furor surrounding the appointment of Peter Mandelson as the U.K. ambassador to the U.S. despite his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

Morgan McSweeney said he took responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Mandelson, 72, to Britain's most important diplomatic post in 2024.

""The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself,"" McSweeney said in a statement. ""When asked, I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice.""

Starmer is facing a political storm and questions about his judgment after newly published documents, part of a huge trove of Epstein files made public in the United States, suggested that Mandelson sent market-sensitive information to the convicted sex offender when he was the U.K. government's business secretary during the 2008 financial crisis.

Starmer's government has promised to release its own emails and other documentation related to Mandelson's appointment, which it says will show that Mandelson misled officials.

The prime minister apologized this week for ""having believed Mandelson's lies.""

He acknowledged that when Mandelson was chosen for the top diplomat job in 2024, the vetting process had revealed that Mandelson's friendship with Epstein continued after the latter's 2008 conviction. But Starmer maintained that ""none of us knew the depth of the darkness"" of that relationship at the time.

A number of lawmakers said Starmer is ultimately responsible for the scandal.

""Keir Starmer has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions,"" said Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party.

Mandelson, a former Cabinet minister, ambassador and elder statesman of the governing Labour Party, has not been arrested or charged.

Metropolitan Police officers searched Mandelson's London home and another property linked to him on Friday. Police said the investigation is complex and will require ""a significant amount of further evidence gathering and analysis.""

The U.K. police investigation centers on potential misconduct in public office, and Mandelson is not accused of any sexual offenses.

Starmer had fired Mandelson in September from his ambassadorial job over earlier revelations about his Epstein ties. But critics say the emails recently published by the U.S. Justice Department have brought serious concerns about Starmer's judgment to the fore. They argue that he should have known better than to appoint Mandelson in the first place.

The new revelations include documents suggesting Mandelson shared sensitive government information with Epstein after the 2008 global financial crisis. They also include records of payments totaling $75,000 in 2003 and 2004 from Epstein to accounts linked to Mandelson or his husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva.

Aside from his association with Epstein, Mandelson previously had to resign twice from senior government posts because of scandals over money or ethics.

Starmer had faced growing pressure over the past week to fire McSweeney, who is regarded as a key adviser in Downing Street and seen as a close ally of Mandelson.

Starmer on Sunday credited McSweeney as a central figure in Labour's recent election campaign and its 2004 landslide victory. His statement did not mention the Mandelson scandal.

In this article

The latest earnings reports from major technology companies have revived investors' concerns about payoffs on elevated artificial intelligence (AI) spending. 

While some companies failed to impress investors, others proved their ability to capitalize on solid growth opportunities offered by the ongoing AI boom.

With their expertise and in-depth analysis, top Wall Street analysts can help investors select stocks that can outperform the broader market and deliver impressive growth. 

Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) is this week's first pick. In a recent research note, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of $330. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AAPL stock, with an ""outperform"" rating and a price target of $289. 

The five-star analyst noted that Apple's January App Store revenue rose 7% year over year. However, Daryanani pointed out that Gaming revenues fell on a year-over-year basis for a third consecutive month, with January revenues down 3%. He explained that this weakness was due to tougher year-over-year comparisons. He expects Gaming revenues to see easier comparisons through the rest of the first half of calendar year 2026. 

Daryanani highlighted that despite ongoing weakness in the Gaming category, revenues from the other five categories of App Store revenue grew by double digits, led by Music (up 21%), Other (21%), Photo and Video (18%), Social Networking (11%) and Entertainment (10%).

The analyst stated that Apple continues to deliver robust growth in Services revenue despite subdued App Store data, with the December quarter seeing 14% growth compared to the App Store's 6.5% growth. Daryanani also noted that Apple's recently reported revenue and EPS (earnings per share) for the December quarter exceeded expectations, with the company delivering better-than-expected gross margin, driven by limited memory impact and robust Services growth. 

""We expect AAPL to continue to benefit from faster growing areas (Apple Pay, iCloud, Licensing, etc.), helping to offset <10% growth in App Store revs,"" said Daryanani. 

Daryanani ranks No. 160 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.6%. See Apple Options Activity on TipRanks. 

Database software provider MongoDB (MDB) is next on the list. Bank of America analyst Koji Ikeda is optimistic about the company's growth prospects. He recently reaffirmed a buy rating on MDB stock and raised his price forecast to $500 from $480. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on MongoDB stock with a price target of $380. 

Commenting on concerns over whether MongoDB's Atlas revenue growth will keep accelerating, Ikeda sees the potential for continued strength. His optimism is backed by the success of the company's top-down enterprise and bottom-up product-led growth approach and an expanding product lineup for artificial intelligence (AI) and legacy app modernization. The analyst also expects MongoDB to gain from higher consumption, driven by rising enterprise workloads. 

Ikeda highlighted the strengths of MongoDB database, saying it is fast, scalable and document-based, differentiating it from conventional relational databases like Oracle. The five-star analyst also noted the new features offered by the company, including vector search and application modernization capabilities, which bolster its position to win additional workloads.

While MDB stock is trading at a higher valuation compared to infrastructure software peers, Ikeda believes that a premium is justified, given the 30% Atlas growth compared to 11% for peers and MongoDB's leading position in the database market. 

Ikeda ranks No. 689 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.7%. See MDB Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Data storage company Western Digital (WDC) recently announced better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and issued solid guidance. The robust demand for hard drives and flash storage amid the ongoing AI wave is boosting the company's business. 

Following Western Digital's Innovation Day, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan reaffirmed a buy rating on WDC stock with a price target of $345. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on Western Digital with a price target of $285. 

Mohan noted that Western Digital expects the AI and cloud storage market to grow exabytes (EB), a measure of data storage, at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of over 25% through 2030. The five-star analyst also sees the possibility of hard disk drives (HDDs) gaining market share and accounting for more than 80% of storage in the cloud. 

Additionally, Mohan emphasized Western Digital's revised long-term growth targets. Over the next three to five years, the company aims to grow its nearline exabytes at mid-20% CAGR, with overall revenue above 20% CAGR. Mohan highlighted that a favorable mix shift to higher capacity HDDs, stable pricing, and a focus on cost improvements could fuel gross margin above 50%, an operating margin of more than 40%, and EPS higher than $20. 

Meanwhile, Western Digital is planning capital spending at 4% to 6% of annual revenue and a free cash flow margin of more than 30%. Overall, Mohan is bullish on WDC's prospects based on ""secular growth of the HDD market,"" as well as further gross margin upside.

Mohan ranks No. 110 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.1%. See Western Digital Financials on TipRanks.

Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Sunday that the man suspected of shooting top Russian military intelligence officer Vladimir Alexeyev in Moscow has been detained in Dubai and handed over to Russia.

Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev, deputy head of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence arm, was shot several times in an apartment block in Moscow on Friday, investigators said. He underwent surgery after the shooting, Russian media said.

The FSB said a Russian citizen named Lyubomir Korba was detained in Dubai on suspicion of carrying out the shooting.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Ukraine of being behind the assassination attempt, which he said was designed to sabotage peace talks.

Ukraine said it had nothing to do with the shooting.

Alexeyev's boss, Admiral Igor Kostyukov, the head of the GRU, has been leading Russia's delegation in negotiations with Ukraine in Abu Dhabi on security-related aspects of a potential peace deal.

BEIJING — China's Luckin Coffee is taking direct aim at Starbucks' high-end roastery chain with a new flagship store in the country's south that sells premium drinks.

It's Luckin's first major departure from its original strategy of operating budget-priced coffee kiosks – a move that helped the company overtake Starbucks in terms of the number of storefronts in China.

Now, with the U.S. company selling off most of its struggling China business to a local investment firm, Luckin is proving it's more than made a comeback from fraud allegations in 2020 that forced it to delist from the Nasdaq. 

The Chinese company on Sunday officially opened its two-floor Luckin Coffee Origin Flagship in Shenzhen on the border with Hong Kong.

In contrast to Luckin's typical offerings priced at roughly $1 or $2 for an Americano or latte, the flagship store has nudged prices slightly higher for a range of pour-over and cold brew coffee drinks. Customers can choose beans from Brazil, Ethiopia or China's Yunnan province, as Luckin taps into the geographical sourcing ""origin"" theme popular with Starbucks and other coffee companies. 

The new store also sells several specialty drinks such as a ""tiramisu latte"" with a pastry on top, according to posts on Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu. Users have started posting about 1 to 3 hour waits for the drinks since the store's soft launch on Jan. 20. 

The 420-square-meter (4,521 square feet) store signals how intense the competition in China has become for Starbucks. Back in 2017, the U.S.-based coffee giant chose Shanghai for its second-ever Reserve Roastery ""megastore,"" after launching the premium store concept in Seattle three years earlier.

But as coffee has taken off in China, traditionally a tea-drinking market, Starbucks has run into a slew of competitors from boutique cafes to chains such as Cotti Coffee and Manner — which often sell drinks at half the price as Starbucks.

Luckin reported revenue of $1.55 billion for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2025, a nearly 48% increase from a year earlier. 

That's just for the company's self-operated stores, which account for well over half of Luckin's China locations and most of its handful of overseas stores. The new Shenzhen location is billed as Luckin's 30,000th store. The company reported a total of 29,214 stores worldwide as at Sept. 30.

In contrast, Starbucks has just over 8,000 stores in China and around 16,900 in the U.S., its biggest market.

The Seattle-based coffee giant reported a 6% year-on-year increase in China net revenue to $831.6 million for the three months ended Sept. 28. Comparable same-store sales, a standard industry metric, was just 2%, but improved to 7% for the quarter ended Dec. 28. 

Starbucks did not share China net revenue for the latest quarter. The company expects to close a deal in the spring to sell 60% of its China business to Boyu Capital, while retaining a 40% stake. When the deal was announced in November, Starbucks said it values its China business at $13 billion, including future licensing fees. 

Luckin, whose shares still trade over-the-counter in the U.S., had a market value of around $10.46 billion as of Thursday. 

Late last year, Luckin's CEO Jinyi Guo hinted at plans to re-list the company in the U.S. He did not specify a date. Founded in late 2017, the company achieved a $2.9 billion valuation just 18 months later and listed on the Nasdaq in May 2019. But about a year later, Luckin said it discovered much of its 2019 sales were fabricated, leading to the stock's delisting.

The Chinese coffee company continued to operate many of its stores — and kept its name and logo.

Luckin also jumped to attract consumers through a slew of timely collaborations — with premium spirits brand Moutai, the Minions cartoon characters and the hit video game Black Myth: Wukong just days after it surged in popularity.

What sets Luckin apart has been its ability to build a robust pool of private user traffic through its smartphone ordering app, said Mingchao Xiao, founder of Zhimeng Trends Consulting. Rather than placing orders with a counter clerk, Luckin customers select and pay for drinks directly through an app.

China's coffee market is still in a period of rapid change, Xiao said. He added that young consumers today are more willing to try different experiences, and seek emotional fulfillment, which can be met through cross-industry brand collaborations.

Like many Chinese companies, Luckin is also ramping up its global expansion.

Last summer, Luckin opened its first U.S. stores in New York City. It debuted its 10th store in the city on Feb. 6.

Luckin also has 68 stores in Singapore after it entered the market nearly three years ago, and 45 jointly operated locations in Malaysia.

When the U.S. sneezes, it seems Europe may not catch its cold in the same way it used to. 

The Stoxx 600 is sitting close to record highs after recording its 7th positive week in eight, despite the tech-led devastation around it. 

It's been a different story across the pond. In a recent note, Deutsche Bank has started drawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, and says the recent sell-off in AI and software-exposed stocks is showing no signs of easing. This week's declines leave the S&P 500 down almost 30 percent from their October 2025 peaks. 

Broader European stocks meanwhile, are looking more resilient.   

The spike in volatility comes at a sensitive time for the corporate world, with earnings season in full swing. The big-tech releases from last week did little to calm nerves stateside, while some of Europe's biggest names are preparing to report this week. 

CNBC's Carolin Roth will breakdown UniCredit's results in Milan on Monday, speaking with the Italian bank's CEO Andrea Orcel. The lender remains a key M&A player in Europe, with its minority stakes in Commerzbank and Greece's Alpha Bank returning around 20 percent returns on investment, according to the bank. 

In Frankfurt, we will hear from rival Commerzbank's CEO Bettina Orlopp on Wednesday, who told Squawk Box during the World Economic Forum in Davos in January that a deal with UniCredit is ""not sensible"" given the German bank's high valuation. 

Shares in financial stocks across Europe had a rollercoaster week, ending the week in the red. 

Next week will also bring a fresh set of numbers from some of the biggest players in the European healthcare space, namely pharma giant AstraZeneca and Philips. The Dutch medical tech company will hope to continue a positive performance streak from the launch of new AI tools, while AstraZeneca is turning towards China in the hope that it can access this market for weight-loss drugs. However, there will be some warning bells following the sharp sell-off in Novo Nordisk's shares, after the Danish pharmaceutical rival disappointed investors with its sales projections. Executives from both Philips and AstraZeneca will join Squawk Box Europe on Tuesday. 

For more on why AstraZeneca poured billions into China ahead of the trading debut of its shares in New York, read this.

On Thursday, CNBC's Charlotte Reed will be in Paris to speak with the CEO of L'Oreal, Nicolas Hieronimus, as the French beauty giant reports numbers. Last quarter, a recovery in both of its biggest markets, the U.S. and China failed to support the stock, which fell on a narrow sales miss. L'Oreal could also be on the acquisition hunt, after raising 3 billion euros for M&A financing towards the end of last year. The comapny recently doubled its stake in Swiss dermatology group Galderma, in a deal that is expected to close this quarter. 

Monday: UniCredit

Tuesday: Philips, AstraZeneca, Barclays, Ferrari

Oops, something went wrong

Key Takeaways

The “Bitcoin to $0” narrative is surging again.

Market sentiment has flipped decisively bearish.

Bullish credibility is weakening.

“Every time I ask a Bitcoin true believer to explain why they think it has any long-term value… I come away more certain that Bitcoin has no long-term value, and a floor price of zero.”

That was the verdict this week from Buck Sexton, a popular American talk show host, in a post that quickly spread across social media as Bitcoin's price fell over 20% in the past week.

Sexton's comments are the latest example of a narrative that has resurfaced fiercely during the most recent downturn.

Bitcoin's critics have always argued that its value depends on the next buyer paying more than the last — and that in a true confidence crisis, there is no “fundamental floor.”

That is the logic behind the zero-dollar thesis.

What has changed is that, amid another sharp downturn, the idea is no longer confined to a handful of gold advocates or ideological skeptics.

It now seems to be being repeated by media figures and even previously bullish traders, at a moment when the crypto market is already battling extreme fear.

But why has the idea that Bitcoin could ultimately be worth nothing become so popular?

Bitcoin has faced existential critiques since its earliest days, but the latest downturn seems to have spread further, fueling long-time skeptics and also those outside of the crypto space.

Richard Farr, chief market strategist and partner at Pivotus Partners, claimed on Wednesday that his firm's Bitcoin target is “$0.0.”

Farr argued that Bitcoin has failed as a hedge against the dollar, remains heavily correlated to the Nasdaq, and has not gained traction as a medium of exchange.

He also pointed to concerns around mining economics and energy consumption.

“The miners (who are the network) are bleeding cash,” Farr wrote, adding: “We think it's a zero.”

Peter Schiff, one of Bitcoin's most vocal opponents, argued that gold's value is rooted in physical utility, while Bitcoin's value is based purely on belief.

“Bitcoin's value is purely subjective, as it has no utility beyond belief,” Schiff said in a post.

Schiff also argued that Bitcoin offers limited practical function beyond storage and transfer.

“Bitcoin can't do anything. That's the problem,” he said. “Yes you can store and transfer your Bitcoin, but beyond that you can't do anything with it.”

Sexton, in a separate post, argued that the anger he receives from Bitcoin supporters is itself part of the problem.

He wrote that if Bitcoin's long-term case is truly as strong as believers claim, they should welcome price declines as an opportunity to buy.

“The people who get mad at me over this just prove the point further,” Sexton wrote.

Traders pushed back on this theory, with many explaining that Bitcoin's investor base is not a single bloc of patient “true believers.”

In 2026, a significant portion of demand comes from institutional investors involved in ETFs and leveraged long positions, meaning steep drops can quickly turn into an unwind rather than a discount-buying spree.

As a result, price weakness tends to feed anxiety of even the most “bullish” participants.

Another reason for the zero dollar theory taking such large prominence at the moment can also come down to social media sentiment.

Blockchain analytics firm Santiment said sentiment across the crypto market has turned decisively negative over the past week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum absorbing the brunt of trader pessimism following a steep downswing.

“Sentiment has turned extremely bearish toward Bitcoin and Ethereum following crypto's major downswing this past week,” the firm said.

The shift in sentiment has been reflected in widely watched market gauges.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell sharply recently, sliding from “Fear” to “Extreme Fear” and dropping to a reading of 14 — its lowest level in roughly six weeks.

As prices slide dramatically, the renewed talk of Bitcoin going to zero has been amplified by a collapse in confidence around the industry's most aggressive bullish forecasts.

In recent weeks, missed predictions from Fundstrat's Tom Lee and bullish comments from Michael Saylor have drawn skeptics to disown long-term forecasts.

On Jan. 30, 2026, a viral post from a social media figure branding himself as the “world's smartest man” declared: “Bitcoin about to pump hard.”

Instead, Bitcoin fell sharply the same day, dropping roughly 6% and triggering more than $1.6 billion in liquidations as leveraged long positions were wiped out.

In the days that followed, crypto traders pushed increased criticism at some of the industry's most loudest bullish voices — especially those with a rich history of missed forecasts.

Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, became a focal point after he floated a scenario in a recent video in which Bitcoin could reach $10 million “tomorrow” if the world reached consensus on its value.

“If people in the rest of the world knew what I know, and they understood and they agreed with me, Bitcoin would go to $10 million tomorrow,” Saylor said.

Critics mocked the logic of Saylor's remarks, with one user comparing it to speculative manias of the past, writing: “At least tulips are beautiful.”

Others argued Saylor was ignoring structural pressures facing the Bitcoin ecosystem, including miner profitability, energy costs, and increasing centralization.

Despite the renewed wave of zero-dollar rhetoric, many investors say the selloff has not erased Bitcoin's long-term thesis — particularly among institutions and large asset managers.

In its “Big Ideas 2026” report released in January, ARK Invest said it expects the global cryptocurrency market to expand at a 61% compound annual growth rate to around $28 trillion by 2030.

ARK projected that Bitcoin could represent roughly 70% of that total market, and said the token's price could reach between about $950,000 and $1 million.

“Bitcoin is maturing as the leader of a new institutional asset class,” the firm said.

ARK's chief executive Cathie Wood also argued that improving macroeconomic conditions could provide support for Bitcoin and broader risk assets.

Wood said the economy has already absorbed a “rolling recession” across housing, manufacturing, small businesses and consumer sentiment, reducing the risk of a deeper downturn.

She also pointed to tax-related tailwinds, including refunds and corporate incentives, as potential drivers of a stronger investment cycle.

Finally, Wood said easing inflation, lower interest rates and deregulation could create a more supportive environment for financial markets.

Despite the renewed zero-dollar rhetoric, many market participants say Bitcoin collapsing to nothing remains improbable.

Major institutional allocators and long-term custodial vehicles now hold Bitcoin, unlike in earlier boom-and-bust cycles.

A collapse to zero would likely require not just a prolonged bear market, but a complete breakdown in custody, legality and long-term belief.

Much more than a simple crash.

Oops, something went wrong

Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, suggested that institutional dealer hedging is exacerbating the recent downward pressure on Bitcoin prices.

In a February 7 post on X, Hayes pointed to structured financial products linked to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).

He argued that falling Bitcoin prices force financial institutions that issue these notes to sell the underlying asset to manage their risk exposure. Finance professionals refer to this process as delta hedging.

Hayes explained that these structured notes are often issued by major banks to provide institutional clients with exposure to Bitcoin. The products include specific risk-management features, such as principal-protection levels.

When market prices dip low enough to trigger these pre-determined levels, dealers must aggressively adjust their positions to remain risk-neutral.

While this mechanism is standard in traditional equity markets, Hayes noted that it creates a feedback loop in the crypto sector where selling begets further selling. This dynamic effectively accelerates the asset's price collapse.

“I will be compiling a complete list of all issued notes by the banks to better understand trigger points that could cause rapid price rises and falls,” Hayes wrote.

However, Hayes clarified that he does not believe there is a ""secret plot"" to crash the market.

He emphasized that these derivatives do not inherently instigate market movements but rather amplify volatility in both upward and downward directions.

He added that the market should be grateful for the absence of bailouts, which would allow leverage to unwind naturally.

The commentary comes amidst a turbulent week for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin recently recorded its worst single-day performance since the collapse of the FTX exchange in November 2022.

Meanwhile, other market participants have attributed the decline to broader macroeconomic headwinds and even quantum computing security concerns.

For context, Pantera Capital General Partner Franklin Bi pinned the volatility on a distressed non-crypto entity rather than a typical industry fund.

Bi posited that the seller was likely a large, Asia-based player. This entity reportedly evaded early detection by market watchers because it lacks deep ties to crypto-native counterparties.

According to Bi's theory, the entity was likely engaged in leveraged market-making strategies on Binance, funded by the Japanese yen carry trade.

These two analysis underscores a fundamental shift in the digital asset sector.

It shows that complex trading strategies, rather than retail sentiment alone, increasingly influence Bitcoin's price action.

Citron Research founder Andrew Left renewed his aggressive short campaign against Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) on Thursday, dismissing the company's complex financial architecture as ""nonsense"" after the firm reported a staggering $12.4 billion fourth-quarter loss.

The critique marks a sharp reversal for Left, who previously praised the company before it “completely detached from BTC fundamentals.”

The dispute centers on Executive Chairman Michael Saylor's recent descriptions of his firm as a “Bitcoin treasury company” powered by a “Bitcoin reactor.” Left fired back via social media, mocking the terminology used to justify the company's massive debt-fueled acquisition strategy.

“I admit when I heard it I thought maybe I am ignorant and don't understand, turns out the more jargon the more nonsense,” Left stated. The “nonsense” Left refers to includes Saylor's claims that Strategy can “strip the volatility” off fixed-income securities and generate a “BTC spread” of up to 90%.

While Saylor previously bragged, “We're making 500 million a day,” the reality of early 2026 has proven more somber. Strategy's fourth-quarter results showed a net loss of $12.6 billion, largely due to a $17.5 billion surge in unrealized losses on its digital assets.

Adding weight to the bearish sentiment, “Big Short” investor Michael Burry warned this week that Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) descent could trigger a “collateral death spiral.”

Burry noted that Strategy could find capital markets “essentially closed” if prices fall another 10%, potentially leaving the firm billions in the red.

Burry specifically highlighted the risk to the broader ecosystem: ""At $50,000, miners would go bankrupt and be forced to sell their BTC reserves, tokenized metals futures would collapse into a black hole with no buyer"".

Despite the volatility, Saylor remains defiant, telling investors on the post-earnings call that “the actions by big finance, the actions by the big banks and the actions by the financial regulators are the fundamentals.”

However, with Strategy's average cost per Bitcoin sitting at $76,052 and the current market price hovering near $64,000, the firm's “leveraged Bitcoin reactor” is facing its most severe stress test to date.

Shares of Strategy have declined by 29.59% year-to-date and 71.50% over the last six months. It was also down by 68.22% over the year. On Thursday, the stock fell 17.12% to $106.99 apiece following its earnings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","3 Reasons Investors Need to Invest in Bitcoin","https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/08/3-reasons-investors-need-to-invest-in-bitcoin/","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 05:30:00 GMT","

There are quite a few reasons this asset is worth owning.





Bitcoin (BTC +2.05%) is an asset that's worth holding in your portfolio, even if it's just a small holding. And for many investors, a larger allocation of up to 5% of the portfolio's total value is justifiable. It simply offers too much to pass up.

Let's take a look at three reasons everyone should own some of it.

Image source: Getty Images.

Inflation is an underrated drag on the value of many portfolios. Bitcoin is an asset whose supply can't increase, meaning that, over the very long run, its purchasing power can't be diluted by supply factors.

There can only ever be 21 million Bitcoins, and close to 20 million have already been mined.

But calling it an inflation hedge without qualifiers is sloppy. History (as well as academic research on the topic) suggests that the coin's inflation-hedging behavior depends on the economy; when people's purchasing power is broadly under pressure, Bitcoin does often act as a hedge, but when the economy is in a state of overt crisis, such as during the early pandemic, it doesn't hedge effectively at all compared to assets like gold. 

So if you buy it, treat it like insurance against long-run fiat currency debasement rather than a month-to-month protector of purchasing power. It's a bit too volatile to fill that role.

Within crypto itself, Bitcoin remains the reference asset that everything else revolves around. It's worth $1.4 trillion of the entire sector's market cap of $2.5 trillion.

In most crypto market cycles, when Bitcoin rises or falls sharply, the rest of the sector tends to follow with a bit of lag and a lot of extra drama for holders. Therefore, owning a small amount of Bitcoin is an easy way to get broad exposure to crypto, as you don't need to go through the hassle (or take on the extreme risks) of picking a basket of smaller altcoins to accomplish the same goal.

Today, it's easier than ever to buy and hold Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), so you don't even need to spin up a crypto wallet of your own to hold it.

That also means there's less friction for companies that want to hold crypto assets. And given that more than 4 million Bitcoins are currently held by countries, companies, ETFs, and other large and conservative holders, an ever-increasing proportion of the supply is being held in the coffers of those who are least likely to sell on a whim. 

So if you buy and hold Bitcoin, you'll get upside from the growing number of businesses that are also buying and holding it. Assuming they prefer to hold on to their coins to benefit from their increasing scarcity over time, its price will be biased upward, and if you hold any, you'll benefit, too.

Ethereum's recent sell-off has weighed heavily on sentiment after the price fell below the $2,000 level and pulled much of the altcoin market lower alongside it. The move has caused sweeping fear and caution among Ethereum traders. However, some analysts are of the notion that a bullish upside will roll in soon. 

In a post shared on X, crypto analyst ChainHub said the current conditions point more toward exhaustion, and after massive downside comes massive upside.

ETHBTC Structure Holds

ChainHub emphasized that the ETH/BTC pair is still technically valid and has not seen any structural invalidation despite the recent price crash. Although Ethereum's price fell much lower than many expected during the crash, it is not going to keep falling forever. He also pointed to fear levels that are now climbing to extremes rarely seen, noting that such environments always tend to appear near major turning points. “After massive fear and massive downside comes massive upside,” the analyst said.

On Ethereum itself, ChainHub acknowledged that losing the $2,000 handle was important, but he highlighted the next major area of interest near $1,700. This zone is technically consistent with a broader corrective structure, and it is possible that Ethereum might not even fall that far before it rebounds. However, even if Ethereum does fall to $1,700, price action reaching this area means Ethereum is finally at a region where buyers may begin to reassert control.

He linked this outlook to Bitcoin's recent behavior. Bitcoin's rejection at $72,000 opened the door to a retest of the upper portion of its summer 2024 demand range, which stretches from around $59,000 down to $49,000. 

ChainHub pointed out that this is the first significant interaction with that demand area since 2025, with Fibonacci alignment clustering around $57,000 to $58,000. This increases the odds that Bitcoin is in the process of forming a base, and that is where it establishes a bottom.

Altcoins Touching Meaningful Demand Levels

ChainHub also noted that Ethereum is not alone in testing critical levels. Several major altcoins, including Solana and XRP, have moved into important demand zones. Many of these altcoins have revisited August 2024 lows or filled prior wicks, areas that have not yet been broken on an initial attempt.

Solana, for instance, has broken below $100 for the first time since January 2024 and recently traded at a low of $75. As noted by ChainHub, this move saw Solana finally touch meaningful demand for the first time in 2 years.

Dogecoin, Cardano, and Avalanche have also all filled the downward wicks on October 10, restoring balance and touching the August 2024 low. Although there is still the possibility for limited downside, the expectation is that the market begins forming a range and then starts building bullish momentum in the coming weeks.

Solana may be outperforming Ethereum across key metrics right now. 

Nothing in the market right now is just “coincidence.”

Volatility is hitting risk assets hard. After three days of outflows pushed major top-cap assets below key support, the market saw a sharp single-day move of over 10% on 06 February. This caught many off guard.

In this kind of environment, investors are naturally cautious, relying more on data than luck. So, when Solana [SOL] starts outpacing Ethereum [ETH] across key metrics, it clearly signals more than just short-term momentum.

Source: DeFiLlama

One example is perpetuals trading volume. Solana recently posted $12.1 billion compared to Ethereum's $9.6 billion, roughly 26% higher. Higher perps volume here implies stronger trading activity and market interest.

Backing this momentum, Solana's institutional FUD is relatively lighter, with ETFs posting about $18 million in net outflows over the past three days, compared to Ethereum's $180 million over the same period. 

Meanwhile, on the DeFi side, the divergence is clear – Solana's stablecoin market is up 8.5% this week, while Ethereum's is nearly flat at 0.2%. The former has been fueled by $2.75 billion in USDC minted on Solana over the same period.

Together, these metrics may be evidence of growing activity rotating towards SOL. However, as AMBCrypto noted previously, in the current market, nothing happens by chance. So, could this rotation be a sign of something deeper?

For Ethereum, the past few days have been rough. 

As LookOnChain flagged, Trend Research has nearly sold all of its ETH. They withdrew 792,532 ETH at $3,267, and later deposited 772,865 ETH back to Binance at $2,326, resulting in a total loss of roughly $747 million.

In this context, the SOL/ETH ratio trading in a tight range near the support starts to make sense. At the time of writing, the ratio was around 0.04 – A level that sparked a 35% rebound during the Q3 2025 rally. Hence, this could allude to similar upside potential.

Source: TradingView (SOL/ETH)

Couple this with Solana outperforming Ethereum across key metrics and the ongoing FUD around ETH as big players offload their holdings, and the setup looks like a potential rotation of capital towards SOL.

In short, the SOL/ETH ratio chopping sideways isn't just a “coincidence.”

Instead, if this trend holds over the next few days, it could set the stage for another SOL rally. This could involve rotational flows, strong on-chain activity, and market sentiment, making Solana a relatively attractive risk-reward play.

If there's one thing that WallStreetBets loves to do, it's marvel at losses that other community members sustain when making outsized bets on stocks and crypto. But at a recent conference in Miami, not many degen traders were left standing by the conference's last day.

At [REDACTED] Live, a conference devoted to the most reckless traders in finance, dealers stood ready at blackjack and roulette tables, waiting for conference-goers to try their luck. They didn't have much to do, and all the while, Bitcoin and Ethereum plunged alongside precious metals, beginning a crypto market slide that would get much worse in the following days.

Despite a last-minute name change, the conference formerly known as WallStreetBets Live was still slated to host names like Jordan Belfort, the former stock broker who inspired a generation of so-called degens through his life's portrayal in the “The Wolf of Wall Street.”

Ultimately, the character that became synonymous with charismatic persuasion and unapologetic greed in finance couldn't attend. Martin Shkreli's scheduled session also fell through, leaving attendees without the controversial investor known as the “Pharma Bro.”

In some ways, the conference's lack of attendees showed how niche a fandom toward the bombastic Reddit community had grown—and crypto by extension. Some attendees recalled how hard it was to navigate the floors of the Miami Beach Convention Center in 2021, when a Bitcoin conference made it feel like the industry was tipping into the mainstream.

By many measures, digital assets have become legitimized in traditional finance since then. But following a series of booms and busts in the cryptosphere—from NFTs to meme coins—digital assets haven't been embraced broadly by the general public yet.

An event organizer told Decrypt that around 1,300 attendees registered for [REDACTED] Live.

A few speakers that attended the conference portrayed a shift from speculation to tokenization, allowing people to access real-world assets as digital tokens in a way that dovetails with the community serving as a digital breeding ground for meme stocks.

Bitget CEO Gracy Chen said onstage that meme coins lack “fundamental value.” And although the Seychelles-based exchange has listed several popular meme coins, including Pepe and President Donald Trump's official token, she said that doesn't mean she's generally bullish on them.

Mezcal, the pseudonymous founder of token launchpad America.Fun, structured his presentation for the platform that lets users create and trade meme coins around the notion that Solana's so-called trenches are dead. But by charging users $200 per meme coin created, he argued that his platform is less likely to support a mix of low-quality tokens on similar platforms that essentially amount to spam.

According to its documentation, America.Fun solely uses World Liberty Financial's USD1 stablecoin, and trading fees collected by the platform may be used for buybacks of WLFI, the token offered by the DeFi project backed by President Donald Trump and his sons. 

Ogle, a pseudonymous advisor to World Liberty Financial, is an advisor to America.Fun as well, Mezcal told Decrypt. Mezcal added that it was his first time visiting the country.

Although enthusiasm toward assets that trade on vibes and bravado associated with WallStreetBets had dimmed, as far as the conference went, the same “us vs. them” mentally that defined the GameStop saga of 2021 still smoldered.

At least, that was from the perspective of WallStreetBets founder Jamie Rogozinski. Instead of waging war against Wall Street short sellers, he told Decrypt that his camp was now at odds with Reddit after it forced the event to change its name through a cease and desist letter.

With days to go, the conference went from “WallStreetBets Live” to “[REDACTED] Live.” Throughout the venue, all mentions of the name were patched over with new banners.

U.S. courts have ruled that Reddit owns the trademark to WallStreetBets, and in December, the Supreme Court declined to review a lawsuit brought by Rogozinski, per Bloomberg Law.

That didn't prevent Rogozinski from rolling with the title for months. And he argued that Reddit is mostly concerned with how WallStreetBets has expanded beyond its platform.

“There is a resounding demand for this collective mindset to be able to unite,” he said. “I believe that the reason why Reddit is doing what they are doing specifically against me is because they are afraid that precisely that is what's happening.”

A Reddit spokesperson told Decrypt that it “occasionally trademarks the names of certain communities to protect the creativity and interests of the users.”

Martin Masser, head of growth at TON Foundation, told Decrypt the outcome of Rogozinski's legal tussle with Reddit sets a “dangerous precedent” because it creates the perception that people aren't entitled the ownership of their data or the social media communities they create. 

He pondered whether YouTube could try to assert ownership over Mr. Beast's media empire, for example. The sentiment was shared by AlphaTON Capital CEO and whistleblower Brittany Kaiser, who previously wrote amicus briefs to support Rogozinski's case.

“A lot of the people here used to be considered rebels, deviants, or people doing something that was niche,” she told Decrypt, noting that she had just returned stateside from her 12th trip to Davos, Switzerland. “Now what we're doing is not niche at all.”

For South Florida locals like Alex Hochberger, founder and CEO of crypto startup Web3 Enabler, [REDACTED] Live felt like a mixed bag.

The bar was open at 9 a.m., as it should be at any Miami gathering, he told Decrypt. But there was something about an “anti-establishment conference [being] priced for people with corporate credit cards” that didn't fully sit right with him.

Hochberger argued that general admission should've been free. Still, a couple dozen people had shown up early on the conference's final day to watch former White House Communications Director and SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci kick things off.

Like Belfort and Shkreli, Scaramucci wasn't able to make an appearance in-person. Still, he offered wisdom via a pre-recorded video, including that “you got to get up.”

As Scaramucci recalled his life's biggest knockdowns—including losing his prominent White House gig after just 11 days—a brief clip of Sam Bankman-Fried shuffling in handcuffs played, depicting the former FTX CEO's arrest in 2022. 

When FTX still had the naming rights to the arena where the Miami Heat play professional basketball, he was celebrated as someone that could turn the city into a major crypto hub. His conviction for orchestrating a massive, multibillion-dollar fraud would later stain the industry.

Scaramucci conceded that he let Bankman-Fried, who received a 25-year prison sentence for orchestrating a multi-billion fraud, acquire a 30% stake in Skybridge weeks before its collapse. But Scaramucci noted that setbacks can be temporary.

“It looked really bad for us,” he said. “But if you operate with integrity, even when you're having a bad situation happen to you, you can survive—and there's plenty of opportunities.”

Ethereum's recent sell-off has weighed heavily on sentiment after the price fell below the $2,000 level and pulled much of the altcoin market lower alongside it. The move has caused sweeping fear and caution among Ethereum traders. However, some analysts are of the notion that a bullish upside will roll in soon. 

In a post shared on X, crypto analyst ChainHub said the current conditions point more toward exhaustion, and after massive downside comes massive upside.

ETHBTC Structure Holds

ChainHub emphasized that the ETH/BTC pair is still technically valid and has not seen any structural invalidation despite the recent price crash. Although Ethereum's price fell much lower than many expected during the crash, it is not going to keep falling forever. He also pointed to fear levels that are now climbing to extremes rarely seen, noting that such environments always tend to appear near major turning points. “After massive fear and massive downside comes massive upside,” the analyst said.

On Ethereum itself, ChainHub acknowledged that losing the $2,000 handle was important, but he highlighted the next major area of interest near $1,700. This zone is technically consistent with a broader corrective structure, and it is possible that Ethereum might not even fall that far before it rebounds. However, even if Ethereum does fall to $1,700, price action reaching this area means Ethereum is finally at a region where buyers may begin to reassert control.

He linked this outlook to Bitcoin's recent behavior. Bitcoin's rejection at $72,000 opened the door to a retest of the upper portion of its summer 2024 demand range, which stretches from around $59,000 down to $49,000. 

ChainHub pointed out that this is the first significant interaction with that demand area since 2025, with Fibonacci alignment clustering around $57,000 to $58,000. This increases the odds that Bitcoin is in the process of forming a base, and that is where it establishes a bottom.

Altcoins Touching Meaningful Demand Levels

ChainHub also noted that Ethereum is not alone in testing critical levels. Several major altcoins, including Solana and XRP, have moved into important demand zones. Many of these altcoins have revisited August 2024 lows or filled prior wicks, areas that have not yet been broken on an initial attempt.

Solana, for instance, has broken below $100 for the first time since January 2024 and recently traded at a low of $75. As noted by ChainHub, this move saw Solana finally touch meaningful demand for the first time in 2 years.

Dogecoin, Cardano, and Avalanche have also all filled the downward wicks on October 10, restoring balance and touching the August 2024 low. Although there is still the possibility for limited downside, the expectation is that the market begins forming a range and then starts building bullish momentum in the coming weeks.

As Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed $70,000 on the wee hours of Sunday, the crypto market saw a slight relief after a volatile week.

In the broader altcoin market, Bitcoin's relief has rolled over to five altcoins that have emerged as top gainers over the weekend. Aster (ASTER), Sun (SUN), Nexo (NEXO), UNUS SED LEO (LEO), and Hedera (HBAR) were among the strongest performers over the past 24 hours, according to market data.

Aster (ASTER) led the group, while several other tokens posted mid-single-digit gains as buyers stepped back in.

Aster (ASTER) was trading at $0.63, up 13.8% over the past 24 hours and 14.8% over the past week. The token carried a market capitalization of about $1.54 billion, making it the top performer among major gainers during the weekend rebound. On Stockwits, the retail sentiment around ASTER moved from ‘bearish' to ‘extremely bullish' territory, as chatter levels around it improved from ‘low' to ‘extremely high' over the past day.

Sun (SUN) also moved higher, though with a more measured pace. The token traded near $0.01, rising 7.8% over the past day and about 0.7% over the past week. Unlike Aster's sharp breakout, Sun's move appeared to track the broader market recovery rather than a single surge in momentum. On Stockwits, the retail sentiment around SUN remained in the ‘neutral' territory, as chatter levels improved from ‘high' to ‘extremely high' over the past day.

Nexo (NEXO) rebounded over the weekend as buying returned after a weak start to the week. The token traded near $0.81, up 6.1% over the past 24 hours, though it remained slightly lower on a seven-day basis. Nexo's market capitalization stood at around $816 million. On Stockwits, retail sentiment around the token remained in the ‘neutral' territory, as the chatter levels around it remained ‘high' over the past day.

UNUS SED LEO (LEO) also moved higher, though it lagged some smaller tokens. LEO traded at about $8.27, rising nearly 6.1% over the past day. Despite the rebound, the token remained down by 4.4% over the past week, reflecting continued pressure after last week's selloff.

With a market capitalization of roughly $7.7 billion. On Stockwits, retail sentiment around the LEO remained in the ‘neutral' territory, as the chatter levels around it remained ‘high' over the past day.

Finally, Hedera (HBAR) tracked the broader recovery as market prices steadied. The token was trading around $0.09, up just over 6.1% in the past 24 hours and extending modest gains over the week. Hedera's market capitalization was about $4.0 billion, and its performance reflected a steady rebound. On Stockwits, retail sentiment around HBAR remained in the ‘bullish' territory, as the chatter levels around it remained ‘high' over the past day.

Many market analysts, like Raoul Pal, cited a recovery in the U.S. M2 money supply, which is currently close to $22.7 trillion and up roughly 5% year over year, as well as a weaker dollar index at 97.8, as macro indicators that Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to overall liquidity conditions. According to the CEO of Real Vision, these patterns indicate that Bitcoin should be trading closer to $140,000 by now.

Venture capitalist Tim Draper echoed the bullish outlook, reiterating long-term price targets that extend well beyond near-term cycles. Draper, who acquired 30,000 BTC at the U.S. Marshals auction in 2014, said Bitcoin could reach $250,000 in the near term, then climb toward $1 million and, eventually, $10 million as fiat currencies lose purchasing power over time.

In the aftermath of a huge decline, the cryptocurrency market rose 5.57%  in the last 24 hours, raising its entire market value to $2.35 trillion. Although the mood is still staying in the extreme fear zone, it sees cautious optimism, as the crypto Fear & Greed Index increased to 8 from its previous low of 5, and Bitcoin's rebound to $70,000 from recent lows drove increases in the overall market.

The whole market's upward trend is majorly driven by Bitcoin's upswing, which contributes more than half, around 58.2%, to the overall crypto market cap. As it is currently trading at 67,978 with 4.74% high in the past 24 hours, before this, it had reached $71,605 earlier today. But, it is down by 19% over a week and 25% down over a month, which signals the broader downturn. 

As per the Coinglass liquidation data, over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin short positions were liquidated for around $282 million, while longs were liquidated for $118 million, and the open interest has increased by around 2%. 

Analysing the exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows, as per SoSoValue data,  Bitcoin ETFs recorded $330.67 million in inflows as of February 6, which shows the positive momentum of the institutional side, even though the spot price declined yesterday.

With that, seeing the 4-hour chart, the Bitcoin Relative Strength Index is currently at 40, suggesting the asset is approaching oversold territory but not yet fully reached that zone. The Bitcoin's  MACD line remains above the signal line, indicating that bearish momentum may be easing. If it maintains the same momentum, it can attempt to retest resistance near $72,000 in the near term. But if it falls again, selling pressure can quickly reverse the recent gains. 

Followed by Bitcoin rise, Ethereum saw 6.85% up in the past 24 hours, trading at $2,016, then, XRP surged by 9%, and Solana is trading up with 7.05%. While other major cryptos like Cardano and Chainlink all of them rebound, as of writing.According to CoinMarketCap, yesterday saw a large number of top losers, while gainers were few or none, but today,  only three cryptocurrencies in the top 100 are recording losses, as of writing. While LEO led the top gainers with a 17.39% surge, followed by NIGHT and LIT tokens, this highlights the return of positive momentum among altcoins.

While other major cryptos like Cardano and Chainlink all of them rebound, as of writing.According to CoinMarketCap, yesterday saw a large number of top losers, while gainers were few or none, but today,  only three cryptocurrencies in the top 100 are recording losses, as of writing. While LEO led the top gainers with a 17.39% surge, followed by NIGHT and LIT tokens, this highlights the return of positive momentum among altcoins.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Counting the waves of tech industry BS from blockchain to AI","https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/08/waves_of_tech_bs/","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 12:33:45 GMT","

Opinion The real opponent of digital sovereignty is ""enterprise IT"" marketing, according to one Red Hat engineer who ranted entertainingly about the repeated waves of bullshit the industry hype cycle emits.

During a coffee break at this year's CentOS Connect conference, The Reg FOSS desk paused for a chat with a developer who was surprised but happy to find us there. We won't name them – we're sure that they'd prefer to keep their job rather than enjoy a moment of fame – but we much enjoyed their pithy summary of how IT has faced repeated waves of corporate bullshit for at least 15 years now, and how they keenly and enthusiastically anticipate a large-scale financial collapse bursting the AI bubble.

This vulture has been working in the tech field for some 38 years now, and the Linux developer we spoke with has been in the business nearly as long. We both agreed that the late 20th century – broadly, the period from the early 1990s onward for a decade or so – had mostly been one of fairly steady improvement. Then, they suggested, roughly following the 2008 credit crunch, we've had some 15 years of bullshit in tech.

They called out about half a dozen particular instances of what they considered to be bullshit technology. We were too busy laughing sympathetically to whip out a laptop to make notes, but as best as we can recall the sequence, they were:

Adding back some of the rather invective-laden commentary…

Containers: Sure, yes, they work, they are handy for testing. But they aren't a deployment method. You shouldn't need them. Anything that you can run in a container, you can just run on the bare metal, and if you're not competent enough to get – and keep – that working, then you probably aren't competent enough to deploy a container either.

Kubernetes: If you don't need containers, then you don't need another vastly more complicated tool to deploy those containers. The chances are, you are not a vast multinational that must be able to withstand ten million potential new customers visiting your site all at once. It won't happen, so you won't lose any of that imaginary business.

(This is sometimes known as the Use One Big Server approach, and in our humble opinion, it has great merit.)

The cloud: Nebulous by name and by nature. Who thought it was smart to take all your company's important data and hand it to some internet rando – probably the lowest bidder – trusting them to store the crown jewels, keep them safe, and never ever peek at them. If that sounds reasonable to you, maybe you should try selling homeopathy.

(This can be summarized as There Is No Cloud – There's Just Somebody Else's Computer, and was being spelled out in clear language in 2015.)

Anything ""as a service"" – it doesn't matter what: Infrastructure as a service – if you need servers, buy servers, or rent your own private servers. Nobody else will ever care as much about your servers as you will. Platform as a Service – now you don't even get servers, just OS instances. That's even worse. Software as a Service? Now you don't even know what the server is, or where it is, or what it's running; you don't get software, and you don't even know what data you have or how it's stored – you're paying for access to your own stuff.

(The problems with this entire concept arguably go back to Peter Deutsch's Fallacies of Network Computing some 30 years ago.)

The blockchain, and anything built on the blockchain: the world's slowest and most-distributed database. Cryptocurrencies? Hashcash on the blockchain. NFTs – URL shorteners on the blockchain, only they're longer rather than shorter. Worthless. Web3? Get ripped off, as a service.

Which brings us round to ""generative AI"" or, as we prefer to term them, large language models, powered by the transformer algorithm. If The Financial Times can explain how it works to a banker in a couple of thousand words and a few minutes, it can't be that complicated or hard to understand, and it isn't. It's predictive text turned up to 11. It can't even count. As Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, caustically observed:

The ""i"" in ""LLM"" stands for intelligence.

(This vulture laid out some of his case against it when Gentoo and NetBSD banned LLM bot slop in 2024.)

Honestly, we can't fault any of this reasoning. We've looked into the chronological sequence of the waves of marketing drivel, and it's not quite how we expected. Although the earliest mention of Salesforce.com we can find on The Reg is from 2002, when we called it ""relatively new,"" it was founded in 1999. Perhaps the first mass SaaS offering to the general public was Google's Gmail in 2004.

Cloud computing in the sense of automatic creation and deployment of VMs arguably dates to Amazon taking Amazon Web Services live in 2002.

Whoever ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" is or was, their paper [PDF] introducing Bitcoin was published in 2008, although it didn't come to The Reg's attention until 2011.

2008 was also the year that the first version of LXC (you can still find version 0.1.0 on the downloads page) was released. Docker debuted in 2013 but your humble correspondent had predicted that Linux containers would be the Next Big Thing a couple of years earlier, back in 2011. We reckon we called it.

Kubernetes first appeared in 2014, although Google had been running ""Borg"" internally since around 2008. We still harbor a cynical suspicion that Mountain View threw it over the wall for no other reason than to distract the Penguinisti and keep them busy.

So in chronological order, those are:

1999: SaaS

2002: Cloud computing goes mainstream with AWS

2004: SaaS reaches the general public

2008: LXC frees application containers from FreeBSD's Jail and brings them to Linux… and Bitcoin delivers full industrial-scale mass-production of the ancient scam of the pyramid scheme

2014: Kubernetes is loosed upon an all-too-willing tech world

2022: ChatGPT opens to the public, or as The Reg calls it, another AI to fill the world with kinda-true stuff

All right, yes, rather more than 15 years. ""A century of tech BS"" seems a bit over the top when it's only 2026, but it certainly feels that long.

Obviously there are many more potential candidates, but we thought this was an excellent top six. Some of the other contenders are more niche, from the eternally awful Jira to the project managers' religion of Agile. Which of your bêtes noires did we miss? ®

In the fast-moving world of tech, one thing never changes: waves of massive hype followed by harsh reality checks. From the promise of  revolutionizing everything to the current frenzy around AI, the industry has a habit of selling dreams that often turn into nightmares. If you've been in tech for a while, you've seen it all – clouds that aren't clouds, services that lock you in, and coins that vanish overnight. This post dives deep into these , focusing on blockchain and crypto, and asks: when will the next bubble burst?

Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, tech felt like steady progress. Hardware got faster, software got better, and open-source tools like Linux powered real innovation. But after the 2008 financial crash, things shifted. Companies needed quick wins to boost stock prices, and marketers stepped in with big promises.

A seasoned Linux developer at a recent conference nailed it: we've had over 15 years of non-stop hype cycles. These aren't just buzzwords – they cost businesses billions and waste developers' time. Let's count the major waves, starting with the early ones and building to blockchain and beyond.

It kicked off around 2002 with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The pitch? Spin up virtual machines on demand, no hardware hassles. Sounds great for startups. But dig deeper: the cloud is just servers in a data center run by a big company. You're trusting them with your data, paying premium prices, and locked into their ecosystem.

Remember: There is no cloud. It's somebody else's computer. For most businesses, buying your own servers or using private hosting works fine and cheaper.

By 2004, SaaS exploded with tools like Gmail and early Salesforce. Why install software when you can subscribe? Fast-forward, and it's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) – all promising freedom from IT headaches.

Reality? You're renting access to your own data. No control over servers, updates, or storage. One outage, and your business stops. Classic pitfalls from network computing fallacies: assume networks are fast and reliable? They're not.

Lesson: If you care about your data, manage it yourself.

Containers started in 2008 with LXC on Linux, popularized by Docker in 2013. Handy for testing apps in isolation. Kubernetes (K8s) followed in 2014 – a tool to orchestrate containers at massive scale.

For 99% of companies? Total overkill. If you can run it in a container, run it on bare metal. Need K8s? Only if you're handling millions of users spiking at once – which won't happen for most.

Pro Tip: One Big Server approach often wins for simplicity and cost.

Enter 2008: Bitcoin's whitepaper drops amid the financial crisis. Satoshi Nakamoto promised decentralized money. By 2011, crypto hit mainstream radar. Then NFTs in 2021, Web3 everywhere.

Blockchain truth: It's a slow, energy-guzzling database that's super distributed – great for theory, terrible for speed. Need transactions per second? Visa laughs at it.

In blockchain and crypto, hype met reality hard. Early adopters made bank, but retail investors got wrecked. Real use? Supply chain tracking, maybe. But DeFi scams and 90% of tokens hitting zero? Pure BS.

SEO keywords like ‘blockchain myths' and ‘crypto bubble burst' trend because people are waking up. Invest wisely: DYOR, avoid FOMO.

2022: ChatGPT blows up. LLMs promise to code, write, create. But it's transformer models predicting next words – glorified autocomplete. Can't count past 10 reliably, hallucinates facts.

Blockchain parallel? Both sold as world-changers but deliver meh. AI needs massive data centers (hello, cloud hypocrisy), and outputs are ‘kinda true' slop. Gentoo and NetBSD banned it for code – smart move.

Coming crash? Billions poured in, returns? Hype deflation ahead.

That's 20+ years of cycles. Feels like a century.

1. Question the hype: If it sounds too good, test it yourself.

2. Own your stack: Bare metal > containers > cloud for most.

3. Crypto caveat: Blockchain shines in niches like secure ledgers, but avoid shiny tokens. Stick to Bitcoin or Ethereum for stores of value.

4. AI future: Tools, not magic. Use it for drafts, not decisions.

Other villains? Jira hell, Agile worship. What's your top tech BS?

The tech industry thrives on BS, but savvy pros see through it. In blockchain and crypto, we've learned: decentralization is hard, scams are easy. AI? Same story incoming. Build real value, ignore the noise.

Oops, something went wrong

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Senate Banking Committee he “would not be surprised” if China was building digital assets potentially backed by gold rather than the yuan, given China's large sandbox in Hong Kong.

Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) asked Bessent directly whether China is using digital assets and blockchain to build an alternative to American financial dominance.

Bessent responded, saying, ""We don't know that for sure. There are lots of rumors that China may be developing digital assets backed by something other than the RMB, perhaps gold-based. We haven't seen that.""

He added a caveat: “But they have a very large sandbox in Hong Kong. And HKMA is actively traveling the world looking at different mechanisms. So I would not be surprised.”

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority serves as China's testing ground for financial innovations without directly implicating mainland authorities.

By operating through Hong Kong, China can experiment with digital asset structures while maintaining plausible deniability.

A gold-backed digital asset would compete directly with the dollar's reserve currency status by offering a stable store of value not subject to U.S. monetary policy or sanctions.

This differs from China's existing digital yuan, which remains tied to the RMB.

Bessent's comments come as gold recently hit record highs above $5,600 per ounce before a sharp correction, and as crypto markets struggle with regulatory uncertainty in the U.S.

Bessent addressed other topics beyond Chinese digital assets, saying Iranian leaders are moving money out “like crazy”—a sign that “the end may be near” for the current regime. He described it as “the rats are leaving the ship.”

Bessent also emphasized the importance of passing the Clarity Act, acknowledging that applying capital gains tax on cryptocurrency is complex.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has urged the cryptocurrency industry to resist drifting away from its foundational practices, arguing that innovation in blockchain technology should build on established principles rather than discard them in pursuit of short-term trends.

Buterin's remarks were shared in a recent public appearance and later highlighted by the X account Coinvo. Following verification of the source, hokanews cited the comments as part of its ongoing coverage of thought leadership and long-term vision within the digital asset industry.

The comments come amid rapid experimentation across the crypto sector, where new financial products, scaling solutions, and governance models are being introduced at an accelerating pace.

In his remarks, Buterin emphasized that many of crypto's early design choices were responses to real-world problems, not outdated habits that should be abandoned lightly. He warned that moving too far away from those practices risks undermining the values that originally made blockchain technology distinct.

According to Buterin, decentralization, transparency, and simplicity remain core strengths of crypto systems. While technological progress is essential, he argued that innovation should refine these concepts rather than replace them with opaque or overly centralized alternatives.

His comments appeared aimed at a growing segment of the industry focused on rapid product deployment and financialization.

Buterin clarified that “old habits” does not mean resisting change or rejecting new technology. Instead, he referred to long-standing practices such as open-source development, cautious protocol upgrades, and community-driven governance.

These practices, he said, help ensure that blockchain systems remain resilient and trustworthy over time.

Industry analysts note that these principles often slow development but reduce the risk of catastrophic failure, an increasingly relevant concern as blockchains handle larger volumes of value.

The crypto industry has evolved dramatically over the past decade, expanding from simple peer-to-peer transactions into complex ecosystems involving decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and institutional-grade infrastructure.

With that growth has come pressure to optimize for speed, scale, and profit. Buterin cautioned that such pressures can lead to shortcuts that compromise long-term security and decentralization.

His remarks reflect a broader debate within the industry about whether crypto should prioritize mainstream adoption or remain focused on its original mission.

The comments gained wider visibility after Coinvo shared excerpts of Buterin's remarks on X, prompting discussion across developer forums and social media platforms. After confirming the context of the statements, hokanews referenced them while presenting the remarks as part of an ongoing philosophical discussion rather than a critique of specific projects.

Mainstream coverage has similarly framed Buterin's message as guidance rather than condemnation.

Ethereum's own development path reflects the tension Buterin described. The network has undergone major upgrades to improve scalability and efficiency, while maintaining an emphasis on decentralization and open participation.

Supporters argue that Ethereum's cautious, research-driven approach has allowed it to adapt without sacrificing its core values. Critics contend that the pace of change has left room for faster-moving competitors.

Buterin's comments suggest that he views deliberate progress as a feature rather than a flaw.

For developers, Buterin's message reinforces the importance of thoughtful design and long-term thinking. For investors, it serves as a reminder that not all innovation is inherently positive, particularly when it prioritizes rapid gains over system integrity.

Market analysts note that projects grounded in foundational principles often demonstrate greater resilience during market downturns.

Buterin's remarks are part of a wider conversation about maturity in the crypto sector. As blockchain technology moves closer to mainstream finance, the question of how much to change and how much to preserve has become increasingly central.

The debate is likely to intensify as regulatory scrutiny grows and institutional participation increases.

While Buterin did not call for specific policy changes or technical rollbacks, his comments add weight to ongoing discussions about responsible innovation. Developers and community leaders are expected to continue debating how best to balance experimentation with stability.

                Cuts are being made across multiple teams during evaluation cycles that continue through late February.            

Share

Block, the fintech firm behind payment tools and blockchain-based financial services led by Bitcoin advocate Jack Dorsey, is carrying out performance-based job cuts that could affect up to 10% of its workforce, Bloomberg reported Sunday, citing people with knowledge of the situation.

Block has over 10,000 employees, according to the company's LinkedIn page. The potential reductions could affect over 1,000 employees by late February, continuing a restructuring effort that began in 2024 under Dorsey.

In March 2025, the company eliminated 931 jobs, cutting about 8% of its workforce of approximately 11,300 employees.

Dorsey said at the time that the moves were intended to sharpen focus and accountability, and were not positioned as cost-cutting measures tied to financial trouble or AI-driven automation.

Block, which holds approximately 8,800 BTC valued at around $625 million as of the latest update, is working to integrate Cash App with Square and advance other projects, including its Bitcoin mining operation, Proto, and its artificial intelligence tool, Goose.

Job reductions are taking place across the technology sector, where companies are tying workforce adjustments to performance review cycles to streamline operations amid economic headwinds.

Crypto exchange Gemini is reducing its headcount by 25% as it restructures its business during the crypto market slump. The exchange is also exiting the UK, EU, and Australian markets as it refocuses on a smaller set of core priorities.

Another major exchange, OKX, has trimmed its global institutional workforce as part of an internal reorganization to refine its operations.

Jakarta, Pintu News – The Crypto Clarity Act is a draft policy andregulatory framework that aims to provideregulatory clarity for the cryptocurrency industry. This initiative emerged as a response to the regulatory uncertainty that has overshadowed industry players, investors, and blockchain technology developers. With the Crypto Clarity Act, regulators are expected to have clearer boundaries of authority, while market participants gain legal certainty.

The Crypto Clarity Act refers to a legislative effort that regulates the classification of crypto assets more strictly. The main focus is to distinguish whether a crypto asset is categorized as a security, commodity, or another form of digital asset. This clarity of classification is a key foundation for supervision and enforcement.

Through this approach, the Crypto Clarity Act seeks to reduce overlapping authority between regulatory agencies. It also aims to create consistent standards so that technological innovation is not hampered by legal uncertainty.

Over the years, the crypto industry has faced regulatory uncertainty that has led to legal disputes and market confusion. Many crypto projects struggled to determine legal obligations due to differing interpretations between regulators. This has resulted in slow institutional adoption and increased legal risks.

The Crypto Clarity Act was born in response to the market's need for certainty. With a clearer legal framework, regulators can focus on consumer protection, while industry players can operate with more stable regulatory certainty.

The main objective of the Crypto Clarity Act is to provide a clear legal definition of crypto assets. The regulation is designed to ensure that supervision is proportionate to the characteristics of each digital asset. Thus, a one-size-fits-all approach can be avoided.

In addition, the Crypto Clarity Act aims to encourage innovation in blockchain technology. Legal certainty is expected to create a more conducive investment climate, while increasing the competitiveness of the crypto industry at the global level.

The scope of the Crypto Clarity Act covers the classification of digital assets, token issuance governance, as well as crypto trading supervision mechanisms. This regulation also touches on aspects of consumer protection and information transparency. Businesses are required to provide adequate disclosure regarding the risks and structure of crypto products.

Additionally, the Crypto Clarity Act has the potential to regulate the relationship between developers, crypto exchanges, and investors. With this framework, the responsibilities of each party become more defined and measurable.

For investors, the Crypto Clarity Act provides stronger legal protection. Clarity on the status of crypto assets helps investors understand the risks and rights attached to each instrument. This is important for making more rational investment decisions.

With clearer regulations, the potential for gray and fraudulent practices is expected to be reduced. Investors also gain greater transparency regarding the obligations of market participants and applicable compliance standards.

For the industry, the Crypto Clarity Act has the potential to reduce the legal risks that have hindered the development of crypto products. Companies can design business models that are compliant with regulations from the start. This encourages healthier and more sustainable ecosystem growth.

On the other hand, overly strict regulation remains a concern. Therefore, the balance between supervision and innovation is a key factor in the implementation of the Crypto Clarity Act.

While it aims to provide clarity, the Crypto Clarity Act also faces challenges. One of them is the fast-evolving dynamics of crypto technology that is difficult to accommodate by static regulations. The risk of over-regulation can stifle innovation if not implemented adaptively.

In addition, differences in regulatory approaches between countries can create fragmentation of the global market. These challenges demand international coordination to keep crypto regulation relevant and effective.

The Crypto Clarity Act is an important step towards legal certainty in the cryptocurrency industry. With clearer definitions and classifications, it has the potential to enhance investor protection while encouraging innovation. Its success will largely depend on the balance between oversight and regulatory flexibility.

In the long run, the Crypto Clarity Act could lay the foundation for a more mature and sustainable crypto industry. For market participants, understanding these regulations is key to adapting to the increasingly structured crypto landscape.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Ancient bones reveal chilling victory rituals after Europe's earliest wars","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208011012.htm","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 07:09:26 GMT","

A study published in the journal Science Advances is reshaping how researchers understand early human violence. By closely examining the people who died in what may be one of Europe's earliest known victory celebrations, scientists are challenging long-held assumptions about prehistoric warfare and its purpose.

The research, titled 'Multi-isotope biographies and identities of victims of martial victory celebrations in Neolithic Europe', was published in Science Advances and co-authored by Dr. Teresa Fernández-Crespo and Professor Rick Schulting. Using advanced multi-isotope analysis, the team reconstructed the life histories of individuals buried in mass graves in Alsace in northeastern France. These remains date back roughly 4300-4150 BCE.

Violence With Meaning, Not Chaos

The findings question the idea that prehistoric violence was random or driven only by survival. Instead, the evidence points to deliberate actions tied to social and symbolic goals.

Archaeological excavations at the Achenheim and Bergheim sites revealed disturbing patterns. Researchers uncovered complete skeletons bearing signs of extreme and repeated violence, alongside pits filled with severed left upper limbs. This combination of excessive force and body part removal did not resemble known Neolithic massacres or executions. Rather than unplanned brutality, the researchers suggest these deaths were part of organized rituals carried out after conflict, meant to shame defeated enemies and strengthen group identity.

Chemical Clues From Ancient Bones

To better understand who these individuals were, scientists compared isotopic markers in the victims' bones and teeth with those of people buried in standard graves. These chemical signatures reflect diet, movement, and physical stress over a lifetime.

The analysis showed clear differences. The victims had distinct dietary patterns and signs of greater mobility and physiological strain, indicating they were likely outsiders rather than members of the local community.

A Two-Tiered Ritual After Battle

The isotope data revealed another striking contrast. The severed limbs, thought to have been taken from warriors killed in combat, matched local isotopic values. In contrast, the individuals whose full skeletons showed signs of torture appeared to come from more distant regions.

This split supports the idea of a structured, two-level ritual. Local enemies killed in fighting were dismembered, with limbs brought back as trophies. Others, likely captives taken from afar, were subjected to violent executions. Researchers interpret this as a form of Neolithic political theatre designed to send a powerful message.

Professor Schulting said: ""These findings speak to a deeply embedded social practice -one that used violence not just as warfare, but as spectacle, memory, and assertion of dominance.""

Rethinking Violence in Early Societies

By uncovering the social and cultural roles violence played during the Neolithic period, the study adds an important new perspective to human history. It suggests that war and ritual were closely linked, with acts of violence serving long-lasting symbolic purposes that shaped early societies.

The research was supported by a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions individual grant from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, awarded to Dr. Fernández-Crespo. The project brought together researchers from multiple institutions, including the CNRS, Aix Marseille University, and Minist Culture, LAMPEA in Aix-en-Provence, France; the School of Archaeology at the University of Oxford, UK; the Department of Chemistry at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium; the Department of Archaeology and New Technologies at Arkikus, Spain; ANTEA-Archéologie, France; the University of Strasbourg, France; UMR 7044 Archimède, University of Strasbourg, France; and Inrap Grand Est, France.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists found a gut compound that helps protect the liver","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208011028.htm","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 07:20:10 GMT","

Children whose mothers eat a diet high in fat and sugar during pregnancy and breastfeeding face a greater chance of developing fatty liver disease later in life. New findings from the University of Oklahoma suggest that this risk may be lowered. In the study, pregnant and nursing mice given a naturally occurring compound made by healthy gut bacteria had offspring with much lower rates of fatty liver disease as they grew older.

The compound studied is called indole. It is produced by beneficial gut bacteria when they break down tryptophan, an amino acid found in foods like turkey and nuts. The results add to growing research focused on preventing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This form of fatty liver disease affects both adults and children, but it often advances more quickly in children and is closely linked to diabetes.

""The prevalence of MASLD in children is about 30% in those with obesity and about 10% in children without obesity,"" said Jed Friedman, Ph.D., director of the OU Health Harold Hamm Diabetes Center and professor of biochemistry and physiology in the OU College of Medicine. ""Unfortunately, the risk is higher if a mother is obese or consumes a poor diet. The disease in children is silent and typically isn't discovered until a parent seeks help for their child for liver-related symptoms.""

Testing the Role of the Microbiome

Friedman led the study alongside Karen Jonscher, Ph.D., associate professor of biochemistry and physiology in the OU College of Medicine. Their work was published in the journal eBioMedicine. The team set out to explore whether gut bacteria, known together as the microbiome, influence how fatty liver disease develops.

To investigate this, female mice were fed a high-fat, high-sugar (Western-style) diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. Some of the mice also received indole. After they were weaned, the offspring were placed on a standard diet and later switched to a Western-style diet to encourage the development of fatty liver disease.

""Because offspring inherit their microbiome from their mother, a poor maternal diet can shape the infant's microbiome in harmful ways,"" Friedman said.

Healthier Livers and Lasting Benefits

Offspring born to mothers that received indole showed multiple health advantages. They had healthier livers, gained less weight, maintained lower blood sugar levels, and developed smaller fat cells, even after being exposed to an unhealthy diet later in life. The researchers also observed activation of a protective gut pathway involving the acyl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).

The study found no increase in harmful liver fats known as long-chain ceramides, while levels of beneficial very long-chain ceramides rose. In a key experiment, gut bacteria from the protected offspring were transferred to other mice that had not received indole. Those mice also experienced less liver damage, reinforcing the idea that the microbiome itself plays a central protective role.

Implications for Preventing Childhood MASLD

Although the research was conducted in animals and cannot yet be applied directly to humans, the findings point to new strategies for reducing the growing impact of MASLD through early prevention.

At present, weight loss is the only effective treatment option for pediatric MASLD once the disease is established, and there are no approved medications. ""Anything we can do to improve the mother's microbiome may help prevent the development of MASLD in the offspring,"" Jonscher said. ""That would be far better than trying to reverse the disease once it has already progressed.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New drug resets the body clock and cuts jet lag recovery nearly in half","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208011026.htm","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 12:18:14 GMT","

A research team led by scientists from several Japanese institutions has identified a compound called Mic-628 that directly influences the body's internal timing system. The group included Emeritus Professor Tei H. (Kanazawa University), Associate Professor Takahata Y. (Osaka University), Professor Numano R. (Toyohashi University of Technology), and Associate Professor Uriu K. (Institute of Science Tokyo). Their experiments showed that Mic-628 specifically activates Per1, a core gene that helps regulate daily biological rhythms in mammals.

The researchers found that Mic-628 works by attaching to CRY1, a protein that normally suppresses clock gene activity. This interaction encourages the formation of a larger molecular complex known as CLOCK-BMAL1-CRY1-Mic-628. Once formed, this complex switches on Per1 by acting at a specific DNA site called a ""dual E-box."" Through this mechanism, Mic-628 shifts the timing of both the brain's master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and clocks in other organs, including the lungs. Notably, these clock shifts occurred together and did not depend on when the compound was given.

Faster Recovery From Jet Lag in Animal Tests

To test real-world relevance, the team used a mouse model designed to mimic jet lag by advancing the light-dark cycle by six hours (6-hour light-dark phase advance). Mice that received a single oral dose of Mic-628 adjusted to the new schedule much faster, taking four days instead of seven. Further mathematical analysis showed that this steady, one-direction shift forward is driven by a built-in feedback loop involving the PER1 protein, which helps stabilize the clock change.

Why Advancing the Clock Is So Difficult

Adjusting to earlier schedules, such as traveling east across time zones or working night shifts, requires the body clock to move forward. This type of adjustment is typically slower and more stressful for the body than delaying the clock. Common approaches like light exposure or melatonin depend heavily on precise timing and often produce uneven results. Because Mic-628 consistently advances the clock regardless of dosing time, it offers a fundamentally different drug-based approach to circadian reset.

What Comes Next for Mic-628

The researchers plan to continue studying Mic-628 to better understand its safety and effectiveness in additional animal studies and in humans. Since the compound reliably moves the body clock forward through a clearly defined biological pathway, it could become a model ""smart drug"" for addressing jet lag, sleep problems linked to shift work, and other disorders caused by circadian misalignment.

The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS).

Should conservation efforts focus on protecting one iconic species if that protection may harm another, especially in landscapes still recovering from human activity? This question lies at the center of a growing conservation challenge at Monte Leon National Park on Argentina's Patagonian coast.

The situation highlights the complexity of restoring ecosystems that were altered for decades and are now undergoing rapid change.

Pumas Return and Penguins Face a New Threat

After cattle ranching ended in southern Argentina in 1990, pumas (Puma concolor) gradually began reclaiming parts of their historic range. Their return brought them into contact with Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) for the first time in modern history.

The penguins had previously moved from offshore islands to the mainland, taking advantage of the absence of land predators. With few defenses against large carnivores, they became easy prey once pumas arrived. Until recently, however, scientists did not know how much this new interaction was affecting penguin population numbers.

Long Term Monitoring in Monte Leon National Park

Since the park was established in 2004, penguin colonies have been closely observed by researchers from the Centro de Investigaciones de Puerto Deseado of the Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia Austral, working alongside rangers from Monte Leon National Park. Over a four year period (2007-2010), they recorded penguin carcasses linked to puma attacks.

For the latest study, the team partnered with researchers from Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) to analyze the data and assess the long term implications for the colony.

Thousands of Penguins Killed

Using carcass counts, the researchers estimated that more than 7,000 adult penguins were killed during the four year study period. Many of the birds were only partially eaten or not eaten at all, indicating that the killings were not solely for food. This figure represents about 7.6% of the adult population (around 93,000 individuals).

Lead author Melisa Lera, a postgraduate student at WildCRU, Oxford University said: ""The number of carcasses showing signs of predation we found in the colony is overwhelming, and the fact that they were left uneaten means pumas were killing more penguins than they required for food. This is consistent with what ecologists describe as 'surplus killing'. It is comparable to what is seen in domestic cats when prey are abundant and/or vulnerable: ease of capture can lead to cats hunting more birds, even when they do not end up actually eating them. We needed to understand if the penguin colony's persistence could be threatened due to this behavior.""

What the Population Models Revealed

When the research team applied population models to the data, the results showed that puma predation alone was unlikely to drive the Monte Leon penguin colony to extinction. Instead, the models pointed to other factors as far more influential, particularly breeding success and the survival of juvenile penguins.

Extinction was projected only in hypothetical scenarios where very low juvenile survival occurred, with around 20% failing to reach adulthood, combined with extremely poor reproduction limited to a maximum of one chick per pair. In those cases, high levels of puma predation made the situation worse but were not the primary cause.

Study co-author Dr. Jorgelina Marino (WildCRU, Oxford University) said: ""This study captures an emerging conservation challenge, where recovering carnivores are encountering novel prey. Understanding how these dietary shifts affect both predators and prey is essential to inform conservation.""

Climate Change and Broader Pressures

Because breeding success and juvenile mortality play such a critical role in population stability, the researchers emphasize the need to better understand how environmental conditions affect penguin reproduction. Factors such as nutrient availability, food supply, and temperature, known to be influenced by climate change, may strongly shape the colony's future.

Similar challenges are emerging elsewhere as land predators move into coastal environments. Mainland seabird colonies and other coastal species may become increasingly vulnerable. For example, non-native feral hogs are now major predators of loggerhead sea turtle eggs along the Georgia coast, USA, while coyotes in eastern North America are expanding onto coastal barrier islands, altering those ecosystems.

Why Continued Monitoring Matters

The authors stress that ongoing monitoring is essential to detect early signs of population decline and to guide management decisions before serious ecological damage occurs. At Monte Leon National Park, authorities continue to closely track both puma and penguin populations as they navigate the complex consequences of ecosystem recovery.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This weird deep-sea creature was named by thousands of people online","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260207232242.htm","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 04:34:10 GMT","

The Senckenberg Ocean Species Alliance (SOSA), working with scientific publisher Pensoft Publishers and well known science YouTuber Ze Frank, invited the public to help name a newly identified deep-sea chiton (a type of marine mollusk). The official scientific description of the species was published today in the open-access Biodiversity Data Journal.

More than 8,000 name ideas were submitted through social media. After reviewing the entries, the research team selected the name Ferreiraella populi. The species name populi is a Latin singular noun in the genitive case meaning ""of the people."" Interestingly, 11 different participants independently suggested the same name during the online naming effort.

From a YouTube Video to a Scientific Name

The public naming campaign began after Ze Frank featured the rare deep-sea chiton from the genus Ferreiraella in an episode of his ""True Facts"" YouTube series.

The animal has eight armored shell plates and an iron-clad radula (a rasping tongue). Near its tail, it also hosts a small group of worms that feed on its excrement. Viewers were invited to submit a proposed scientific name along with a justification. In just one week, the response exceeded 8,000 suggestions.

""We were overwhelmed by the response and the massive number of creative name suggestions!"" says Prof. Dr. Julia Sigwart, co-chair of SOSA at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt. ""The name we chose, Ferreiraella populi, translates to ""of the people."" ""

Several other names stood out during the selection process. One was Ferreiraella stellacadens, meaning ""Shooting star chiton,"" inspired by the animal's distinctive aesthete pattern and the way it quickly gained attention. Another suggestion was Fereiraella ohmu, referencing a chiton-like creature from a Studio Ghibli film and offering a nod to Japan, where the species was discovered.

A Rare Specialist of the Deep Ocean

The species was first found in 2024 in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench at a depth of 5,500 meters. Ferreiraella populi belongs to the genus Ferreiraella, a rare group of mollusks known for living only on sunken wood in the deep sea.

The discovery adds to a lineage of chitons that has received little scientific attention so far and supports growing evidence that deep-sea wood-fall ecosystems host highly specialized communities that remain largely unknown, explains Sigwart.

Chitons are often described as resembling a mix between a snail and a beetle. Unlike most mollusks that have a single shell, chitons have eight separate shell plates (valves). This structure allows them to curl into a protective ball or cling tightly to uneven surfaces such as deep-sea wood-falls. Chitons live in environments ranging from shallow coastal waters and coral reefs to the deep ocean, where some species survive at depths of up to 7,000 meters in complete darkness.

How Scientific Names Are Created

When a new species is discovered, it is given a formal scientific name as part of its original taxonomic description. This system follows Carl Linnaeus's principle of binomial nomenclature and includes two parts: the genus name (the first part, capitalized and italicized) and the specific epithet (the second part, lowercase and italicized). The name is assigned by the author(s) who publish the first scientific description and must follow international rules such as the ICZN (zoology) or the ICN (botany). Each name must be unique, latinized, and previously unused. Specific epithets are often based on physical traits, locations, mythology, or people honored for their contributions.

Why Speed Matters for Ocean Biodiversity

Ferreiraella populi highlights the vast biodiversity of the oceans, much of which remains unexplored. Many species disappear before scientists even realize they exist, a problem that is especially pronounced among marine invertebrates, says Sigwart.

""It can often take ten, if not twenty years, for a new species to be studied, scientifically described, named, and published. At SOSA, we have therefore made it our mission to streamline these processes while simultaneously engaging the public with these fascinating creatures. Finding a name for the chiton together on social media is a wonderful opportunity to do just that! Ferreiraella populi has now been described and given a scientific name only two years after its discovery. This is crucial for the conservation of marine diversity, especially in light of the threats it faces such as deep-sea mining!""

Amazon

Pocket

Walmart

Whether sitting in class, a meeting, or an interview, I've never been fond of taking notes, and I'm far from alone. Not only does the process of scribbling something down cause me to miss what was said immediately after, but I also suffer from awful handwriting, meaning that I can rarely read the notes anyway. Recording interviews has long been a solution, but transcribing interviews is another step (with extra cost) that can leave you with thousands of words of material to sift through, much of it irrelevant.

AI notetakers—massively popular at CES 2026—have emerged to offer a new way of making IRL notetaking easier and faster, putting the power of AI into (or at least adjacent to) a portable device that evokes the microcassette recorder of yesteryear. As with all things AI, the jury's out on whether AI notetakers are actually useful or whether bypassing the intellectual rigor of writing down what people say is going to make us all even stupider, but at the very least I've found them to be a convenient way to capture the main points of a conversation—and helpful at keeping a record of discussions and meetings I might otherwise have promptly forgotten.

For this guide, I evaluated six AI notetaker products, using them in person and online for meetings, interviews, and conference calls. In addition to “daily life” use cases, I tested each one by recording the same prerecorded presentation to use as a control. (I won't identify it by name to mitigate the risk of companies attempting to tune their AI models for that specific dialog.) Throughout all of this testing, I considered the accuracy of transcriptions (and translations, where appropriate), the quality of insights generated, overall speed, additional features, and value for the money.

How Do AI Notetakers Work?

The concept behind most AI notetakers is simple: Drop the device on the table between you and your interview subject or in earshot of your professor, and fire it up with the touch of a button. An onboard microphone records the discussion, transcribing all that is said on the fly, then beams it to a companion app on your smartphone. When the discussion is finished, the transcription is uploaded to the cloud for AI processing, where it is crunched and then turned into outline form, often featuring AI-selected quotes from the discussion, action items, and other takeaways designed to make sense out of lengthy, meandering meetings.

Can I Just Use an App?

You don't need a physical device to AI-ify your notes. Services like Bluedot and Otter.ai, ubiquitous on Zoom calls these days, can do the job from your phone or computer. On Pixel phones, Google's Recorder app has been offering transcription and summarizations for several years, and Apple's Voice Memos app can do the same if you have an iPhone with Apple Intelligence.

But physical gadgets are handy for complicated in-person situations where the speaker is far away or difficult to hear, or where you want to use your phone for something else besides its voice recorder function. Just drop a notetaker where it's convenient, and the rest is taken care of. You don't even need to stick around for the discussion—and some notetakers can even translate foreign languages. More advanced systems like the $1,600 Vibe Bot are also available for conference room settings, working as a sort of permanent stenographer for business meetings.

What's the Deal With Subscription Plans?

Every AI notetaker pushes a paid subscription plan, and while all offer a stripped-down, no-cost tier, the utility of these plans varies greatly. Expect to pay $15 to $30 per month for unlimited AI insights on top of the hardware price.

Comulytic

Amazon

Comulytic

I had low expectations for the rather generic Comulytic Note Pro, but it surprised me as not only the most useful all-around notetaker on available but also the cheapest after you consider the cost of a premium subscription.

The slim device, at 28 grams, is small enough to fit in a wallet or attach unobtrusively with the included magnetic ring to the back of your handset (note: it requires a special USB dongle to charge). The 64 GB of storage space and a 45-hour battery life aren't massive, but both should be more than enough to handle a full week of interviews without offloading or recharging, all processed through OpenAI's GPT-5 and Google's Gemini. The small LCD is helpful (and rare in this market), indicating when you're recording and offering a recording duration. This makes it a lot more foolproof than other notetakers, which offer nothing more than a colored LED to tell you if it's on.

The Note Pro supports 113 languages—sort of. It will record in a foreign tongue and offer a verbatim transcript in the native language, but insights and summaries are delivered in your language of choice. It's not a full solution if you need a complete, direct translation, but if you just need the gist of a foreign news story or speech, Comulytic can uniquely handle it.

The proof is in the quality of the abstracts and insights provided. Of all the devices I tested, Comulytic's summaries were the most insightful and least rambling (though better than its transcripts), effectively picking out the most relevant portions of interviews and pulling the best quotes from my conversations (perhaps too many at times). It was also the only device to correctly transcribe a punny product nickname mentioned in passing in one interview, indicating that a more sophisticated language model may be behind the scenes.

Comulytic isn't perfect. It doesn't transcribe in real time, it's one of the slowest products at completing analyses, and I never got its “fast transfer” mode working, which meant all recordings had to be sent to my phone via a pokey Bluetooth connection, but these are minor dings against an otherwise solid solution. Best of all, for a limited time, the company includes a generous three months of premium service at no charge. Even if you don't want to subscribe, the free plan, which offers three “deep dives” and 10 abstracts a month, is better than nothing.

Subscription costs $15 per month or $120 per year

Open Vision Engineering

Pocket

The eponymous Pocket is quite a bit fatter and heavier (56 grams) than Comultyic, but it offers 128 GB of storage space (new models are down to 64 GB), a beefier battery with a whopping 96 hours of recording time, and the inclusion of Claude, Gemini, and GPT-5 models. And it can attach magnetically to your phone out of the box (assuming you have a MagSafe or Qi2 smartphone). A tiny switch on the side lets you shift into a mode that can record phone calls without being on speakerphone.

Pocket's transcriptions and insights are very good and easy to understand, and they get completed quickly (in a bit more than half the time as Comulytic). But I did sometimes struggle with the lone button on the Pocket, as presses sometimes wouldn't register or would cause me to tap it twice, which culminated in several two-second-long recordings being stored on the device. The tiny LED, which turns yellow when recording, is also tough to see.

Pocket's free plan isn't bad—offering unlimited transcriptions, summaries, and mind maps—but it limits history to 14 days and throttles exporting to one recording at a time. It didn't help that all exported documents I made were corrupted if I opted to save them in Word format. The luxe Pocket Pro plan offers a lot of refinements (and unlimited history), but it's costly considering what you get. Ultimately, it was the larger size of the Pocket hardware that made me less likely to reach for it over the Comulytic. When attached to my phone, it made my handset much too bulky.

Subscription costs $20 per month or $200 per year

InnAIO

Walmart

InnAIO

The InnAIO T10 is a language translator first, AI notetaker second, but if you want a device that can (haltingly) straddle both worlds, it's worth a look—despite some obvious immaturity in its current incarnation.

The 33-gram disc (no stated storage capacity, 15 hours of battery life) can live on its own or slap onto the back of your phone, and with the press of a button, it's ready to transcribe conversations in your native tongue and in the language of your choice. Note that translations can't be disabled. Even if you only want an English transcription, you'll have to pick a second language for real-time recordings.

The good news is the T10 is evolving—a promised offline mode is now operational, though the AI model may be dated, using GPT-4.1 instead of the more common GPT-5. It remains frustrating to use, and the free plan offers only 120 minutes per month of real-time translation and meeting minutes. (Unlimited use is pricey at $25 per month or $179 a year.) It's an imperfect product, but if you have a frequent need for transcriptions of multilingual communications, it's arguably the best on the market.

Subscription costs $25 per month or $179 per year

OSO AI

Amazon

OSO AI

OSO's AI Earbuds are a quirky concept, designed to transcribe what you hear—including phone calls—rather than specifically recording the broader world. It's a small but important distinction. Technically, you can remove your earbuds and drop them in the middle of the conference table to record what happens in a room, but people will look at you funny.

The best use case for these earbuds is to leave them in place, doing double duty as standard Bluetooth headphones and switching into AI recording mode when needed. The GPT-5-powered feature is, however, rather limited, offering just four hours of battery life and lacking physical controls for recording, requiring the use of the OSO app to fire up the system. Transcriptions are not displayed in real time, and—critically—the app is very finicky. Any hiccup (like closing the app) aborted recording in my testing. The unit can record in 100-some languages, but it can't translate from one to another.

OSO's free plan is very limited (with 300 minutes per month of transcription), and even its $16 per month or $120 a year subscription only gets you 2,000 minutes per month instead of the usual unlimited service. Its summaries are fine, but far from in-depth. Expect to see some competition in this space, and soon.

Subscription costs $16 per month or $120 per year

This is a nascent category that's growing. Here are others we've tested, but we'll also be keeping an eye on upcoming new hardware from companies like Omi, Boya, Mobvoi, and SwitchBot.

Plaud NotePin S for $179: The 18-gram NotePin S is the smallest and most versatile notetaker on the market (wear it as a lanyard, even!), but it's expensive given that it offers just 300 minutes of transcription unless you pay for its costly subscription. Transcriptions are not displayed in real time, though their eventual analysis is solid. It's a handy little device with multi-language support (though not translation), 20 hours of battery life, and 64 GB of internal storage—but it's just too costly in comparison to the field to recommend. A subscription will set you back $30 per month or $240 per year.

HiDock P1 for $169: HiDock's P1 is a big (91 grams) device that's closer to an old-school tape recorder than a modern AI notetaker, complete with a bevy of onboard controls. It's far more complicated than other notetakers, though its microphone is powerful, and its analyses are fast (at least when connected to a PC). It's best for desktop (computer-attached) scenarios rather than on-the-go usage; I couldn't get it working with my phone. The subscription is $229 per year.

Watch geeks love the phrase “GADA watch,” meaning a “go anywhere, do anything” timepiece—something both feature-rich and eye-catching, a rugged and durable watch that doesn't compromise on style.

Here at WIRED, a related question has been floating around the Gear desk for some time. What's better, one all-rounder premium watch, or a varied collection garnered for exactly the same cash outlay as that piece that also covers every scenario?

Determined to answer this horological conundrum once and for all, WIRED set the same budget for each approach to find out. Let's start with our pick for a GADA timepiece.

Watch fans can never really be satisfied with one watch. We love to pretend that there is a “holy grail” or “exit watch” out there, but really there's no end to this journey. However, we also love to argue, and one permanent conversation starter is the concept of a one-and-done.

It can't be too high-end, for the true GADA watch must be something you can wear on a hike and in the pool, as well as to a formal function. Ideally, you'd be able to wear it around a major city without fear of theft, which rules out pretty much any Rolex, but we'd still want it to be something you can take pride in among horological snobs.

One and done: WIRED's current “go anywhere, do anything” timepiece is this Tudor Black Bay GMT.

Some brands make this kind of sweet spot their comfort zone. We considered the Nomos Glashütte Club Sport Worldtimer, or a Longines Spirit Zulu Time—both brands with an eye on value, a reputation for quality, and an all-around approach to design that's not too polarizing.

Inevitably, your one watch isn't going to be able to do everything. It won't be as chic as a Cartier or pack a pedigree chronograph. But rest assured it'll have you covered 95 percent of the time.

In the end, we settled on a Tudor Black Bay GMT, on a fabric or leather strap. For $4,550, you get a 41-mm stainless-steel piece with 200 meters of water resistance, a COSC-certified chronometer movement that's actually descended from the last generation of Rolex GMT movements, and a design that's smart enough to blend into most formal outfits, even though it's most at home in more casual settings.

With the dual time zone functionality it's a useful travel tool, too, and Tudor's brand name and build quality mean it's respected by watch geeks the world over.

That's what we're up against. Can we build a dream team to rival the Tudor for the same cash outlay?

First stop on our shopping list is a dive watch: something that can at least match the Black Bay's 200-meter water resistance rating and speak to its underpinnings as a daily diver. We don't need a hardcore dive monster, but something that blends style and spec. We could head to Seiko, but while the Prospex range holds a lot of phenomenal beaters, few could be said to be truly stylish.

One strong candidate is the Unimatic U1 Classic ($665), but we've gone for the recently updated Baltic Aquascaphe ($730). Powered by a Miyota automatic movement, the Baltic focuses on more visible premium touches, like the domed sapphire crystal and applied 3D luminous hour markers. It's water-resistant to 200 meters and available in blue, green, gray, or silver.

Next we should hit one of the main weaknesses in the Tudor's armor, and pick up a dress watch. The Black Bay isn't hulking, and our choice to opt for the fabric strap makes the whole watch a lot lighter (although it does add a millimeter in height), but it's not slim by any definition.

For price and poise, we've come straight to Dennison. The one time you can really get away with a quartz watch is at a formal occasion, where the chance of someone asking you for precision timing or to fiddle with your complications will be pretty low. The sold-out Time+Tide Date Night limited edition would be perfect, but failing that we'll opt for the Midnight Aventurine in steel ($690).

Next, we've got space in our collection for a real everyday watch: something that's not overburdened with functionality, but that will cover us for the working day. Here we can look at a simple automatic from Hamilton, whose military-inspired Khaki Field and Pilot watches would also be worthy inclusions. However, for a more everyday staple we've gone for the Khaki Field “Murph” 38 mm ($995), a compact version of the watch Matthew McConaughey's character gives to his daughter in Interstellar. With an 80-hour power reserve and 100-meter water resistance, it's a versatile choice in its own right.

WIRED's collection of watches here come to the same value as the Tudor, and will see you right in all the same situations.

To be a viable alternative to our GADA Tudor, the value collection has to include a travel-time watch. We looked at Farer's 36-mm Lander IV, with its preppy color scheme and distinctive character, but ultimately we went for another cult favorite from the affordable end of the Swatch Group stable.

The Mido Ocean Star Decompression Worldtimer costs $5 less than the Farer, at $1,490, and brings its own eye-catching dial to the table, as well as a 200-meter water resistance rating and a version of the same 80-hour movement as in the Hamilton. Perhaps the clincher was the world-time bezel, which shouldn't be confused with a true mechanical world-time complication, but does give at-a-glance timekeeping around the world.

So far we've spent $3,905, which means we still have $645 burning a hole in our pocket. The obvious gap in this collection is a chronograph of some kind. It would give us the decisive edge over the Black Bay, but for this budget most mechanical chronographs are out of reach. We could buy a MoonSwatch—in fact, at $285 we could buy two and have enough left for the Uber home—but we're on our mission to find something more substantial, more interesting, and (let's face it) more likely to stand the test of time.

And that something is the Brew Super Metric ($475), a hybrid mecha-quartz chrono from a New York microbrand with more personality than every MoonSwatch put together. The unashamedly loud retro styling isn't for everyone, but we think that the cushion-shaped case and steel bracelet help broaden our stylistic options, and although it's not a pedigree mechanical chronograph, it costs less than $500 while looking and feeling like no one's idea of a compromise.

That brings the challengers to a grand total of $4,380, which means we'd be able to buy a six-watch case to keep our collection in (of course it's got space for one more …) and maybe even a couple of spare straps.

There's no doubt the Tudor is in a different league, but could a crack squad of specialists tempt you to part with $4,550? Or will the lure of singular luxe prove too tempting? Over to you. It's decision time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","I Have Fallen in Love With Open Earbuds (and You Should Too)","https://www.wired.com/story/why-open-earbuds-are-my-favorite-new-category/","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 11:30:00 GMT","

If you've done any wireless earbuds shopping lately, you've likely noticed a new design category cropping up everywhere. They're called open earbuds (or open-ear buds, depending on the brand), and just about every audio brand has a pair (or three). They come in a slew of styles, but most either loop around your ears like older Beats buds, or they clip on like funky-futuristic earrings. Whatever the style, they're designed to deliver satisfying sound while keeping your ear canals open to the sounds of the world around you.

Open earbuds are a natural fit for staying aware during outdoor activities like jogging, hiking, and especially cycling, where the tiny microphones in traditional buds are rendered useless by wind. They don't sound as full or detailed as regular earbuds, but the best open earbuds can sound quite good.

Buying such a specified item might seem extravagant when buds with noise-canceling and transparency modes work in the vast majority of scenarios. That was my stance at first, too. Like many things in life, sometimes you need to try something in real life to see if you'll like it. Over the last year or so, I've gone from open earbuds skeptic to evangelizer—and now I can't imagine living without them.

“Occlusion” is mostly a foreign word outside audio circles, but it describes that plugged-up feeling you get from traditional earbuds. The best wireless earbuds counter occlusion with venting and other design factors, but you can't fully out-swerve physics, and most of us get tired of blocking our ear canals after a few hours.

Open earbuds (along with solutions like bone conducting headphones) fix the occlusion problem, with sound that seems to pop into your head like magic. The airy designs of my favorite pairs from brands like Bose and Soundcore are so comfy I can wear them all day, often forgetting they're on.

Comfort alone wasn't enough to sell me on an entire genre of buds you can't use in loud places, but as it turns out, that's rarely a problem. As WIRED's primary open earbuds reviewer, the more time I spend with these buds, the more use cases seem to unfold before me. From the complications of life to my ever-fraying attention span, open earbuds meet me where I live.

My main use case is probably also yours: I love using them for outdoor activities, from keeping in touch with my neighborhood while enjoying Comedy Bang Bang on a dog walk to blissfully grooving to my favorite yacht-rock playlist on an ebike test ride. But that's actually just the beginning.

Open earbuds' true brilliance is the ability to help me stay in tune with everything, everywhere, all at once. I love being able to tap into music, podcasts, and video in nearly any daily scenario without losing touch with the world. Sure, plenty of regular buds offer transparency mode that can mimic full environmental awareness, but few come close to the real thing. It's the sheer freedom and convenience of open buds that has led me to use them more than any other headphones.

I wear them every day while making lunch, brightening the mood with some tunes or comedy while ensuring I can hear the dog pawing at the door or my wife's questions about some household item or other. They're also perfect at the grocery store, where I can tune out the elevator music for my own playlist.

I no longer worry if the bar has the game—I can just set up my phone and keep tabs on it while chatting casually. Just last night, I was watching a tennis tournament on my phone while preparing for bed, still keeping tabs on our baby monitor as our daughter wrestled with her latest teething incident. You really can have it all!

Open buds should obviously not be your only pair: I recommend you find room in the budget for a pair of buds that work on a loud street or a noisy transit ride before springing for open earbuds. Regular buds are just more useful. While some open earbuds have attempted to incorporate a modicum of noise cancellation, the results have (predictably) been underwhelming so far.

I'm not unaware that the highest-end open earbuds are so expensive they seem reserved for the executive class. For most of us, it could be hard to justify a $200 to $300 pair of secondary buds when you've already splashed out on a good pair of noise-canceling earbuds or headphones.

Luckily, there are now so many affordable open earbuds that you no longer have to make that choice. As I write this, one of my favorite budget pairs, the Acefast Acefit Air, lists for $30 on Amazon. That's a helluva deal for something you might use on the daily, and you'll get surprisingly good sound, comfort, and usability for your money.

Stepping up to something like the Soundcore Aeroclip will get you cleaner, more defined sound quality in a compact, clip-on form factor. At the top of the market are Bose's $300 Ultra, which do not deliver 10 times the quality of the Acefit, but could be worth considering for persnickety listeners with a flex budget.

There's no shortage of other good models to try, many of which appear on our Best Open Earbuds guide, with more pairs seeming to arrive almost daily. Not all are winners, and many struggle to deliver full, resonant sound in the lower registers. Now that good open earbuds are easy to be had at such affordable prices, I do think it's worth the cost of a meal out to see if you find them as indispensable as I do. You might just discover a new favorite listening tool you never knew you needed.

Following last year's trend of showcasing AI in multimillion-dollar ad spots, the 2026 Super Bowl advertisements took it a step further by leveraging AI both to create the commercials and to promote the latest AI products. Love it or hate it, the technology has become a star in its own right, alongside the latest movie trailers and snack brands. 

Let's explore the biggest moments from this year's Big Game ads, which featured everything from robots and AI glasses to a touch of drama involving tech founders.

Vodka brand Svedka went with what it touts as the first “primarily” AI-generated national Super Bowl spot. The 30-second ad, titled “Shake Your Bots Off,” features the company's robot character, Fembot, and her new companion, Brobot, dancing their circuits off at a human party.

According to Svedka's parent company, Sazerac, it took roughly four months to reconstruct the Fembot and train the AI to mimic facial expressions and body movements, The Wall Street Journal reported. However, the vodka brand noted that certain aspects were still handled by humans, such as developing the storyline.



​The company partnered with AI company Silverside to create the Super Bowl spot, according to ADWEEK. Silverside AI is the same team behind recent AI-generated Coca-Cola commercials that sparked controversy.

​It's a bold move to debut AI-generated content during the Super Bowl, an event known for star-studded, high-production ads. The heavy reliance on AI is polarizing, fueling debates over whether AI will replace creative jobs.

Either way, Svedka definitely got people talking.

Anthropic's ad wasn't just about selling its Claude chatbot; it was about throwing shade. The commercial took a jab at OpenAI's plan to introduce ads to ChatGPT, with a tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” Rather than focus solely on Claude's features, it poked fun at the idea of your helpful AI assistant suddenly turning into a hype man for “Step Boost Maxx” insoles, for example.

It wasn't a standard product pitch, and it escalated into an online feud. OpenAI's Sam Altman fired back on social media, calling the ad “clearly dishonest.” So while we didn't get any more Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef this time around, maybe we did get our own AI, nerdy version of it.



Meta spotlighted its Oakley-branded AI glasses, designed for sports, workouts, and adventures, including extreme scenarios such as chasing down a departing plane. 

The ad showcased thrill-seekers, from skydivers to mountain bikers, using the glasses to capture epic moments. Famous faces like IShowSpeed and filmmaker Spike Lee made appearances, demonstrating capabilities like filming a basketball dunk in slow motion, posting hands-free to Instagram, and other advanced features.

The tech giant also featured its wearable AI tech in last year's Super Bowl ad to spark consumer interest, with stars like Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner showing off Ray-Ban Meta glasses.



Amazon's ad took a cheeky (and slightly unsettling) approach, starring Chris Hemsworth in a satirical “AI is out to get me” storyline. The commercial exaggerates common fears about AI, with Hemsworth humorously accusing Alexa+ of plotting against him. Scenes included Alexa+ closing the garage door on his head and shutting the pool cover while he swam, each mishap escalating in absurdity.

Beyond the dark comedy, the ad introduced the new Alexa+, showcasing its enhanced intelligence and capabilities, ranging from managing smart home devices to planning vacations. Alexa+ had been available in early access for over a year and officially launched to all U.S. users on Wednesday.



Ring's commercial spotlighted its “Search Party” feature, which leverages AI and a community network to reunite lost pets with their owners. The ad followed a young girl searching for her dog Milo, illustrating how users can upload a pet's photo to the app, where AI works to identify matches and taps into nearby cameras and the broader Ring user community to help track down missing furry family members.

Ring recently announced that anyone can now use Search Party, even without owning a Ring security camera. According to the company, the feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog with its owner every day.



Google's ad showcased the Nano Banana Pro, its newest image-generation model. The commercial followed a mother and son as they used AI to envision and design their new home, uploading photos of bare rooms and turning them into personalized spaces with just a few prompts.



Ramp scored big by getting Brian Baumgartner — the actor who played Kevin in “The Office” — for its Super Bowl commercial.

In the spot, Baumgartner uses Ramp's AI-powered spend management platform to “multiply” himself, effortlessly tackling a mountain of work. The ad highlights how Ramp's all-in-one solution helps teams focus on the most important tasks through smart automation.

And, as a playful nod to his TV persona, Baumgartner is seen carrying a pot of chili in the ad, referencing Kevin's legendary scene where he brings his cherished recipe for his co-workers to try, only to disastrously spill the entire pot on the floor.



Rippling, the cloud-based workforce management platform, went all in on its first-ever Super Bowl ad. The company tapped comedian Tim Robinson in a spot about onboarding an alien monster, poking fun at HR headaches and the promise of AI automation.



Health company Hims & Hers used its Super Bowl spot to address disparities in healthcare access. The ad cleverly references the lengths the wealthy go to for health and longevity, even appearing to poke fun at Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin spaceflight in 2021 and Bryan Johnson's expensive anti-aging routines.

In recent years, the company launched an AI-powered “MedMatch” tool to deliver more personalized treatment recommendations, especially for mental health and wellness.



Website builder Wix spotlighted its new AI-powered Wix Harmony platform, promising website creation as easy as chatting with a friend. Unveiled in January, the flagship platform combines AI-driven creation and “vibe coding” with full visual editing and customization.

Wix's biggest competitor, Squarespace, also has a Super Bowl ad this year. Squarespace's ad has a more cinematic approach starring Emma Stone and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.

Deep tech startups in sectors such as space, semiconductors, and biotech take far longer to mature than conventional ventures. Because of that India is adjusting its startup rules, and mobilizing public capital, hoping to help more of them make it to commercial products.

This week, the Indian government updated its startup framework, doubling the period for which deep tech companies are treated as startups to 20 years and raising the revenue threshold for startup-specific tax, grant, and regulatory benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.12 million), from ₹1 billion (around $11.04 million) previously. The change aims to align policy timelines with the long development cycles typical of science- and engineering-led businesses.

The change also forms part of New Delhi's effort to build a long-horizon deep tech ecosystem by combining regulatory reform with public capital, including the ₹1 trillion (around $11 billion) Research, Development and Innovation Fund (RDI), announced last year. That fund is intended to expand patient financing for science-led and R&D-driven companies. Against that backdrop, U.S. and Indian venture firms later came together to launch the India Deep Tech Alliance, $1 billion-plus private investor coalition that includes Accel, Blume Ventures, Celesta Capital, Premji Invest, Ideaspring Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, and Kalaari Capital, with chipmaker Nvidia acting as an adviser.

For founders, these changes may fix what some see as an artificial pressure point. Under the previous framework,  companies often risked losing startup status while still pre-commercial, creating a “false failure signal” that judged science-led ventures on policy timelines rather than technological progress, said Vishesh Rajaram, founding partner at Speciale Invest, an Indian deep tech venture capital firm.

“By formally recognizing deep tech as different, the policy reduces friction in fundraising, follow-on capital, and engagement with the state, which absolutely shows up in a founder's operating reality over time,” Rajaram told TechCrunch.

Still, investors say access to capital remains a more binding constraint, particularly beyond the early stages. “The biggest gap has historically been funding depth at Series A and beyond, especially for capital-intensive deep tech companies,” Rajaram said. That is where the government's earlier RDI fund is meant to play a complementary role.

“The real benefit of the RDI framework is to increase the funding available to deep tech companies at early and growth stages,” said Arun Kumar, managing partner at Celesta Capital. By routing public capital through venture funds with tenors similar to private capital, he said, the fund is designed to address chronic gaps in follow-on funding without altering the commercial criteria that govern private investment decisions.

Siddarth Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital and co-chair of regulatory affairs at the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association, said India's deep tech framework avoids a “graduation cliff” that has historically cut companies off from support just as they scale.

These policy changes come as the RDI fund is beginning to take shape operationally, Pai said, with the first batch of fund managers identified and the process of selecting venture and private equity managers under way.

While private capital for deep tech already exists in India — particularly in areas such as biotech — Pai told TechCrunch the RDI Fund is intended to act as a nucleus around which greater capital formation can occur. Unlike a traditional fund-of-funds, he noted, the vehicle is also designed to take direct positions and provide credit and grants to deep tech startups.

In terms of scale, India remains an emerging rather than dominant deep tech market. Indian deep tech startups have raised $8.54 billion in total to date, but recent data point to renewed momentum. Indian deep tech startups raised $1.65 billion in 2025, a sharp rebound from $1.1 billion in each of the previous two years after funding peaked at $2 billion in 2022, per Tracxn. The recovery suggests growing investor confidence, particularly in areas aligned with national priorities such as advanced manufacturing, defence, climate technologies, and semiconductors.

“Overall, the pickup in funding suggests a gradual move toward longer-horizon investing,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn. 

In comparison, U.S. deep tech startups raised about $147 billion in 2025, more than 80 times the amount deployed in India that year, while China accounted for roughly $81 billion, data from Tracxn shows. 

The disparity highlights the challenge India faces in building capital-intensive technologies, even with its wealth of engineering talent. So the hope is that these moves by the Indian government will lead to more investor participation over the medium term.

For global investors, New Delhi's framework change is being read as a signal of longer-term policy intent rather than a trigger for immediate shifts in allocation. “Deep tech companies operate on seven- to twelve-year horizons, so regulatory recognition that stretches the lifecycle gives investors greater confidence that the policy environment will not change mid-journey,” said Pratik Agarwal, a partner at Accel. While he said the change would not alter allocation models overnight or eliminate policy risk entirely, it increased investor comfort that India is thinking about deep tech on longer time horizons.

“The change shows that India is learning from the U.S. and Europe on how to create patient frameworks for frontier building,” Agarwal told TechCrunch.

Whether the move will reduce the tendency of Indian startups to shift their headquarters overseas as they scale remains an open question.

The extended runway strengthens the case for building and staying in India, Agarwal said, though access to capital and customers still matters. Over the past five years, he added, India's public markets have shown a growing appetite for venture-backed tech companies, making domestic listings a more credible option than in the past. That, in turn, could ease some of the pressure on deep tech founders to incorporate overseas, even if access to procurement and late-stage capital will continue to shape where companies ultimately scale.

For investors backing long-horizon technologies, the ultimate test will be whether India can deliver globally competitive outcomes. The real signal, Kumar of Celesta Capital said, would be the emergence of a critical mass of Indian deep tech companies succeeding on the world stage.

“It would be great to see ten globally competitive deep tech companies from India achieve sustained success over the next decade,” he said, describing that as the benchmark he would look for in assessing whether India's deep tech ecosystem is maturing.

The launch of the multi language Cedar runtime in 2011 led to incredible growth and by 2012 we were drowning in tech debt and scaling challenges. Despite more than tripling our headcount in that first year (~20 to 74) we could not keep up.Mid 2012 was especially bad as we were severely impacted by two us-east-1 outages just 2 weeks apart. To the extent it wasn't already, reliability and paying down tech debt became the main focus and I think we went about 18 months between major user-facing platform launches (Europe region and eventually larger sized dynos being the biggest things we eventually shipped after that drought). The organization lost its ability to ship significant changes or maybe never really had that ability at scale.That time coincided with the founders taking a step back, leaving a loss of leadership and vision that was filled by people more concerned with process than results. I left in 2014 and at that time it already seemed clear to me that the product was basically stalled.I'm not sure how much of this could have been done better even in hindsight. In theory Salesforce could have taken a more hands on approach early on but I don't think that could have ended better. They were so far from profitability in late 2010 that they could not stay independent without raising more funding. The venture market in ~2010 was much smaller than a few years later—tiny rounds and low valuations. Had the company spent its pre-acquisition engineering cycles building for scalability & reliability at the expense of product velocity they probably would have never gotten successful.Even still, it was the most amazing professional experience of my career, full of brilliant and passionate people, and it's sad to see it end this way.

I honestly find it a bit nuts, there's offerings that come close, but using them I still get the impression that they've just not put in the time really refining that user interface, so I just wanted to say thank you for the work you and the GP did, it was incredibly helpful and I'm happy to say helped me launch and test a few product offerings as well as some fun ideas

It absolutely boggles my mind that nothing else exists to fill this spot. Fly and others offer varying degrees of easier-than-AWS hosting, but nobody offers true PaaS like Heroku, IMHO.

The fact that it required nothing but 'git push heroku master' at the time was incredible, especially for how easy it was to spin up pre-prod environments with it, and how wiring up a database was also trivial.Every time I come across an infrastructure that is bloated out with k8s, helm charts, and a complex web of cloud resources, all for a service not even running at scale, I look back to the simplicity we used to have.

In my view , doing something quickly is the easy part , good engineering is only needed exactly when you want things to be maintainable and scalable, so the assertions above don't really make much sense to me.

* You probably aren't going to need it, so putting the effort into scaling means slowing down your delivery of the very features that would make customers want your solution.* It typically slows down performance of individual features.* It definitely significant increases the complexity of your solution (and probably the user-facing tooling as well).* It is difficult to achieve until you have the live traffic to test your approach.

Perhaps the thing I would add is that even with the tech debt and scaling problems we still had over a million applications deployed ready for that request to hit them.

I remember when we launched that product we went to that year's PGCon and there were people in the crowd angry and dismissive that we would treat data that way. It was actually pretty confrontational. Products like that were being produced while we were also working on migrating away from the initial implementation of the ""free tier"" (internally called Shen). It took me and a few others months to replace it and ensure we didn't lose data while also making it maintainable. The resulting tool lovingly named ""yobuko"" ended up remaining for years after that (largely due to the stagnation and turn over).Anyways, that was just a slice of it. Decisions made today are not always the decisions you wanted to be made tomorrow. Day0 is great, day100 comes with more knowledge and regret. :D

* The simpler the interface for the user, the more decisions you can make behind the scenes. A good example here is ""git push heroku"". Not only is that something every user (bot or human) can run, it is also easy to script, protect, and scale. It keeps the surface area small and the abstraction makes the most sense. The code that was behind that push lasted for quite some time, and it was effectively 1-2 Python classes as a service. But once we got the code into our systems, we could do anything with it... and we did. One of the things that blows my mind is that our ""slug"" (this is what we called the tarballs of code that we put on the runtimes) maker was itself a heroku app. It lived along side everyone else. We were able to reduce our platform down to a few simple pieces (what we called the kernel) and everything else was deployed on top. We benefited from the very things our customers were using.* NOTE: This one is going to be hard to explain because it is so simple, but when you start thinking about system design in this way the possibilities start to open up right in front of you.
  The idea is that everything we do is effectively explained as ""input -> filter -> output"". Even down to the CPU. But especially when it comes to a platform. With this design mentality we had a logging pipeline that I am still jealous of. We had metrics flowing into dashboards that were everywhere and informed us of our work. We had things like ""integration testing"" that ran continuously against the platform, all from the users perspective, that allowed us to test features long before they reached the public. All of these things were ""input"" that we ""filtered"" in some way to produce ""output"". When you start using that ""output"" as ""input"" and chaining these things together you get to a place where you can design a ""kernel"" (effectively an API service and a runtime) and start interacting with it to produce a platform.I remember when we were pairing down services to get to our ""kernel"" one of the Operations engineers developed our Chef so that an internal engineer needed maybe 5-7 lines of Ruby to deploy their app and get everything they needed. Simple input, that produced a reliable application setup, that could now get us into production faster.Anyways, those are just a couple.

Then life went on, I bounced around in my career, and forgot about Heroku. Years later I actually suggested it for someone to use for a simple project once and I could practically feel the other developers in the room losing respect for me for even mentioning it. I hadn't looked at it for so long that I didn't realize it had fallen out of favor.> That time coincided with the founders taking a step back, leaving a loss of leadership and vision that was filled by people more concerned with process than resultsThis feels all too familiar.

FWIW, the team that eventually created ""Docker"" was working at the same time on dotCloud as a direct Heroku competitor. I remember meeting them at a meet-up in the old Twitter building but couldn't tell you exactly which year that was. Maybe 2010 or 2011?

I worked for a different part of Salesforce. I don't really feel like Salesforce did a ton of meddling in any of its bigger acquisitions other than maybe Tableau. I think the biggest missed opportunity was potentially creating a more unified experience between all of its subsidiaries. Though, it's hard to call that a failure since they're making tons of money.It could be a case of post-founder leadership seeing that there's not a lot of room for growth and giving up. That happens a lot in the tech industry.

Our Pardot leadership translated for us and provided the necessary context: Pardot is being killed. The plan was to start building the product that would replace it, stop selling new contracts, rename Pardot in the meantime so the change wouldn't be as noticeable, and in a timeline of ""by 10 years from now"" Pardot wouldn't exist anymore.This is Salesforce for ""last call for the lifeboats, we're gonna capsize the boat.""

We offer the same default simplicity/speed, but with the ability to go deeper once teams hit scale, cost, or workflow limits. Plus a pricing model that stays understandable and improves as teams scale rather than punishing them for it.Fair warning: the website is pretty light right now. It's mostly a placeholder while we prep a broader push over the few months. Happy to answer questions here if helpful.

We should show pricing, and we will. We temporarily stripped the site back while overhauling positioning and pricing, which is why it's missing right now. That's on us, not a stance against transparency.In the meantime, I'm more than happy to share pricing directly.At a high level on our pricing:
- Current customers are on a mix of usage-based and fixed monthly plans, depending on their needs. We've found many of our customers love the fixed plan as it's a whole new level of predictability.
- We're generally architected to land well below Heroku's Enterprise pricing and to be competitive with a IaaS.
- We want pricing to get out of your way as you scale, so no big steps in pricing as you add services.
- Databases are HA by default and support replication.
- Pipelines and review apps don't require hacks to avoid per-review-app database costs.Happy to answer specifics here or over email if helpful.

The seeds of this outcome were planted years ago when sales comp plans changed.  When a sales rep can hit their target by simply converting the way an existing customer gets billed, none of them look for new business. Don't need new leads. Don't need to win competitive deals. But finding new customers and losing opportunities are the only things that signal/drive innovation. But from a budgeting perspective, why increase investment in a product that already hits/exceeds their sales targets?Over time sales targets get met, but the product doesn't advance.  By the time all existing customers that can convert have converted, the product is no longer competitive. Like bankruptcy, it comes gradually, then suddenly.

In every single company I've worked for in the past 15-20 years in this capacity the biggest focus was to exit heroku as quickly as possible. The reason: Price. You don't get to charge a premium for tooling, especially not when open source tooling exists that lets you use cloud providers without paying ""the Heroku Tax"".) Is Heroku still using AWS/any cloud provider? They should have rolled their own infrastructure decades ago. Alas, they got bought by a shit show of a company.(Note: I stopped working in 2023 due to health, and much of my early career was ASP/PHP/.NET)

We've had a bunch of people migrate over from Heroku in the last couple years, especially after they killed the free tier.The main difference from other alternatives is that you don't write any infrastructure config - you just declare what you need in your code (databases, cron jobs, pubsub, etc) and Encore handles provisioning it in your AWS/GCP account (works locally as well where local is 1:1 to your prod env).

So much of the value was already delivered in that simple `git push heroku master` which gave you a container + load balancer + a database. The vast majority of people didn't need more. And of those that were left that did far too few of them were willing to suddenly start paying $32/mo per dyno (you just gave me one for free! I only want one more!) or make the jump to multiple hundreds of dollars for a database.Read any of the threads about Heroku over the years. The biggest complaint is always “it's too expensive”. Even when a large percentage of what was on people's bills were add-ons like databases, new relic, redis, logging, etc (i.e., not Heroku).

To my understanding there was a runway-growth problem. Could the founders raise and spend (efficiently) enough money quickly enough to keep the business viable? It would be a big gamble and the alternatives were to shut down (no way!) or sell. So they sold.Rackspace wanted to take Matt's and Jason's know how (plus customer base) and go big, really big! That defocused our efforts a bit, plus there were corporate integration headaches (though not too bad). Eventually Linode, already a competitor, and later Digital Ocean filled the void.

I remember being excited by the merger because well, Rackspace had such a fantastic reputation at the time. People still tell stories about their service. The Rackspace Cloud was just up against an absolute monster in AWS and never really became competitive.

This is a common misconception, but it's actually not true. The reality is even more bizarre.Most of Heroku's successful years came after the acquisition, not before. Heroku was acquired extremely early in its lifecycle, and Salesforce does actually bear responsibility for investing in it and making it the powerhouse it became. Most of what people remember as the glory days of Heroku came long after the acquisition. And in fact, at the time of acquisiton, Heroku was nowhere near as competitive as a product as it later became.It was only much later on that Salesforce began to pull the supports out from underneath it, leaving it to fall behind and become what it is today.The narrative of ""BigCo™ acquires startup, then leaves it to wither and die"" is a trope because it is very commonly true, but it's actually not what happened in this particular case.

Decided this is the time to make the switch over to AWS. They've been rather painful with cancellation. They required all dynos be downgraded to ""Eco"". Fine.But this downgrade also incurred another $5 charge which they now required me to pay to remove the credit card. It's not much, but this is shady af.The billing language has become increasingly shady over the years. Basic is ""~$0.010/hour, Max of $7 per month"". Eco is ""~$0.005/hour, Flat fee of $5.00/month"". But in reality, you're just being charged a flat $7 or $5 either way. Eco is visually shown as the ""free"" option, except it's not free at all.I'd love to just keep using Heroku and paying some flat rate; we were talking about putting some more work & funding into the project and maybe scaling it up to thousands of users. But I have no idea what Heroku can actually scale to and how much it costs. AWS etc are also not that clear on costs, but at least their specifications is a little more detailed than ""Superior performance for your very large-scale, high traffic app""

I'd be glad to stand corrected but AFAICT this is the only sentence that describes the change. All other say ""nothing is changing in [some area]"".Trying to downplay something to that extent immediately raises suspicious that this something (the change) is much more profound that what is stated.

It ran our business.The benefit to us was the lack of problems that occurred at deploy time. Heroku's orchestration of removing old dynos, adding new dynos, and their network control was spectacular. DB's were updated, or patched, without downtime. It truly was impressive.We moved to a combination of AWS and on-prem, and the overhead of providing what Heroku previously provided is quite large.I'll remember it fondly, and miss it a bit too.

Heroku pioneered what a PaaS could be, alongside Cloud Foundry and others, so I'm genuinely sad to see it go down like this.We built Northflank because we saw enterprises wanting to deploy workloads in their own VPC with Heroku-level simplicity. Over the past 5 years, our mission has been solving the graduation problem where companies outgrow their PaaS and have to eventually migrate.Northflank runs in your VPC (AWS/GCP/Azure/OCI) with the same git-push experience. We have customers ranging from small startups to governments and public companies who would've otherwise built their own internal developer platform. They either use Northflank as-is in their own cloud or use our API to build their IDP on top of it.Most common use cases are preview environments and production workloads. Happy to answer questions and throw in some credits if you're evaluating alternatives.

We have customers ranging from small startups to governments and public companies who would've otherwise built their own internal developer platform. They either use Northflank as-is in their own cloud or use our API to build their IDP on top of it.Most common use cases are preview environments and production workloads.

northflank supports the same buildpacks that you run on Heroku, so it should be fairly straightforward.we have these docs for a more detailed walkthrough:1/ https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/migrate-from-hero...2/ https://northflank.com/blog/how-to-migrate-from-heroku-a-ste...

I've had pretty good luck setting up logical replication from Heroku to the new provider and having a 10-15 minute maintenance window to catch up once it's in sync. Might be worth considering.You might also want to add a warning about Postgres versions. There's some old bugs around primary key hash functions that can cause corruption on a migration. I've seen it twice when migrating from Heroku to other vendors.

For a company like Northflank, I'd expect actual production-grade documentation for migrating, not instructions that are only applicable to a toy app.

I've been building Frost https://github.com/elitan/frost, open source and self-hosted. Same idea, git push to deploy, automatic SSL, custom domains, but on your own VPS. Docker-native, no vendor lock-in, no pricing surprises.The angle that's a bit different: it's designed for AI coding agents. Simple config they write correctly, clear errors, no K8s complexity to hallucinate. You give your agent the install URL and it sets up the whole server.

I think it's fair to say that, if not for Heroku, I would not have had a career in software. I learned how to code web apps from books, and had a breakthrough when I discovered Rails (in 2009 I think?). But for the life of me I did not understand how to deploy a Rails app.I bashed my head against that wall for a while, then found Heroku, and it just worked. That let me ship a product when I barely knew what I was doing, which let me keep building and learning, until eventually I didn't need Heroku anymore. But I still always liked it, because I never enjoyed thinking about infrastructure.RIP Heroku, you were legendary.

I primarily worked on PoC/MVP development where I worked to bring ideas to something barely tangible. And Heroku's free tier decisions meant it was a barrier for developers to develop on their platform. Pay first, develop later. It was like the rest of the industry.After that, I just exited containerized platform-based application development entirely because convenience and having that weird developer  philosophy ""I must not pay because I can find a way"" was less of a reason than sustainability. For me, containerized application platforms was about POC and MVP. If there was growth then me or the client can pay for the convenience. But if there was nothing, pretty easy to delete the project.Then I committed to replicating the Heroku experience with a small VPS, backing up via rsync, and moving from PostgreSQL to SQLite. I can even charge clients for hosting (+ maintenance) on my VPS.I do not know, to me containerized application platforms are limited by commercial challenges rather than technical ones. I see tons of containerised application platforms, but the trust has eroded because of a single company.I have changed my development facility and laid the groundwork to not commit to these platforms. Sustainability over convenience.Sure, I understand and respect folks at fly.io, render, railway, and even the open source variants of these companies (Caddy etc.). But there is no sustainability guarantee for these platforms. It was not just about the ""free tier"", to me it transcends to a philosophical point about building applications in general. Sure, there could be a new era with AI making MVP/PoC development easy through hosting in containerised applications, but that is a tangent point.If Heroku were doing everything right, there would not be a dozen application platforms out there, but they made mistakes and, in my opinion, made the entire containerised application platform model untrustworthy.

- I think administrations in the EU are (slowly but steadily) adopting ""Public Money, Public Code"" policies and looking more seriously at open source- Note that policy / strategy on this depends a lot per country / local administration / project etc. I think most governments don't actively develop in house - France is quite the exception in this- There are a number of conferences that might be relevant (FOSDEM for example just finished)- We also benefitted from EU grants (e.g.: NLNet) to bootstrap our work and the early research phases

Even in this example, the French are building this in-house, but the Germans are repackaging this into their suite. And the Netherlands is on their way to do the same.So the approach would be different depending on which country you approached.My advice to you would be to follow government events like Hackdays to get yourself in front of people who can point you in the right direction

“Content over form” so you don't really need all the formatting options of something like Word when you are just trying to write meeting notes.They are definitely trending more towards a wiki, but it is still early days for this whole experiment. Though, many of the municipalities in the French gov are using it for their day to day work so it is clearly useful in some capacity. I don't have numbers, but it's definitely respectable

From my experience using open-source collaboration groupware like Nextcloud, their solutions written in dynamic programming languages like PHP and Python are always woefully slow. Only thing that got somewhere near of the commercial offering is OwnCloud's Infinity Scale (OCIS) which is written in Go. It is no surprise since OwnCloud is indeed running an open-core business and you cannot use their binaries in businesses. OpenCloud is the ""open-source"" fork but they are already in legal trouble with OwnCloud due to industrial espionage claims.If European governments are serious, the amount of money they _guarantee_ should be in the degree of tens of billions of Euros.

I imagine it is the same for a significant portion of the population.Also, libreoffice is already a thing and nobody edits office365 documents using the web versions except when their employer can't/don't want to pay the license for the full version or the client is not vailable on their OS (linux users). Libreoffice doesn't have that problem, you only really need storage with sharing facilities, not featurefull web clients for your docs.

I have no doubt that Microsoft and Google products offer more features but my point still stands: a lot of employees (like myself) need productivity tools but only need the core features.[1] https://lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr/produits/fichiers[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDesk[3] https://github.com/suitenumerique/drive/blob/46c9730d1b6d5c4...

Doing layout is not easy. Programming layouts well requires real expertise, which is why most layout engines expose a gui and let you deal with larger text components graphically. Maybe someone else will come up with a usability innovation here, but I'm not aware of it, and markdown certainly doesn't have that capability.

There are plenty of UI editors where they give you the basics for formatting and inserting stuff.Markdown is fairly portable, and with AI it is easy to generate and share as well.

All of this goes out the window when you're dealing with a government bureaucracy that has hyper specific document formatting requirements.This is a real foundational need of nearly every business at some point.  Every court system and government agency has their own rules and they need to be tracked and followed perfectly.  There are whole sub-industries around dealing with this for legal documents in MS Word.

By a ""decent layout"" engine, you'd like the ability to change fonts, add spacing between paragraphs, segment the page into regions, e.g. by changing the number of columns on a page, insert images and diagrams and choose how text wraps around them, create captions for embedded media, set page numbering policies (or navigational policies for web generation), generate table of contents, set table headers, make more complex tables with merged cells and different types of boundaries, generate table of references, generate tabs, then export to a web page, to a pdf, or to whatever other format you want, hopefully all from the same source. Then when you send it out for review, people can attach their comments to portions of the document, you can accept or reject their changes, there is a document revision history, etc.So for example, you could write up a quarterly report by importing summary financial data into your spreadsheet, doing some basic analysis, export tables to your word processor, generate some bar charts or graphs, draw some boxes and arrows with your drawing program, stick that into your word processor, add some footnotes and hyperlinks, put the same info into a slide presentation. Then if you want, you could save that as a pdf or turn into a webpage, etc.One time I had to write up documentation for various security certifications, and that was my introduction to the world of Microsoft office. Learning office made the project more fun, I had never used it before and was impressed with the functionality.That said, I don't think most people who have office suites actually need a full powered office suite. Probably markdown + slack is enough for a lot of people, but I always like a good drawing or diagram.Most people I know have shifted to google suite, it really has everything you need and is OS independent. But apart from the convenience of being browser-based, it is just another MS Office clone. The google drawing functionality is very basic, I often wish you could integrate something like excalidraw into it.I am not suggesting this project needs to keep adding clones of MS Office functionality until it turns into Libre Office, but funded by the French government. That would be a waste. Instead, why not make it better? Reimagine it? Look, for example, at excalidraw. It's fantastic. It was really a fresh take on the stuff people were doing with visio.I think there is lots of room to make a truly modern office suite instead of another MS Office rehash, so I would encourage this project to go its own way and do something interesting if they intend to be a replacement for proprietary office suites like google suite or MS Office.

When any random company makes a Build vs. Buy decision the question is “is this a core competency?” Most companies use a package from MS or GOOG because it's unlikely that they'll be so good at productivity software that it's (A) worth distracting themselves from their actual job and (B) good enough.

LibreOffice has a cloud version :). From what they presented at T-Dose like 10 years ago, it's basically an instance of the software running on the server, cut up into tiles and displayed on a webpage as zoomable image using Leafletjs, the same way that google maps worked before switching to vector graphics 15 years ago. Clicks and other input events are presumably emulated on the server and the resulting display update is sent back to the client, a bit like VNC but using a map library

For instance, when every employer (including those that may be only marginally successful to begin with) is expected as a matter of law to extend onerous labor protections against firing and laying off to each and every worker,[0] this results in marginal workers (who may have been socially marginalized originally for reasons of ethnic heritage and the like) being completely excluded from the market, which makes their plight even worse. (Except for forms of ""gig work"" or informal employment, of course - which in practice function to sidestep the most onerous regulations to some extent.) A very relevant issue in present-day France.[0] And to fund those costly welfare programs through payroll contributions that are levied on employees and employers alike - which is its own issue and often amounts to exploitive, confiscatory taxation for the most marginal workers.

But why import uneducated immigrants when you could import educated ones instead? The Canadian model has been a resounding success on that front and European countries should copy it. (And no, the ""brain drain"" argument doesn't really hold water. The successful migrants/expats tend to go back to their homelands after a while and become a much needed force for progress there, if there's even the slightest scope for actual improvement.)

reply

Refugees are not ""imported."" They are people fleeing war, persecution, or state collapse under international law obligations that Europe helped write. You don't get to say ""we'll take the engineers, but not the bombed-out schoolteachers."" Treating asylum like a points-based talent visa is a category error, not a policy preference.The brain drain argument absolutely does hold water. Systematically pulling scarce doctors, engineers, and academics out of low-income or fragile states weakens those societies. Some people return and contribute, yes, but many don't, and many return to systems too damaged to absorb their skills. That's not controversial. It's well documented in development economics.What's being presented as ""common sense"" here is really a value judgement: that human worth should be ranked by immediate economic utility to the receiving country. That's not a fact, and it's not how real migration systems actually work.If the goal is serious policy discussion, collapsing refugees, migrants, education, and prosperity into a single slogan doesn't get you there. It just makes the world simpler than it is.One more point about the word ""import,"" because language matters in how we think about policy.Describing people as being ""imported"" frames migration as a centrally planned, top-down process, rather than as a response to war, persecution, economic collapse, or climate pressure. It shifts attention away from those underlying causes and toward the idea that governments are deliberately ""bringing people in"" as if they were interchangeable inputs.That framing makes it easier to talk about migrants in abstract, instrumental terms, sorted by usefulness rather than understood as people reacting to circumstances, and it tends to oversimplify how migration actually works in practice, which is far more reactive and constrained than intentional or engineered.Being precise about language helps keep the discussion grounded in reality rather than drifting into metaphors that flatten complex human movement into something it isn't.

That's not a fact, and it's not how real migration systems actually work.If the goal is serious policy discussion, collapsing refugees, migrants, education, and prosperity into a single slogan doesn't get you there. It just makes the world simpler than it is.One more point about the word ""import,"" because language matters in how we think about policy.Describing people as being ""imported"" frames migration as a centrally planned, top-down process, rather than as a response to war, persecution, economic collapse, or climate pressure. It shifts attention away from those underlying causes and toward the idea that governments are deliberately ""bringing people in"" as if they were interchangeable inputs.That framing makes it easier to talk about migrants in abstract, instrumental terms, sorted by usefulness rather than understood as people reacting to circumstances, and it tends to oversimplify how migration actually works in practice, which is far more reactive and constrained than intentional or engineered.Being precise about language helps keep the discussion grounded in reality rather than drifting into metaphors that flatten complex human movement into something it isn't.

Want to admit more refugees without endangering social cohesion? Then you should make sure that you're also carefully selecting your economic migrants as best you can.  It's not a matter of assigning different human worth to each, but of simultaneously abiding by legal obligations towards actual refugees that are binding for the country, and also trying to do the absolute best you can for the highest amount of people who might be wanting to expatriate to it for different but nonetheless valid reasons - without unduly burdening that country and society in the process.

This is not true.  Women entering the workforce instead of having babies earlier in life lowers prosperity.  In our society women working during those early years creates more prosperity (two incomes) but those who are very rich like Musk has no issue producing a big stable of kids.

Same with welfare state. Which countries do you count as non-welfare states? And when do they stop being a welfare state? Let's take Poland as an example. When do they stop being a welfare state? If they lower the unemployment payments, will they stop being a welfare state?And at what timescale do you think Poland will stop existing because of demographics?

That figure is pretty tired. In France, the pension scheme is counted as public spending.

The critical point if my claim is whether or not they are mandatory. Pillar 2 is mandatory for employees. Whether employees are forced to fork their cash to the state or to a private management company doesn't change the scheme or the benefits you get, but it changes OP's number.There's plenty more to say about the way pension schemes are set up, their benefits and drawbacks, but that's unrelated to my point.> Care to elaborate why French middle class (we are on HN after all, not on Jacobin) would be worse off on Swiss health care model, for example?I'm going to talk about the French as a whole here.

Someone making 2500€ gross will take home 1885€ per month after taxes and contributions. On which you can add a 20% VAT. Even should you want to operate in incredibly bad faith and add employer contributions, it would only amount to 3175 in total. For fun, I tried to figure out what would be needed for someone to have 82% of their salary going away into taxes. It is physically impossible to go anywhere above 55%, the math just stops scaling. Even taking employer costs into account, the max will be 65%. This all starts happening when you have the lowly gross salary of about 30 000€/month, something that I'm sure you're being paid right now to complain about to much about it.Hell, even the damn link you're posting shows that you can't read:> In France, income tax and employer social security contributions combine to account for 82% of the total tax wedge, compared with 77% of the total OECD average tax wedgeWhat the fuck do you think tax brackets cover, ponies ?

How is that bad faith? It's basic common sense to count that together. Total cost is what matters to employers. You can't compare different countries either if you don't hacks like this that try to confuse the workers about how much they are paying.e.g.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Payroll_...taxes in Denmark are presumably several times higher than in France?

The initial claim is ""82% of wages go to taxes"", which is inaccurate, a lie and a bad faith argument.

So you don't care about the size of your salary? Fair enough...It's all the same to them, whether the social insurance contributions are shown on your payslip or not is just an accounting detail. It's still a tax on labour and no different that the share you are paying.

On a €2500 gross salary you take home €1651 (which is a very low salary in France very close to the minimum salary). But I guess you think the gross salary is what the company, by law, has to say they pay you, instead of what the total cost for the company of your salary.See, in France, even if you are getting close to the minimum salary, the state is taking 33% of the cake for themselves. This is for people that earn very little. For people that earn average salaries of €2669 liquid (€5000 gross for the company), the French state takes 47% of the cake.It's a normal mistake for people that don't actually have to support the costs themselves. Once people actually start a small business or pay more attention to their own wages and how much is being taken away, they figure out how it actually works.

No, thank you, I am quite well versed in the concept of superbrut, and actively pay more than a SMIC in taxes every year: you won't play that game with me. Va jouer, comme on dit.They're employer _contributions_ to the system. They're the price you pay for a healthy, well educated working population.You don't get to claim it as ""it would be your salary"", because we both damn well know you'd never pay that back into the salary should it go away. We've had the experience every time, with tax writeoffs on SMICs, VAT lowered to 5.5% which led to zero jobs created and no changes in employment conditions, etc. You might even be old enough to remember the MEDEF's ""1 million jobs"" pin, where they created... 20k. Cool. The reality of things is, you as an employer cannot be trusted to not fuck over employees, especially the weakest and most vulnerable of us all.Once again, your own damn links prove that 1/ France isn't that far off the OECD average for taxation and 2/ actually does better in not slapping in a bunch of unrelated crap in taxes.

Depends which ones.  Python? Definitely a source of slowness.

reply

I would first blame the programmers, the design and lack of specialty offloading before blaming any programming language. Well designed web calls scale nearly linearly with usage and usually poor design or programming is the source of slowness. You can always trade language complexity for speed but assuming it is the cause of all perceived slowness is a poor man's view.It is the same story every time again, first it was java, which has so many large scale projects most people won't even know it's running things they use, now it's apparently python who is to blame for all slowness on the web. When the next JIT or scripted language comes along which is not someone's favourite pet that will get the blame.

reply

I also denounce the notion that trading language complexity for slowness is the case. Python is already complex, and there's some language and frameworks that are actually quite a bit easier to use for web backends. Like java, or dotnet. It just makes no sense to use python for this usecase, even if you ignore the slowness.But that's not completely true, there is one very good reason to use python. Your devs know it. But, that doesnt say anything about the language itself.

Don't we have enough examples showing that this simply cannot work long-term, because the for-profit enterprises will _inevitably_ grow larger than the government can handle through antitrust? And once they reach that size, they become impossible to rein in. Just look at all the stupid large american corporations who can't be broken up anymore because the corporation has the lobbying power and media budget to make any attempt to enforce antitrust a carrier killer for a politician.I think it's very myopic to say that corporate structure is the ""best solution"".

It's great that Django's API design allowed them to move this way easily, but they aren't actually using Django in the traditional sense because it can't handle their scale.I've found that with the Django ORM and DRF especially, it's very easy to create a poorly performing app by following the established patterns (N+1 queries being a huge problem created by DRF serializers). You need to be extremely diligent to create something performant in this ecosystem. Not every dev team has Armin Ronacher :PWhere I work we found this exhausting, and moved on to FastAPI and ASP.NET. We make our queries much more explicit using tools like Dapper, and now a senior engineer can have a much better idea how a particular route will perform just by reading the code (obviously, we still do some profiling).[1]: https://djangochat.com/episodes/django-instagram-carl-meyer

It has a weird learning curve, where you can ship something somewhat working, fairly fast, but to write it properly, with no bugs, you need to understand a lot of niche React-specific things, and their solutions (and those solutions are never useEffect https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect).At that point, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't already experienced with React. It's been an uphill battle, trying to work with anyone that is using React, without understanding how to write properly.

If the aim is indeed sovereignty, data and software (and this is software not data), and in general, then they need an effective and comprehensive plan. I think taxpayer-funded state-developed open-source software brings very little at a high cost and can even be counter-productive. Frankly I think it is apolitical move internal to the French state to keep the gavy train coming to government agencies.Rather I think the US, and also China that does it even more, are much more effective at this by throwing money at the marketplace to develop a whole ecosystem competitively that can also compete globally. An important thing to note here is that EU rules prevent a lot of state action (for instance they would not be allowed to buy only French cars or do things seen as direct subsidies, etc)France will continue to fall further behind unless it really gets it act together, which is unlikely TBH.

Yes in the most basic sense it does since they build their own tool instead of getting a foreign one. To be a little bit provocative I could say that Warsaw Pact countries used to do the same and built plenty of uncompetitive products themselves...But beyond that it isn't a plan because it does not scale, it does not help the country develop its own industry and economy, it does not help competitiveness, and it is a huge cost for very little. Again, the sovereignty aspect means all of this must be addressed otherwise it is just a stunt and waste of taxpayers' money.You've got to have a competitive industry to achieve and maintain 'sovereignty' in a broader and positive sense otherwise you end up like the Warsaw Pact or China before it realised that. You might survive but look more and more like North Korea (poor and obsolete but, yes, sovereign).So yes, taxpayer-funded and state-developed internally in isolation for the sake of it is pretty much universally bad.Taxpayer-funded is not bad per se, as already said in my previous comment, but here it is indeed more than that, it's the government building random stuff internally for frankly no good reason. Maybe next the government will manufacture its own 'sovereign' pencils as well?They could have spent the same amount of money supporting small companies to develop similar products and that would have helped creating a competitive 'sovereign' ecosystem and commercial products to sell to everyone at home and also abroad. Much more bang for their buck and long term virtuous circle.So, again have you got a point to discuss beyond just wanting to argue against me?Edit:An example of why competitiveness is important: Arianespace. It's great, Europe has the 'sovereign' ability to launch satelittes. That's useful for government agencies, a niche use-case. But everyone else in Europe who wants to launch a satelitte uses SpaceX because Arianespace is not competitive and is obsolete at this point.

Is not really limited to Trump at all, even though the consequential and public nature of Trump takes everyone's attention … ironically, with its opponents only feeding that loop in how they oppose it.It's a core characteristic of narcissism people rarely understand. Narcissism (individual or system) utterly depends on conflict for its “narcissistic supply”. When you “oppose it”, you are in fact only fueling that which you believe you are opposing. It's a paradox that people have an impossible time understanding, especially all the people who see “Nazis” everywhere, while openly and violently “protesting” in this supposed “Nazi” regime they're opposing. Narcissistic control needs that for its manipulation. That is precisely the kind of fuel narcissists love and need and relish with glee as you oppose them, because it means they have you exactly where they want you, emotional and easily manipulated and controlled.You think the Super Bowl would happen if people stopped living the delusion of “my team” conflict with “not my team”? When you see that stadium full of people, realize that every single one of those thousands of people, will have spent on avg. ~$15,000 per person. It takes manipulation into a state of mental illness to do that. No different than Trump supporters or Nazi fighters or all the other kind of fantasy LARPing that is so pervasive in America, living a life of delusion created for them because it is profitable and makes people easily manipulated.

Passwords have been the least of my concerns since password managers were invented.You could, in theory, use a custom domain or email aliasing service like SimpleLogin or Addy to combat the email address issue, though websites like GitHub have been known to block emails created with an aliasing service. I could go on about why that move does next to nothing to combat actual abuse; any spammer worth their salt can just buy a bunch of Gmail accounts or Outlook accounts instead.

The government was actually succeeding, albeit at “another objective altogether”—the enrichment of its own members.A few paragraphs later:> In the face of flagrant misappropriation, she found, ordinary citizens could experience a sense of grievance so potent that it filled them with something worse than anger—a desire for revenge. Nurallah, an employee at the factory who once worked as a police officer, told her about the humiliation that his brother experienced during a shakedown by Afghan police. “If I see someone plant an I.E.D. on the road, and then I see a police truck coming... I will not warn them,” Nurallah said. This is the central revelation in “Thieves of State”: at a certain point, systemic corruption became not just a lamentable by-product of the war but an accelerant of conflict.

But if you look at Google, there isn't one key product. There are a whole pile of products that are best in class. Search (cringe, I know it's popular here to say Google search sucks and perhaps it does, but what search engine is far better?), YouTube, Maps, Android, Waymo, GMail, Deep Mind, the cloud infrastructure, translate, lens (OCR) and probably a lot of others I've forgotten. Don't forget Sheets and Docs, which while they have been replicated by Microsoft and others now were first done by Google. Some of them, like Maps, seem to have swapped entire teams - yet continued to be best in class. Predicting Google won't be at the forefront on the next advance seems perilous.Maybe these products have key people as you call them, but the magic in Alphabet doesn't seem to be them. The magic seems to be Alphabet has some way to create / acquire these keep people. Or perhaps Alphabet just knows how to create top engineering teams that keep rolling along, even when the team members are replaced.Apple produced one key person, Jobs. Alphabet seems to be a factory creating lots of key people moving products along. But as Google even manages to replace these key people (as they did for Maps) and still keep the product moving, I'm not sure they are the key to Googles success.

Additionally, Flash required android phones with 256MB ram as a minimum (which would have precluded two of the three shipped iPhone models at the time) and at least initially only supported software video decoding. Because of the difference in screen dimensions, resolutions and interaction models (plus the issues with embedding due to RAM limitations), the website was still basically broken whether your mobile phone had Flash or not.My understanding (based on the timing) was always that when Adobe was finally ready to push its partners to bundle mobile Flash, Apple looked at it and decided against it. Adobe made public statements against their partner and so Jobs did so in kind.

And it's still not clear whether they are using a fallback driving stack for a situation where one of non-essential (i.e. non-camera (1)) sensors is degraded. I haven't seen Waymo clearly stating capabilities of their self-driving stack in this regard. On the other hand, there are such things as washer fluid and high dynamic range cameras.(1) You can't drive in a city if you can't see the light emitted by traffic lights, which neither lidar nor radar can do.

Lidar also gives you the ability to see through fog and as it scans, see the depth needed to nearly always understand what object is in front of them.My Model 3 shows ""degraded"" or ""unavailable"" about 2% of the time i'm driving around populated areas. Zero chance it will ever be truly FSD capable, no matter the software improvements. It'll still be unavailable because the cameras are blinded/blocked/unable to process the scene because it can't see the scene.While you're right, washer fluid works usually on the windshield, it doesn't on the side cameras, and yea hdr could improve things, it won't improve depth perception, and this will never be installed on my model 3..Lidar contributes the data most needed to handle the millions of edge cases that exist. With both camera and lidar contributing the data they are both the best at collecting, the risk of the very worst type of accidents is greatly reduced.I don't see these stats https://waymo.com/safety/impact/ happening for tesla anytime soon.

Using vision only is so ignorant of what driving is all about: sound, vibration, vision, heat, cold...these are all clues on road condition. If the car isn't feeling all these things as part of the model, you're handicapping it. In a brilliant way Lidar is the missing piece of information a car needs without relying on multiple sensors, it's probably superior to what a human can do, where as vision only is clearly inferior.

Also, integration effort went down but it never disappeared. Meanwhile, opportunity cost skyrocketed when vision started working. Which layers would you carve resources away from to make room? How far back would you be willing to send the training + validation schedule to accommodate the change? If you saw your vision-only stack take off and blow past human performance on the march of 9s, would you land the plane just because red paint became available and you wanted to paint it red?I wouldn't completely discount ego either, but IMO there's more ego in the ""LIDAR is necessary"" case than the ""LIDAR isn't necessary"" at this point.

It was funny watching everyone around me convert in the opposite direction at around the same time, probably driven by politics. I get it, I hate Elon's politics too, I just try very hard to keep his shitty behavior from influencing my opinions on machine learning.

It's still rather weak and true monocular depth estimation really wasn't spectacularly anything in 2021. It's fundamentally ill posed and any priors you use to get around that will come to bite you in the long tail of things some driver will encounter on the road.The way it got good is by using camera overlap in space and over time while in motion to figure out metric depth over the entire image. Which is, humorously enough, sensor fusion.

I do some tangent work from this field for applications in robotics, and I would consider (metric) depth estimation (and 3D reconstruction) starting to be solved only by 2025 thanks to a few select labs.Car vision has some domain specificity (high similarity images from adjacent timestamps, relatively simpler priors, etc) that helps, indeed.

The issue with lidar is that many of the difficult edge-cases of FSD are all visible-light vision problems. Lidar might be able to tell you there's a car up front, but it can't tell you that the car has it's hazard lights on and a flat tire. Lidar might see a human shaped thing in the road, but it cannot tell whether it's a mannequin leaning against a bin or a human about to cross the road.Lidar gets you most of the way there when it comes to spatial awareness on the road, but you need cameras for most of the edge-cases because cameras provide the color data needed to understand the world.You could never have FSD with just lidar, but you could have FSD with just cameras if you can overcome all of the hardware and software challenges with accurate 3D perception.Given Lidar adds cost and complexity, and most edge cases in FSD are camera problems, I think camera-only probably helps to force engineers to focus their efforts in the right place rather than hitting bottlenecks from over depending on Lidar data. This isn't an argument for camera-only FSD, but from Tesla's perspective it does down costs and allows them to continue to produce appealing cars – which is obviously important if you're coming at FSD from the perspective of an auto marker trying to sell cars.Finally, adding lidar as a redundancy once you've ""solved"" FSD with cameras isn't impossible. I personally suspect Tesla will eventually do this with their robotaxis.That said, I have no real experience with self-driving cars. I've only worked on vision problems and while lidar is great if you need to measure distances and not hit things, it's the wrong tool if you need to comprehend the world around you.

I don't think Tesla is that far behind Waymo though given Waymo has had a significant head start, the fact Waymo has always been a taxi-first product, and given they're using significantly more expensive tech than Tesla is.Additionally, it's not like this is a lidar vs cameras debate. Waymo also uses and needs cameras for FSD for the reasons I mentioned, but they supplement their robotaxis with lidar for accuracy and redundancy.My guess is that Tesla will experiment with lidar on their robotaxis this year because design decisions should differ from those of a consumer automobile. But I could be wrong because if Tesla wants FSD to work well on visually appealing and affordable consumer vehicles then they'll probably have to solve some of the additional challenges with with a camera-only FSD system. I think it will depend on how much Elon decides Tesla needs to pivot into robotaxis.Either way, what is undebatable is that you can't drive with lidar only. If the weather is so bad that cameras are useless then Waymos are also useless.

I understand that small lens sizes mean that falling droplets can obstruct the view behind the droplet, while larger lens sizes can more easily see beyond the droplet.I seldom see discussion of the exact failure modes for specific weather conditions. Even if larger lenses are selected the light source should use similar lens dimensions. Independent modulation of multiple light sources could also dramatically increase the gained information from each single LiDAR sensor.Do self-driving camera systems (conventional and LiDAR) use variable or fixed tilt lenses? Normal camera systems have the focal plane perpendicular to the viewing direction, but for roads it might be more interesting to have a large swath of the horizontal road in focus. At least having 1 front facing camera with a horizontal road in focus may prove highly beneficial.To a certain extend an FSD system predicts the best course of action. When different courses of action have similar logits of expected fitness for the next best course of action, we can speak of doubt. With RMAD we can figure out which features or what facets of input or which part of the view is causing the doubt.A camera has motion blur (unless you can strobe the illumination source, but in daytime the sun is very hard to outshine), it would seem like an interesting experiment to:1. identify in real time which doubts have the most significant influence on the determination of best course of action2. have a camera that can track an object to eliminate motion blur but still enjoy optimal lighting (under the sun, or at night), just like our eyes can rotate3. rerun the best course of action prediction and feed back this information to the company, so it can figure out the cost-benefit of adding a free tracking camera dedicated to eliminating doubts caused by motion blur.

The apparent applicability to Waymo is incidental, more likely because a few millions+ were spent on Genie and they have to do something with it. DeepMind started to train ""world models"" because that's the current overhyped buzzword in the industry. First it was ""natural language understanding"" and ""question answering"" back in the days of old BERT, then it was ""agentic"", then ""reasoning"", now it's ""world models"", next years it's going to be ""emotions"" or ""social intelligence"" or some other anthropomorphic, over-drawn neologism. If you follow a few AI accounts on social media you really can't miss when those things suddenly start trending, then pretty much die out and only a few stragglers still try to publish papers on them because they failed to get the memo that we're now all running behind the Next Big Thing™.

Dictionary def: ""a machine controlled by a computer that is used to perform jobs automatically.""

Even if that definition were universally agreed on l upon though, that's not really enough to understand what the parent comment was saying. Being a robot ""in the same way"" as something else is even less objective. Humans are humans, but they're also mammals; is a human a mammal ""in the same way"" as a mouse? Most humans probably have a very different view of the world than most mice, and the parent comment was specifically addressing the question of whether it makes sense for an autonomous car to model the world the same way as other robots or not. I don't see how you can dismiss this as ""irrelevant"" because both humans and mice are mammals (or even animals; there's no shortage of classifications out there) unless you're completely having a different conversation than the person you responded to. You're not necessarily wrong because of that, but you're making a pretty significant misjudgment if you think that's helpful to them or to anyone else involved in the ongoing conversation.

Also subtle head and eye movements, which is something a lot of people like to ignore when discussing camera-based autonomy.  Your eyes are always moving around which changes the perspective and gives a much better view of depth as we observe parallax effects.  If you need a better view in a given direction you can turn or move your head.  Fixed cameras mounted to a car's windshield can't do either of those things, so you need many more of them at higher resolutions to even come close to the amount of data the human eye can gather.

And, importantly, the fender-mount LIDARs.  It doesn't just have the one on the roof, it has one on each corner too.I first took a Waymo as a curiosity on a recent SF trip, just a few blocks from my hotel east on Lombard to Hyde and over to the Buena Vista to try it out, and I was immediately impressed when we pulled up the hill to Larkin and it saw a pedestrian that was out of view behind a building from my perspective.  Those real-time displays went a long way to allowing me to quickly trust that the vehicle's systems were aware of what's going on around it and the relevant traffic signals.  Plenty of sensors plus a detailed map of a specific environment work well.Compare that to my Ioniq5 which combines one camera with a radar and a few ultrasonic sensors and thinks a semi truck is a series of cars constantly merging in to each other.  I trust it to hold a lane on the highway and not much else, which is basically what they sell it as being able to do.  I haven't seen anything that would make me trust a Tesla any further than my own car and yet they sell it as if it is on the verge of being able to drive you anywhere you want on its own.

More subtly, a lot of depth information comes from how big we expect things to be, since everyday life is full of things we intuitively know the sizes of, frames of reference in the form of people, vehicles, furniture, etc
. This is why the forced perspective of theme park castles is so effective— our brains want to see those upper windows as full sized, so we see the thing as 2-3x bigger than it actually is. And in the other direction, a lot of buildings in Las Vegas are further away than they look because hotels like the Bellagio have large black boxes on them that group a 2x2 block of the actual room windows.

reply

Humans do this with vibes and instincts, not just depth perception. When I can't see the lines on the road because there's too much slow, I can still interpret where they would be based on my familiarity with the roads and my implicit knowledge of how roads work, e.g. We do similar things for heavy rain or fog, although, sometimes those situations truly necessitate pulling over or slowing down and turning on your 4s - lidar might genuinely given an advantage there.

For example, we know from experience that Waymo is currently good enough to drive in San Francisco.

And, as usual, the more we use and validate these models, the more we can improve them; creating a virtuous cycle.

do that for enough different scenarios, and if the model is consistently accurate across every scenario you validate, then you can start believing that it will also be accurate for the scenarios you haven't (and can't) validate.

So many people advocate for public transit, but are unwilling to deal with the current market tradeoffs and decisions people are making on the ground. As long as that keeps happening, expect modes of transit -- like Waymo -- that deliver the level of service that they promise to keep exceeding expectations.I've spent my entire adult life advocating for transportation alternatives, and at every turn in America, the vast majority of other transit advocates just expect people to be okay with anti-social behavior going completely unenforced, and expecting ""good citizens"" to keep paying when the expected value for any rational person is to engage in freeloading. Then they point to ""enforcing the fare box"" as a tradeoff between money to collect vs cost of enforcement, when the actually tradeoff is the signalling to every anti-social actor in the system that they can do whatever they want without any consequences.I currently only see a future in bike-share, because it's the only system that actually delivers on what it promises.

Why do you expect them to make money? Roads don't make money and no one thinks to complain about that. One of the purposes of government is to make investment in things that have more nebulous returns. Moving more people to public transit makes better cities, healthier and happier citizens, stronger communities, and lets us save money on road infrastructure.

I don't.That's why I said ""variable cost of operations.""If a system doesn't generate enough revenue to cover the variable costs of operation, then every single new passenger drives the system closer to bankruptcy. The more ""successful"" the system is -- the more people depend on it -- the more likely it is to fail if anything happens to the underlying funding source, like a regular old local recession. This simple policy decision can create a downward economic spiral when a recession leads to service cuts, which leads to people unable to get to work reliably, which creates more economic pain, which leads to a bigger recession... rinse/repeat. This is why a public transit system should cover variable costs so that a successful system can grow -- and shrink -- sustainably.When you aren't growing sustainably, you open yourself up to the whims of the business cycle literally destroying your transit system. It's literally happening right now with SF MUNI, where we've had so many funding problems, that they've consolidated bus lines. I use the 38R, and it's become extremely busy. These busses are getting so packed that people don't want to use them, but the point is they can't expand service because each expansion loses them more money, again, because the system doesn't actually cover those variable costs.The public should be 100% completely covering the fixed capital costs of the system. Ideally, while there is a bit of wiggle room, the ridership should be 100% be covering the variable capital costs. That way the system can expand when it's successful, and contract when it's less popular. Right now in the Bay Area, you have the worst of both worlds, you have an underutilized system with absolutely spiraling costs, simply because there is zero connection between ""people actually wanting to use the system"" and ""where the money comes from.""

That's before you consider how it takes 2-4x as long to get somewhere by public transit outside of peak hours and/or well-covered areas.

1) is a bit simplistic though. I don't know of any European system that would cover even operating costs out of fare/commercial revenue. Potentially the London Underground - but not London buses. UK National Rail had higher success ratesThe better way to look at it imo is looking at the economic loss as well of congestion/abandoned commutes. To do a ridiculous hypothetical, London would collapse entirely if it didn't have transit. Perhaps 30-40% of inner london could commute by car (or walk/bike), so the economic benefit of that variable transit cost is in the hundreds of billions a year (compared to a small subsidy).It's not the same in SFBA so I guess it's far easier to just ""write off"" transit like that, it is theoretically possible (though you'd probably get some quite extreme additional congestion on the freeways as even that small % moving to cars would have an outsized impact on additional congestion).

You're making my argument for me. Again, my concern isn't the day-to-day conveniences of funding, my point is that building a fragile system (a system where the funding is unrelated to the usability of the service) is a system that can fail catastrophically... for systems where there are obviously alternatives (say, National Rail which can be substituted for automobile, bus, and airplane service) are less to worry about, because their failure will likely not cause cascading failures. When an entire local economy is dependent on that system -- when there are not viable substitutes -- then you're really looking at a sudden economic collapse if the funding source runs dry, or if the system is ever mismanaged.This is a big deal. When funding really actually does run out and the system fails, then if the result is an economic cascade into a full blown depression, then you would have been much better off just building the robust system in the long term. I just really don't think people appreciate how systems can just fail. Whether it's Detroit or Caracas, when the economic tides turn in a fragile system people can lose everything in a matter of a few years.

And National Rail isn't replaceable at all with bus/cars/planes. You really underestimate the number of people which commute >1hr into London (100km+). There is just no way to do that journey by car or bus. It would turn a ~1hr commute into a 3hr _each way_ and that's not even considering the complete lack of parking OR the fact suddenly the roads would be at (even more) gridlock with many multiples of commuters.That's not even getting into what you consider fixed vs variable costs. Are the trains themselves a fixed cost (they should last 30-40 years)? Is track maintenance a fixed cost (this has to be done more often than the trains themselves), etc etc. The 2nd point is very important - a lot of rail operators in the UK can be made profitable or not on your metric by how much the government subsidises track maintenance vs the operators paying for it in track access charges.Equally, are signalling upgrades (for example) fixed costs? But really they are only required to run more frequent services. So you could argue they are a variable cost?

Variable cost, typically labor, go away when you don't actually need that additional marginal train. You still have to amortize that train even if it's not on the tracks. You still need to buy that marginal train when the service levels require it. You still have to do track maintenance even when you're not running trains (though, yes, at the very margin there could be some small rate adjustments).

Fixed costs are the costs that don't go away when the passengers go away. Variable cost, typically labor, go away when you don't actually need that additional marginal train. You still have to amortize that train even if it's not on the tracks. You still need to buy that marginal train when the service levels require it. You still have to do track maintenance even when you're not running trains (though, yes, at the very margin there could be some small rate adjustments).

This isn't just happening in America. Train systems are in rough shape in the UK and Germany too.Ebike shares are a much more sustainable system with a much lower cost, and achieve about 90% of the level of service in temperate regions of the country. Even the ski-lift guy in this thread has a much more reasonable approach to public transit, because they actually have extremely low cost for the level of service they provide. Their only real shortcoming is they they don't handle peak demand well, and are not flexible enough to handle their own success.

I'm not sure if this was intended or not, but this is a common NIMBY refrain. The argument of ""This thing being advocated for that I'm fighting against isn't something people want anyway"". And like walkable neighborhood architecture, extremely few Americans have access to light rail. Let alone light rail that doesn't have to yield to car traffic.Regardless, the cost arguments fall apart once you take the total cost society pays for each system instead of only what the government pays. Because when you get the sum of road construction & maintenance, car acquisition, car maintenance, insurance, and parking, it dwarfs the cost of the local transit system. Break it down on a per-consumer basis and it gets even uglier. New York City is a good example to dive into, especially since it's the typical punching bag for ""out-of-control"" budgets.Quick napkin math pins the annual MTA cost at $32-$33 billion and the total cost of the car system between $25 and $44 billion per year. Since the former serves somewhere around 5.5 million riders, and the latter only about 2 million, the MTA costs $5,300-6,600 per user annually where the car system costs $12,000–$22,500 per user annually.

When ridership plummeted by >50% during the pandemic, fixed costs stayed the same, but income dropped. Last time I checked, if Bart ridership returned to 2019 levels, with no other changes, it would be profitable again.

reply

BART has already been bailed out by the state, twice. It has already failed, twice. It very much needs to reduce the level service it provides if it wants to be sustainable, or seek other forms of revenues while we wait to see if ridership returns. Many have suggested BART explore the SE Asian model of generating revenues by developing residential housing, which seems fairly straightforward.If ridership never returns, then we ought not continue throwing good money after bad, and we ought to adjust the level of service to meet the level of revenues. Obviously the main problem here is that it's literally illegal to just build high density corridors directly adjacent to the transit stations... which is what we ultimately need to prioritize.

1. You want to be forward looking, not backwards looking. Cutting services means less ridership means less revenue means cutting services means...etc. Bart is super useful for me during the week because headways from SF to West Oakland are often 5m. As I'm writing this (11 on a Friday) I missed a train and had to wait 20 minutes. Every seat on the car is also full, and while not packed, it's standing room only. If my choice is to wait 20 mins for the next train, other ways of getting places become a lot more appealing.2. Government services should be good. This is good both because it makes people interested in using them (see 1) and because people who don't have other options deserve good services. The point of government is, at least in part, to serve those who can't serve themselves. I don't expect Bart to be revenue neutral for the same reason I don't expect CalFRESH to be.

reply

That's not true. If you have stations that are revenue positive and stations that are net negative, then cutting ridership at the net-negative stations can put the system in a much better financial position. E.g. If BART didn't end at Antioch, and instead continued to Rio Vista, it's entirely likely that the Rio Vista station would just cost more to operate than is worth operating. It takes time to go back and forth, nobody will ever want to be picked up there because it's car-dependent sprawl.

I'm very obviously going to vote to increase funding, my point is that it shouldn't have to come to a vote. If service is reduced to a more sustainable rate, the system could recover organically. The revenue jump that has happened at stations immediately after the gates were installed, for example, shouldn't surprise anyone. I'm a transit advocate, BART is mostly irrelevant to this discussion anyway, because we're talking about situations where Waymo is a viable alternative, which really doesn't apply to BART.

Or the majority of the residents of New York City on their daily commute? I like to think I have sense, and I happily use public transport most days. I prefer it to sitting in traffic, isolated in a car. At least I can read a book. If you work too hard to insulate yourself from the world, the spaces you'll feel comfortable in will get more and more narrow. I think that's a bad thing.

Even though the train system in Japan is 10x better than the US as a whole, the per-capita vehicle ownership rate in Japan is not much lower than the US (779 per 1000 vs 670 per 1000). It would be a pipe dream for American trains/subways to be as good as Japan, but even a change that significant would lead to a vehicle ownership share reduced by only about 13%.

From the perspective of enactivism and radical empiricism, intelligence doesn't ""represent"" the world; it simply navigates it. A biological organism doesn't need a 3D CAD file of a tree to survive; it only needs a history of sensory-motor contingencies—the ""if I move this way, I see that"" patterns. It's a synthesis of interactions, not a library of blueprints.AI operates on the same logic, albeit through a different medium. It isn't simulating the physical laws of the universe or ""understanding"" gravity. Instead, it navigates the high-dimensional geometry of human data. It's a sophisticated engine of association, performing a high-speed synthesis of the patterns we've left behind.In this view, ""knowing"" isn't about matching an internal image to an external truth. It is the seamless flow of past inputs into future predictions. There is no world model—only the habit of being.

As always tho the devil lies in the details: is an LLM based generation pipeline good enough? What even is the definition of ""good enough""? Even with good prompts will the world model output something sufficiently close to reality so that it can be used as a good virtual driving environment for further training / testing of autonomous cars? Or do the kind of limitations you mentioned still mean subtle but dangerous imprecisions will slip through and cause too poor data distribution to be a truly viable approach?My personal feeling is that this we will land somewhere in between: I think approaches like this one will be very useful, but I also don't think the current state of AI models mean we can have something 100% reliable with this.The question is: is 100% reliability a realistic goal? Human drivers are definitely not 100% reliable. If we come up with a solution 10x more reliable than the best human drivers, that maybe has some also some hard proof that it cannot have certain classes of catastrophic failure modes (probably with verified code based approaches that for instance guarantees that even if the NN output is invalid the car doesn't try to make moves out of a verifiably safe envelope) then I feel like the public and regulators would be much more inclined to authorize full autonomy.

In the example videos, the Golden Gate bridge with snow shows the bridge as 1 road, with total of 3 lanes. But in reality, it's a split highway with divider, so 2 sides both have 3 lanes, 6 total lanes.What happens when the car “learns” to drive on the simulated incorrect 3 lane example? For example will next time it goes on the real GG bridge hug to the rightmost lane?

The driver could have stopped in the praça below and told me to walk 15m up. Instead the guy went all the way up then curved through 5-10 alleys like that to drop me off right right in front of my place. At a significant speed as well. It was one of the craziest car rides I've ever experienced.

Human drivers routinely do worse than Waymo, which I take 2 or 3 times a week. Is it perfect? No. Does it handle the situation better than most Lyft or Uber drivers? Yes.As a bonus: unlike some of those drivers the Waymo doesn't get palpably angry at me for driving the route.

But pedestrian infrastructure is a very simple problem to solve, even in the US.  Just look at how the market responds to public transit projects in the US —- developers trip over themselves to build projects in response to the induced demand.Likewise they also responded to the reduced demand as a result of ripping out public transit infrastructure in the 20th century. Which is why doughnut-shaped cities are common in the US.

Anyway you can think it's a waste but they're wasting their money, not yours. If you want a train in your town, go get one. Waymo has only spent, cumulatively, about 4 months of the budgets of American transit agencies. If you had all that money it wouldn't amount to anything.

reply

Oh come on -- of course they are. That's precisely why you put it in a ""white paper"" and not, you know, ads.

reply

But eventually I think we will get there. Human drivers will be banned, the roads will be exclusively used by autonomous vehicles that are very efficient drivers (we could totally remove stoplights, for example. Only pedestrian crossing signs would be needed. Robo-vehicles could plug into a city-wide network that optimizes the routing of every vehicle.) At that point, public transit becomes subsidized robotaxi rides. Why take a subway when a car can take you door to door with an optimized route?So in terms of why it isn't a waste of time, it's a step along the path towards this vision. We can't flip a switch and make this tech exist, it will happen in gradual steps.

Automation makes public transit better. There will be automated minibuses that are more flexible and frequent than today's buses. Automation also means that buses get a virtual bus lane. Taxis solve the last mile problem, by taking taxi to the station, riding train with thousands of people, and then taking more transit.Also, we might discover the advantage of human powered transit. Ebikes are more efficient than cars and give health benefits. They will be much safer than automated cars. Could use the extra capacity for bike and bus lanes.

In my sleepy metro area that has at least mid-tier respectable public transit (by US standards only), otherwise known as Portland, I think a lot of the routes would be better served by minibuses than full size.  I wonder how the economics work out on that.  Maybe dominated by labor?  Tri-met drivers have a reputation of being paid handsomely as they gain seniority.

I basically agree with your premise that public transit as it exists today will be rendered obsolete, but I think this point here is where your prediction hits a wall.

And in the spirit of that nuance, I will revise my statement slightly.  I think it is entirely possible we will eliminate drivers on 10% of roads.  We have rules that are analogous to that already with limited access highways.  Though I would rate this still as unlikely, since such roads only make up just over 1% of all the roads in the US as it is.  Not sure what the % is for other countries, probably less.> some really dense city will decide to make a tiny core autonomous vehicles onlyAgree 100%, this kind of thing I do expect to see happen.  We already have exclusions for cars altogether in favor of pedestrians, so the precedent is set.

In high density regions, vehicles on surface roads can't meet the passenger demand required. Even if you banned human drivers, the other human users introduce too much variability and delay (passengers loading and unloading, errant objects, cyclists and pedestrians, etc).  Roll a dumpster in the street, and have a couple of jaywalkers, and the entire system crawls to a stop.Controlled access is required to get even medium-high throughput.  But these systems already exist, they are called personal rapid transit systems.

Humans don't drive well because we map vision policy to actions. We drive well (an in general, manipulate physical objects well), because we can do simulations inside our head to predict what the outcome will be. We aren't burdened by our inability  to recognize certain things - when something is in the road, no matter what it is, we auto predict that we would likely collide with that thing because we understand the concept of 3d space and moving within it, and take appropriate action. Sure, there is some level of direct mapping as many people can drive while ""spaced out"", but attentive driving involves mostly the above.The self driving system that can actually self drive needs to do the same. When you have this, you will no longer need to do things like simulate driving conditions in a computationally expensive sim. You aren't going to be concerned with training model on edge cases. All you would need to to ensure that your sensor processing results in a 3d representation of the driving conditions, and the model will then be able to do what humans do and explore a latent space of things it can do and predict outcomes then chose the best one.You want proof? It exists in the form of  Mu Zero, and it worked amazingly well. And driving can be easily reformated as a game that the engine plays in a simulator that doesn't involve vision, and learns both the available moves and also the optimal policy.The reason everyone is doing end to end today is because they are basically trying to catch up to Tesla, and from a business perspective, nobody is willing to put money and pay smart enough people to research this, especially because there is also a legal bridge to cross when it comes to proving that the system can self drive while you napping. But nevertheless, if you ever want self driving, this is the right approach.Meanwhile, Google who came up with Mu Zero, is now doing more advanced robotic stuff than anyone out there.

Having humans in the loop at some level is necessary for handling rare edge cases safely.

reply

The first is the DDT control loop, what a human driver does. Waymo's remote assistants aren't involved in that. The computer always has responsibility for the safety of the vehicle and decisionmaking while operating, which is why Waymo's humans are remote assistants and not remote drivers. Their safety drivers do participate in the DDT loop, hence the name.But there's also another ""loop"" of human involvement. Sometimes the vehicle doesn't understand the scene and asks humans for advice about the appropriate action to take. It's vaguely similar to captchas. The human will usually confirm the computer's proposed actions, but they can also suggest different actions. The computer the advice as a prior to continue operating instead of giving up the DDT responsibility. There's very likely a closely monitored SLA between a few seconds to a few minutes on how long it takes humans to start looking at the scene.If something causes the computer to believe the advice isn't safe, it will ignore it. There have been cases where Waymos have erroneously detected collisions and remote assistants were unable to override that decisionmaking. When that happens, a vehicle recovery team is physically sent out to the location. The SLA here is likely between tens of minutes and a couple hours.

This does bring up something, though: Waymo has a ""pull over"" feature, but it's hidden behind a couple of touch screen actions involving small virtual buttons and it does not pull over immediately. Instead, it ""finds a spot to pull over"". I would very much like a big red STOP IMMEDIATELY button in these vehicles.

The satellite internet race is ramping up. In the years since SpaceX launched its first batch of Starlinks back in 2019, numerous competitors have entered the market, including two you've almost definitely heard about lately: Amazon Leo and Blue Origin's newly announced TeraWave.

Starlink, Amazon Leo, and TeraWave are far from the only players in this rapidly growing industry, but they stand out because of their massive financial backings and the ambitious strategic visions of their respective billionaire owners. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk oversees Starlink, while Jeff Bezos—through Amazon and Blue Origin—is developing Amazon Leo and TeraWave.

Each of these brands has taken a unique approach to building the next generation of satellite internet technology. Understanding the differences between them is key to grasping how the future of global connectivity may unfold. So, without further ado, let's dive in.

The first thing to understand is that these networks came on the scene at different times, and their parent companies have chosen different deployment strategies. As a result, they are in various stages of development.

Starlink is by far the most mature of the three. SpaceX was first to market with its satellite project, announcing it in 2015. Since the start of deployment in 2019, the company has rapidly built up the Starlink megaconstellation through hundreds of launches aboard its Falcon 9 rocket, with 9,555 Starlinks currently active and providing broadband internet to millions worldwide.

Amazon unveiled plans to develop a competitor—called Project Kuiper at the time—about one month before SpaceX launched its first batch of operational Starlinks, “but was much slower to really ramp up and start production,” Kevin Bell, senior vice president of the Engineering and Technology Group (ETG) at The Aerospace Corporation, told Gizmodo. “Some of that was satellite driven, some of that was rocket driven,” Bell explained.

While SpaceX's approach to Starlink development prioritized rapid iteration and deployment, Amazon took its time finalizing the design of its satellites and conducted more extensive prototype testing. Because Amazon does not have its own rockets to support satellite deployment, it partners with launch providers—including SpaceX—to build its constellation.

The company launched its first operational batch of satellites aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket in April 2025. The next launch, set for February 12, will bring the constellation (now called Amazon Leo) up to 212 satellites. Because it is still in the early days of scaling, the service has not yet launched commercially.

Then there's TeraWave, the newcomer. Blue Origin announced the project on January 21, setting a goal to begin deployment by the first quarter of 2027. The company will presumably use its New Glenn rocket to launch its satellites, but that has not yet been confirmed. According to the announcement, the TeraWave constellation will ultimately scale to 5,408 satellites situated in low-Earth orbit (where Starlink and Amazon Leo reside) and in medium-Earth orbit.

That's larger than Amazon Leo's planned deployment of 3,236 satellites, but if Musk gets his way, Starlink will eclipse both of Bezos's constellations. The Federal Communications Commission recently approved a SpaceX application to launch up to a million more Starlinks for the purpose of building an orbital data center.

Broadly speaking, the satellite internet industry serves two types of customers: enterprise and individual users. But according to Bell, these markets can be further divided into five core segments, namely direct to device, direct to consumer, high bandwidth (for business-scale users), backhaul (providing connectivity to underserved areas), and sovereign government.

“While Starlink is really kind of spread across all of them, Amazon and TeraWave have chosen—at least initially—to position themselves towards the higher end,” Bell said.

Starlink indeed serves a diverse array of users, from individuals to the American government. Its primary customer base, however, consists of people living in rural and remote areas who lack access to reliable, high-speed internet. Amazon Leo ultimately plans to target that market, but its initial phase of deployment will serve select enterprise, government, and telecommunications customers.

TeraWave is unique in that it is not at all geared toward individual customers. This network will serve “tens of thousands” of enterprise, data center, and government users, according to Blue Origin.

“One of the big differences there is that, typically, an enterprise would negotiate a service level agreement—so there is a requirement that the company be able to provide a certain level of speed, a certain level of capacity,” Tom Stroup, president of the Satellite Industry Association, told Gizmodo.

To meet that demand, Blue Origin will design TeraWave to deliver data speeds of up to 6 terabits per second anywhere on Earth. By comparison, Starlink and Amazon Leo offer speeds ranging from hundreds of megabits to around 1 gigabit per second, which is suitable for individuals and some enterprise customers but not tailored toward high-capacity backhaul or large-scale enterprise operations.

As these networks grow, the satellite internet industry is undergoing a rapid transformation. Competition between them—and their many other competitors—will continue to drive innovation, bringing faster speeds, higher capacity, and broader coverage to users around the world.

“Each generation of satellite that is being launched has greater speed and capacity than the prior generation,” Stroup said. “We're just iterating much more quickly than ever before.”

When Super Bowl LX rolls around this year, all eyes will be on the NFL. That includes, on average, a gargantuan audience of 120 million human viewers from across the U.S. (around one-third of the country), but also more untraditional eyes—ones of a non-human variety.

In addition to football fans and people who just want to mindlessly watch advertisements, there will be an armada of cameras fixing their gaze on Levi Stadium in San Francisco. Those “eyes” are dedicated to capturing each and every solitary moment of the sport's most pivotal day—big plays, fan reactions, and any potential Janet Jackson-style “wardrobe malfunctions,” just to name a few. Some of those all-seeing eyes might even wind up tipping the scales of the game—especially the ones made by Sony.

This year's impending Super Bowl will be just the first ever to feature Sony's Hawk-Eye tech, a camera system that uses a half dozen 8K cameras installed in the catwalks of NFL stadiums to assist on-field officials with the critical task of determining the line to gain. For those not fluent in NFL lingo, that's the line—the yellow one superimposed on TV broadcasts—that teams need to reach in order to keep their offense on the field. (The 2025 season, for context, is the first full season where Hawk-Eye was used ubiquitously across the league to provide virtual measurements, though it was tested initially in 2024.)

While the players themselves work as a team to win the NFL's biggest game, Sony's Hawk-Eye cameras and the NFL officiating apparatus work as their own kind of team. After footage is captured by the cameras, it's then sent to the NFL's Art McNally GameDay Central Officiating Center in New York. From there, on-field officials are informed of the distance, while virtual recreations of those measurements are made to be shown to the in-stadium audience and anyone watching on TV in real time.

It might not sound like a lot, but for diehard fans and the teams in the game, it's a critical facet in determining whether, after 22 weeks of grueling televised violence, a team walks away with the Lombardi Trophy and some shiny new rings or with empty hands and a demoralizing start to the offseason.

Obviously, with those kinds of stakes, the pressure is on Sony for its systems to really get things right.

“As the biggest game and the most-watched show of the year, the Super Bowl production requires tools we can trust,” said Ken Goss, NBC Sports EVP of Studio and Remote Operations, in a statement leading up to Super Bowl LX. “Working with Sony allows us to flawlessly deliver every angle, replay, and on-field moment to viewers watching around the world.”

While this is the first year that Sony's Hawk-Eye cameras were used frequently in the NFL for virtual measurements and in the Super Bowl, the technology has actually been implemented in other sports for similar purposes. In tennis, the tech is famously used for automated line-calling, determining whether the ball is in or out, and deciding which player gets awarded points. In this capacity, the tech is apparently accurate within an impressive 5mm. In soccer, Hawk-Eye can be of equal importance, since it's used to determine whether the entire ball has crossed the line and whether a goal has been scored—not a minor task in a sport that is often decided by one score.

The NFL also implemented Hawk-Eye to assist with replay assistance in 2021, though that stopped short of determining concrete stuff on a consistent basis, like the line to gain.

It's clear that professional sports have faith in the efficacy of Hawk-Eye for making critical decisions, but as important as Sony's cameras have become, there is one thing they still do not do in the NFL; neither Sony, nor the NFL uses Hawk-Eye to actually spot the ball. Instead, Hawk-Eye cameras are secondary to the referee's official spotting of the ball, with the ref determining where the ball wound up and Hawk-Eye determining what the player's distance to a first down is based on that spot.

The NFL says Hawk-Eye is simply a faster alternative to old-school chain gangs, though it keeps referees with orange sticks on the sideline in the event that the technology fails. Here's the official use for Hawk-Eye according to the NFL:

“Sony's Hawk-Eye virtual measurement technology will serve as an efficient alternative to the process of walking chains onto the field and manually measuring whether 10 yards have been met after the official has spotted the ball.”

According to the NFL, the full process of using Hawk-Eye takes about 30 seconds, which saves 40 seconds compared to the previous method of sending out real humans with a chain to decide the line to gain.

In short, that means that the human referees, despite the eye in the sky they now have, are the ones determining how far a player actually gets and whether teams have to relinquish possession or go for broke and risk going for it on 4th down and potentially turning the ball over on downs.

It may seem odd not to use this advanced tech to potentially improve the accuracy of the game, but according to former NFL referee Jeff Bergman, who worked as an NFL line judge for 30 years until retiring in 2023, things aren't as straightforward as they seem.

“Spotting the ball is an art,” Bergman tells Gizmodo. “When the ball carrier is being tackled, you're looking for a body part other than the hands or the feet to hit the ground. And then you have to know where the forward-most point of the ball is, and you have to make sure the ball isn't coming out. So, there are four or five different things you have to be aware of.”

And as to whether Hawk-Eye is actually speeding the game up, Bergman, who was officiating in the NFL when Hawk-Eye was merely being tested on replay assistance in 2021, is even more skeptical.

“They used it [Hawk-Eye] in the past, but it was only half-baked. And from what I saw this year, I believe it's still only half-baked,” Bergman says. “The thought process behind the virtual measurement was to expedite the measuring and speed up the game. Well, it actually takes a lot longer. And then the virtual measurement ultimately comes out, and it says it's two feet, eight inches short. Well, on the field, we know it's less than a foot.”

Sony did not wish to comment for this story.

Imperfect or not, there's a vocal constituent of people who would like to see Hawk-Eye, or technology like it, go further. Take a stroll through Reddit, YouTube, or online sports punditry, and you'll see plenty of feedback urging the NFL to introduce more technology like Hawk-Eye to make rulings more consistent and accurate.

Even Bergman, a skeptic though he may be, is open to the expansion of technology in the NFL, telling Gizmodo, “Any type of additional intel that you can get as an official to help you make decisions is something that should be really embraced.”

The NFL, for its part, hasn't given any indication that it plans to further move the needle on using tech to make calls like that on the field, though. Here's what NFL executive, Kimberly Fields, told the Associated Press almost exactly a year ago when asked about Hawk-Eye:

“What this technology cannot do is take the place of the human element in determining where forward progress ends… There will always be a human official spotting the ball. Once the ball is spotted, then the line-to-gain technology actually does the measurement itself. So I think it's probably been a point of confusion around what the technology can and can't do. There will always be a human element because of the forward progress conversation.”

Gizmodo reached out to the NFL, but a representative was not made available for comment in time for publication.

The NFL does have other technologies outside of Hawk-Eye tech that seem promising, but those are also imperfect for the time being. For example, in 2017, the NFL put RFID chips inside the ball that can record all sorts of data. While those chips are capable of determining ball position, they fall short of being able to measure forward progress, which is the football terminology for how far a player gets before being officially ruled down.

There are a few reasons why those chips don't suffice for ball spotting, but a major one is that they (even advanced ultra-wideband ones) have a margin of error of six or more inches, which is about half the length of a football. A distance like that can be the difference between a first down and a change of possession. In short, it could potentially change the game. Then again, so could a shoddy spot by the referee.

Bergman, for his part, says he'd like to see technology be used to make officials better at their jobs, not replace their say on the field entirely.

“Utilizing the technology is critically important to a game official, but you really have to embrace that, and you have to want to do it. And you have to be taught to do it the proper way,” Bergman says. “I'm huge on technology, but it has to be able to be as reliable as the people on the field, and it has to expedite the play, not slow it down.”

Whether the NFL has the means to make that happen or if the tech world can even marshal the know-how to make the process work is still an open question. Gizmodo reached out to another provider of technology to the NFL, Catapult, which makes similar player-tracking tech that can monitor metrics in practices, determining things like speed and injury risk, but didn't exactly get a straight answer on whether a ball-spotting future for technology is a real possibility.

“The sports industry has made great strides, but we've only just begun to unlock the power of performance tech,” Matt Bairos, Chief Product Officer at Catapult, said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. “Football has always been a video-first sport. Coaches think, teach, and make decisions through video. But the real breakthrough, the seamless fusion of video with live, trusted athlete data, is starting to happen now.”

That sounds grand, but not everyone is optimistic about the future of sports tech like Hawk-Eye. Bergman, retired from a life in the NFL though he may be, saw a different future on the field this year—a much longer one.

“If you are having difficulties determining if the ball has made the line to gain, you'll be light years away from trying to determine where the spot of the ball is,” Bergman says.

G.Skill has entered the 128GB (2x64GB) race and brought the Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 C34 to dethrone the best RAM. Finding reasonably priced DDR5 memory kits has become increasingly challenging, let alone procuring 128GB memory kits. First, manufacturing these massive dual-channel memory kits requires 64GB modules that push production costs through the roof. Second, the memory shortage has left most major retailers showing limited stock and manufacturers scrambling to meet even basic demand, so there aren't many premium enthusiast-grade kits being released. Therefore, G.Skill's Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 C34 memory kit is worth paying attention to if you have the cash for such a hefty kit.

G.Skill has always understood that premium memory deserves premium aesthetics, and the Trident Z5 Neo RGB memory modules are the perfect example. The meticulously crafted aluminum heat spreader features a matte black exterior, a complementary black brushed aluminum inset, and silver highlights, making the fin-like design stand out. At a builder-friendly 1.65 inches (42mm) tall, we expect these memory modules to slide effortlessly under even the most aggressive CPU air coolers without any clearance nightmares.

Crowning each memory module is a streamlined RGB light bar with vibrant colors and illumination. G.Skill offers two alternatives for RGB customization and control: its dedicated Trident Z Lighting Control software or seamless integration with your motherboard's native RGB software. Choose the latter route, and you'll find the Trident Z5 Neo RGB fits in nicely with all the major platforms, including Asus Aura Sync, Gigabyte RGB Fusion 2.0, MSI Mystic Light Sync, and ASRock Polychrome Sync.

At the heart of this kit are two 64GB DDR5 memory modules, each with a dual-rank design, which is essential for achieving this level of capacity. Each memory module houses 16 individual integrated circuits (ICs), with eight soldered chips on each side of the black PCB. Each of these ICs contributes 4GB of capacity. Surprisingly, G.Skill utilizes Samsung K4RBH086VM-BCWM (M-die) ICs for this particular in lieu of SK hynix's M-die. Meanwhile, the company has entrusted power distribution to Richtek, which supplies power management IC (PMIC) bearing the ""0P=CF MY2"" marking.

In its default stock configuration, the memory modules operate at DDR5-5600 with relaxed 46-45-45-90 timings to ensure maximum compatibility across a wide range of system configurations. G.Skill includes only a single overclocking profile, conveniently available in both Intel XMP 3.0 and AMD EXPO formats. When you enable the DDR5-6000 profile through your motherboard's BIOS, the memory kit will automatically reconfigure itself to run at the higher frequency with tightened 34-44-44-96 timings and adjust the DRAM voltage to 1.35V.

Thanks to its higher data rate and optimized timings, the Manta XFinity memory kit outperformed the Trident Z5 Neo in the majority of the scenarios. However, the Trident Z5 Neo edged ahead in the Adobe Lightroom benchmark. It shows that performance can vary depending on the workload.

On the AMD platform, the Ryzen processor's integrated memory controller (IMC) determines whether the unified memory controller clock (UCLK) and memory clock (MEMCLK) can run in a 1:1 ratio with memory above DDR5-6000. With our Ryzen 9 9900X, DDR5-6400 forces a 2:1 ratio, which imposes a performance penalty on the Manta XFinity. That's the reason why the Trident Z5 Neo came out on top.

Sometimes you already know how an overclock will likely turn out, but it's still fun to push memory beyond the manufacturer's specifications.

On this occasion, we overclocked the memory from DDR5-6000 to DDR5-6333 while maintaining the memory timings at 34-44-44-96, with DRAM voltage increased from 1.35V to 1.45V. It just goes to show that high-capacity memory modules are difficult to overclock, even when applying substantial voltage.

The CAS Latency (CL) was unlikely to cooperate since G.Skill probably binned it to the limit. The other timings, however, responded well with 1.45V applied. We managed to decrease the tRCD and tRP by four clock cycles and the tRAS by 12 clock cycles, a solid result overall.

From a compatibility standpoint, DDR5-6000 is more likely to run perfectly on AMD's platform without any performance penalty than DDR5-6400. That's why many budget-conscious buyers choose DDR5-6000, and it's where the Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 C34 excels. G.Skill's memory kit delivers the complete package: beautiful aesthetics, good performance, and more than generous capacity. It's just a victim of the unfortunate circumstances of a global memory shortage that is pushing up pricing.

The Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 C34 launched with a $419.99 MSRP just a couple of months ago. Fast forward to today, in the middle of a global DRAM shortage, and the price tag has skyrocketed to $1,599.99. On the bright side, Newegg generously includes a $50 Starbucks gift card so you can “drink coffee while you game.” Jokes aside, the Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 C34 is an excellent memory kit that's worth every dollar once pricing stabilizes.

This is a fun mod, but is a thermal printer more useful than a floppy drive in 2026?

A retro computer enthusiast has fitted a thermal printer into an ancient Apple Macintosh Plus. A short video clip shared on social media shows the mod is effective and, dare we say, practical. The otherwise redundant floppy drive in this Mac Mini brain transplanted desktop looks almost perfect for spewing forth coils of thermal copy paper.

1円で落札したサーマルプリンタをMac mini仕込んだMacintoshに入れてみた。なんとなくなりたい事がわかってきた様な気がする。 pic.twitter.com/Lb4z8lVj2QFebruary 5, 2026

The original Apple Macintosh has such iconic computing appeal that it is natural that enthusiasts repurpose the old chassis if or when the innards deteriorate beyond repair. But what do you make of the cutout where the floppy drive used to be?

The above perfectly valid answer is provided by Japanese pickle store manager and Mac enthusiast, Meinan, on X. Apparently, they were lucky enough to get this thermal printer in some kind of auction for ‘1 yen', and were looking for a good way to make use of it. We don't know how it is hooked up to the computer, but would guess it simply interfaces via USB, like printers have done for decades now.

A brief glance at the display of this Mac Plus, shows that it has been seriously ungraded in the processing department too. Gone is the low-res mono CRT, and a vibrant LCD display is fitted in the frame. Powering the modern mac OS system you see running is some version of the Mac Mini.

In some ways it is a shame that Meinan's machine couldn't be preserved in its original configuration, of course. But we don't know what happened to this aged computer before its shell was reused. It seems to be a particularly interesting cross-generation sample. The shell mixes a Mac 128K facia, with a Plus 1Mb rear housing (and contents at one time) making it a possibly rare transition machine.

Overall, the thermal printer mod is a pretty interesting one. The project reminds us of the iMac G4 ‘lamp shade' revitalization mod by Action Retro in 2024. Similarly, a Mac Mini was squeezed into the retro-shell in that project. Sadly, Action Retro didn't reuse the vestigial optical drive during that mod, which seemed like a missed opportunity.

Over the years, we've seen plenty of attempts by DIY modders and PC enthusiasts to shrink gaming PCs down to the size of traditional game consoles. This is often done with the goal of enjoying PC gaming on a large TV from the comfort of their couch. From custom small form factor builds to console-inspired enclosures, the idea of a living room-friendly PC isn't exactly new. However, a modder on YouTube by the name of PhasedTech has taken this concept to a whole new level by cramming an entire desktop PC inside a svelte Xbox One S.

Now there have been similar projects in the past where modders have managed to install an entire PC inside the chassis of an old console. But, as pointed out in the video, most of them rely on an external power brick and / or integrated graphics. To make the project a bit more challenging, PhasedTech set out to use an internal power supply, a discrete graphics card, as well as an optical disc drive so the system could functionally mimic the original console. Additionally, the build avoids the use of glue, ensuring that all components are properly mounted and bolted in for a more professional finish. Lastly, only the rear and bottom of the chassis have been modified, with no changes allowed to the front, sides, or top panels.

Since the Xbox One S has a volume of approximately 4.4 liters, the parts chosen for the project had to be compact and consume relatively low power. For that reason, the hardware leans more towards a balanced console-like setup rather than a high-end gaming PC. The modder used a mini-ITX motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU cooled by a Noctua NH-L9i, along with 16GB of DDR4 ultra-low-profile memory. For storage, the system uses a standard NVMe SSD, a 250W flex PSU to provide power, and a low-profile single-slot Nvidia RTX 3050 to handle the graphics.

After separating the outer chassis from the core internals of the Xbox Series S, the modder began by laying out all the components to get a sense of where each part will go. They then shaved off some internal supports to make room for the hardware, followed by drilling a few holes to secure the power supply and motherboard using standoffs. Using a custom right-angle mount and screws, a USB Type-A extender cable is installed at the front of the console chassis.

For the optical disc drive, the modder soldered two wires to the drive's eject switch, with the other ends connected to a micro switch. This micro switch is intended to be used with the original Xbox eject button, enabling the disc drive to be controlled using the console's built-in button. After a quick test of the optical drive, all the power supply cables are installed, followed by preparation of the top half of the chassis.

By making use of two threaded mounting points and some plastic grooves inside the top chassis, the modder 3D-printed a two-part custom bracket to securely mount the disc drive, GPU riser cable, power button, and eject button in place. Notably a four-lane PCIe riser cable is used due to the limited internal space as opposed to a traditional 16-lane cable. Fortunately that does not impact the performance of the GPU used for the build. After installing the disc drive, power/eject buttons, GPU, and a bit of cabling, the top and bottom chassis are snapped back together, along with two custom 3D printed I/O shields for the rear.

The system boots into Windows without any issues, but due to the relatively low-end hardware, it is best suited for less resource-intensive and eSports titles. According to PhasedTech, games like Valorant and Counter-Strike 2 can push to 200 FPS at 1080p using medium settings, with temperatures reaching up to 80°C. While they haven't offered any extended benchmark results, the project stands out for being able to balance performance, thermals, and functionality within the limited space of a console chassis, while preserving the original look and feel of the original Xbox One S.

Rice University bioengineer Antonios Mikos is part of a team of researchers led by the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine awarded up to $24.8 million over five years to help address the nation's growing organ donor shortage by bioprinting on-demand kidney tissues.

The new funding, from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), will enable the team to produce bioprinted, vascularized kidney tissue that augments renal function in patients suffering from kidney disease. The implantable kidney tissue will be made from a patient's own cells combined with a bioink that supports the long-term viability of the implanted cells.

""Our key efforts are going to focus on the development of the bioinks, which are 3D printable inks that can host cells,"" said Vasiliki Kolliopoulos, a postdoctoral researcher in the Mikos lab who is working on the project. ""These are highly complex materials that have to not only be able to mimic the tissue microenvironment but that can also sustain cells over their culture period prior to them being implanted.""

The task will involve developing a library of bioinks that can be adapted to different patients and also vascularizing the 3D-printed constructs to enable their long-term maintenance and function in the body.

The project will draw on the extensive experience in the development of bioinks ⎯ including tissue-mimicking bioinks ⎯ of the Mikos group and will benefit from the resources and infrastructure at the Biomaterials Lab at Rice.

The funding comes from the Personalized Regenerative Immunocompetent Nanotechnology Tissue (PRINT) program at ARPA-H, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. PRINT will use state-of-the-art bioprinting technology and a regenerative medicine approach to 3D-print personalized, on-demand human organs that do not require immunosuppressive drugs.

This aims to solve the critical problems of organ shortage and transplantation risks in the United States. There are 120,000 people on waiting lists for an organ, but only 45,000 transplants are performed annually. In addition, transplanted organs last about 15 to 23 years on average and require immunosuppressive drugs for life.

""Just as tissue engineering is considered a convergent science that requires the convergence of many different disciplines, ARPA-H funding mechanisms like PRINT allow for the convergence of different laboratories, different institutions that contribute different expertise needed to address a major health care problem ⎯ in this case, kidney disease,"" said Mikos, the Louis Calder Professor of Bioengineering and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and director of the Biomaterials Lab, the Center for Excellence in Tissue Engineering and the J.W. Cox Laboratory for Biomedical Engineering at Rice.

Mikos said the project builds on a long history of collaboration between researchers at Rice, Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine and the University of Maryland. Other program partners include PrintBio Inc. and the University of Texas at El Paso.

""We're really excited to take part in such a significant project and to be able to contribute towards the next generation of patient care,"" Kolliopoulos said.

The project also includes plans to develop a scalable pathway for the manufacturing and commercialization of personalized bioprinted organs and tissues.

What we are trying to do with PRINT is extraordinarily hard. It requires major breakthroughs in cell manufacturing, bioreactor design and 3D-printing technology to reliably build organs that function like the real thing. But if we succeed, we won't just be giving patients faster access to new organs - we will change the foundation of transplantation itself. The advances from this program could dramatically reduce wait times, eliminate the need for lifelong immunosuppressive drugs and open the door to bioprinted solutions for many other organs in the future.""

Ovarian cancer kills more women than any other gynecological cancer. Most patients receive their diagnosis only after the disease spreads throughout the abdomen. Until now, scientists have never fully understood why this cancer advances so fast. A new study led by Nagoya University explains why. Published in Science Advances, the study shows that cancer cells recruit help from protective mesothelial cells that normally line the abdominal cavity. Mesothelial cells lead the invasion and cancer cells follow the pathways they create. These hybrid cell clusters resist chemotherapy better than cancer alone. Researchers examined abdominal fluid from ovarian cancer patients and found something unexpected. Cancer cells do not float alone in the abdominal cavity. Instead, they often grab onto mesothelial cells and form hybrid spheres. About 60% of all cancer spheres contain these recruited mesothelial cells. The cancer cells release a protein called TGF-β1 that transforms the mesothelial cells and causes them to develop spike-like structures that cut through tissue. 

When ovarian cancer develops, cancer cells break off from the tumor. These cells enter the abdominal fluid and float freely. The fluid moves around as you breathe and move your body. This movement carries the cancer cells to different spots in the abdomen. Most other cancers spread differently. Breast cancer or lung cancer cells enter blood vessels. They travel through the bloodstream to reach distant organs. Doctors can sometimes track these cancers through blood tests because blood moves in predictable paths through vessels. Ovarian cancer cells avoid blood vessels entirely. They float in fluid that has no fixed path. This floating stage happens before the cancer cells attach to new organs. Scientists did not fully understand what happened during the floating period or how cells worked together to spread cancer so quickly. The research team discovered that cancer cells recruit protective mesothelial cells that have shed from the abdominal cavity lining during this floating stage. The two cell types stick together and form hybrid spheres. The mesothelial cells then grow invadopodia, spike-like structures that drill into surrounding tissue. The hybrid spheres resist chemotherapy drugs more effectively and invade tissues faster when they land on organs. 

 The researchers examined abdominal fluid from ovarian cancer patients using advanced microscopy to watch this process in real time. They confirmed their findings with mouse models and single-cell genetic analysis. Lead author Dr. Kaname Uno, a former PhD student and current Visiting Researcher at Nagoya University's Graduate School of Medicine, explained that the cancer cells do not need to become more invasive themselves. ""They manipulate mesothelial cells to do the tissue invasion work. They undergo minimal genetic and molecular changes and just migrate through the openings that mesothelial cells create."" Dr. Uno worked as a gynecologist for eight years before he pursued research. One of his patients changed his career path. She had clear screening results just three months before doctors found advanced ovarian cancer. Current medical tools failed to detect the cancer early enough to save her life. This motivated Dr. Uno to investigate why ovarian cancer spreads so rapidly. This discovery opens new treatment possibilities. Current chemotherapy targets cancer cells but ignores the mesothelial accomplices. Future drugs could block the TGF-β1 signal or prevent the formation of these dangerous partnerships. The research also suggests that doctors could monitor these cell clusters in abdominal fluid to predict disease progression and treatment response.

In infants and toddlers who had a stroke before birth or as a newborn (28 days or younger), a treatment that combined restricting the use of the stronger arm with intensive task-oriented physical therapy led to improved function and skill gained on the weak side compared to standard care, according to preliminary late-breaking science presented today at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference 2026. The meeting, Feb. 4 - 6, 2026, in New Orleans, is a world premier meeting for researchers and clinicians dedicated to the science of stroke and brain health.

Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS) is the most common form of stroke in children, which causes functional impairment and limited voluntary motor control on one side of the body, a condition known as hemiparesis.

Constraint-induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is a rehabilitation approach to improve use of an impaired upper extremity, helping to rewire the brain after injury such as a stroke. In this study, treatment with CIMT for very young children after a stroke was designed to increase the use of the more-affected arm and hand. The treatment included intensive motor therapy that was task-oriented and guided by learning principles to improve motor function, coordination and independence in daily activities by restricting the use of the stronger arm and hand with a lightweight cast.

This study is the first to evaluate the potential impact of this form of CIMT, which is delivered in the child's home or natural settings and includes a parent program to help children in this age range after perinatal strokes.

This research fills a knowledge gap. Previously, parents and physicians relied on findings from a mixed group of mostly older children with cerebral palsy and hemiparesis to make treatment recommendations; however, these findings lacked sufficient data about benefits for this clinical population of infants and toddlers. Now, we confidently know that this treatment, at both dosages, was well-received, safe and produced measurable benefits.""

Sharon Ramey, Ph.D., study author, co-director of the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute Neuromotor Research Clinic, a distinguished scholar and professor, Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, and professor, department of psychiatry and behavioral medicine, Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine in Roanoke, Virginia

In this Phase 3, randomized clinical trial (a large-scale study to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment) testing the I-ACQUIRE treatment, researchers enrolled 216 children, ages 8 months to 36 months, at 15 different U.S. universities and hospitals; outcomes from 167 children were included in today's presentation. Parents granted permission for their children to participate.

The children were randomly placed into one of three groups:

All therapy was focused on helping children gain new skills and increase their daily use of their more-impaired arm and hand.

Certified assessors, who were unaware (blinded) of which treatment group the child was enrolled in, measured each child's arm and hand skills before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at six months after treatment. The focus was on specific skills related to using the hand and arm for fine and some larger movements. In addition, parents provided ratings of their child's functional performance in a wide range of typical home activities.

The analysis found:

""Unexpectedly, children in the usual care group also showed clinically important improvement in their arm and hand skills at six months,"" Ramey said. These included changes such as reaching out, grasping and releasing an object, using the more impaired arm in activities that promote balance, crawling and protective extension. However, the parent ratings for their children's everyday use of the more-impaired limb did not indicate that parents saw real-world improvements at either the end of treatment or six months later for those receiving the usual care.

""We had expected a larger number of skills to be gained from the I-ACQUIRE therapy,"" Ramey said. ""We think this finding may reflect two likely reasons: first, as a group, children with Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke may show greater differences in their responses to this treatment – some benefit much more than others – compared to findings from prior studies on other clinical populations. Identifying which children benefit the most, or the least, will be very important going forward.""

""We think the potential for an infant to recover from an early stroke far exceeds what was once considered a fairly grim prognosis,"" Ramey said. ""We repeatedly heard from parents that the many changes they saw in their children exceeded what they had been told was likely for their child. In turn, when they saw these improvements, they increased their own expectations for the future and their child's likely success in participating in a wider range of age-typical activities at home and in the community.""

The study showed that researchers can conduct these studies carefully and that families and clinicians can follow the treatment plan effectively. Other study strengths included the ability to closely monitor participants to ensure proper enrollment, therapy implementation, adherence to assessment standards and data quality. The study focused on a group of young children who had not been specifically examined in previous research to improve arm strength and mobility.

The study's limitations include that the 15 U.S. sites were selected based on their interest levels and if they had the resources needed to conduct the trial. These sites may not be representative of all the places where children with PAIS receive care and rehabilitation. Another limitation is that researchers enrolled and treated a small number of children whose parents stated that the child had PAIS, yet the independent specialist review did not confirm that the child had this form of stroke. This led to a reduced study sample size of only 167 children.

A new study from National Jewish Health helps explain how exposure to burn pit smoke and desert dust may damage the lungs of military service members deployed to regions such as Afghanistan and Iraq. The research, published in Free Radical Biology and Medicine(Opens in a new window), sheds light on why veterans exposed to these environments face higher rates of asthma and other long-term respiratory conditions.

Burn pits, which are used to dispose of waste during military operations, release tiny particles into the air. These particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, but until now, scientists have not fully understood how they trigger lasting lung damage. In this study, researchers compared particulate matter collected from Afghanistan with similar desert dust from California to better understand their effects on lung immune cells.

The findings show that particles linked to burn pit exposure cause stronger inflammation and stress in lung immune cells than typical desert dust. These particles activate an immune response that can lead to ongoing inflammation and tissue damage, helping explain why some service members develop chronic breathing problems after deployment.

This study provides important insight into how deployment-related particulate matter affects immune cells in the lungs. Our findings identify the Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2) as a key mediator of inflammation caused by burn pit–associated particulate matter and suggest that targeting this pathway may offer new strategies to protect or treat individuals exposed during military service.""

Brian Day, PhD, vice president of research and, director of the Office of Research Innovation at National Jewish Health, and principal investigator of the study

Using pre-clinical monocyte cell lines and primary bone marrow–derived macrophages, researchers evaluated how Afghanistan desert particulate matter (APM) and California desert particulate matter (CPM) affect immune signaling and inflammatory responses. They measured the production of nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide and inflammatory cytokines, which are key drivers of lung inflammation and tissue damage.

The results showed that APM was significantly more toxic to macrophages than CPM, producing stronger oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that deployment-related particulate exposure may place warfighters at heightened risk for long-term respiratory disease.

 Key findings include:

The research represents a significant step toward understanding the biological basis of deployment-related respiratory disease. It provides new information to help guide future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for affected veterans and service members.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","American women show varied preferences for in-clinic versus at-home cervical cancer screening","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260207/American-women-show-varied-preferences-for-in-clinic-versus-at-home-cervical-cancer-screening.aspx","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 02:32:00 GMT","

American women now have the option of screening for cervical cancer at home, using newly approved self-collection tools. While experts hope this will increase uptake in the under-screened population, a first-of-its kind study by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center found the majority (60.8%) still prefer to see a medical professional in-clinic.

The study, published today in JAMA Network Open, also revealed that marginalized were more likely to prefer at-home self-sampling, and women with low income and those who do not trust the health care system were more likely to be uncertain about which option to choose. Of 2,300 screening-eligible women, just 20.4% prefer to screen for cervical cancer at home, and 18.8% were unsure about their choice.

Home-based self-sampling has the potential to remove many of the barriers women face when it comes to cervical cancer screening. By expanding screening options and pairing them with targeted education, we can empower more women to participate in screening in a way that fits their lives.""

Sanjay Shete, Ph.D., lead author, deputy division head of Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences

While cervical cancer screening rates have increased over the last 25 years, there has been a shift since the COVID-19 pandemic toward decreased annual screening coverage. Experts say there is still a need to improve cervical cancer screening uptake among under-screened populations, and this study suggests that these groups would benefit from having options that best fit their preference.

In the study, Black women were less likely to prefer at-home self-sampling versus clinic-based testing compared to white women. On the other hand, individuals who were overdue for screening were most likely to prefer at-home kits, as were those who had experienced prejudice or discrimination when getting medical care. The most reported reasons for preferring at-home self-sampling were privacy (54.9%), time constraints (35.1%) and avoiding embarrassment (33.4%).

Both the Health Resources and Services Administration and the American Cancer Society have adopted home-based self-collection for cervical cancer screening.

""Major public health and medical organizations should consider updating their recommendations to include home-based self-sampling. This policy shift could play a critical role in reducing screening inequities and improving uptake among populations that have historically been underserved,"" said co-author Joël Fokom Domgue, M.D., senior researcher of Epidemiology.

This cross-sectional study was based on data from the 2024 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults in the civilian population. This study included all women aged 21-65 who completed the survey and were eligible for cervical cancer screening as per U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. The individuals also had to have responded to the cervical cancer screening questions.

Limitations of the study include the cross-sectional nature of HINTS, a lack of familiarity with the new at-home screening kits, the fact that the FDA has not approved the self-collection tool at the time of the HINTS survey, and that data and prior screening history was not collected as a part of HINTS.

New research from CU Anschutz scientists suggests that staying physically active after heart rhythm treatment may significantly reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) returning, offering patients a simple, low-cost way to support long-term heart health.

The study, published this month in the Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology, found that adults who engaged in regular, moderate physical activity after catheter ablation had markedly lower rates of AF recurrence compared with those who were less active.

Atrial fibrillation often comes back even after a technically successful ablation, which can be frustrating for patients and clinicians alike. Our findings suggest that moderate exercise for 30 minutes three times a week, something most people can realistically do, may help protect against recurrence after undergoing catheter ablation.""

Lohit Garg, MBBS, assistant professor of cardiology, CU Anschutz School of Medicine and lead author of the study

Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder worldwide and is linked to a higher risk of stroke, heart failure and repeated hospitalizations. Catheter ablation is a widely used treatment that restores normal rhythm, but recurrence remains a persistent challenge. The CU Anschutz study examined whether post-procedure lifestyle behaviors could influence outcomes.

Researchers analyzed data from 163 adults who underwent catheter ablation and tracked both their physical activity levels using wearables and heart rhythm outcomes over time.

""For many patients, recovery after ablation raises questions about what they can do beyond medications or procedures to reduce the chances of recurrent AF,"" Garg said. ""This study suggests that physical activity may directly support the durability of AF treatment.""

The researchers also observed that regular physical activity is associated with better blood pressure control, improved sleep, mood and weight management, all of which are known contributors to heart rhythm stability.

""Exercise should be part of the post-ablation conversation,"" Garg said. ""It's one of the few interventions patients can control themselves that may meaningfully affect their long-term recovery.""

The study's authors emphasized that patients should always consult their healthcare provider before beginning or changing an exercise routine, particularly following a heart procedure.

Stroke patients treated intravenously with loberamisal, a novel neuroprotective medication, daily for 10 days and starting within 48 hours of stroke symptoms, had better recovery than patients who received a placebo, according to a preliminary late-breaking science presentation at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference 2026. The meeting, from February 4 to 6, 2026, in New Orleans, is a world premiere meeting for researchers and clinicians dedicated to the science of stroke and brain health.

The study is a Phase III clinical trial, a large-scale study to evaluate the effectiveness of a new treatment. The study goal is to test loberamisal, a new-generation dual-target treatment strategy designed to protect brain cells (neuroprotective agent) within the first 2 days after a stroke.

Neuroprotective agents may help improve patient outcomes since they are aimed at preserving the function of neurovascular units. However, trials for most of these agents have not been successful. In this trial, we tested loberamisal, a small-molecule, dual-acting neuroprotective agent that was an effective neuroprotectant in rodent studies. New treatments for stroke may come from multi-target neuroprotective agents, which could lead to important advancements in reducing or preventing disability after a stroke.""

Shuya Li, M.D., study author, director of the Clinical Trial Center and head of the Phase I Clinical Research Unit at Beijing Tiantan Hospital in Beijing

The American Stroke Association's new 2026 Guideline for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke notes that neuroprotection has garnered renewed interest. Current knowledge gaps need to be addressed in future research.

In this study trial participants were patients who received stroke care at 32 centers in China. 998 adults, ages 18 to 80, were treated for 10 days with either a daily, intravenous infusion of 40 mg loberamisal for 10 days or a matched placebo, started within 48 hours of a moderate to severe stroke caused by a blocked vessel. All had a confirmed clogged brain-vessel stroke, and treatment began within 48 hours of when stroke symptoms began. Only about 17% of participants received standard IV clot-busting medication (for example, alteplase), limiting assessment of combined effects of both treatments. Patients who received surgical treatment for the blockage (mechanical thrombectomy) were excluded from the trial.

At 90 days after treatment, the analysis found:

Study limitations include that the trial was conducted only in China, therefore, the results cannot be directly translated to people living in other countries.

""We want to confirm our findings with larger groups of people, including people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, patients with more severe strokes and those who also have had vascular surgery. We need to better understand how loberamisal works by studying biomarkers in multiple population groups,"" Li said.

Other limitations were that most patients in the study had moderate to severe strokes, which may affect applicability to people who have a more severe stroke. No blood or imaging biomarkers were assessed, which limits the applicability of the study's understanding of how loberamisal affects the body.

Sepsis is a leading global cause of hospital deaths, occurring when the body's response to infection damages tissue and causes organs to fail. Africa bears the world's highest burden of sepsis, with an estimated 48 million cases each year leading to about 11 million deaths. People living with HIV face the greatest risk of dying from the condition. 

A new study has found that tuberculosis, a chronic bacterial lung disease, is a major and long-overlooked cause of deadly sepsis among people living with HIV. An associated Phase 3 clinical trial called the ATLAS study found that starting tuberculosis (TB) treatment immediately, even before a TB diagnosis is confirmed, could significantly reduce sepsis deaths among HIV patients. 

The study and ATLAS trial were conducted by Tulane University and University of Virginia in collaboration with Mbarara University in Uganda and the Tanzania's Kibong'oto Infectious Diseases Hospital, among others. The findings of the study and clinical trial were published in Lancet E-Clinical Medicine and Lancet Infectious Disease, respectively. 

""Our analysis of the clinical trial results found that Mtb (the bacteria that causes TB) is a much more common cause of sepsis that we thought,"" said Dr. Eva Otoupalova, an assistant professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Tulane University School of Medicine, who co-led the study and was also an author on the ATLAS trial. ""Usually, anti-TB treatments are reserved for those diagnosed with TB. We found that, in African hospitals where HIV and TB are a common co-infection, patients with sepsis may benefit from being given anti-TB medications as soon as possible."" 

The ATLAS trial found that immediately treating HIV-related sepsis patients with anti-TB medication caused a 23% reduction in mortality when compared to those who only received treatment after receiving a TB diagnosis. Put another way, early anti-TB treatment saved 1 in every 4 patients. 

An immediate but higher dose of the same medication was not associated with a decrease in mortality. 

In the follow-up study examining the outcomes of the trial, Mtb was the most common pathogen, detected in 52% of HIV-related sepsis patients. 

Previous studies have shown that TB can cause sepsis, however those studies are few, and I don't think we realized how high the prevalence is. Our analysis also found that our diagnostic tools are missing a lot of TB-sepsis, which is impactful if anti-TB treatment is only given to those diagnosed with the disease."" 

Dr. Eva Otoupalova, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Tulane University School of Medicine

It's been known that TB can be difficult to detect in children, the elderly, those with HIV and those with pulmonary TB, all cases where sputum needed for testing is more difficult to obtain. However, the researchers found that combined urine and sputum testing missed 32% of Mtb bloodstream infections. 

The findings highlight the need for both earlier treatment and improved TB diagnostic tools. 

""These studies underscore two things: First, we successfully intervened in TB-related sepsis, and second, we used every rapid test available and found that they just don't detect all of the Mtb,"" Otoupalova said.

Wistar scientists have combined a promising cancer therapy with a molecule that targets tumors to treat cancer more effectively. The new approach could be a way to deliver treatment directly to tumors at higher doses, while reducing side effects in healthy tissue.

An Aurora kinase A (AURKA) inhibitor is viewed as a lethal synthetic molecule in cancer therapy, but the problem is you can't dose it high enough, because then it starts to spill over and target normal cells, causing toxicity. By using this cancer-targeting approach, we can direct this molecule, which is already in clinical use, to cancer cells, increasing its exposure in the tumor itself.""

 Joseph Salvino, Ph.D., coauthor

Salvino is professor in the Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis Program at the Ellen and Ronald Caplan Cancer Center, and scientific director of Wistar's Molecular Screening & Protein Expression Facility. 

The new chimeric molecule takes two existing molecules and attaches them together like LEGO blocks to make what's called a small molecule drug conjugate. One half of the conjugate, an Aurora kinase A (AURKA) inhibitor, works by blocking a protein that controls cell division and helps tumors to grow. While this molecule has shown promise in clinical trials, it's also caused toxic side effects that limited its use. The second half is a molecule that binds to a protein called HSP90, which cancer cells produce to help them survive stress. By targeting HSP90, which is found at high levels in cancer cells, researchers hoped to show that they could concentrate the compound within the tumor, preferentially over healthy tissue. 

In a proof-of-concept study, they demonstrated that the new chimeric molecule successfully binds to both the AURKA and HSP90 proteins. When researchers tested it in cell samples taken from multiple cancer types, including head and neck, lung, and melanoma, they found that it stopped the cancer cells from dividing and replicating, eventually causing the cells to die. 

The researchers then tested the new chimeric molecule in preclinical animal models. They found that it concentrated inside the tumors at levels sometimes 10 times higher than when the original AURKA inhibitor was used on its own. The compound also stayed in the tumor for much longer, and was still active 24 hours after being injected, while the original inhibitor was no longer detectable. The compound was also well tolerated in preclinical models, with no significant toxicity. 

When the researchers combined the new molecule with another cancer drug, called a WEE1 inhibitor, the two together were even more effective in controlling tumor growth. 

""When drugs fail in the clinic, 50% of the time it's because of poor exposures in the tumor, due to pharmacokinetic problems,"" or the body's ability to absorb or interact with a drug, Salvino explained. ""Our approach will take an existing compound and improve its pharmacokinetic properties, enhancing its exposures in the tumor."" 

In addition to the cancers tested in the initial study, the new compound should have broad application to many other types of cancer, he added.

Next, researchers plan to apply their approach to different molecules and types of cancer. They also want to develop the new chimeric molecule into a formulation that can be given orally.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Children's cooperative behaviors align with cultural norms over time","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260207/Childrene28099s-cooperative-behaviors-align-with-cultural-norms-over-time.aspx","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 03:54:00 GMT","

Children across the globe engage in a constellation of behaviors that support cooperation, an action critical to the survival of the human species, a team of Boston College researchers report today in the journal Science Advances.

The team from Associate Professor of Psychology Katherine McAuliffe's Cooperation Lab surveyed children in the urban United States, rural Uganda, Canada, and Peru, and the hunter-horticulturalist indigenous Shuar of Ecuador.

The researchers found there are cross-cultural regularities in some aspects of the development of cooperation - namely, that younger children tend to be self-interested, and that as children get older their behavior starts to reflect local norms, according to the report.

The researchers examined the development of four cooperative behaviors - fairness, trustworthiness, forgiveness, and honesty - in more than 400 children aged 5 to 13 from five societies. They also collected normative judgments from more than 160 peers and nearly 90 adults from each community. 

""Cooperation is crucial to the success of our species,"" said McAuliffe. ""We were interested in how behaviors related to cooperation-fairness, trustworthiness, honesty, and forgiveness-emerge with age across diverse populations. We found some similarities, such as fairness and trustworthiness behaviors aligning with adult norms over age across societies. And we found some differences, such as variations in the norms themselves.""

The norms themselves contained cross-cultural differences. For instance, adults across cultures have different ideas of what constitutes ""fair"" behavior.

""There are cross-cultural regularities in some aspects of the development of cooperation - namely, that younger children tend to be self-interested, and that as children get older their behavior starts to reflect the norms of their broader society,"" said co-author Dorsa Amir, a former post-doctoral researcher in McAuliffe's lab and now an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience and Duke University.

We find cross-cultural differences in the norms themselves. For instance, adults across cultures have different ideas of what constitutes 'fair' behavior. Our study shows that children seem to be sensitive to those specific differences and tend to bring their behavior in line with them over time.""

Dorsa Amir, assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience, Duke University

The team worked with 5- to 13-year-old children and adults in Canada, Ecuador, Peru, Uganda, and the U.S. They designed four different child-friendly activities to measure fairness, trustworthiness, forgiveness, and honesty. For example, in the fairness activity, children used an intuitive wooden apparatus to make decisions about whether to accept or reject uneven divisions of candies between themselves and a peer. 

The research found substantial variation in cooperative behaviors and norms across populations, but, more generally, that children's behaviors and norms tend to converge toward community-specific norms in middle childhood. 

The team also identified three cooperative strategies – maximization, generic cooperation, and partner-contingent cooperation – that become more prevalent with age and differ across societies. All told, the findings show how the differences and similarities present as cooperative behavior develops within and across cultures.

McAuliffe said the study, undertaken with funding from the John Templeton Foundation, built on previous work that had looked at children's sharing and fairness behavior across societies to understand a broader suite of cooperative behaviors.

""By including a 'cooperative task battery' we were in a good position to explore how cooperative behaviors relate to one another,"" said McAuliffe, referring to the collection of activities and tasks they administered during their sessions with participants in the study.

McAuliffe said the researchers were most surprised by the findings about the role of forgiveness.

""Our lab has done a lot of work on punishment behavior, finding punishment to be a common response to transgressions across societies,"" she said. ""Yet, here, both adults and children seemed to endorse forgiveness over punishment. It's possible that, in past work, we have overestimated how much people want punishment because we haven't given them alternative options such as forgiveness.""

McAuliffe and her team are working on a follow-up report from four of these same countries that looks at the mechanisms of norm transmission. 

""Specifically, we are comparing the influence of adult and peer models in influencing children's fairness and trustworthiness behavior,"" she said. ""This is an important extension of the current work because it goes beyond showing that children vary in their cooperative behavior and looks at how that variation may come about.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","CRISPR gene-drive technology reverses antibiotic resistance in bacteria","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260207/CRISPR-gene-drive-technology-reverses-antibiotic-resistance-in-bacteria.aspx","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 03:10:00 GMT","

Antibiotic resistance (AR) has steadily accelerated in recent years to become a global health crisis. As deadly bacteria evolve new ways to elude drug treatments for a variety of illnesses, a growing number of ""superbugs"" have emerged, ramping up estimates of more than 10 million worldwide deaths per year by 2050.

Scientists are looking to recently developed technologies to address the pressing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are known to flourish in hospital settings, sewage treatment areas, animal husbandry locations and fish farms. University of California San Diego scientists have now applied cutting-edge genetics tools to counteract antibiotic resistance.

The laboratories of UC San Diego School of Biological Sciences Professors Ethan Bier and Justin Meyer have collaborated on a novel method of removing antibiotic-resistant elements from populations of bacteria. The researchers developed a new CRISPR-based technology similar to gene drives, which are being applied in insect populations to disrupt the spread of harmful properties, such as parasites that cause malaria. The new Pro-Active Genetics (Pro-AG) tool called pPro-MobV is a second-generation technology that uses a similar approach to disable drug resistance in populations of bacteria.

""With pPro-MobV we have brought gene-drive thinking from insects to bacteria as a population engineering tool,"" said Bier, a faculty member in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology. ""With this new CRISPR-based technology we can take a few cells and let them go to neutralize AR in a large target population.""

In 2019 Bier's lab collaborated with Professor Victor Nizet's group (UC San Diego School of Medicine) to develop the initial Pro-AG concept, in which a genetic cassette is introduced and copied between the genomes of bacteria to inactivate their antibiotic-resistant components. The cassette launches itself into an AR gene carried on plasmids, circular types of DNA that replicate within cells, thereby restoring sensitivity of the bacteria to antibiotic treatments.

Building upon this idea, Bier and his colleagues developed a follow-on system that spreads the antibiotic CRISPR cassette components via conjugal transfer, which is similar to mating in bacteria. As they described in the Nature journal npj Antimicrobials and Resistance, the researchers showed that this next-generation pPro-MobV system can exploit a naturally created bacterial mating tunnel between cells to spread the key disabling elements. They demonstrated the process working within bacterial biofilms, which are communities of microorganisms that contaminate various surfaces and can be extremely difficult to remove under conventional cleaning methods. Biofilms also contribute to the spread of disease and are created in the majority of infections that lead to serious disease, in part because biofilms help combat antibiotics by creating a protective layer of cells that is difficult for antibiotics to diffuse through. The new technology therefore carries potential in health care settings, environmental remediation and microbiome engineering.

The biofilm context for combatting antibiotic resistance is particularly important since this is one of the most challenging forms of bacterial growth to overcome in the clinic or in enclosed environments such as aquafarm ponds and sewage treatment plants. If you could reduce the spread from animals to humans you could have a significant impact on the antibiotic resistance problem since roughly half of it is estimated to come from the environment.""

Ethan Bier, Professor, UC San Diego School of Biological Sciences 

The researchers also found that components of the active genetic system could be carried and delivered by bacteriophage, or phage, which are viruses that are natural evolutionary competitors of bacteria. Phage are being specially engineered to combat antibiotic resistance by evading bacterial defenses and inserting disruptive factors inside cells. pPro-MobV elements, the researchers envision, would work in conjunction with such engineered phage viruses. This active genetic platform also can incorporate a highly efficient process known as homology-based deletion as a safety measure to remove the gene cassette if desired.

""This technology is one of the few ways that I'm aware of that can actively reverse the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes, rather than just slowing or coping with their spread,"" said Meyer, a professor in the Department of Ecology, Behavior and Evolution, who studies the evolutionary adaptations of bacteria and viruses.

For the millions of people living with end‑stage kidney disease, hemodialysis is more than a medical procedure, it is a thrice‑weekly lifeline that keeps the body's chemistry in balance. Yet even with decades of clinical experience and numerous technological advances, one stubborn challenge persists: determining how much fluid to remove during treatment without tipping a patient into dangerous instability. Too little fluid removal leaves patients overloaded, too much can trigger sudden drops in blood pressure, cramping, nausea, or even early termination of the session. These events are not rare, in fact, they affect nearly half of all dialysis patients.

A new pilot study from Boston University and Boston Medical Center suggests a promising way to address this longstanding problem. By using a custom optical device that illuminates the skin and underlying muscle with near‑infrared light, the researchers captured real‑time changes in tissue water content and other physiological signals during hemodialysis. As reported in Biophotonics Discovery, their research results point to a future in which clinicians may be able to anticipate adverse events earlier, and intervene before a patient becomes unstable.

Current monitoring tools provide only a partial picture of what happens during fluid removal. For example, devices like Crit‑Line track how the blood's hematocrit changes as water is removed from circulation. But this leaves out the largest reservoir of fluid in the body: the extravascular compartments, where more than 60% of total body water resides. Those spaces exchange water with the bloodstream at varying rates depending on the patient's vascular refill capacity, comorbidities, and the intensity of ultrafiltration.

When this delicate balance breaks down, when fluid leaves the bloodstream faster than it can be replenished, patients become vulnerable to hypotension and other complications. Because existing tools cannot reliably detect this mismatch in real time, clinicians often rely on patient symptoms or heuristic rules to adjust treatment.

The Boston team saw an opportunity: instead of listening only to the bloodstream, why not measure what is happening directly in the tissue itself?

The researchers created a compact device that combines two forms of near‑infrared spectroscopy: frequency‑domain (FD) and broadband continuous‑wave (CW), to gather complementary information. The FD light component measures absolute absorption and scattering as specific wavelengths, and when combined with the broadband CW measurements, the amounts of water, lipids, and hemoglobin can be quantified in tissue.

Together, these measurements provide a high‑resolution portrait of the optical properties of tissue. Each minute during dialysis, the system captured:

The probe itself, held against the calf muscle with medical tape, remained unobtrusive throughout treatment. Patients continued their dialysis as usual while the device recorded continuous optical data.

Twenty‑seven adult inpatients receiving fluid‑removal dialysis participated. Their medical histories reflected a typical inpatient dialysis population, including high rates of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Researchers logged any signs of trouble including cramping, dizziness, vomiting, headache, shortness of breath, or hypotension, and tagged these events in the data stream.

The central question: Could tissue‑level optical changes distinguish patients who experienced complications from those who did not?

Among all optical markers measured, one metric proved especially telling: the water ratio, defined as water content divided by the combined water‑plus‑lipid content of the tissue.

Across the cohort:

This difference was statistically significant.

The implication is compelling: when the body struggles to shift water from tissues into the bloodstream fast enough to keep up with fluid removal, the water ratio may flatten or rise, signaling an emerging mismatch that precedes symptoms.

The researchers also found that reduced scattering amplitude, a parameter reflecting how light interacts with tissue structure, differed between groups. Patients who remained stable tended to show distinct patterns in scattering compared to those who became unstable. This lines up with earlier work showing that tissue scattering decreases as hydration increases.

Together, water ratio and scattering measures formed a signature that could discriminate between the two groups. A multifeature model using three optical parameters classified subjects with strong accuracy, better than any single marker alone.

Crit‑Line, the widely used optical hematocrit monitor, did not distinguish between stable and unstable patients in this cohort in a statistically significance manner. Likewise, systolic blood pressure only showed a difference because most complications were hypotension‑related, and by the time blood pressure drops, an adverse event is already underway.

The optical system, by contrast, revealed subtle physiological divergence earlier in treatment, sometimes within the first quarter of the session. This points to possible future use as an early warning tool, rather than a reactive one.

Dialysis patients frequently suffer from fluid‑management‑related complications. Yet clinics have few objective, real‑time tools for assessing the physiological mechanisms that actually drive those complications.

This study is small, but it opens a meaningful path forward:

The authors emphasize limitations: the cohort was small and medically complex, the tissue model was simplified, and optical methods require further validation. But they also highlight the broad potential of the technology. Beyond dialysis, tools that measure tissue hydration could help manage edema in heart failure, monitor weight‑loss interventions, or support athletes tracking hydration status.

Fluid removal during hemodialysis will always be a balancing act. But with the ability to monitor tissue water in real time, clinicians may soon have a clearer view of the underlying physiology that shapes each patient's response. This optical approach doesn't just add another number to the chart, it opens a new window into how the body manages fluid, second by second.

For patients whose treatments can suddenly shift from routine to dangerous, that insight could make all the difference.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Gut bacteria use formic acid as an electron taxi","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260207/Gut-bacteria-use-formic-acid-as-an-electron-taxi.aspx","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 02:25:00 GMT","

Researchers at Goethe University Frankfurt have discovered a surprising role for formic acid in the human gut: The small molecule acts as a kind of “taxi” for electrons – both within bacteria and, likely, also between different microorganisms. The gut bacterium Blautia luti produces formic acid as part of a metabolic trick that allows it to respond flexibly to what is available in the gut. In addition to carbohydrates, the bacterium can also metabolize toxic carbon monoxide derived from the body's own hemoglobin degradation.

Among the many trillions of microorganisms in the human gut is Blautia luti. Like many gut bacteria, it metabolizes indigestible dietary components, such as fiber in the form of carbohydrates. This process produces, among other things, acetic acid (acetate), an important energy source for our intestinal cells and a signaling molecule that can even influence our well-being via the gut-brain axis.

B. luti lives in the gut without oxygen and cannot respire, but only ferment. During this process, carbohydrates are converted into lactate, succinate, ethanol, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen, which are excreted as metabolic end products. Too much hydrogen in the gut is unhealthy because it inhibits further fermentation. Therefore, small single-celled organisms known as archaea consume the hydrogen, convert it into methane, and thus regulate hydrogen levels in the gut. Hydrogen thus acts, so to speak, as an electron taxi within a bacterium and between different bacteria. However, this process involves a substantial loss of energy and is therefore disadvantageous for the bacteria.B. luti has an additional, better option. Raphael Trischler and Prof. Volker Müller, Chair of Molecular Microbiology and Bioenergetics at Goethe University Frankfurt, found that B. luti produces formic acid (formate) instead of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and hydrogen, with hydrogen bound to CO₂. In this case, formic acid is the electron taxi, allowing the energetically costly production of hydrogen to be bypassed.

To produce formic acid, B. luti uses the enzyme pyruvate formate lyase. This enzyme is rather unusual in acetogenic bacteria. ""The electrons are essentially stored in the formic acid,"" explains Trischler. However, formic acid is also unhealthy at high concentrations.B. luti detoxifies formic acid together with CO₂ via a special metabolic pathway, the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP), converting it into acetate. In the WLP, CO₂ is transformed via two different ""branches"" and ultimately assembled into acetic acid. In the first branch, CO₂ is normally converted into formic acid by a specific enzyme - formate dehydrogenase - using hydrogen. ""But B. luti completely lacks formate dehydrogenase,"" explains Raphael Trischler, who studied the bacterium for his doctoral thesis. Instead, B. luti uses formic acid directly. Sugar breakdown on one side and acetic acid production on the other are thus linked via formic acid - a clever strategy that gives the bacterium an energetic advantage.

In the laboratory culture studied, B. luti excretes formic acid. In the complex food web of the gut, however, the situation is different, and formic acid does not accumulate there. Methane-producing archaea can convert formic acid into methane, but B. luti has another trick up its sleeve. Reducing formic acid in the WLP requires electrons that originate from carbohydrate fermentation. But B. luti can also use gases produced by other bacteria for this purpose. ""In the presence of hydrogen, the formic acid disappears completely,"" reports Trischler.Particularly remarkable is B. luti's ability to utilize carbon monoxide. This highly toxic gas is produced in the human body during the natural breakdown of hemoglobin, the red blood pigment. ""Bacteria like B. luti can thus detoxify carbon monoxide produced by the body itself using formic acid,"" explains Müller. This also explains why so many gut microbes possess the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.B. luti has yet another property beneficial to humans: In addition to acetate, it produces succinate (succinic acid). Succinate promotes the growth of other beneficial gut bacteria, stimulates the immune system, and is also an industrially valuable raw material for biotechnological applications.The study highlights how diverse metabolic strategies in the gut are.

Even within related groups of bacteria, there are fascinating differences. Understanding this helps us better decipher the interactions between different gut bacteria and their role in human well-being.""

In recent years, cancer researchers have made major breakthroughs by using the body's immune system to fight cancer. One of the most promising approaches, known as immune checkpoint blockade, works by releasing molecular ""brakes"" on T cells. This allows them to better recognize and attack cancer cells. While these therapies can be very effective for some patients, many solid tumors, including most forms of breast cancer, remain largely unaffected. Cancer Center at Illinois (CCIL) Program Co-leader Erik Nelson and his research group are working to understand why these treatments fail.

Elevated blood concentrations of cholesterol have long been linked to cancer outcomes. In a new study, they found that a protein called ABCA1 is involved in transporting cholesterol out of a type of immune cell called macrophages, and in so-doing shifts them to an ""attack cancer"" mode.

Immune based therapies have revolutionized how we can treat cancer, basically taking the brakes off of a type of immune cell called T cells so they can attack cancer. While this approach works well for some patients, many so-called solid tumors fail to respond or develop resistance mechanisms.""

Erik Nelson, Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign

Nelson's team began looking beyond T cells to try and understand why solid tumors fail to respond to traditional treatments. They focused on myeloid immune cells, particularly macrophages, which are abundant in many solid tumors and play a major role in shaping the tumor environment.

""Here, we find that ABCA1, which is a protein that transports cholesterol from inside the cell to the outside, plays a big role in directing how myeloid cells, specifically macrophages, behave,"" Nelson said. ""When we engineer macrophages to express more ABCA1, they become much better at fighting cancer and supporting the other immune cell type, T cells.""

Immune checkpoint blockers are currently approved for only one subtype of breast cancer, and even among those patients, only about a quarter respond to treatment. One reason, researchers believe, is the influence of myeloid cells in the tumor environment. These cells can suppress immune activity, promote new blood vessel growth that feeds tumors, and limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy.

To understand how important ABCA1 is to the immune response, the team tested what happens when myeloid cells completely lack ABCA1.

""We next utilized mice that were engineered so that their myeloid cells did not express ABCA1,"" Nelson said. ""Tumors grew quicker in these mice, and perhaps even more importantly, immune based therapies failed to control tumors in these mice.""

The researchers also found strong evidence that these mechanisms matter in humans. In patient tumor samples, higher levels of ABCA1 in myeloid immune cells were associated with increased numbers of cancer killing T cells and improved outcomes for breast cancer patients.

""This tells us that what we are seeing in the lab is relevant to patients with cancer,"" Nelson said. ""It gives us confidence that targeting ABCA1 could be a meaningful new strategy for cancer immunotherapy.""

Looking ahead, Nelson's team is now focused on developing ways to increase ABCA1 activity specifically in tumor associated macrophages and testing whether these approaches can be combined with existing immune therapies.

""Our ultimate goal is to induce an immune response in tumors that were previously unresponsive to immunotherapy,"" Nelson said. ""The immune system has the capacity to eradicate cancer. We just need to figure out where all the brakes are and how to release them safely.""

Neuropathic pain, caused by injury or disease of the somatosensory nervous system, is a major clinical challenge and often evolves into a chronic condition. Importantly, up to 80% of patients with long-term pain also experience anxiety or depression. This creates a vicious cycle that not only worsens prognosis and quality of life but also poses significant challenges for treating both the pain and the accompanying emotional disorders. Current treatments mainly focus on pain intensity, while emotional symptoms often remain inadequately addressed.

Acupuncture, an ancient Chinese practice, is now widely recognized and integrated into global pain management. It offers a drug-free option for conditions such as chronic back pain, migraines, and arthritis. High-quality clinical trials have further confirmed its efficacy in treating both acute and chronic pain. Beyond pain relief, acupuncture also demonstrates certain advantages in managing pain-induced negative emotions. While research on the potential mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia has achieved notable progress, the neural mechanisms underlying the link between acupuncture and pain-related emotional disturbances remain poorly understood.

Previous studies have indicated that the prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in integrating pain perception and emotional regulation, yet it remains unclear whether acupuncture exerts its effects by modulating the prefrontal cortex. Given these challenges, there is a pressing need to investigate whether and how acupuncture intervention influences the prefrontal cortex and modulates specific neuronal circuits, thereby alleviating pain-induced emotional disturbances.

Researchers from Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine reported (DOI: 10.13702/j.1000-0607.20230755) in January 2025 in Acupuncture Research hat electroacupuncture significantly alleviated pain-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in a mouse model of neuropathic pain by modulating specific excitatory neurons in the brain. By combining behavioral testing with chemogenetic manipulation, the team demonstrated that the therapeutic effects of electroacupuncture depend on the activation of glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral orbital cortex, a subregion of the prefrontal cortex closely linked to emotional processing. The study provides direct neural evidence connecting acupuncture-based intervention with brain circuit modulation.

To explore the neural basis of pain-related emotional disorders, the researchers established a neuropathic pain model in mice using common peroneal nerve ligation. A battery of behavioral tests—including open field, elevated plus maze, forced swimming, and tail suspension assays—revealed that nerve injury induced persistent anxiety- and depression-like behaviors alongside heightened pain sensitivity. Electroacupuncture was then applied daily for seven days at specific hindlimb acupoints (""Yanglingquan"" (GV34) and ""Xuanzhong"" (GB34)) commonly used in pain treatment.

Results showed that electroacupuncture markedly improved emotional behaviors without affecting overall locomotion, indicating a genuine anxiolytic and antidepressant effect rather than a motor artifact. To uncover the underlying mechanism, the team selectively activated or inhibited glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral orbital cortex using chemogenetic tools. Artificial activation of these neurons mimicked the emotional benefits of electroacupuncture, while their inhibition completely blocked the therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture.

Immunofluorescence analysis further confirmed increased neuronal activation following electroacupuncture, demonstrating that excitatory prefrontal neurons are a critical neural substrate linking pain relief and emotional regulation.

""Chronic pain is not merely a sensory experience—it fundamentally alters emotional brain circuits,"" said one of the study's senior authors. ""Our findings show that electroacupuncture can directly engage prefrontal glutamatergic neurons that are suppressed by long-term neuropathic pain. By restoring the activity of this circuit, emotional symptoms such as anxiety and depression can be alleviated. This provides a biological explanation for the clinical observation that acupuncture improves both pain and mood, and highlights its potential as a complementary strategy for treating complex pain-related disorders.""

These results have important implications for the treatment of chronic pain conditions complicated by emotional disorders. By identifying a specific prefrontal neural circuit involved in pain-induced anxiety and depression, the study opens new avenues for precision neuromodulation therapies. Electroacupuncture, as a low-risk and non-pharmacological intervention, may help reduce reliance on antidepressants or opioids, particularly in patients with comorbid pain and mood disorders. More broadly, the findings support an integrative neuroscience framework in which traditional therapeutic techniques are evaluated and optimized through modern brain circuit analysis, potentially accelerating their translation into evidence-based clinical practice.

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, marked by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. What makes it more dangerous is the ability of cancer cells to move quickly through the body, allowing them to invade surrounding tissues. While this behavior is well known, the mechanism behind this rapid spread remains unclear. Researchers from Kyushu University set out to fill this gap and unveiled a new physical process that helps cancer cells move rapidly throughout the body.

This study was led by Professor Junichi Ikenouchi from Kyushu University's Faculty of Medical Sciences, along with his colleagues at Kyushu University, in collaboration with Yokohama City University. The findings of this study, published in The EMBO Journal on February 3, 2026, reveal how water pressure generated inside cells aids in cancer cell migration.

Healthy cells typically move by attaching to surfaces, which allows them to pull themselves forward. While existing therapies can target this adhesion-based movement, cancer cells evade this treatment approach by following a different strategy: amoeboid migration. In this mode, cells form temporary bulges called blebs, enabling them to squeeze through tight spaces without attaching to their surroundings.

For a long time, it was believed that bleb expansion was driven by internal pressure-until research by Ikenouchi in 2021 overturned that assumption.

In our previous research, we observed that expanding blebs show unique cytoplasmic properties such as high levels of calcium ions, suggesting that blebs are not just passive, pressure-driven protrusions but specialized cellular compartments."" 

Professor Junichi Ikenouchi, Kyushu University's Faculty of Medical Sciences

Inspired by this, the researchers wanted to further explore the reasons behind these bleb expansions. Furthermore, they also noticed significantly higher levels of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) present in the cells, prompting a critical question: does CaMKII have a more direct physical role in shaping cells and their movements?

As the researchers probed deeper into bleb dynamics, they discovered that CaMKII does much more than act as a signaling protein. When a bleb begins to grow, there is an increase in the calcium levels inside the cells. In response to this surge, CaMKII present in the cell undergoes a structural change and assembles into a large protein supercomplex together with other molecules.

Once formed, this supercomplex behaves like an osmotic engine, creating a concentration gradient that draws water into the bleb through osmosis. The water pushes the cell membrane outwards, leading to rapid growth of the bleb. This newly discovered process was named ""CODE"" which stands for ""CaMKII-based osmotically-driven deformation.""

""Surprisingly, cells can generate force simply by changing how proteins are distributed inside them,"" says Ikenouchi. ""CaMKII creates pressure by gathering in one place, and that pressure physically pushes the membrane outward.""

These findings hold great significance in molecular biology, as most advanced cancer cells rely on amoeboid movement. In such cases, treatment becomes difficult; most current therapies only target cell proliferation or adhesion-dependent migration. Uncovering the CODE mechanism opens new avenues for therapies that specifically target amoeboid movement.

Apart from cancer, understanding how cells generate force through changes in their physical properties could also have implications for regenerative medicine, developmental biology, and tissue engineering. This research may inspire new therapeutic strategies that target cellular mechanics rather than classical signaling pathways, opening the door to more robust and effective treatments.

        This article was originally published on The Conversation.    

With an upcoming FIFA World Cup being staged across the nation, 2026 was supposed to be a bumper year for tourism to the United States, driven in part by hordes of arriving soccer fans.

And yet, the U.S. tourism industry is worried. While the rest of the world saw a travel bump in 2025, with global international arrivals up 4%, the U.S. saw a downturn. The number of foreign tourists who came to the United States fell by 5.4% during the year – a sharper decline than the one experienced in 2017-18, the last time, outside the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, that the industry was gripped by fears of a travel slump.

Policy stances from the Trump administration on everything from immigration to tariffs, along with currency swings and stricter border controls, have seemingly proved a turnoff to travelers from other countries, especially Canadians – the single largest source of foreign tourists for the United States. Canadian travel to the U.S. fell by close to 30% in 2025. But it is not just visitors from Canada who are choosing to avoid the United States. Travel from Australia, India and Western Europe, among others, has also shrunk.

We are experts in tourism. And while we don't possess a crystal ball, we believe that the tourism decline of 2025 could well continue through 2026. The evidence appears clear: Washington's ongoing policies are putting off would-be travelers. In other words, the tourism industry is in the midst of a “Trump slump.”

The impact of Donald Trump's policies are perhaps most pronounced when looking north of the U.S. border. According to the U.S. Travel Association, Canadian visitors generated approximately 20.4 million visits and roughly US$20.5 billion in visitor spending in 2024, supporting about 140,000 American jobs.

The economic impact of fewer Canadian visitors in 2025 affects mostly border states that depend heavily on people driving across the border for retail, restaurants, casinos and short-stay hotels.

The sharp drop in return trips by car to Canada is a direct indication that border economies might be facing stress. This has led elected officials and tourism professionals to woo Canadians in recent months, sometimes with “Canadian-only deals.”

And it isn't just border states. In Las Vegas, some hotels are now offering currency rate parity between Canadian and U.S. dollars for rooms and gambling vouchers in a bid to attract customers.

Winter-sun states, such as Florida, Arizona and California, are facing both fewer short-stay arrivals and an emerging drop-off in Canadian “snowbirds.” Reports indicate a noticeable increase in Canadians listing U.S. properties in Florida and Arizona for sale and canceling seasonal plans, threatening lodging, health care spending and property tax revenue.

Economic policies pursued by the Trump administration appear to be among the main reasons visitors are staying away from the U.S. Multiple tariff announcements – pushing tariffs to the highest levels since 1935 – along with tougher border-related rhetoric and an aggressive foreign policy have contributed to a negative perception of the U.S. among would-be tourists.

Many foreigners report feeling unwelcome or uncertain about travel to the U.S., and some public leaders from Canada and Europe have urged citizens to spend domestically, instead. This significantly reduced intent to travel to the U.S. in 2025.

Meanwhile, exchange rates and inflation have further affected some aspiring travelers, especially Canadians. The Canadian dollar was weakened in 2025, making U.S. trips more expensive. This disproportionately affected day-trip and shopping-driven border crossings.

Travelers are also staying away from the U.S. because of safety concerns. Several countries have posted travel advisories about the risks of traveling to the U.S., with Germany being the latest. Although most worries are related to increased border controls, recent aggressive tactics by immigration agents have added to potential visitors' decisions to avoid the U.S.

The current tourism outlook is reason for concern. Julia Simpson, president and CEO of the industry association World Travel and Tourism Council, has described the situation as a “wake-up call” for the U.S. government.

“The world's biggest travel and tourism economy is heading in the wrong direction,” she said in May 2025. “While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the ‘closed' sign.”

According to estimates, the U.S. stood to lose about $30 billion in international tourism in 2025 as travelers chose to travel elsewhere.

The disappointing figures for U.S. tourism follow a longer trend. The share of global international travel heading to the U.S. fell from 8.4% in 1996 to 4.9% in 2024 and was expected to drop to 4.8% in 2025. Meanwhile, arrivals to other top tourism destinations, including France, Greece, Mexico and Italy, are set to increase.

The decline is also being felt by the business tourism sector, with every major global region sending fewer people to the U.S. for work.

So what does that mean for the upcoming FIFA World Cup, with 75% of the soccer matches being hosted across the United States? Traditionally, host nations benefit from sports events, although impacts are often overestimated. After a disappointing year, the U.S. tourism sector expects the World Cup to boost visits and revenue.

But Trump's foreign policy may undermine those expectations.

A new visa integrity fee of $250 and plans for social media screening of some visitors make travel to the U.S. less attractive. And there are growing calls for a boycott of the U.S. following some of Trump's policies, including his aggressive stance about Greenland.

Former FIFA President Sepp Blatter has suggested that fans avoid going to the U.S. for the World Cup.

It remains to be seen whether fans will follow his call. Bookings for flights and hotels were up after the dates and venues of games were announced in December.

But current political rhetoric is affecting travel decisions, especially given that fans from some specific countries may not be able to get visas. The U.S. government has imposed travel bans on Senegal, Ivory Coast, Iran and Haiti, all of which have qualified for the World Cup.

European soccer leaders have even discussed the possibility of a boycott, although such an action is unlikely to happen, given the revenue at stake for national teams and football associations.

White House policies look unlikely to drastically change in the next few months. And this causes concern for tourism professionals, although most have remained silent about the recent immigration crackdown.

To make matters worse, federal funding for Brand USA, the national destination marketing organization, was cut deeply in mid-2025, leading to staff shortages that have reduced the country's capacity to counter negative sentiment through positive promotion.

Soccer fans tend to be passionate about following their national side. And this could offset some of the impact of the Trump travel slump.

Yet, with sky-high match ticket prices and the international reputation of the U.S. as a tourism destination damaged, we believe it is unlikely that the tourism industry will recover in 2026. It will take a long time and good strategies to repair the serious damage done to the nation's image among travelers in the rest of the world.﻿

            / CBS Philadelphia
          

The FIFA World Cup trophy is coming to Philadelphia as part of a 38-city tour across North America before the tournament kicks off.

The tour includes all 16 host cities and 22 additional stops, giving fans a chance to see the original  trophy up close before competition begins.

Currently, the trophy is overseas as part of a tour that began Jan. 3 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The tour includes stops in future host nations like Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Portugal, Spain and Brazil.

The trophy is set to arrive in North America by the end of the month.

Fans will have to be patient, as the trophy is set to make an extensive tour before arriving in the city.

The trophy will first arrive in Mexico on Feb. 26, launching the tour in Mexico City and will travel across the country through March 22 before heading to the United States for a total of 21 stops.

The U.S. leg of the tour starts in Los Angeles March 24 and will visit Las Vegas, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Portland and Seattle through April 6.

The trophy will then travel to Canada, stopping in Vancouver, Calgary and Winnipeg from April 10 to April 13. It then returns to U.S. soil for a run through the Midwest to the deep South from April 14 to May 16.

The trophy will then make its one-day stop in Philadelphia on May 21.

After that, the tour returns to Canada, with stops in Montreal, Halifax, Ottawa and Toronto, before visiting Boston on May 30.

It'll wrap up its U.S. tour in New York on June 3.

The trophy will then return to Mexico City, where the tour concludes June 5, just ahead of the tournament's opening match between Mexico and South Africa on June 11.

With a global sporting event comparable to the Olympics set to take place in Kansas City this June, mid-Missouri businesses should start preparing now for the economic ripple effects of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the leader of a Columbia bank said Wednesday.


""It's not every day that we have a mini Olympics happening an hour and a half down the road from us,"" said Sarah Dubbert, president of Commerce Bank in Columbia.


Nearly half of the 650,000 visitors expected for the World Cup will arrive from outside the United States, according to FIFA data. That will create a surge in tourism and spending and a test of readiness for small businesses across the state.


Although the six matches will be hosted at Arrowhead Stadium, Dubbert believes cities such as Columbia will benefit as visitors travel before and after games. She encouraged small businesses to reassess their business plans and consider creative ways to meet potential demand.


""I think where we're located on I-70, being right in the middle of Missouri, there's an opportunity for spillover, and we want to make sure we can take advantage of it,"" Dubbert said.


Beyond increased foot traffic, she said businesses should prepare for a more diverse customer base, including potential language barriers and cultural differences due to the large number of international visitors expected.


""It's all about intentionality,"" Dubbert said.


For Columbia businesses, that intentionality — including staffing and inventory decisions as well as contactless payments — could determine how effectively they capitalize on the increased traffic tied to the World Cup.


""We want to make sure that the small business community knows that we're promoting Columbia as a satellite city but also how to prepare their businesses as well,"" said Megan McConachie, communications and outreach supervisor for the city of Columbia.


McConachie said Columbia is typically prepared to handle large crowds.


""You know, we're very used to having large scale festivals, Mizzou football games, Mizzou graduations,"" McConachie said, ""and so those are things that we're all very used to as a community having take place.""


What will make this summer different, though, is the preparation for international travelers of various cultural backgrounds. Customers from different countries could encounter challenges, such as different tipping norms or difficulties with contactless payments.


Commerce Bank is offering a Small Business Readiness Program aimed at encouraging owners to plan well in advance. One recommendation from Dubbert is to adjust staffing based on tournament schedules or other cultural norms.


""It's really a preparation checklist more than it is a program — different things to think about,"" Dubbert said. ""We wanted to give people plenty of time to incorporate what they think might help them really maximize this FIFA experience.""


The City of Columbia also recommends that local businesses and community members visit columbiamo.com for additional resources, visitor forecasts, and other pertinent information before the World Cup.

Former Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been told that Kobbie Mainoo's form is 'very embarrassing' for him after failing to get the best out of the England midfielder when he was in charge at Old Trafford. Mainoo made only a handful of appearances this season with Amorim in the dugout, but has started all four of United's wins under new boss Michael Carrick.

Amorim's underwhelming stint as United boss came to an end early on in January. Despite improving the team's form this season, he was sacked after seemingly taking on the board over his job title.

Following a 1-1 draw at Leeds, Amorim said: ""To start with that, I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. And that is clear. I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.""

During Amorim's 14 months at the helm, United recorded their lowest-ever Premier League finish of 15th, lost to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final and he became derided for his comments lambasting his Red Devils group as 'maybe the worst' in the club's history.

Amorim was also heavily criticised for his deployment of academy product Mainoo, who became a key starter under predecessor Erik ten Hag but couldn't nail down a place in the Portuguese's demanding 3-4-3 system. But the 20-year-old has found his best form again in recent weeks, and after impressing in Saturday's 2-0 win against Spurs, Ian Wright took the opportunity to praise Mainoo and lay into Amorim.

""Everybody was confused with what was happening under Ruben Amorim,"" Wright said on Premier League World. ""When you look at [Mainoo], someone who's not played, coming into a Man United side that's not in great form. To play in that midfield which is where all the questions have been around... just the quality.

""You're listening to Bruno [Fernandes] saying they've been given the freedom to express themselves because they're good players. And Kobbie is a very, very good player. I'm just pleased we're seeing that now.

""I think it's very embarrassing for Ruben Amorim if we're going to be totally honest. Because what we seen was a Man United youth product not given the opportunity to play and very, very close to leaving the club.

""[Mainoo] was brilliant today. Magnificent today.""

Due to his feud with Amorim, Mainoo wanted to leave United. In the final week of the summer 2025 transfer window, the midfielder asked to be loaned out, aware that clubs such as Napoli, where fellow academy product Scott McTominay is thriving, were interested in his services. A move to the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona never materialised, though reports have suggested Mainoo would have pushed for a January exit too had Amorim remained in post but he will now sign a new contract with United.

Mainoo and the Red Devils return to action on Tuesday with a trip to relegation-battling West Ham United, with Carrick looking to record his fifth win on the spin as head coach.

In the longer term, there is also buzz that Mainoo could return to the England fold in time for the World Cup this summer. He has been capped ten times by the Three Lions but hasn't represented his country since September 2024 - one month before Thomas Tuchel was unveiled as the team's permanent successor to popular head coach Gareth Southgate.

Bruno Fernandes has reached yet another milestone for Manchester United which underscores his importance to the Red Devils yet again. The Portuguese midfielder ran the game against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday and his goal contributions took him to second, and above some of the club's greatest players, in the list of fastest players to reach 200 goal involvements.

Fernandes was on the scoresheet as United earned their fourth win on the bounce. The Red Devils beat Spurs 2-0 at Old Trafford with the Portuguese midfielder doubling his team's advantage after Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring with a sweeping effort from the top of the box from a corner.

Fernandes took the headlines when he fired home from a Diogo Dalot cross with just ten minutes to go as he put the game beyond doubt. Thomas Frank's side had been reduced to ten men earlier in the game following a red card to Cristian Romero and never looked like turning the game around.

The United skipper has once again been the star of their season for both Ruben Amorim and now Michael Carrick. The goal against Spurs marked his sixth goal in the Premier League this campaign and his 18th direct involvement. His 12 assists in the division put him far and away the best playmaker in the league, with Rayan Cherki's seven the next highest tally.

Fernandes notched up his 200th goal or assist for Manchester United on Saturday and, in doing so, became the second-quickest player to do so in the club's long history. Only Wayne Rooney, who scored 133 goals and registered 67 assists in 295 games, can top Fernandes' record of 104 goals and 96 assists in 314 games.

Per Opta, Fernandes has also overtaken the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo (339 games), David Beckham (393), Ryan Giggs (424) and Paul Scholes (564). It puts him amongst some of the very best players to have ever pulled on a red shirt of Manchester United and he will not be forgotten any time soon.

United have been resurgent under Carrick and their fourth win on the spin is testament to the work he has put in at Old Trafford. The Red Devils never accrued as many victories in a row under his predecessor Amorim.

Speaking after the game, Fernandes hailed the impact the former England and United midfielder has had on the squad. He told TNT Sports: “I think Michael came in with the right idea of giving the players the freedom to take responsibility on the pitch to do the decisions that were needed. I think he remembers what I told him the last time he was manager. I thought Michael could be a great manager and he's just shown it.

“We hope we can help him even more so everyone can see we are good players. That's why we are at Man United. I think everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club. Everyone knows the expectations around it.”

United will have to contend with another side on their own glitzy run of form on Tuesday when they travel to the London Stadium to face West Ham. United are currently fourth in the Premier League, look set to secure a return to the Champions League next season and can begin to dream beyond. Carrick's side are also just three points off of Aston Villa and Manchester City ahead of them and will fancy themselves to overhaul their rivals. League leaders Arsenal, 12 points clear of United, appear too far ahead to even begin to suggest a potential title charge.

United will know any slip up could spell trouble too, with Chelsea just one point below them. Liverpool are four off the pace but have a game in hand against City on Sunday afternoon, knowing victory will put the pressure on the sides above them.

United can strengthen their grip on the top four with a win against the Hammers, but will have to play well to take the maximum points off a side with four wins from their last five games in all competitions.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Real Madrid manager Alvaro Arbeloa has accused Clasico rivals Barcelona of generating the “biggest scandal in the history of Spanish football”. The Blaugrana remain embroiled in the long-running Negreira case, with accusations being levelled at the Catalan giants of bribing match officials. No definitive conclusion to that saga has been reached, much to the bemusement of Arbeloa.

The case has been back in the news of late. Barca were initially found to have made payments totalling €8.4 million (£7m/$10m) to Jose María Enríquez Negreira - a former vice president of the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA) of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) - between 2001 and 2018.

Barcelona maintain that they hired Negreira as an external consultant to provide technical reports on refereeing, with the man himself denying any suggestion that was paid to influence decisions made in competitive fixtures. Bribery charges were dismissed by a Spanish court in May 2024, but the investigation continues under the charge of sports corruption.

Arbeloa, who has taken coaching reins at the Bernabeu on the back of Xabi Alonso's dismissal, has been asked for his take on the situation. Unsurprisingly, given his ties to the Blancos, the ex-Spain international was scathing in his assessment.

He told reporters: “Regarding the Negreira case, I think that no one understands that, to this day, the biggest scandal in the history of Spanish football is still unresolved. For me that is what should worry a lot of people.”

Arbeloa is doing his best to ensure that off-field matters do not become a distraction for Real, as they chase down Barcelona in another thrilling La Liga title race. He has endured the odd shock defeat during his tenure - against Albacete and Benfica - but has overseen three successive victories in La Liga.

He said of the challenges that his side face heading into a clash with Valencia on Sunday: “Great teams have to do a lot of things well to win. We can't just master one, we have to be able to do many things well on the pitch: we have to be able to do them at the same time, have automatisms, think all the same way… And that can only be achieved by working and putting in hours.

“The predisposition that the players have had is still just as good, with the same desire and the same ambition of the objectives we have ahead of us. Tomorrow is a very complicated and difficult match. This week we've been focused on continuing that improvement in all aspects of the game. We are still far from our ceiling.”

Real Madrid have lost England international midfielder Jude Bellingham to an untimely injury, with a hamstring problem being picked up by the all-action 22-year-old, while Rodrygo is now serving a ban.

The Brazilian forward was dismissed during a humbling 4-2 defeat to Benfica in Lisbon that saw opposition goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin score a 98th-minute header to keep his team alive in Champions League competition.

Rodrygo has apologised for his actions, and Arbeloa considers that to be the end of the matter. He said: “He has already issued a statement of regret. He knows he made a mistake and from there we need to get him back as soon as possible and in the best possible condition so that he can help us as he knows how to do.”

Real are readying themselves for an immediate reunion with Benfica in continental action. Having failed to secure a top eight finish and automatic qualification for the last 16, they must face Jose Mourinho's men again in the knockout phase play-offs.

The first leg of that contest will take place on February 17, with the Blancos having two domestic fixtures to work through prior to that. After facing Valencia at the Mestalla, they will then play host to Real Sociedad on February 14. Arbeloa's side are within touching distance of Barcelona at the top of the Liga table.

Cole Palmer has thrown out any suggestions that he is unhappy at Chelsea and itching for a move back to Manchester. The Blues star scored a hat-trick away at Wolves on Saturday and told fans that he is not listening to the noise surrounding him. Palmer insisted he is happy in west London and not looking to leave the club any time soon, labelling rumours of his exit as ‘rubbish'.

Palmer has had, by his lofty standards, a relatively subdued season so far. Struggling with injuries and fitness concerns, the English forward has been unable to maintain a consistent level of form and health that has allowed him to soar to become one of the best players in the Premier League. Yet, on Saturday, he showcased just why it is too soon to write him off as anything but that.

Palmer was the star of the show as the Blues saw off bottom of the table Wolves 3-1 at Molineux. The Blues took the lead early in the game when Palmer sent Jose Sa the wrong way from the penalty spot after Joao Pedro was sent tumbling to the turf in the box after just 13 minutes.

The Brazilian was then on the end of another foul, a push in the back when running through on goal, and was awarded yet another spot kick. Palmer put the ball into the opposite corner this time, with Sa diving the opposite direction once again.

The former Manchester City man then rounded off a first half hat-trick when he rifled into the roof of the net from around eight yards out after a cutback from defender Marc Cucurella. The Blues man celebrated with his trademark celebration before putting his hands over his ears, telling the crowd he was not listening to any noise.

The noise circulating Palmer has been incessant in recent weeks, with multiple reports suggesting that the Chelsea attacker is unhappy in west London and is looking for a move back up north, where he grew up. Palmer is known to be a Manchester United fan and came through the Manchester City academy and has been touted with a move to the former in recent weeks as a potential replacement for Bruno Fernandes.

Yet Palmer was keen to quash any speculation after the Wolves game. Speaking to BBC's Match of the Day, he said: “Everyone loves to chat rubbish, don't they? I don't pay too much attention to it.

“You see things. But I feel like I've come from a strong place anyway so I don't pay attention to it.”

Since switching the blue of Manchester for the blue of London, Palmer has become a superb footballer and an integral part of Chelsea, no matter which manager he has been playing under. He was signed by Mauricio Pochettino, under whom he exploded from a fringe player into one of the standout talents in the division.

After the departure of Pochettino, Enzo Maresca made Palmer his talisman and the Englishman helped the Blues finish in the Champions League qualification spots and lift both the Conference League and the Club World Cup.

Now under the stewardship of Liam Rosenior, Palmer has a new boss to contend with. He is already loving life under the new Blues boss.

“Life under Liam is amazing, he gives us all confidence,“ he said. “He lets us be ourselves, play free. I'm sure when I'm back proper fit, you'll see the best of me. Him and all the staff give us all confidence on the training pitch, with his strategies, the way we play… I really like it.”

Chelsea have made a fast start to life under Rosenior and are looking up the table. The Blues sit fifth, which will likely be a Champions League spot, but will be determined to close the gap on the teams above them. They are just four points off Manchester City, who sit second.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Milwaukee Bucks star pledges to 'push the game to new heights' after investing in WSL champions","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/giannis-antetokounmpo-joins-chelsea-womens-ownership-group-milwaukee-bucks/bltdc5b8aa53688a59f","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 08:16:45 GMT","

NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo has joined the ownership group of Women's Super League champions Chelsea. Antetokounmpo is a close friend of Alexis Ohanian, who is a minority owner of the Blues' women's side, and the 'Greek Freak' has decided to purchase his own stake in the club as he continues to bolster his investment portfolio.

Antetokounmpo, like many of the NBA's European stars, is a huge soccer fan and has added a second football club to his growing list of investments. He and his brothers, Alex, Kostas and Thanasis, became minority owners of Major League Soccer team Nashville SC back in 2023, while Giannis also owns a stake in the Major League Baseball franchise Milwaukee Brewers.

Antetokounmpo took to social media late on Saturday night to announce the news of his latest investment, writing: ""I'm proud and honored to partner with my friend @alexisohanian, joining the ownership group of @ChelseaFCW, a historic club built on passion, excellence, and a winning culture. Chelsea's history speaks for itself, and I'm excited to contribute to the future by supporting continued growth and impact in women's sport. This is about ambition, legacy, and pushing the game to new heights. Up the Chels!""

Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit and husband of tennis legend Serena Williams, bought a 10 percent stake in Chelsea Women from BlueCo in May 2025. At the time, Ohanian said: ""I've bet big on women's sports before - and I'm doing it again. I'm proud to announce that I'm joining Chelsea Women as an investor and board member. I'm honored for the chance to help this iconic club become America's favourite WSL team and much, much more.""

Though Antetokounmpo is now officially a part owner of Chelsea, he was in fact once a fan of their London rivals, Arsenal. In 2020, he said: ""I used to watch a lot of football when I was growing up. My dad was a football player and football was our life. I started playing basketball when I was 13. My favourite team used to be Arsenal and my favourite player used to be Thierry Henry. I am an Arsenal fan but I like PSG when Zlatan Ibrahimovic was here on the team. Deep down I am still an Arsenal fan.""

However, during a conversation on X, formerly Twitter, last year, the Greek was asked which football team he supported, and admitted he had lost his love for the Gunners. ""Back in the day Arsenal. Now probably Real Madrid,"" he replied.

Antetokounmpo made headlines off the court earlier this week when he controversially partnered with prediction market Kalshi. This came after he decided not to pursue a trade away from the Milwaukee Bucks at the NBA trade deadline, despite extensive reporting suggesting he would try and engineer an exit to a title contender.

The 31-year-old could be watching from afar on Sunday when Chelsea travel to neighbours Tottenham in the WSL. The Blues are 12 points behind league leaders Manchester City and are set to miss out on the title for the first time since 2019, though despite this recently tied head coach Sonia Bompastor - the successor to current USWNT boss Emma Hayes - down to a new contract.

Meanwhile, USWNT star Catarina Macario could leave Chelsea in the near future after rejecting the offer of a new deal.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi turned the clock back when scoring a stunning solo goal for Inter Miami in their latest pre-season friendly. The Argentine GOAT found himself lining up against Barcelona. He was not reunited with former employers from Camp Nou, but was in action on Ecuadorian soil. The all-time great gave those in the stands what they came for when dancing past defenders and hitting the back of the net.

MLS Cup winners Inter Miami have been working through a tour of South America. Messi is getting himself back up to speed after rewriting the history books again in 2025. He has become the first man to win back-to-back MVP awards in the United States.

A notable hat-trick will soon be chased down, while also looking to defend his Golden Boot award. Javier Mascherano's side continue to look to their talismanic captain for inspiration, with a contract extension in South Florida being agreed through 2028.

Messi has opened his goal account for the new year, and did so in spectacular style when lining up against Barcelona SC. With a little over half-an-hour gone in that contest, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner picked up possession a long way out.

He immediately set off towards the penalty area, despite seeing several yellow shirts blocking his path. Three defenders descended upon him when reaching the edge of the box. Messi shifted the ball beyond two of them with the outside of his famous left foot.

Without breaking stride, and having worked a yard of space, the Argentina international whipped a shot back across the face of goal and into the corner of the net - leaving opposition keeper Jose Contreras flapping at fresh air.

Inter Miami were pegged back in the 41st minute, but restored their lead in first-half stoppage-time when Messi teed up German Berterame. Mascherano made a number of changes in the second half, with his skipper being replaced by Luis Suarez just before the hour mark.

The Herons were unable to see the game out, after seeing David Ayala sent off, with Argentine midfielder Tomas Martinez ensuring that the game ended 2-2 when levelling for the hosts three minutes from time.

Inter Miami will now turn their attention to a MLS season opener against Son Heung-min and LAFC on February 21. Their opening five games of the new campaign will be played away from home as work on Freedom Park is completed.

Messi will be hoping to hit his stride as quickly as possible, allowing him to feel comfortable with his form and fitness ahead of the 2026 World Cup finals - with the expectation being that he will join Argentina's squad for a global title defence.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario has admitted that his team could find themselves dragged into a relegation scrap as their poor form continued on Saturday. Spurs were woeful again as they whimpered to a 2-0 defeat to Manchester United and left them looking over their shoulders at the sides below, with only six points separating themselves from the bottom three.

Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes scored the goals to hand Michael Carrick his fourth victory in as many games as United showed their opposition that the grass can be greener in a comfortable home victory. Thomas Frank has been under immense scrutiny in north London for a desperately poor set of results, particularly in the Premier League, which leaves the club in 14th spot.

Spurs have been abject at times under the Danish coach and many suggest that his time in charge could be facing an early termination should performances remain poor. With Newcastle and Arsenal making up their next two opponents in the division, there is a chance that the club slip further and further down the table and towards danger.

The nerves around the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium were eased only slightly by last week's draw with Manchester City and the Spurs faithful will be getting twitchy seeing the sides below them earning wins when they have just two victories in the last 16 games.

The threat of relegation for Spurs is a reality, and one Vicario is refusing to rule out. The Italian is adamant that they do not want to become complacent and get dragged into a scrap amongst the likes of West Ham, Nottingham Forest, Leeds and Crystal Palace.

After Saturday's loss to United, Vicario was asked if the club was in a relegation battle. He replied: “It depends how you see things in life. The reality is that in terms of results we have struggled a lot.

“Two wins in the last 16 is not acceptable for this football club, but we don't have to forget how we are trying to push ourselves in tough conditions. This is the reality.”

West Ham's victory over Burnley on Saturday afternoon tightened the gap on Spurs and the rest of the sides above them. The teams between 14th and 18th are tightly compacted and separated by just six points, with a poor run between now and the end of the season likely to cost one of those sides a place in the English top flight next season.

Wolves and Burnley appear all but relegated, but there remains one spot open for a straggler. The Hammers are the form team of the clubs battling at the bottom, winning four of their last five games in all competitions – their only defeat coming against London rivals Chelsea in dramatic circumstances.

Leeds came out victors against Forest on Friday in a relegation six pointer and have a strong home form at Elland Road which should see them able to keep their heads above the parapet. Sean Dyche's Forest have work to do and are only three points clear of the drop, but have been okay in recent weeks.

Palace and Spurs are the two sides facing the biggest uphill battle to build momentum. The Eagles began the season remarkably and underwent a lengthy 14-match unbeaten run, but have seen their performances are results fall of a cliff. Their task has not been aided by the departure of captain Marc Guehi.

Newcastle make the trip down south on Tuesday night as the Magpies look to compound the misery on Thomas Frank. The Dane could be shown the exit door if results remain stagnant and, as Vicario is well aware, staving off the threat of relegation proves too tough a test for the former Brentford coach.

North London is split desperately and there could not be a greater divide between Arsenal and Spurs this season. Spurs' bitter rivals appear to be running away with the Premier League title and Mikel Arteta will delight at putting the final nail in Frank's coffin should the Spurs boss remain in the job that long.

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Williams Team Principal James Vowles sits down with Lawrence Barretto to discuss why the outlook now looks brighter for the squad despite missing the recent Barcelona Shakedown.

In the second week of January, Williams Team Principal James Vowles says he and the team realised there was a problem with production that left them behind on certain parts.

That left Vowles with ""one of the hardest"" decisions of his career – try to make the Barcelona Shakedown or skip it to ensure the team were ready for Bahrain testing with the in-season development plan unscathed. Neither was ideal but for Vowles, but it was clear there was only one option – the latter. And so ensued a painful period as they watched all 10 of their rivals get started on 2026 while they were on the sidelines.

Fast forward a couple of weeks to now, though, and things are looking significantly brighter, in yet another example of how quickly things can change in Formula 1.

The team have completed their first shakedown with the FW48 breaking cover at a damp Silverstone last week – with Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz getting a taste of their new office before the car was sent on to Bahrain for final preparations ahead of the first official pre-season test, which starts on Wednesday.

""I have no concerns about going forward from here,"" Vowles tells me when we sit down to chat in the Williams Experience Centre, surrounded by a suite of historic Williams cars that combined have won nine Teams' Championships and seven Drivers' titles, at their HQ in Grove.

""As strange as this sounds, we need to as an organisation go through these sorts of events. I wish it wasn't as extreme as what it was, but we need to go through that to make sure we absolutely flush out every part of our business that simply is not at the right level and fit the purpose and learn from it very quickly – and we are.

""What I've seen out of it is the drivers pulled closer together, the board pulled closer together, the team pulled together through this. Even while we're still now in the midst of making sure we're preparing for Bahrain and beyond, there was an ongoing review of what can we do right now to make sure that we make changes that bring us in the right direction forward.""

Vowles' decision was made easier by the fact that, while they have ambitions to be World Championship contenders once again, they are not yet at that level.

The iconic British team are in the midst of a rebuild, which began in 2023 when Vowles joined as Team Principal from Mercedes, with all corners of the business getting attention to ensure they are strengthened sufficiently to cope with the challenge of trying to fight for wins and titles on a consistent basis.

They believe taking a hit now to ensure a smooth campaign ahead – even if they are playing catch-up slightly – is worth it, so long as it keeps them on course to be fighting at the front in a few years' time.

""We're not championship level,"" says Vowles. ""We're not championship level across the board. But we are nudging everything forward in the right direction of travel and so part of that is there will always be investment in our long-term – and I can't state that enough.

""That's why 2025 (when Williams finished fifth overall) was successful. It was the investment in 2023. And that's why our future will be successful. It's the investments in the current year.

""That's what I love about the cost cap. It forces you to, do you want to focus on the next race or an update? Or do you want to focus on goodness that can apply across the next three years fundamentally?

""It's not as easy a decision as it may sound on the outset but, to that point, the reason for making the decision on Barcelona is to protect what we're doing in terms of upgrade strategy across the year.""

Williams carried out a test in the virtual world while everyone else was in Barcelona, and Vowles says that helped them ""remove some of the gremlins"" which are normal when you have a new car that has been started from scratch after sweeping changes to the chassis and power unit regulations.

But they will have to do a bit of work in real life at the track early doors in Bahrain on areas such as correlation to ensure everything is working as it was in the sim world, whereas many of their rivals will have already done that in Barcelona.

Still, with six days of running, there is plenty of time to catch up and ensure they hit the ground running when points are first on offer in Australia.

What's the target for this year, then?  They finished fifth last year, with the highs of two podium finishes for Sainz and a superb P9 in the Drivers' Championship standings for Albon after a stellar opening two-thirds of the campaign.

That was a big step forward, given the team had finished 10th, seventh and ninth in the previous three campaigns. It was even more impressive given they turned off development very, very early in 2025 to switch all resources to 2026 and the new rules in the hope of getting the headstart on the next generation of car.

Is it realistic to expect at least the same, or should they be more cautious given the level of competition and the fact they pleasantly surprised themselves with the level they showed last year?

For Vowles, it's pretty clear. Yes, fighting for championships is the end goal, but last year's form needs to be the minimum they should expect of themselves as they move forward with their rebuild.

""I want to treat last year as a baseline, the base we operate from,"" says Vowles. ""And we want to move forward from there. We want to move every part of the business forward so that includes simulation capability, aerodynamics, build of the car, design of the car, the flow of where we go on upgrades etc.

""It really is pushing the boundary and a lot of those are metrics that you can't see. Some of them in the real world translate to performance on track.

""But it's making sure that what we did last month is not acceptable for what we're going to be doing in the next month. What we did last year is a nice baseline. We need to nudge it forward from there.""

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

It's almost Super Bowl time, so there's no better time to break down all the crossovers between F1 and American football, including investors, collaborations and a special livery reveal round the corner...

It's Super Bowl Sunday! Across the world, millions will be tuning in to watch the Seattle Seahawks take on the New England Patriots for the Vince Lombardi Trophy, along with a blockbuster halftime show from Bad Bunny. Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara is hosting Super Bowl LX, leaving many viewers facing a tough time zone difference, but racing fans planning to stay up will get a special Formula 1 treat partway through the game...

Our newest team Cadillac are fully leaning into their American roots, announcing their 2026 livery during a Super Bowl television advert. The first look of the design that Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas' will be driving is sure to be a highlight of the evening, but it's far from the first time that American football and F1 have crossed paths.

Whether it's the Miami Grand Prix's incorporation of the NFL stadium, the various investments from drivers and players in each other's sports, or the many cameos made by NFL stars at race weekends, the two sports have more in common than ever before. Let's explore all the connections between the two as we approach kick-off in the NFL season finale...

Back in early December, Cadillac announced that they were revealing their debut livery during one of the coveted Super Bowl commercial breaks – another fresh idea to reveal a design. With this reveal, the American team are continuing to build their North American fan base that came with the hiring of Mexican Perez and test driver Coltan Herta.

We will get to see their 2026 contender during Bahrain testing in the coming weeks, having seen it adorned in the special shakedown livery in Barcelona, as they build up to their maiden F1 season.

American football and racing are never closer than during the Miami Grand Prix race weekend. Debuting in 2022, the Miami International Autodrome was designed around the Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins.

There are two paddocks at the track – one near the pit lane and another situated inside the stadium itself. The field becomes home to media facilities and team buildings, but the grass still sees footballing action, as Dolphins players regularly come down to teach the grid some skills.

Kicking, throwing and catching drills are a highlight for the drivers, despite their consistent struggles, but they'll feel better seeing some of the NFL players reactions to speed. McLaren's Oscar Piastri flexed some of his racing muscles when giving Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa a hot lap – an experience that certainly thrilled if not scared the American!

Given the size of both sports, it was inevitable that big players in both worlds would see opportunity in the other. Lewis Hamilton has a diverse range of interests, but recently American football has been at the forefront of his mind.

In 2022, the seven-time World Champion became part owner of the three-time Super Bowl-winning Denver Broncos. Since then, Hamilton has attended several games and followed the Broncos' journey to the AFC Championship game religiously, as they agonisingly fell to the Patriots 10-7.

In 2023, this time it was the turn of some of the NFL's biggest stars to invest in motorsport. Kansas City Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, winners of three Super Bowls as team mates, joined Otro Capital's consortium that invested into Alpine. Quarterback Mahomes checked out his new favourite team at last year's Miami Grand Prix, and he'll be hoping the French outfit improve from last year's struggles thanks to the new regulations.

We couldn't mention the NFL without bringing up eight-time race winner Daniel Ricciardo. The Australian was looking for a franchise to follow, but after meeting Buffalo Bills quarterback and future NFL MVP Josh Allen in 2019, his heart was set.

The pair became good friends, and Ricciardo has been a superfan ever since, eventually making it to his first Bills game in Buffalo in 2024. The 36-year-old even got the chance to catch a football from the legendary Tom Brady in 2019, with the American launching a ball from yacht to yacht in Monaco – a memorable moment for Daniel!

Elite athletes love getting a taste of the action at some huge sporting events, and it's no different when it comes to NFL and F1 stars. The introduction of the Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023 was a golden opportunity for the grid to take advantage of the city and catch some NFL action, with Lando Norris, Carlos Sainz, and Alex Albon all visiting the Las Vegas Raiders last year at the start of race week. Elsewhere, Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson visited the Los Angeles Rams in 2024, even getting on the pitch for some pictures with the players!

There have been countless NFL icons who have been drawn to the spectacle of F1 over the years. Dallas Cowboys duo Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb paid a visit to the Red Bull garage in Miami in 2023, while last year, former LA Rams champions Jalen Ramsey and Odell Beckham Jr made it to the grid in Florida, along with legendary running back Derrick Henry.

Brothers T.J. and J.J. Watt, who have four NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards between them, were invited to the Haas garage for the 2022 Miami Grand Prix – even finding time to take on some pitstop challenges! Another guest of Red Bull in Miami last year, 2022 NFL Offensive Player of the Year Justin Jefferson also had a go with the wheel gun, although he looked slightly bemused by the technology.

Some older players have also made appearances in days gone by – including seven-time Super Bowl champion Brady, who caught up with Nico Rosberg at the 2016 Monaco Grand Prix. His former Patriots team mate Rob Gronkowski was seen in Miami last year, and former Cincinnati Bengals receiver Chad Ochocinco Johnson was in Vegas for Max Verstappen's 2025 win. Hall of Famer Michael Strahan was a guest of McLaren for last year's Dutch Grand Prix, while Hamilton and 2014 Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson met up before the 2018 Canadian Grand Prix.

Actor and television host Terry Crews has become a regular in the paddock over the past few seasons, with the ‘White Chicks' star even becoming a member of the post-race interviews line-up in Vegas. The pairing has become a natural fit given Crews' charisma and the ever-growing flair of the North American race weekends.

But did you know that Crews is a former professional football player? Between 1991 and 1997, he played in the NFL as a defensive end and linebacker for several teams, including the Green Bay Packers and San Diego Chargers, before heading into acting and presenting. And we're pretty glad he made the switch!

Not only has Crews captivated the F1 audiences – he's provided some pretty unforgettable viral moments – who could forget when he chaperoned Verstappen, Norris and George Russell to the Las Vegas podium in the pink Lego Cadillac?

Netflix's Drive to Survive and America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have been two of the biggest shows on the platform, and the two came together at the 2024 United States Grand Prix in Texas. Based not far from the Circuit of The Americas, the NFL team's cheerleaders were everywhere during the race weekend, getting pictures with drivers, performing on the grid, and even waving the flag as Ferrari claimed a one-two with Charles Leclerc and Sainz.

""Honestly, there's no one we wish we could thank in person at this moment more than we would love to thank Catherine O'Hara,"" Rogen said, which led the audience to erupt in applause Saturday night.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



The Studio directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg honored Catherine O'Hara during their acceptance speech for outstanding directorial achievement for a comedy series at the 2026 DGA Awards. 


	“Honestly, there's no one we wish we could thank in person at this moment more than we would love to thank Catherine O'Hara,” Rogen said, which led the audience to erupt in applause, as Goldberg added, “We grew up in Canada, and she is and was quite literally our idol since we were children.”




	O'Hara portrayed movie executive Patty Leigh in Rogen and Goldberg's Apple TV comedy. She appeared in all 10 episodes of The Studio‘s hit first season, and notably earned herself a 2025 Emmy nomination for best supporting actress in a comedy series.

	The Beetlejuice actress died Jan. 30 at her home in Los Angeles after a brief illness. She was 71. 


	Rogen cited the two-time Emmy winner's iconic role in the Home Alone franchise as a moment that made him want to make his own films. 


	“Home Alone honestly is the movie that made me want to make movies in a lot of ways,” he said. “And I mean, in that movie she's always yelling, ‘Kevin, Kevin,' and on set she would always be yelling, ‘Evan, Evan!' And every time she did it, we were like, ‘It's like Home Alone.'” 


	“The best part of her is she showed that you can be an utter genius and also the nicest person in the entire world,” Goldberg continued. 

	











	“Every day we worked very hard to make the show good enough to warrant her time and her presence. So, ultimately, we would like to thank the DGA for this, but we would mostly like to thank Catherine O'Hara for being such a wonderful person,” Rogen said to conclude their acceptance speech. 


	Following O'Hara's death, The Studio cast, crew and producers paid tribute to their late star, with Apple TV and Lionsgate Television sharing in a joint statement, “We are all heartbroken by the loss of Catherine O'Hara.”


	Elsewhere on Saturday night's awards ceremony, Paul Thomas Anderson won the top prize of outstanding directorial achievement in theatrical feature film for One Battle After Another. 


	“This is an incredible, incredible honor. We're going to take it with the love that it's given and the appreciation of all our comrades in this room,” Anderson said during his acceptance speech, noting “obviously we are up here minus one,” paying tribute to first director Adam Somner, who passed away from cancer in November 2024.


	Earlier, Christopher Nolan kicked off the night with his first presidential speech since he was elected DGA president, where he acknowledged “that our members are having very hard times.” 


	“Tonight is a celebration of extraordinary work and it should be a very joyful one, but I do want to start by just acknowledging that our members are having very hard times. In 2024, our employment in our guild was down about 40 percent, and that was followed by another decline in '25,” Nolan added. “The amount of money that people spend on our work, on entertainment, is very, very stable. Audiences are invested in us, we have to be sure that we're able to repay that investment.”

""We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her,"" the 'Today' host said in a new video message on Instagram Saturday. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Savannah Guthrie has issued a new video message acknowledging that her family has received a message from the suspected kidnappers of her mother, Nancy Guthrie.


	Sitting with her her brother, Camron Guthrie, and sister, Annie Guthrie, Savannah began, “We received your message, and we understand.” 




	“We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her,” she said in the new video shared on Instagram Saturday. “This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”

	“Bring her home,” Savannah wrote in the caption of the new post.

	On Wednesday, Savannah, Camron and Annie addressed their mother's suspected kidnapper for the first time, noting in the video, “Our mom is our heart and our home. She's 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, and she needs it not to suffer.”


	“We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk,” Savannah continued. “However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please. Reach out to us.”

	











	And on Thursday, Savannah's brother Camron, a retired F-16 fighter pilot, shared a separate video on his sister's Instagram page, pleading for those responsible “to reach out.”


	“This is Camron Guthrie. I'm speaking for the Guthrie family,” he began in the video. “Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you. We haven't heard anything directly. We need you to reach out and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward. But first, we have to know that you have our mom. We want to talk to you and we are waiting for contact.”


	In each post Savannah and the Guthrie family have made concerning the disappearance of their mother, the caption reads, “Bring her home.” 


	On Tuesday, Pima County Sheriff's Department acknowledged the reporting of a ransom note, that was originally obtained by TMZ and at least two local news outlets in Arizona on Tuesday, saying that investigators are “following all leads.”


	Nancy was reported missing on Sunday by family members after she didn't show up for church. The Hollywood Reporter confirmed with the Pima County Sheriff's Department that they believe Nancy may have been abducted or kidnapped. Sheriff Chris Nanos told CBS News on Monday that he believes Nancy was taken from her home as she slept.


	“I believe she was abducted, yes,” Nanos told CBS News. “She didn't walk from there. She didn't go willingly.” 


	Nanos has explained that there is an added layer of urgency to find Nancy as she is without her daily medications that could lead to serious health risks, including death. Amid an ongoing investigation, Nanos additionally noted on Wednesday that he is hopeful Nancy is still alive. 

	











	Savannah exited her planned Winter Olympics coverage amid the search for her mother, as commentators for NBC acknowledged her absence during Friday's opening ceremony. 


	“We're certainly without a very important and beloved member of our team tonight,” host Terry Gannon said of Savannah. “She is dearly missed by everybody.”


	Earlier Saturday, President Donald Trump shared an update on the search for Nancy, telling reporters reporters he received new information on the case from federal law enforcement and the FBI. 


	“I think we're doing very well in that regard. You're probably surprised to hear that,” Trump said. “I think we're doing very well, meaning we have some clues, I think that are very strong and I think we could have some answers coming up fairly soon.”


More to come.

""Those that are opposed don't fully understand how good the concept of this Deal is for them, but they will in the future,"" the president wrote on Truth Social Saturday. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	President Donald Trump is showing support for the pending Nexstar–Tegna merger.


	Trump took to Truth Social on Saturday where he shared his thoughts on the deal, which is under review by the FCC, writing in favor of the merger that he says “will help knock out the Fake News.” 




	“We need more competition against THE ENEMY, the Fake News National TV Networks. Letting Good Deals get done like Nexstar – Tegna will help knock out the Fake News because there will be more competition, and at a higher and more sophisticated level,” the president wrote. “Those that are opposed don't fully understand how good the concept of this Deal is for them, but they will in the future. GET THAT DEAL DONE! PRESIDENT DJT.”

	In August, Nexstar and Tegna entered a definitive agreement for a merger, which would see the former company emerge with 265 local TV stations in 44 states and the District of Columbia and 132 of the country's 210 television DMAs, or Nielsen's Designated Market Areas. In total, this would cover 80 percent of U.S. TV households.


	And while the merger hasn't been approved yet by the FCC, chairman Brendan Carr reshared Trump's social media post in support of said deal on Saturday. 


	“President Trump is exactly right,” Carr wrote on X Saturday. “The national networks like Comcast & Disney have amassed too much power. For years, they've been pushing this Hollywood & New York programming all over the country with no real checks.”

	











	The FCC chairman concluded, “Let's get it done and bring real competition to them.” 


Nexstar CEO Perry Sook released a statement in November, where he argued, “Nexstar's acquisition of TEGNA will provide us with the scale necessary for local journalism to thrive amidst a media landscape that is dominated by Big Tech and the legacy media companies, enabling us to continue not only investing in high-quality journalism and local news, but in serving our local communities in the best possible way.”


	“To be clear, in an age of disinformation and political agendas, we are the anti-fake news,” Sook said. “Our news is delivered by trusted, familiar voices — journalists who live in the community — not a chatbot or social media influencers. And yet, we are prohibited from broadcasting trusted local news and programming to hundreds of communities across the country because of antiquated regulatory constraints. In an era where political discourse has turned increasingly polarized and violent, our democracy requires that Americans have easy access to reliable fact-based journalism and community forums to debate the issues of the day safely and respectfully.”


	Trump recently weighed in on another major merger currently dominating Hollywood, that of Netflix and Paramount Skydance's battle to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, telling NBC News‘ Tom Llamas' that he “shouldn't be involved” in the fight for the company.


	“I haven't been involved,” Trump said. “I must say, I guess I'm considered to be a very strong president. I've been called by both sides. It's the two sides, but I've decided I shouldn't be involved. The Justice Department will handle it.”

	











	While Netflix announced plans to acquire Warner Bros. for $82 million, Paramount has fought against this, subsequently launching a $108.7 billion hostile offer for the entire company. Warner Bros. subsequently denied Paramount's offer, which led the David Ellison-led company to file a lawsuit, seeking more information about how they settled on accepting Netflix's offer.


	Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos appeared before the U.S. Senate's antitrust subcommittee on Tuesday, where he said that the company acquiring Warner Bros. would help save the studio from “deep-pocked tech companies trying to run away with the TV business.”

'The Odyssey' filmmaker, who was elected president of the Directors Guild of America last year, spoke at Saturday's awards. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


Christopher Nolan, the newly elected president of the Directors Guild of America, presided over his first DGA Awards on Saturday night, as he kicked off the ceremony with a passionate speech.


	Nolan was elected in September to serve as president of the Hollywood directors union, and returned to its annual awards show in very different fashion than two years ago, when he won the top prize for Oppenheimer.




	This time around, he began by showing appreciation to the guild's board members and telling those in the room, “If you like the way the organization is running and you see things you like, or more importantly if you don't like the way we're doing things, please come and get involved… we need as many voices as possible.”

	Nolan noted how being a director can be “a lonely profession, and having us all come together on occasions like this is what helps us have strengths together in our conversations and our dealings with the studios. A lot of heavy hitters here tonight.” He joked he wasn't “supposed to talk too much about business” but took a moment to shout out the negotiations committee, who “have spent many, many months figuring out what's going on in this crazy world of ours.”


	The filmmaker, whose highly anticipated film The Odyssey comes out in July, is leading the union at a very fraught time in Hollywood, as production has slowed, AI is threatening jobs and one Hollywood giant (Netflix) is attempting to swallow another (Warner Bros.). There are also labor negotiations with studios and streamers on the horizon, with discussions expected to begin on May 11, after SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America initiate their own negotiations. 

	











	“Tonight is a celebration of extraordinary work and it should be a very joyful one, but I do want to start by just acknowledging that our members are having very hard times. In 2024, our employment in our guild was down about 40 percent, and that was followed by another decline in '25,” Nolan continued. “The amount of money that people spend on our work, on entertainment, is very, very stable. Audiences are invested in us, we have to be sure that we're able to repay that investment.”


	“It's the people in this room that were able to look forward and realize what an audience wants before they even know they wanted it. And no Pam and Mike, I'm not talking about you,” he teased to Warner Bros.' Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca. “The directors — we are the storytellers, we are the people who have to innovate on the screen and it's very important that as our industry progresses, as new technologies and new forms of distributions come along, that we are always sensitive to how are our voices being put across, how can we get our messages across, how can we engage with that audience and pay that investment that they continue to give us. The best argument on that is to look at the work represented here tonight.”

The director admitted he ""promised"" himself he would work with 'The Notebook' actress again following their time collaborating on 2022's 'Multiverse of Madness.'


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Sam Raimi believes Rachel McAdams was “underutilized” in his 2022 Marvel film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. 


	When discussing their collaboration on Send Help, Raimi's survival thriller that stars The Notebook actress alongside Dylan O'Brien, the director recently told Total Film he “promised” himself he would work with McAdams again following their time collaborating on the Doctor Strange sequel. In fact, Raimi noted that he thought she wasn't utilized to her full potential in the latter film.




	“First, she was the perfect person because she's such a brilliant actress,” he said of McAdams starring in Send Help. “I had a chance to work with her on my last film and saw how talented she was and actually underutilized. And I promised myself that I would work with her again. And then this film came up, and her warmth is wonderful.”

	McAdams portrayed Dr. Christine Palmer in Multiverse of Madness, Stephen Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) former girlfriend. The Spider-Man director added that McAdams playing a “dark, terrible villain” in Send Help “really sets the audience up to be surprised” because it differs from roles she's played in the past.


	“And because the movie's focus is not a whodunnit, but what comes next, that's what really the movie wants to do to the audience,” Raimi continued. “They don't know what's right around the corner; it turns left when they think it's gonna turn right. That was an important factor, that she, this good person that we know and love, becomes this terrible villain.”

	











The Hollywood Reporter pointed out contrast this in its Send Help review, as Frank Scheck wrote, “In the past, McAdams has proved equally fine at romantic comedy and serious drama, but this role stretches her in ways she's never handled before. She's fully up to the challenge, making Linda's transformation from meek dweeb to badass survivalist fully convincing and enormous fun to watch.” 


	Raimi previously raved about McAdams' role in the film at its Los Angeles premiere in January, telling THR that “Rachel was a great choice [for the part] because she's never gone [this dark] before and she really knows how to, and yet she can do comedy brilliantly.” 


	“There's a very tough woman there who usually just shows off her beauty, her great skills as an actress, her feminine side, but not the monster within,” he continued. “And fortunately, all actors and actresses have monsters within them to bring out; I know from personal experience.”

	Arnold's death was confirmed earlier in the day by the rock group via social media, prompting messages of remembrance from fellow musicians who toured alongside him during the peak of post-grunge and hard rock's commercial dominance in the early 2000s.

	Among the first to publicly pay tribute was Brent Smith of Shinedown, who shared a video message recalling how 3 Doors Down helped his band early in their career.

	











	“You guys were the first band that ever took us out on the road,” Smith said, referencing Shinedown's opening slot for 3 Doors Down in 2003. “Brad was always kind, always encouraging, and always real.”




	He captioned the post: “Thank you for the music. Thank you for the songs. Thank you for your love. Thank you for your friendship, and thank you for inspiring us all. May your light shine through all of time, and space forever.”


	Alter Bridge wrote, “Thank you Brad, your friendship was one we will hold close forever. Until we meet again,” Sevendust added, “Rest now brother. Thank you for all you have given us.” 


	Creed offered a brief note of support — “Sending love to the Arnold and 3DD family” — as Black Stone Cherry remembered Arnold as an early champion, adding, “Brad was always such a top notch, class act to us… Even before we were anything at all — he supported us.”


	Mark Tremonti also shared a personal message, calling Arnold “one of the kindest people I've ever had the privilege of calling my friend.”


	“It is absolutely heartbreaking to realize that you'll never get to perform or just have a laugh with a friend that you grew up with in the music industry,” Tremonti added.


	David Draiman of Disturbed echoed those sentiments, writing: “Brad was always a gentleman, a stellar musician, and a good man. May his memory be a blessing to all who knew and loved him.”


	Producer Howard Benson — who has worked across rock radio staples for decades — also paid tribute, writing, “I will always cherish the time we spent together making music and talking about life. RIP Brad.”


	Additional tributes came from artists including Seether, Adam Gontier of Three Days Grace, Staind, and more.


	Arnold co-founded 3 Doors Down in Escatawpa, Mississippi, and rose to prominence as the voice behind the band's breakout 2000 single “Kryptonite,” which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and helped propel the group's debut album The Better Life to multi-platinum status. The band went on to score multiple top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 and a string of mainstream rock radio staples throughout the 2000s.

	











	In recent years, Arnold had spoken openly about his cancer diagnosis, sharing updates with fans while continuing to express gratitude for the support he received from the music community.

Anderson, S.C., was removed from the fest's schedule this week as the lineup shifted for the multi-date, Kid Rock-led event.

	Ashley Iasimone



	Amid Rock the Country's lineup disruptions this week — with artists including Shinedown, Ludacris, Morgan Wade and Carter Faith making exits — the festival's July 25-26 weekend in Anderson, S.C., is no longer on the schedule.


	The South Carolina stop originally announced as part of an eight-city trek has been removed from Rock the Country's website. Billboard reached out to a representative for Rock the Country for comment.


	Anderson County administrator's was informed of the event being called off on Feb. 5, reports the Greenville, S.C., publication The Post and Courier. No specific reason for the cancellation was stated.

	











	As of Saturday (Feb. 7), the tour's seven other stops remain on its schedule: Bellville, Texas (May 1-2); Bloomingdale, Ga. (May 29-30); Sioux Falls, S.D. (June 27-28); Ashland, Ky. (July 10-11); Hastings, Mich. (Aug. 8-9); Ocala, Fla. (Aug. 28-29) and Hamburg, N.Y. (Sept. 11-12).




	Rock the Country's lineup varies by date, with Kid Rock, Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton, Jelly Roll, Brooks & Dunn, Riley Green, Miranda Lambert, Hank Williams Jr., Ella Langley, Lynyrd Skynrd, Jon Pardi, Brantley Gilbert and dozens more artists set to perform throughout the tour.


	Shinedown, who pulled out of the festival on Feb. 6, was one of the acts booked to perform at the South Carolina dates. The band opted to drop out after receiving backlash from fans for participating in the festival.


	While event organizers have not explicitly stated any political affiliation, headlining performers Aldean and Kid Rock have both been vocal supporters of President Donald Trump. Kid Rock and Brantley Gilbert are appearing at Turning Point USA's upcoming “All-American” alternative halftime show, set to broadcast opposite the NFL's official Super Bowl Halftime Show starring Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, whose Debí Tirar Más Fotos was recently the first all-Spanish album to win album of the year at the Grammy Awards.


	“Shinedown is everyone's band. We feel that we have been given a platform to bring all people together through the power of music and song. We have one boss, and it is everyone in the audience. Our band's purpose is to unite, not divide. With that in mind, we have made the decision that we will not be playing the Rock the Country festival,” Shinedown said in a statement posted on its social media pages on Feb. 6.


	The group stated, “We know this decision will create differences of opinion. But we do not want to participate in something we believe will create further division.”

	“I am declaring tomorrow in California as ‘Bad Bunny Day' when Bad Bunny performs at the big game in the Golden State with his soothing, beautiful voice, and his very nice looks,” Newsom said via X on Saturday.

	Newsom later amplified his support with a tongue-in-cheek follow-up message, describing himself as “a tremendous lover of the Spanish” and “a huge fan of Puerto Rico,” before adding, “We love Bad Bunny! He is nearly as ‘hot' as me — which is a big compliment, because there is nobody hotter. Happy Bad Bunny Day, America.”


	Support also came from Tim Cook, who praised the artist on social media ahead of the game in a selfie with the singer to social media.


	Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, is set to deliver an all-Spanish halftime performance at Levi's Stadium during Super Bowl LX, marking one of the most prominent Spanish-language showcases in the event's history. 


	The appearance follows a landmark year for the Puerto Rican artist, who recently won Album of the Year at the 2026 Grammy Awards, becoming the first artist to claim the prize with a Spanish-language album.

	











	Speaking earlier this week to  Access Hollywood's Scott Evans about his approach to the halftime show, Bad Bunny said, “I just want to be there. I'm just ready to do it. I want to feel it. I want people to watch it and enjoy it.”


	The designation of “Bad Bunny Day” also arrives amid heightened political attention around the halftime performance. In recent public remarks, Bad Bunny has spoken out on immigration and identity, including a statement delivered at the Grammys in Los Angeles on Feb. 1, where he said, “ICE out… We're not savage, we're not animals, we're not aliens — we are humans, and we are Americans.”


	Apple Music, which has sponsored the Super Bowl halftime show since 2023, continues its partnership with the NFL and Roc Nation, the Jay-Z-founded company responsible for selecting halftime performers. The collaboration has emphasized global and multicultural reach in recent years, with Bad Bunny's selection reflecting the NFL's expanding Spanish-language audience.


	Super Bowl LX kicks off Sunday, Feb. 8, at 6:30 p.m. ET / 3:30 p.m. PT. The game and halftime show will air on NBC, stream on Peacock, and be available via Spanish-language broadcasts on Telemundo and Universo.

The group chatted with Billboard ahead of the Super Bowl Sunday ad.

	Ashley Iasimone



	The Backstreet Boys bring a fun, reimagined version of “I Want It That Way” to T-Mobile's 2026 Super Bowl commercial, which they filmed in New York City with a snowstorm looming.


	“We were hit with the winter storm right at the exact same time we were supposed to start filming,” BSB's Nick Carter revealed in an interview with Billboard's Tetris Kelly, noting, “There was a lot of adjustments that were being made at the time because we were supposed to do a two-day shoot.”


	That two-day schedule was condensed into one long day on set in the city at T-Mobile's store in Times Square, where Carter says the temperature dropped to about six degrees, with snow imminent: “There's a state of emergency basically in the city … The inside of the store was freezing. So every time that they opened the door it was like a wind tunnel, or like a refrigerator.”

	











	As Carter shared, “It was a lot of fun, but it was also a lot of work — good work. Producers were incredible. Everybody had a lot of fun. Everybody was really creative.” He added that the group and the commercial's production team bounced ideas off of each other, while bandmate Kevin Richardson chimed in, “It was a great collaboration.”




Billboard has a backstage look at the Backstreet Boys' T-Mobile commercial shoot, premiering in the bloopers clip and the behind-the-scenes video below.


	The commercial was created in partnership with Panay Films, with a 60-second spot scheduled to air during the second quarter of the game on Super Bowl Sunday (Feb. 8). 


	“This spot is about asking Americans to pause and think about what their wireless provider actually does for them,” said Lucy McLellan, chief brand and communications officer at T-Mobile, in a statement about the ad. “We believe people deserve more than just a connection — they deserve more benefits, more transparency and a better overall experience — and that's what sets T-Mobile apart. Bringing the Backstreet Boys back was a fun way to put a fresh twist on an iconic song and bring that message to life on the biggest stage in the world. The takeaway is simple: it's better over here.”


	The in-store event had something like 50 extras present, the Backstreet Boys said: customers — and, clearly, BSB fans — at the T-Mobile store.


	Druski and Pierson Fodé are also featured in the spot, which was directed by Steve Pink and produced by creative team Andrew Panay, Brian Klugman and Nate Tuck, with Kevin Anderson as editor.


	Also among the talent was a young actor who was a pro through a commercial shoot that went late into the night due to the weather-adjusted timeline, AJ McLean recalled; her moment was opposite Machine Gun Kelly, who makes a comedic cameo at the end of the ad: “We knew that MGK had not started filming yet, and we had wrapped close to 2 a.m. and he hadn't even started filming his bit yet,” McClean said. “So that means that little girl was probably there at, like, three in the morning … But everybody, from the extras to crew, they just kept the ball rolling.”

	











	Ahead of getting on set, the Backstreet Boys put in time in the studio to record some new, funny lyrics to “I Want It That Way,” written specifically for the T-Mobile commercial.


	“We recorded several different versions of the different takes and the lyrics,” Howie Dorough shared.

Executive Editor, Awardsline


One Battle After Another director Paul Thomas Anderson has won the DGA Awards‘ top prize — Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Theatrical Feature Film — which marks a highly significant Oscar predictor.


	“It's an honor, President Nolan,” he told DGA president Christopher Nolan, to loud laughter from the audience Saturday at the Beverly Hilton.


	This was Anderson's third DGA nomination. Most recently, he was nominated for Licorice Pizza in 2021 and, before that, for There Will Be Blood in 2007.


	Ever since the first DGA Awards ceremony in 1948, the winner of its Theatrical Feature Award has predicted the Best Director Oscar winner in all but eight instances. This makes the DGA Awards a major bellwether for Oscar. Add to that, the DGA Theatrical Feature win and Oscars Best Director has matched every year for the past five.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Anderson referenced Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, saying, “It's like we're all here for a reason, some cosmic thing brought us to this room, and it was that call to the mountain. It's that feeling that we all love making sh*t and we need to do it. We need to do it or it's an addiction, I'm not quite sure.”


	On a more somber note, Anderson paid tribute to his close friend, producer and longtime first AD Adam Somner, who died in 2024 from thyroid cancer.


	“Obviously we are up here, minus one,” Anderson said. “A lot of people in this room know our hero, our man, Adam Somner. Steven [Spielberg] knows him. His wife Carmen [Ruiz de Huidobro] is here.”


	Anderson continued, “He took this work so seriously, and did not take himself seriously at all. And that was a great gift… He made us feel safe. Think about this work that we do, how dangerous it can be, really dangerous. And to be to get through a film and no one get hurt, be safe, have an amazing experience is because of a great AD, and he was the best.”

	











	Choking up a little, Anderson went on, “I wish everyone in this room the love that I had with him, may you be blessed with a relationship that I had with him, and if you have one already, hold them close, remind them that you love them. He would love this. He'd be so f*cking happy.”


	 Last year, the big DGA win went to Anora's Sean Baker, who went on to win the Directing Oscar and the film took Best Picture. Two years ago, Christopher Nolan won at the DGAs ahead of picking up Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for Oppenheimer.


	Other nominees in this same DGA category tonight Ryan Coogler for Sinners, Chloé Zhao for Hamnet, Guillermo del Toro for Frankenstein and Josh Safdie for Marty Supreme.


	Coogler is only the fifth Black director ever to be recognized in this DGA Awards category. The last was Spike Lee for BlacKkKlansman in 2018. But no Black filmmaker has ever won this top DGA prize.


	Zhao won this DGA top honor in 2021 for Nomadland (which also earned Best Picture and Best Director at Oscar) and now, with this Hamnet nomination, she joins Kathryn Bigelow, Jane Campion and Greta Gerwig as the only women to earn multiple DGA nominations. 


	In 2018, Del Toro won the DGA top film prize for The Shape of Water, while this was Safdie's first DGA nomination.

Paul Thomas Anderson won the top film prize on Saturday at the 78th DGA Awards for Warner Bros' One Battle After Another, another victory on the awards circuit this season.


	Anderson was one of four Oscar-nominated directors in tonight's marquee Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Theatrical Feature Film race, which also included Sinners' Ryan Coogler, Marty Supreme's Josh Safdie and Hamnet's Chloé Zhao. The other DGA nominee was Frankenstein's Guillermo del Toro, who lost out on the Oscar list to Sentimental Value's Joachim Trier.


	The DGA winner in the category has matched the Oscars Directing trophy in each of the last five years. Last year, the big DGA win went to Anora's Sean Baker, who went on to win Directing the Oscars along with that pic scoring Best Picture. Two years ago Christopher Nolan won at the DGAs ahead of picking up Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for Oppenheimer.

Lindsey Vonn‘s Olympic dream is in tatters after she crashed out of the Women's Downhill final.


	The 41-year-old Team USA skiing legend had taken a huge risk competing just days after announcing she had suffered an ACL rupture on her knee.


	However, the legendary Olympian crashed near the top of the Olympia delle Tofane course as she misjudged a turn, with her shoulder clipping a gate as she picked up speed. She lost her balance and crashed, with her left leg, which had sustained a significant ACL injury just over a week ago, gave way.

	Vonn was heard crying out in agony as medical staff surrounded her. After a significant pause in the time trial proceedings, she was placed on a stretcher and airlifted to a hospital. It was a devastating sight, as the 2010 downhill Winter Olympic champion, who has won four World Cups in a storied career, left the snow for what is almost certainly the final time.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Competing against a field of world-class downhill skiers, Vonn was competing as the 13th of 36 racers in Cortina d'Ampezzo. 


	The crowd watching on her silenced as they watched on following the crash, with music played as a course hold was placed on the event.


	BBC Sport reporter Chemmy Alcott, a former skier who was often Vonn's competition in the past, was visibly distressed by the event and noted that Vonn was given a standing ovation as the helicopter carrying her took off.

	











	The Women's Downhill has now resumed, as the Olympic world awaits news on Vonn's conditions. 


	Vonn had trained well and set the third-quickest time in practise runs yesterday. Her teammaker, the reigning women's downhill world champ Breezy Johnson, had earlier set the fastest time and looks set to have won the gold.


	Vonn was considered to be the highest-profile athlete at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. She had come out of retirement to put in a series of outstanding performances that placed her among the major favorites for a medal. 


	We included the star, who represented by WMG/IMG in our recent article on potential breakout stars from the Olympics, which began on Friday and runs until February 22.

A+++++++ for effort and determination!!! True inspiration for any athlete or anyone who needs to overcome anything standing in the way of success.

She should have never been out there in the first place. Pure selfish move. How many Olympics has she been to?? If she actually tore her ACL (questionable) she should have given the spot to another competitor. Put her team and home country first. Instead she used it to attention grab and compete knowing she apparenly wasn't 100%. Yeah, she's such a hero.

This 1000%! When she tore her ACL, the US Ski Team should've stepped in and said this year‘s Olympics were off the table. If the US Ski Team wasn't going to do that, Team USA should've done that. She took away a spot from another (healthy) US athlete for her own selfish reasons. Everyone was so focused on the damn Cinderella story that no one considered what was in the right interest for the health of the athlete and for the good of team USA.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	“Honestly, there's no one we wish we could thank in person at this moment more than we would love to thank Catherine O'Hara,” said The Studio creator-director-star-scribe Seth Rogen during his acceptance speech Saturday for Best Comedy Series Director at the DGA Awards.


	Both Rogen and his creative partner Evan Goldberg were recognized tonight for helming the episode “The Magic Hour.”


	“We grew up in Canada, and she is and was quite literally our idol since we were children,” said Studio co-creator/director/scribe Goldberg.


	“Yeah. I mean, Home Alone, honestly, is like the movie that made me want to make movies in a lot of ways,” said Rogen, adding, “In that movie, she's always yelling ‘Kevin! Kevin!' and on set we would be yelling ‘Evan! Evan!' Every time she did, it's like, Home Alone.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Rogen added, “And the best part of her is she showed that you can be an utter genius and also the nicest person in the entire world. It was an honor to get to direct her every day and we worked very hard to make the show good enough to warrant her time and her presence So, ultimately, we would like to thank the DGA for this, but we would mostly like to thank Catherine O'Hara for being such a wonderful person and for blessing us with your presence.”


O'Hara died last week in Los Angeles at age 71 after a brief illness. On The Studio, she played a studio executive who, after being fired, becomes a producer; the role is loosely based on former Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairwoman Amy Pascal.

	











	O'Hara was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the Emmys back in September for her turn on the Apple TV/Lionsgate series.

Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner challenged the “Kardashian curse” after sister Kendall's viral Super Bowl commercial suggested she's under a dating curse. 

“Haven't you heard? The internet says I'm cursed,” Kendall joked in the Fanatics Sportsbook ad, which references the model's series of NBA boyfriends. “Any basketball player who dates me kind of hits a rough patch.” 

Kim took to Instagram Stories on Friday to address the “curse” by sharing her Fanatics Sportsbook bet on Sunday's big game between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks.

The Skims founder, 45, shared a screen shot of her bet — 69 cents in favor of the Seahawks with the possibility of earning $347,222 — writing atop the pic, “Here me out … I'm proving the curse ISN'T real because one of us will win.”

Kylie, meanwhile, took to the same platform to share that she's also backing the Seahawks. “Kim traded on the Seahawks,” she wrote atop Kim's screengrab. 

“Am I saying I copied her by trading on the Seahawks?” she joked, referencing Kourtney and Kim's infamous rift over Kourtney having her wedding to Travis Barker in Italy, eight years after Kim wed Kanye West in the same locale. 

Kendall, meanwhile, sipped tea in a black swimsuit in the already-viral Superbowl ad for the sports betting site. 

In the ad, she sipped tea from a rose-embellished teacup. As she uttered, “Haven't you heard? The internet says I'm cursed, the rose wilted.

She then recounted her rough history with basketball players hitting “a rough patch” after dating her, striking a match and throwing the flame into a bin full of basketball jerseys.

Kendall then ambled through a mansion filled with portraits of herself and her ex boyfriends — their faces conspicuously removed. “While the world has been talking about it, I've been betting on it,” she added. 

In the next shot, she emerged from a luxurious pool in a black swimsuit. “This pool? Basketball boyfriend one missed the playoffs. I guess nobody was getting a ring in this house,” she quipped before moving onto a jet. 

In the cheeky ad, she also stepped into a sports car before approaching a jet, noting that “Boyfriend number two flopped right out of the league,”  and adding, “This cute jet? Thanks boyfriend three!” 

Once she was settled in her seat, she said she was ready to “bet on something new. Football players.” Kendall, 30, concluded the ad by quipping, “The Kardashian curse – it's not even my last name.”

Kendall indeed has dated a string of NBA stars, including Devin Booker, Ben Simmons, and Jordan Clarkson, and Blake Griffin. 

But her love interests haven't been exactly restricted to athletes — ex boyfriend Bad Bunny is set to perform at the Super Bowl on Sunday.

Michael Rubin's Fanatics Super Bowl Party was the place to be in San Francisco, Calif., on Saturday.

The annual bash was jam-packed with A-listers once again, making it one of the most sought-after parties to score an invite to during Big Game Weekend.

One of the earliest celebs to arrive and make his way down the red carpet at Pier 48 was NFL legend Tom Brady, followed by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, New York Giants star Cam Skattebo and Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow.

Shortly after, we spotted everyone from influencer Alix Earle — who, along with Brady, has been hopping around to all the hottest Super Bowl parties this week — to singer J Balvin, NFL star Odell Beckham Jr., retired NBA pro Dwight Howard, actor Jamie Foxx and “CBS Mornings” host Gayle King.

Of putting together such an A-list guest list this year, Fanatics CEO Rubin exclusively told Page Six that it was “really easy” thanks to the Patriots making it into the Super Bowl.

“I get one of my closest friends, Robert, [and Kraft Group president] Jonathan Kraft actually being in the game, that helps, by the way, when your friends are playing in the game,” he explained on the red carpet.

“What's going to make it a great week is that, we're going to have the best party ever today and then the [New England Patriots] are going to win the game tomorrow.”

Inside the star-studded bash, Page Six spotted rapper Jay-Z hanging out with friends in an exclusive, roped-off area of the venue, taking a spot right next to the stage.

Just a few feet away, “Bloody Valentine” rocker MGK was seen chatting it up with actor Kevin Costner, who became “fast friends” with the singer's close pal, Pete Davidson, at last year's VIP fête.

Kendall Jenner was also in attendance — after recently appearing in a Super Bowl 2026 ad for Fanatics Sportsbook — and at one point stopped to snap an unexpected pic with Kraft.

Other attendees included Zac Efron, Sofía Vergara, Jon Bon Jovi, Diplo, Kevin Hart, Meek Mill, Lil Baby, Teyana Taylor, Russell Wilson, Shaboozey, Drew Brees, 2 Chainz, French Montana, Reggie Bush, Guy Fieri, Fat Joe, Becky G, Tiffany Haddish, Keegan-Michael Key, Adam Devine, Emma Roberts, Livvy Dunne, Kevin Hart, Danny Amendola, Ja Rule, Lala Anthony, Camille Kostek, Kyle and Kristin Juszczyk and many more.

Guests at the party were entertained from beginning to end, with performances from Cardi B — who encouraged partygoers to take shots with her in celebration — along with SZA, Travis Scott, Ciara, 21 Savage, Don Toliver, Chase B and Nelly and Ashanti.

The Fanatics bash kicked off just one day before the New England Patriots face off against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, meanwhile, will be headlining the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show, following an opening ceremony by Green Day and pre-game performances from Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones.

“I just want to have fun, it's going to be a huge party,” the “King of Latin Trap” (real name: Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) teased during Apple Music's press conference in San Francisco Thursday.

“I don't want to give spoilers; people only need to worry about dancing. They don't even have to learn Spanish; it's better if they dance, but there's no better dance [than one] that comes from the heart.”

Tune into all the Super Bowl 2026 festivities live on NBC, Peacock, Telemundo and Universo Sunday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","What if they held a Kid Rock country music festival and no one came?","https://www.avclub.com/kid-rock-rock-the-country-shinedown-south-caroline-canceled","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 02:16:00 GMT","

It's like the old proverb says: How can you win the hearts and minds of a nation if you can't even keep Shinedown on your side? Such is the plight of Kid Rock's Rock The Country music festival, which has just added the Florida-based rock band to its list of recent festival dropouts. At the same time, outlets like Complex are reporting that the festival has just canceled what was supposed to be one of the 8 shows of its 2026 tour, dropping out of a July weekend appearance in South Carolina.

It's not clear if the two incidents are related, with representatives for Kid Rock and Rock The Country so far not deigning to speak on the topic. But you know who does deign? Shinedown, which issued a statement on social media today asserting that Shinedown refuses to be drawn into fractious political debates:

SHINEDOWN is everyone's band. We feel that we have been given a platform to bring all people together through the power of music and song. We have one BOSS, and it is everyone in the audience. Our band's purpose is to unite, not divide. With that in mind, we have made the decision that we will not be playing the Rock The Country Festival. We know this decision will create differences of opinion. But we do not want to participate in something we believe will create further division. And to our fans, thank you for supporting and believing in us. We love and appreciate you always. All love and respect, SHINEDOWN.

News of The Shinedown Withdrawal follows earlier reports that Ludacris had either dropped out of the shows, or never intended to be part of them in the first place. (Eagle-eyed Creed watchers have also noticed that the band's name has disappeared from the Rock The Country site.) There are still a lot of pretty well-known names topping the bill for the other seven shows, including Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton, and Jelly Roll, so it's not clear if the withdrawals were the reason for the South Carolina cancellation. (Local authorities have told journalists that they weren't given any motivation for why the festival pulled out.) But it's obviously pretty hard to disconnect the festival from the wider political divides in America at the moment, especially because Rock himself won't really let you, what with his endless efforts to associate himself with the Donald Trump regime—including headlining this week's Turning Point USA “All-American Halftime Show”—in ways that are definitely turning up the political heat surrounding the festival.

Law enforcement activity intensified Saturday night as investigators spent around two and a half hours inside Annie Guthrie's home.

It marked the most significant police presence at the residence in days amid the ongoing investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.

As deputies departed, one officer was observed loading a white case into his vehicle, which he had earlier carried inside, along with what appeared to be a grocery-size brown bag, according to Fox News Digital. 

Deputies ultimately left the property around 10:30 p.m. local time, but not before conducting what appeared to be a methodical and detailed search that has raised new questions about the direction of the case.

At least four members of the Pima County Sheriff's Department arrived at the home in two unmarked white SUVs and a white truck late Saturday afternoon.

The extended visit stood out, as recent days had seen little to no visible law enforcement activity at the residence.

The late-night activity comes as authorities widen their focus in the case.

Earlier Saturday, Fox News Digital reported that the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff's Department are searching for an unidentified male after two plainclothes officers visited a gas station near Nancy Guthrie's home.

A gas station employee told the outlet that investigators requested access to surveillance footage, explaining they were looking for “some guy” who had “got away.” 

The employee said no description was provided and authorities did not disclose what the footage revealed.

Adding to the uncertainty, the sheriff's department previously declined to say whether any family members have been ruled out as suspects, a statement that continues to draw attention as searches expand across multiple locations.

Deputies were also seen earlier Saturday at Nancy Guthrie's residence, indicating investigators are continuing to retrace steps and reexamine evidence.

As the investigation stretches into another critical phase, the extended late-night search at Annie Guthrie's home signals that authorities are actively pursuing new leads — even as many questions remain unanswered.

While inside the residence, investigators appeared to take photographs in the garage before moving to the opposite side of the home, where three bedrooms are located.

Bright photography flashes were visible through windows, and at one point, a jacket was placed over a window, blocking the view from media gathered outside.

Fox News Digital reporters on the scene also reported hearing clanking noises from inside the home, suggesting deputies may have been moving or handling items during the search.

One deputy was later seen exiting the residence wearing latex gloves, a detail that underscored the forensic nature of the visit. It remains unclear whether anyone is currently living in the home.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","John Travolta's Kids Look So Grown Up in Rare Family Photo: ‘My Beautiful Babies'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/john-travolta-kids-ella-ben-photo/","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 11:01:48 GMT","

John Travolta is not only a famous actor, but he's also a loving father. That's why he just shared a photo of himself with his daughter, Ella (25), and son, Ben (15), whom he shared with his late wife, Kelly Preston.

The star took to Instagram on Sunday, February 8, to post a rare shot of himself with his children. In the pic, Ella can be seen leaning against her dad, while the star has his arm around Ben.

In the caption of his post, John wrote, “My beautiful babies in my belated Christmas card 2025. Hope all is going well.”

When John shared the photo of himself with Ella and Ben on Instagram, his followers left quite a few comments letting him know what they thought of the pic.

One person wrote, “Lucky you all have each other to Love xx”

“Such a beautiful family! You're an amazing dad!🙏♥️,” came from another follower.

A third person wrote, “❤️I know how you feel. Hug them for as long as you can.”

“Beautiful, thank you for sharing dear John ✨️🫶✨️🙏❤️🌹⚘️🌹,” someone else said in a comment.

Another fan added, “What a beautiful family, it's so good to see how well you are. My heart is filled with light seeing how well you are. I'm so glad you showed up! I love you all. ❤️”

A few others commented on how big Ben has gotten.

“Benji is so big! 🙌❤️,” came from one person.

Another person wrote, “Beautiful children❤️,his son has gotten so tall.”

That's not to mention someone else who added, “Ben is getting tall. Ella is beautiful too, John.”

In August 2019, John opened up to People about Ella and Ben, who were 19 years old and 8 years old, respectively, at the time.

While talking about Ella, he said, “She is her own person. She is gracious, generous, poised, graceful and gorgeous. I don't know how she came to be, and I don't take any credit other than just adoring her. And maybe that's a valid contribution.”

As for Ben, his dad noted how many hobbies he was involved in, saying, “He's into gymnastics, tennis, fishing and the computer world, like all the kids.”

John also noted how important it is to let children share their thoughts.

“I really do believe that children have rights. Just because they are little bodies doesn't mean that they shouldn't have a say-so,” he said. 

He added, “I find when you consult them, they can come up with much better ideas than yours.”

There opinion should be acknowledged you can't say we're family&make family decisions w/o asking there opinion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Nancy Guthrie's Captors Likely Identified Soon, Former FBI Agent Says","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nancy-guthrie-captors-identity/","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 14:09:24 GMT","

A former FBI special agent believes authorities may be close to identifying those responsible for Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.

Stuart Kaplan, an ex-FBI special agent, told “Fox & Friends Weekend” on Saturday that the FBI and police are “zeroing in” on potential suspects after a vehicle was taken from Nancy's property on Friday night.

Kaplan noted that advanced technology deployed by the FBI will ultimately serve as the catalyst to break the case wide open.

“I think the FBI and its partners are zeroing in and that the noose is getting tighter and tighter,” Kaplan added. “I think every time you see law enforcement go back to the house, they have in some capacity, additional digital footprints that require them to go back and corroborate or to dismiss or dispel or to confirm.”

Kaplan also pointed out that Friday's investigative efforts, which involved the seizure of a car from Nancy's home, could yield crucial information.

“And I see this latest event of taking this car, may be one of those confirmations. It may be that this car may have been shared with someone else,” Kaplan explained. 

The former agent continued, “We haven't heard a lot about people that would come and help or assist Nancy, whether it was home healthcare aides, or just people that would come and maybe take her to the supermarket or to the beauty parlor.”

Kaplan noted that if the car has been used by someone other than Nancy, authorities may have seized it for forensic analysis.

“If, in fact, this car may have been commonly used, they may have retrieved this car for forensic analysis to see whether or not there is any fiber or hair samples, or GPS tracking to see if, in fact, prior to last Sunday, was this car used by someone to go somewhere?” he added.

When asked about his opinion on whether the suspects know Nancy personally, Kaplan said there's “no doubt” the person was familiar with her.

“This was someone who was familiar and intimate with Nancy Guthrie, her relationship with her daughter, her health issues, her medical issues,” he explained. “There's no doubt there was planning and plotting in connection with going to this house last week.”

Kaplan expressed confidence that the FBI will soon make a breakthrough, saying, “The FBI has a lot of information. It's being kept close to the vest. This case is on the precipice of being broken wide open.”

Is it wide for all the “talking heads” on TV news programs to be making comments about this investigation when a woman's life is at risk?

I think it's her daughter Annie/SIL knows something.. in my opinion they were the last to see her and who knows the mom home better than anyone?

I just pray that she still with us and comes back home soon May God bless them

Erin Krakow has been soaking in all of the excitement during her first pregnancy after announcing in November 2025 that she and her husband, Ben Rosenbaum, are expecting.

In a new Instagram post, Krakow shared an adorable photo of her growing pregnant belly with her beloved dog, Willoughby, resting on her lap.

“Siblings 🥰,” she captioned the sweet post.

The “WCTH” star also showed off her stunning engagement ring and wedding band in the snapshot as she rested her hand on Willoughby, whom she and Rosenbaum adopted from Tobie's Small Dog Rescue in January 2023, according to Krakow's previous Instagram post.

Hearties couldn't help but fawn over Krakow's dog protecting her growing belly bump, taking to her comments to reassure her that her baby and pup will be “the best of friends.”

“Aww just resting and waiting! How sweet ❤️,” wrote one fan.

“Dogs and babies together are just the sweetest 🥹 So excited for your first and second babies to officially meet 🥰,” said another.

“Aww! So sweet! He will be a fierce protector and best friend of your baby! ❤️❤️,” added a third.

“Snuggles! It's a beautiful connection,” said a fourth.

In an interview with Scary Mommy earlier this year, Krakow opened up about how her role as Elizabeth Thornton on “WCTH” has overlapped with her personal life as an expectant mom.

“This year, I've really enjoyed exploring what it means to be a protective mom — some might say overprotective mom,” she shared with the outlet of her onscreen son, Little “LJ” Jack.

When asked about the peculiarity of being pregnant at the same time as “WCTH” co-stars Kayla Wallace and her husband, Kevin McGarry, as well as co-star Chris McNally and his partner, Julie Gonzalo, the Hallmark star explained what a thrill it is to relish in the joy together.

“Oh, it's the best. It was such a surprise to learn that we were all pregnant at the same time and due within six weeks of each other,” Krakow shared. “It has been so nice to be able to lean on one another and ask questions. ‘Is this normal? How are you preparing for this? Did you find a stroller?' It's nice to have a community you can lean on, and it feels pretty comparable to the way we handle life in Hope Valley.”

With Oscars voting in full swing, and awards season entering its final stretch, tonight's Directors Guild of America Awards marked one of the last benchmarks in a tight race for Best Director. Presented the evening's top prize by last year's winner Sean Baker (“Anora”), Paul Thomas Anderson took home the honor in the Theatrical Feature Film category for “One Battle After Another.”

Coming on the heels of the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards (but ahead of the Indie Spirit Awards next weekend), the 78th annual DGA ceremony will clarified where filmmakers Anderson, Chloé Zhao (“Hamnet”), Josh Safdie (“Marty Supreme”), and Ryan Coogler (“Sinners”) stood on the podium they'll share with Joachim Trier (“Sentimental Value”) at the 98th Academy Awards. Also competing in the 2026 DGA theatrical feature film category tonight was Guillermo del Toro (“Frankenstein”).

Historically, the DGA doesn't always mirror the Academy's final Best Director lineup, but its winners often help define momentum heading into Oscars night. This year's guild honorees reflected marquee auteurs as well as an eclectic slate of first-time directors, including Hasan Hadi (“The President's Cake”), Harry Lighton (“Pillion”), Alex Russell (“Lurker”), and Eva Victor (“Sorry, Baby”), and race winner Charlie Polinger (“The Plague”). IndieWire's Marcus Jones was on the ground at the Beverly Hilton.

In 2026, it should come as no surprise that a suburban hamlet calling itself “the safest town in America” has a hidden history of violence. I mean, when Minneapolis, Minnesota — a city that's predominant cultural stereotype is rooted in how nice its people are — is too dangerous for parents to trust their kids will make it home from school every day, can any American town be considered truly and simply safe? (Not from ICE! Not from this government! Not unless you're grading on a curve!)

Even if you set reality aside (a reasonable request for a network comedy), seeing “the safest town in America” scrawled under a roadside welcome sign should register less as a reassurance than a red flag. To her credit, Samira (Keke Palmer) seems to take it that way: The new resident of Ashfield Place, a cul-de-sac nestled within a fictional New Jersey suburb, is immediately, insistently suspicious — as she should be. The Victorian across the street looks like a cartoon haunted house that's come to life. Crows roost on its dilapidated shingles and fly off simultaneously, like a choreographed murder. Speaking of the M-word, its other meaning is rumored to have happened within the pink five-bedroom with an unfinished basement, resulting in its decades-long abandonment… until now. [dun dun dun]

Samira's hair-trigger apprehension is a welcome change from her genre-forbearers, whose delayed reactions to obvious threats prove as annoying as they are unnatural; too many scared characters act like they've never seen a horror movie before; Samira acts like she never forgot what Eddie Muprhy said in “Raw.” But the astute self-awareness ends there. Her sudden shifts from on edge to easy-breezy makes “The ‘Burbs” premiere feel like it's setting up a spoof movie. It's not, and the tone never resolves itself.

 










Celeste Hughey's Peacock adaptation is blunt and bland. The eight-episode first season offers plenty of promise early on: Palmer leads a strong cast in what initially appears to reframe Joe Dante's 1989 film — half-a-comedy about suburban malaise, half-a-satire about how privileged paranoia and groupthink can destroy anyone perceived to be different — through the lens of the besieged minority party (in this case, a Black woman). But all that actively regresses after the first hour, and “The ‘Burbs” plods along absent a good point, or any point at all. 

“Nope” this is not.

With a tension-less atmosphere and an affable ensemble, “The ‘Burbs” often feels like a slower, cheaper wannabe-successor to Hulu's hit comic murder-mystery: Call it, “Only Murders in the Neighborhood.” What happened in the movie version doesn't seem to matter to the series: There's a whole new history to the neighborhood, a whole new cast, and a whole new case to crack. (There are plenty of odd little easter eggs, as if there's a huge fandom demanding “The ‘Burbs” reboot be faithful, but don't hold your breath for a Hanks cameo — all you'll get is a photo).

The story centers on Samira investigating her creepy new neighbor with her other, slightly less creepy neighbors: The cul-de-sac crew includes Dana Richards (Paula Pell), a retired Marine who never leaves the neighborhood, Tod Mann (Mark Proksch), a rich loner who knows as much about his friends as they don't know about him, and Lynn Gardner (Julia Duffy), a casually racist widow whose good intentions are supposed to make us forget she's introduced by knocking on Samira's car window, ready to run her out of town for being Black in a white neighborhood.

 










But hey, Samira can take it. She's used to crazy white people. Her smug British husband Rob (Jack Whitehall) is the reason they're living on Ashfield Place to begin with: He grew up there — his best friend Naveen (Kapil Talwalkar) still lives down the street — and his parents left them their house after retiring to a cruise ship. Tempted out of New York after a robbery in their building, the Fischers just want to enjoy their blessings… but then the new neighbor (Justin Kirk) calls the cops on Samira for bringing him brownies (aka the same thing Lynn accosted her for), and suddenly their picturesque property feels like it could be a trap.

“The ‘Burbs” keeps you guessing about the neighborhood's many secrets — What's going on in that old house? Who's the new owner? Why's he burning stuff in the woods and making weird noises in the basement? — but it never pushes those questions hard enough to build genuine suspense. The end of the premiere — when everyone rallies around Samira after her racial profiling incident — tells you what the show is really about: community. But doubts surrounding Dana, Tod, Lynn, and Naveen aren't serious (even Lynn's ignominious introduction gets swept under the rug), and what little there is to find out is held back at the expense of the ensemble. It's hard to appreciate characters who won't open up.

 










“The ‘Burbs” is so intent on preserving an air of mystery, it never develops any of its other attributes. It trades in sharp characters, commentary, and comedy for broad semblances of each, be it the image of a haunted house (without any real frights lurking inside), the appearance of a socio-political stance (without ever digging into the racial barriers facing Black residents living in enclaves of white flight), or the impression of a fun time (without enough jokes to fill a good comedy, twists to pay off a good mystery, or insights to deliver a valuable cultural assessment).

In perhaps the series' greatest sin, given the envious trio of Palmer, Pell, and Proksch, it's not even a good hang. All three proven performers have their moments, but they elevate the show, not the other way around — much like Tom Hanks and Bruce Dern elevated the original movie, which has more to say about the suburbs than the series does (even if you recognize its degenerative, ill-fitting conclusion).

If community is what really matters in “The ‘Burbs” — a point that could surely resonate right now — then the serious needs to showcase why community matters via its own rewarding group of neighbors. Instead, they seem disposable, like you could find them anywhere, and, worse yet, that tracking them down isn't really worth the bother. 

 










Nothing could be further from the truth, which just numbs whatever else “The ‘Burbs” hoped to make you feel.

“The ‘Burbs” premieres Sunday, February 8 on Peacock. All eight episodes will be released at once.

1981

In 1954, Time magazine published a short column listing three civil rights breakthroughs (and one “no-gain”) that included Knoxville integrating its airport restaurants and Birmingham allowing Black and white athletes to compete against each other in baseball and football. It's a short list, presented straightforwardly, except for one phrase in the first sentence: “to breach the Magnolia Curtain of racial discrimination.” Those words—a bit of poetry in the newsreel—implied a truth both obvious and largely unspoken: The South had used its prejudices and its claims to heritage, among other bricks and mortar, to cordon itself off from the rest of the nation. The phrase took hold and proved useful during the Civil Rights era, and in 1964, when a self-proclaimed “New York liberal” writer named Richard Boeth moved to the small town of Rosedale, Mississippi, he gleefully annihilated the region's calcified hypocrisies for The Atlantic. He called the piece “Behind the Magnolia Curtain.”

In 1981, Memphis musician Tav Falco adopted that same phrase for the title of his debut album with the Panther Burns, one of the weirdest, wildest support groups in rock history. His usage seems less pointed than Boeth's, on account of him being an actual Southerner; Falco might have been born in Pennsylvania, but he grew up near Gurdon, Arkansas, moved east to Memphis as a young man, and has been closely associated with that city ever since (despite spending the past 30 years living in Europe). He's always been on the southern side of the Magnolia Curtain, so he can see what it conceals from those who erected it in the first place: a vibrant culture that extends to food, clothes, literature, and especially music, too often disregarded or overwritten by modern Southerners.

Or, as he told a combative TV host during a famously tense Panther Burns performance in 1979: “It's all invisible to us.” And by “us” he means not himself or his band, but Memphis in general, the South in general. Everybody down here. “We can't see what's around us. There are blues people here who don't have exposure, rockabilly artists who don't have any exposure. They don't really exist here. They're part of our environment, we see them every day, yet they're invisible to us. We take them for granted. It takes a group like us to create contrast, to create focus.”

Panther Burns wanted to jolt their listeners into seeing those invisible people—those old blues and rockabilly artists whose innovations defined the city's culture even after they were forgotten. The way they did that was by playing old songs very loud and very bad. At any given moment each musician in the band might be playing at a different tempo or in a different key altogether, or hell, they might be playing a completely different song. On a good night they could make the Shaggs sound like Booker T. & the M.G.'s. Panther Burns weaponized their amateurism, but never condescended to the source material: Falco wanted to make that old music as culturally disruptive in the late 1970s as it had been in the late 1950s. The best way to do that, he reckoned, was volume and chaos.

That strategy was evident enough in his first public appearance, when the man born Gustavus Nelson gave birth to a legend named Tav Falco. The scene takes place on the afternoon of October 1, 1978, at the Orpheum Theatre, then a rundown building with broken seats and peeling paint, lacking heat and constantly in danger of demolition. It was, in other words, a perfect symbol of the city's withering music industry. Elvis had died, and while his death eventually inspired a morbid, kitschy cottage industry, he was still dead. Stax had closed, shuttered by some shady dealings by Atlantic in New York and Union Planters Bank in Memphis. Chips Moman had closed American Recordings, where the Box Tops, Bobby Womack, and Dusty Springfield had recorded huge hits. And Al Green, the city's last major superstar—at least for a while—had ditched Hi Records and bought a church. In a downtown emptied by white flight and recession, the Orpheum was used primarily for DIY events, which is why Jim Dickinson chose the spot for a series of shows celebrating local music. The very last one he advertised as the final performance by his band Mud Boy & the Neutrons, although he knew full well the band wasn't going away.

Midway through Mud Boy's mock send-off, Falco wandered onstage looking like a punk Charlie Chaplin: pencil-thin mustache, tattered tuxedo, and frayed, fingerless gloves. Strumming an out-of-tune guitar, he delivered a crude and shrill yet impassioned cover of Lead Belly's “Bourgeois Blues.” He caterwauled the chorus—“It's a bourgeois town!”—as an accusation to a city that was ignoring its greatest resources, namely its legacy of blues, country, rockabilly, gospel, and plum weird shit. He then set his Silvertone down on a chair, produced a chainsaw seemingly out of nowhere, and set about loudly splintering the still-plugged-in guitar. It was so loud, so violent, so intense that Falco reportedly ended his short set by fainting.

Nobody could have known at the time, but that performance was a prophecy of the city's future, where artists would become the primary stewards of Memphis music history, rampaging through old blues, rock, soul, and gospel. The audience was small that afternoon—roughly 50 people in the 2,300-seat venue—but Alex Chilton was there, and he liked what he heard. He saw great promise in the collision of punk and performance art, blues and noise, reverence and irreverence: local music history as a vehicle for local commentary and local confrontation. Chilton had been up in New York City, off on the fringes of the punk scene and catching shows by James Chance & the Contortions and Teenage Jesus & the Jerks, and he saw the potential in Falco for a uniquely Memphis take on no wave, anchored in the musical traditions that made the city famous. He suggested to Falco that they start a band—not as equals, not like him and Chris Bell in Big Star, but with Chilton as sideman and Falco as bandleader. They rounded out the group with some local professionals (like bassist Ron Miller, a member of the Memphis Symphony) and some friends unburdened by musical talent (like drummer Ross Johnson, who by his own admission was no drummer). “I'm really not even a musician,” Falco explained to Memphis' Commercial Appeal. “I just make music and play upon the guitar.”

That band name—Panther Burns, sometimes the Unapproachable Panther Burns—comes from a town deep in the Mississippi delta, about an hour south of Memphis. The word “town” might be an exaggeration: It's more like a strip of highway with aspirations of incorporation. Falco knew about its lore, how a panther once stalked the community for months. The animal was so massive and powerful that its mighty tail swept loose the earth behind it, erasing its footprints and making it impossible to track. Finally the local sharecroppers trapped the beast in a cane break, which they set on fire rather than kill it by hand. For their cowardice they suffered a long night listening to its dying shrieks. Falco wanted the band to make music that sounded like the cries of a conflagrating cat; he wanted to keep folks up at night.

Just four months after that Orpheum performance, Falco and his new band played their first show at 96 S. Front Street, an old cotton exchange building that had once housed a segregated “soft drink” establishment and an off-the-books whiskey service in the 1920s but had sat empty for decades. Besides the Orpheum, there weren't many places in Memphis where punk and no wave or new wave bands could play, so they had to create venues for themselves in the vacant historic buildings overlooking the Mississippi River. Falco didn't brandish a chainsaw, but the band exerted a similar effect on the songs they covered. They played with fury and abandon. They made the invisible briefly visible. Some folks left plugging their ears, but enough stayed to crowd the stage. Realizing he was boxed in, Chilton stepped to the side, unzipped, and relieved himself mid-song.

Onstage, Falco appeared like a man from another time, cajoling his audience and even calling them “lackeys of the running dog imperialists.” Away from the stage, however, their mission to illuminate the dark corners of Memphis history through volume proved much more daunting. They recorded covers of “Train Kept a Rollin'” by Johnny Burnette and “Dateless Night” by Allen Page, two local rockabilly pioneers by then largely forgotten. That single caught the ear of Rough Trade founder Geoff Travis. He encouraged Panther Burns to record and submit a full album of material, so they booked time at Sam Phillips Recording Services. Jim Dickinson stepped in to produce and play a little piano, but Travis deemed the results too polished, too polite, too bourgeois. Where was the noise? The subversion? The disruption? (Those recordings were released in 1992 as The Unreleased Sessions.)

Falco and Panther Burns regrouped and booked two three-hour sessions at Ardent Records in Midtown, once hectic with overflow from Stax but now booking sessions with national acts like ZZ Top. They took a first-take, best-take approach to recording, not necessarily racing through the songs but certainly not taking their time to get everything just right. Comprised primarily of covers of Memphis non-hits, Behind the Magnolia Curtain is a bizarre record, its confrontational lack of chops intensifying its cockeyed charisma and ribaldry. Sex—once so repressed by polite society that it bubbled up in disreputable music—motivates many songs, especially on the first side. Their cover of Page's “She's the One That's Got It” plays coy with its subject matter, especially when the band begs him to elaborate. “Got what?” they bark at him. “Oh, you know!” comes the reply. Somehow it sounds racier than if he were more explicit.

That weird discretion makes his takes on “Come On Little Mama” and “Hey High School Baby” less troublesome than, say, the Stray Cats' “She's Sexy +17,” which far too eagerly broadcasts its lecherous designs. Those historical re-enactors from Massapequa were taking rockabilly back into the Top 10, but lesser-known bands like the Blasters and, in particular, the Cramps were cratedigging for left-of-center inspiration and putting their own indelible stamps on old blues and rockabilly numbers. Behind the Magnolia Curtain, though, sounds like an album that could only have been made in Memphis by artists steeped in local lore, by folks who drove by the boarded-up Stax building every day, who maybe bumped into Furry Lewis sweeping up on Beale Street, who knew where all the bodies were buried. It's full of big ideas, but never sounds brainy or abstract. It's always specific, always purposeful, always lurid. Behind the Magnolia Curtain kicks you in the head and the gut, and then it kicks you in the ass.

There's an intimacy with the source material, but also a sense of immense possibility. Falco invited members of the Tate County Mississippi Drum Corps up to Memphis to play on the record, and you can hear their booming bass drums and slithering snares on their version of R.L. Burnside's “Snake Drive” and Ary Barrosso's “Brazil.” The latter is one of the most covered songs of the 20th century, but that bouncing chorus of drums, along with Falco's marblemouthed croon, utterly transforms the melody. This melding of punk and fife-and-drum blues has inspired locals for years, including one-time Panther Burns guitarist Lorette Velvette (“Come On Over”) and the Oblivians (“I May Be Gone”).

Rough Trade picked up Behind the Magnolia Curtain, and soon the Panther Burns were on the road more than they were in Memphis, with a lineup that changed almost every night. A few members played only one show, others even less. The official list of players past and present includes old-timers like Burnside, the Memphis Horns, Teenie Hodges of the Hi Rhythm Section, and the Bar-Kays' Ben Cauley, along with younger artists like Jim Duckworth (of the Gun Club), Jim Sclavunos (Teenage Jesus & the Jerks and later the Bad Seeds), Alex Greene (Reigning Sound), Roland Robinson (who wrote Rod Stewart's hit “Infatuation”), and many others. Chilton left the band not long after recording Magnolia Curtain, but his short tenure invigorated him: You can hear him tinkering with these ideas throughout his career, especially on his 1979 solo debut, Like Flies on Sherbert. Finding intention in inscrutability, he forged a way forward.

For Falco, it was impossible to sustain that chaos of possibilities, and not just because the musicians in Panther Burns couldn't help but hone their chops. Folks get used to loud and bad, they adjust to the din, so the visible becomes invisible once again. His subsequent albums, including 1987's excellent, Chilton-produced The World We Knew, burrow deeper into his own persona, which is eccentric and mysterious in a specifically Southern way. He left Memphis for Europe in the early 1990s, perhaps with the idea that the best way to understand your home is to leave it, yet he remains closely associated with that city as a soapbox historian, always beating the drum for the forgotten and the never-known. With Behind the Magnolia Curtain, he showed generations of locals how they might rediscover and redefine Memphis music, how they might draw back the curtain once more.

Footage showing a UFO-like object is going viral on social media, reigniting curiosity about parallel universes. The recently surfaced video is from 2012 and it shows glowing tri-orbs moving over the Persian Gulf. As per a report by the New York Post, the videos are leaked footage recorded by the US military purportedly showing UFO-like objects operating over the Middle East.

According to the reports, the US Department of War and the intelligence community officially designated the flying objects to be Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), and kept it under the “non-human"" category.

The video captured in 2012 shows three lights or orbs in a triangular formation. The video was taken by an MQ-9 Reaper drone's infrared sensors.

‘LEAKED' US AIR FORCE VIDEO OF UFOs IN MIDDLE EAST — NYP pic.twitter.com/jnrd47LKMe— RT (@RT_com) February 7, 2026

The one-minute clip showing mysterious glowing objects was released recently by reporters and prominent UFO researchers George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell, NYP reported.

George Knapp spoke about the footage on his podcast and said, “This is a military-recorded, sensor-generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. And clearly, you watch this, and that's not what it is.""

The objects demonstrate abrupt changes of direction and the thermographic Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) detected no heat or other signatures that mark traditional propulsion systems, according to the Knapp and Corbell report in Weaponized.

A group of teens plays around with an Aztec death whistle, leading to expected results, in Whistle, which premiered at last year's Fantastic Fest and opens in Prague and cinemas worldwide this weekend. While this initially appears to be another in the long line of lamebrained children-playing-with-haunted-things horror films (see also: Ouija, Wish Upon, Truth or Dare, Tarot, Spin the Bottle), director Corin Hardy (The Hallow, The Nun) knows exactly what he is working with here and lets his audience in on the joke. 

The result is a wildly entertaining supernatural chiller that embraces the inherent silliness of its well-worn template and dials things up to 11. Backed by some engaging performances and showstopping scenes of gore, Whistle is as entertaining as the so-bad-its-good classic Wish Upon … only the filmmakers know exactly what they're doing here. 

Whistle stars Dafne Keen as Chrysanthemum—let's call her Chrys—who moves in with her cousin Rel (Sky Yang) and begins life as a high school senior in a new school after an unexplored tragedy back in Chicago. “I heard you were a junkie who O.D.'ed and killed your dad,” varsity basketball star Dean (Jhaleil Swaby) teases her before taking a knee to the groin. Ah, good old high school ribbing. Two scenes later, these characters are the best of friends. 

Also among the core friend group: prom queen type Grace (Ali Skovbye), Dean's girl and Rel's crush, and Ellie (Sophie Nélisse), who immediately shares some meaningful glances with Chrys that develop into a romance. Decidedly not in their friend group: “youth pastor” Noah (Percy Hynes White), who deals drugs to his flock, corners Chrys with an offer of free goofballs on her first day in school, and turns into a villain of utterly baffling motivation. 

But Chrys and co. have more pressing matters to attend to: namely, that Aztec death whistle she finds in her locker, left over from Horse (Stephen Kalyn), who spontaneously combusted in the locker room in Whistle‘s opening scene. Mr. Craven (Nick Frost) gives us another taste of what the whistle can do before Grace blows it at a pool party and casts their fate. 

In horror terms, the representation of death—and how it kills—is what sets Whistle apart from the other films of the genre (as well as the Final Destination franchise). As explained by Horse's mom (Michelle Fairley), death here is the physical embodiment of each character upon their own future death, now called into the present when the death whistle is used. When Horse blew into the whistle, he summoned himself as a charred corpse at the moment of his own fiery death years in the future. 

That sets Whistle up for some bravura gore sequences, which include characters being pursued by their own mangled corpses from car wrecks and industrial accidents. When the corpse catches up to you, the moment of death is re-created, resulting in some genuinely impressive—and stomach-churning—effects work as characters are isolated and violently maimed; unlike other recent horror films (Primate), Whistle doesn't play its card too early, resulting in some showstopping sequences at the climax.

But what really separates Whistle from the pack is that it knows what kind of movie it is, and plays all the tropes up to the hilt. The script (by Owen Egerton) is wall-to-wall clichés, but director Hardy turns that into a strength by pushing everything so over-the-top his film becomes a satire full of not-so-subtle in-jokes. Viewers expecting something as serious-minded as Talk to Me might be put off by what's on display, but those who can appreciate the film's sarcastic tune will find a lot to like. 

Strong performances also help: Whistle has an unusually engaging central performance from Keen—evoking memories of a Beetlejuice-era Winona Ryder—that breaks through a real lack of characterization in the script and exceeds anything we might usually expect from these kinds of films. She's backed by a pair of scene-stealing turns from Hynes White (aping Caleb Landry Jones) and Yang (dressing up as The Crow—or, uh, The Revenger for the big autumn carnival), in support.

Whistle succeeds not by reinventing the teen horror formula but by fully committing to it, embracing its clichés with a knowing wink and escalating them into gleeful excess. Anchored by a strong central performance from Keen and elevated by outrageous gore sequences, the film finds its identity as a self-aware supernatural chiller that understands exactly how ridiculous the premise is—and blows right into it.

A tarot reader to the stars of Real Housewives Of Cheshire and Love Island has shared her top tips for manifesting love ahead of Valentine's Day, and revealed what her clients really want to know about their futures.

Self-described as The White Witch of Cheshire, Claire Stone, 44, said she was a psychic and author who was born with abilities such as astral projection and being able to communicate with spirits and angels.

From as young as seven years old, Claire said she remembers playing with a snake spirit animal that she would chase around the living room and that her cousins would follow, but she did not realise at the time that they could not see it.

She lived with her grandparents and one night, after they put her to bed, she said she astrally projected – an out-of-body experience where she described floating in spirit form – and saw them eating supper and watching the news downstairs. The next morning, she said she nonchalantly told them what she had experienced, but that they were “really scared” because they were Christians.

Claire said a vicar cautioned her grandmother that the abilities her granddaughter had reported were the “devil in disguise” and he encouraged her to enrol her into a religious course to put her back on the “right” path. As a result, Claire became scared of the angels and spirits who she said visited her, screaming out to them one night to leave her alone, which she said they did.

At 11, Claire said she secretly got into tarot card reading after her friend got a book about it for Christmas, which gave her a lot of comfort at a tumultuous time in her life. She said she was grappling with agoraphobia and instability at home and had reached breaking point by her early teens.

Claire told PA Real Life: “I had just had enough of this crap life and I was so fed up. Instead of turning to God like I'd been conditioned, I asked the universe: ‘Can anyone help me?' This is when I opened my mind to these spirit guides that I'd once connected with years ago.”

“I was petrified. I'm not going to lie. I was really, really scared, but I was equally as intrigued to reawaken that as well,” she said.

This is when Claire said she dived head-first into her psychic interests and bought her own deck of tarot cards to do readings for herself and her friends, alongside communicating with angels.

It started out as “ridiculous” questions such as, “Will I get a Berghaus coat for Christmas?” and “Does this boy fancy me?”, until Claire said she was giving readings to her friends' older siblings, their parents, and neighbours. She said she quickly became known as The Angel Girl.

By 19, Claire went to college and studied aromatherapy, reflexology, Indian head massage, and reiki, before qualifying as a professional holistic therapist. It was during these therapies that she said she would receive messages from clients' loved ones.

“I was giving someone a massage one day and all I could think in my head was about green wellington boots,” Claire said.

“And sometimes it can feel ridiculous to say something because it means nothing to you as the reader, but you've got to trust that it means something to that person. So I asked if green wellies meant anything to her.

“She immediately burst into tears because it was the anniversary of her dad's death. That's why she had treated herself to a massage. And the only thing that she'd had of his was a pair of green wellies,” Claire said.

Claire is now a published author, wife, and mother-of-two to Leah, 21, and Lexi, 13, who has given tarot readings to celebrity clients, including Love Island 2018 winners Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham, and Big Brother's Lisa Appleton.

Claire's career led to producers from the television series The Real Housewives Of Cheshire approaching her to be a featured guest.

She said: “I've been on the show loads of times and sometimes it's ridiculous, like doing past-life readings on dogs. And I am up for a laugh. If it's not harming anyone, I'll go and entertain it.”

Claire said she had become friends with the cast, including doing readings and helping with feng shui to help try and manifest love.

“She had this gorgeous painting of a glamorous woman looking over her shoulder, but it was a single woman,” Claire said of one Housewives cast member.

“I told her that she needed to get rid of that picture and replace it with something like a couple with their arms around each other or a statue of a couple embracing. I also got her to put two rose quartz crystals under the bed.”

Claire said crystals were one way to help manifest love into your life, something she said she got asked a lot about, especially around Valentine's Day.

One way to manifest love, she said, is to create a “love corner” in your home: a feng shui principle often implemented in your bedroom or the far right-hand corner of your living space. Claire said that if you were single and you had a double bed but only one bedside table, your romantic energy was blocked because you were not symbolically inviting a partner into your space.

Another was through tarot, such as embracing the “two of cups” card, which represented harmony, romantic partnership, and mutual attraction. Claire suggested placing this imagery in your love corner or changing your phone screen background to it to invite the energy in.

According to Claire, the biggest thing you could do to manifest love was to be open to it.

She said: “People will say things like, ‘I'll never meet anyone' or ‘all men are bastards', but you're never going to attract love until you've got rid of that. So you need to reprogramme your mind by saying things to yourself like, ‘I am loveable', ‘I am worthy of love', ‘my perfect partner is on the way to me', and ‘I can't wait to meet this person'.”

The most common question Claire said she gets during her £111 tarot card reading sessions is about work and business, then a lot about whether exes will come back into her clients' lives.

For the latter, Claire said: “I'm very cautious with this because I know it's quite unhealthy for people to be hung up on past partners, so I tell them we can do a cord-cutting ritual together, which is a ceremony where you are releasing the energy of your ex-partner. Or you could write everything down and then burn it. You can also get rid of anything that they ever bought you to remove that physical connection. Again, it's very much about changing the way you think.”

Claire said she believed manifestation was something you could do for all aspects of your life, and that you did not need to be able to speak to angels or spirits.

She said: “Every day I get up, I light my angel candle, and I'm connected straight away. I'm asking for guidance, asking for protection, and asking for the day ahead to be blessed. If you keep asking, it makes you feel connected, and I think that's what everyone is looking for.

“Whether someone wants to be a millionaire, (to have) success in their business, or (to find) a life partner. I think underneath all of that, what people are really looking for is a connection to themselves, to their own souls, and to that universal energy.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","How the latest Epstein files have revived conspiracy theorists' attempts to link Mark Carney with the notorious sex offender","https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/how-the-latest-epstein-files-have-revived-conspiracy-theorists-attempts-to-link-mark-carney-with/article_ca791413-e8e1-4a15-91f4-208f5396029c.html","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 12:00:00 GMT","







The prime minister's name comes up dozens of times but the records themselves do not support online claims that Carney and Epstein were linked.

The prime minister's name comes up dozens of times but the records themselves do not support online claims that Carney and Epstein were linked.

Many of the conspiracy theories linking Prime Minister Mark Carney to Jeffrey Epstein were sparked by this 2013 photo of Carney, in purple, standing next to Ghislaine Maxwell, a close Epstein associate, at a music festival.

The latest trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein reveals to new extents the relationships the notorious sex offender held with prominent and powerful figures, from Elon Musk to Bill Gates to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.

The disclosure has also revived conspiracy theorists' attempts to connect the late financier to a particularly prominent Canadian: Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Fringe social media accounts, doubling down on claims they made during the last federal election, are pointing to Carney's name cropping up in the records as proof the two men were linked — even though a mere cursory read of the records that name Carney show they do not support the claim.

A search of the U.S. Department of Justice's online library containing the Epstein files turns up 69 mentions of Mark Carney, dating from 2013 to last fall, all of which have been reviewed by the Star.

The vast majority of incidents are news summaries in which Carney is mentioned in his official capacity as governor of the Bank of England. There is one email in which Epstein's associates discuss attending an event at which Carney is speaking. There's another in which a financial activist mentions the scrutiny Carney was facing at the time regarding a different scandal involving an investment firm that went under, taking the live savings of some clients with it.

The Epstein files shine a light on the relationships the notorious sex offender held with wealthy and powerful figures, among them former U.S. president Bill Clinton, Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger and Virgin Group chairman Richard Branson.

There is no correspondence between Carney and Epstein, and no suggestion that Carney had any involvement with Epstein's crimes. (“The Prime Minister did not know and has never met Mr. Epstein,” a spokesperson said in a statement.)

Other Canadian political figures, including Justin Trudeau and Stephen Harper, also show up in the latest Epstein drop for similar reasons.

Carney's mention in the Epstein files, even when it's just via news briefs, fuels a persistent conspiracy theory about him, particularly how his time at the Bank of England feeds into narratives about shadowy financial elites, says Amarnath Amarasingam, an associate professor who studies conspiracy theories and online communities at Queen's University.

“A lot of conspiracy theories equate power with nefarious activity and control, so that's a lot of what we are seeing here.”

Online conspiracy mongers have tried to link Carney to Epstein as early as the election campaign last summer. Much of it was sparked by a photo of Carney standing next to Ghislaine Maxwell, a close Epstein associate, at a music festival in 2013.

The photographer who took the photo snapped it for the social pages of a British newspaper that was interested in the weekend activities of Carney because he was a newcomer Canadian who'd recently been tapped to run the Bank of England. (A source close to Carney told the Star at the time that Maxwell went to school with Carney's wife's sister and that she and Carney were “not friends.”)

Despite any actual evidence linking Carney and Maxwell outside of a family connection, the conspiracy gained steam thanks to AI-generated images of Carney and Epstein. In Spring 2025, there was what the Canadian Digital Media Research Network called “a surge in suspicious posts on social media spreading false claims.” The online discourse leaked into the real world, when then-Liberal leader Carney was heckled at a campaign rally in March.

With scrutiny of the American government's handling of the case at a fever pitch, Congress voted last November to force the release of the Epstein files. They're less a cohesive set of documents than a hodgepodge of records from different departments, including files from FBI investigations, unclassified records, communications and court records. There are duplicates and redactions — meaning names or photos that have been blacked out — are inconsistent.

Transparency into the online files has some limitations, as some documents, including those that are written by hand, are not searchable.

Epstein died by suicide in a jail in New York in summer 2019 after being indicted.

In 2021, Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking for her role in helping to recruit underage victims and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Thailand's ruling conservative party clinched a surprisingly solid election win Sunday night, marking the first victory this century for a party aligned with the country's royalist establishment and a clear defeat for an emerging progressive movement. 

The Bhumjaithai Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, is set to secure 194 seats out of a possible 500 in the House of Representatives, according to preliminary results from the country's Election Commission, with votes from about 82% of the polling stations counted. The pro-democracy People's Party, which had been leading in the pre-poll surveys, was on track for 108. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Yomiuri Shimbun

21:35 JST, February 8, 2026

The Liberal Democratic Party looked certain to secure a single-party majority in the 51st House of Representatives election on Sunday, according to exit polls jointly conducted by The Yomiuri Shimbun, NHK and Nippon TV-affiliated stations.

The LDP appeared set to take the majority, which is 233 seats of the 465-seat chamber, garnering more than the 198 seats it held before the lower house was dissolved. The ruling coalition of the LDP and the Japan Innovation Party was poised to secure more than 300 seats.

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is also LDP president, had aimed to win a majority for the ruling coalition. With the election victory, Takaichi is expected to advance policies that she touted in the election campaign, such as measures for “responsible and proactive public finances,” claiming that her administration has obtained a public mandate. The ruling coalition is also likely to strengthen its control over the operation of the Diet.

LDP Secretary General Shunichi Suzuki expressed the party's intention on Sunday night to advance discussions on reducing the consumption tax on food and beverages for a limited period of two years, as pledged in its campaign promises.

Suzuki made the statement on a TV Tokyo program on the day.

Also, regarding reports of the LDP's projected landslide victory in the election, Suzuki analyzed the situation as follows. “I believe we received support due to expectations for the responsible proactive fiscal policy that Prime Minister Takaichi aims to pursue, as well as for strengthening defense and diplomatic capabilities.”

Yoshihiko Noda, coleader of the Centrist Reform Alliance, was asked about stepping down. “I have made up my mind, but I will talk to other party executives as the results are not all out yet,” he said.

This was the first lower house election after Komeito left the ruling coalition with the LDP in October last year and then the JIP joined hands with the LDP. This was also the first national election for Takaichi since taking office. Takaichi made whether the public would endorse her as the prime minister a key issue in the election.

In the opposition camp, the CRA — a new party formed by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito and now the largest opposition party — seemed likely to fall significantly short of the 167 seats its members held  before the lower house was dissolved.

Sanseito and Team Mirai were projected to make gains. Sanseito held two lower house seats before the chamber's dissolution. Mirai was expected to win its first seats in the lower house.

Sanseito leader Sohei Kamiya said that support for the party in Sunday's election was not likely to surpass that in last year's House of Councillors election.

“I gave the previous [national] election a score of about 120 points, but compared to that, I think our score  this time is around 75 points,” Kamiya said  Sunday night in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo.

Team Mirai's leader Takahiro Anno credited his party's stance on the consumption tax for its projected strong showing in the election.

“On the key issue of consumption tax cuts, we took a different stance from other parties,” Anno said at a press conference in Tokyo on Sunday night. “I believe we may have become the only option for voters [who are against the tax cuts].”

Other parties called for reducing the consumption tax in their campaigns, but Mirai did not include such tax cuts in its platform.

The lower house election was held about one year and three months after the previous election, with a total of 465 seats contested: 289 in single-seat constituencies and 176 in the proportional representation segment. The period from the lower house's dissolution to the voting and counting was 16 days, the shortest since the end of World War II.

A total of 1,284 candidates ran in the House of Representatives election on Sunday. In single-seat constituencies, 1,119 people competed for 289 seats, while the proportional representation segment was contested by 914 candidates.

There were 749 candidates who were registered in both a constituency and the proportional representation race.

By winning 243 seats, which is called a “stable majority,” the ruling bloc will be able to hold half of all seats in the lower house's 17 standing committees and also dominate chairperson posts in all committees.

Before the dissolution of the lower house, the opposition camp had the post of chairperson of the Budget Committee, where battles of words between ruling and opposition parties occur most often.

During street campaign speeches, the prime minister emphasized, “Other parties hold [chairperson posts] in all key committees [in the lower house].”

Winning 261 seats or more would enable the ruling bloc to dominate all committee chairperson posts and also have a majority in all standing committees. This situation is dubbed an “absolute majority.”

Most recently, the LDP under the leadership of then Prime Minister Fumio Kishida realized an absolute majority in the 2021 lower house election.

If the ruling bloc increases the number of seats by 78, the total will reach 310, which is enough for the two-thirds vote needed for initiating amendments to the Constitution in the lower house.

When the upper house votes down or does not vote on a bill within 60 days after it has been passed by the lower house, the bill can be passed by two-thirds or more ballots among attending members in a second vote in the lower house.

Heavy snow changed the operating hours at voting stations for the House of Representatives election in Shimane and Tottori prefectures.

The opening of a voting station in Daisen, Tottori Prefecture, was delayed by two hours to 9 a.m. because officials in charge of it could not get there on time.

In Shimane Prefecture, 14 voting stations in Ama and 16 in Okinoshima — both located on remote islands — closed three hours early at 5 p.m.

            The chief of staff to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer resigned on Sunday over the scandal around Peter Mandelson's appointment as UK ambassador to the US, despite his links to disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            “The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself,” Morgan McSweeney said in a statement to reporters on Sunday.
    


            The Downing Street chief of staff is the most senior political adviser to the UK prime minister.
    


            McSweeney said he took “full responsibility” for advising Starmer to make the appointment last year, adding “in the circumstances, the only honourable course is to step aside.”
    


            “While I did not oversee the due diligence and vetting process, I believe that process must now be fundamentally overhauled. This cannot simply be a gesture but a safeguard for the future,” McSweeney said.
    


            Starmer thanked the outgoing chief of staff for his service and commitment to the Labour Party. “It is largely thanks to his dedication, loyalty and leadership that we won a landslide majority and have the chance to change the country,” the prime minister said in a statement.
    


            The most recent tranche of Epstein files released by the US Justice Department triggered a police investigation into Mandelson, who has been accused of passing on market-sensitive government information that was of clear financial interest to Epstein following the 2008 financial crisis. Police raided two of Mandelson's properties on Friday as part of their investigation into misconduct in public office.
    


            Mandelson resigned from the Labour Party last Sunday and quit the House of Lords, the upper chamber of Britain's parliament, on Wednesday. CNN has been unable to contact Mandelson this week.
    


            The Mandelson scandal has plunged Keir Starmer's government into crisis and raised questions about the prime minister's political judgment. Starmer appointed Mandelson as ambassador last year, despite his well-known friendship with Epstein, which continued after the financier was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.

Valeria Chomsky says Epstein had deceived them and they were ‘careless' not to thoroughly research his background

Noam Chomsky and his wife, Valeria, made a “grave mistake” and were “careless” not to thoroughly research the background of Jeffrey Epstein, Valeria Chomsky said in a lengthy statement on Saturday, adding also that Epstein had deceived them.

The relationship between Noam Chomsky, the 97-year-old linguist and philosopher, and Epstein has been under scrutiny after documents released by the justice department shed light on their friendship. As Epstein came under scrutiny for sex trafficking allegations in 2019, he asked Chomsky for advice on how to respond. “I've watched the horrible way you are being treated in the press and public. It's painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,” Chomsky wrote in a message signed “Noam” that Epstein shared in email with an associate.

“What the vultures dearly want is a public response, which then provides a public opening for an onslaught of venomous attacks, many from just publicity seekers or cranks of all sorts,” Noam Chomsky wrote in the message. “That's particularly true now with the hysteria that has developed about abuse of women, which has reached the point that even questioning a charge is a crime worse than murder.”

Noam Chomsky is one of several prominent people who were revealed to be in friendly communication with Epstein even after his 2008 guilty plea. Many now face renewed scrutiny over their ties to the disgraced financier.

Some of Noam Chomsky's communications with Epstein took place after the Miami Herald published a bombshell story in 2018 detailing how Epstein preyed on underage girls and received an unusually lenient plea deal in 2008. On Saturday, Valeria Chomsky acknowledged the couple had read that story, but said the couple wasn't aware of the extent of Epstein's crimes until after his second arrest in July 2019.

“We were careless in not thoroughly researching his background. This was a grave mistake, and for that lapse in judgment, I apologize on behalf of both of us. Noam shared with me, before his stroke, that he felt the same way,” she said (Chomsky suffered a massive stroke in 2023). “It was deeply disturbing for both of us to realize we had engaged with someone who presented as a helpful friend but led a hidden life of criminal, inhumane, and perverted acts.”

Valeria Chomsky is the linguist's second wife; they married in 2014.

She said Chomsky's 2019 advice to Epstein on rehabilitating his image should be understood “in context”.

“Epstein had claimed to Noam that he [Epstein] was being unfairly persecuted, and Noam spoke from his own experience in political controversies with the media. Epstein created a manipulative narrative about his case, which Noam, in good faith, believed in,” she said in her statement. “It is now clear that it was all orchestrated, having as, at least, one of Epstein's intentions to try to have someone like Noam repairing Epstein's reputation by association.

“Noam's criticism was never directed at the women's movement; on the contrary, he has always supported gender equity and women's rights. What happened was that Epstein took advantage of Noam's public criticism towards what came to be known as ‘cancelling culture' to present himself as a victim of it,” she added.

Another message from Noam Chomsky released by the House oversight committee last year showed Chomsky saying it was a “most valuable experience” to have “regular contact” with Epstein (it's unclear if the message was ever sent to anyone). Other messages released by the justice department show Epstein sharing a phallic joke with Chomsky, and Chomsky “fantasizing about the Caribbean island”.

Valeria Chomsky said that the couple attended dinners at Epstein's townhouse in New York City, stayed at his apartments there and in Paris, had dinner at his ranch in New Mexico, and attended multiple academic gatherings with him. She said they “never went to his island or knew about anything that happened there”.

Noam and Epstein were introduced in 2015 and that the couple was unaware of Epstein 2008 guilty plea to solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18, Valeria Chomsky said. She said Epstein presented himself as a philanthropist interested in science.

“By presenting himself this way, Epstein gained Noam's attention, and they began corresponding. Unknowingly, we opened a door to a Trojan horse,” she said. “Epstein began to encircle Noam, sending gifts and creating opportunities for interesting discussions in areas Noam has been working on extensively. We regret that we did not perceive this as a strategy to ensnare us and to try to undermine the causes Noam stands for.”

Valeria Chomsky also clarified the basis for two financial transactions between Chomsky and Epstein. On one occasion, Epstein sent Noam Chomsky a $20,000 check as part of a linguistic challenge Chomsky developed, she said. She also said Epstein helped Noam recover $270,000. Epstein helped after Noam Chomsky discovered “inconsistencies in his retirement resources that threatened his economic independence and caused him great distress”.

Epstein offered to help and did so “likely as part of a machination to gain greater access to Noam. Epstein acted solely as a financial advisor for this specific matter. To the best of my knowledge, Epstein never had access to our bank or investment accounts.” She said neither of them – individually or as a couple – had investments with Epstein's office.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni condemned recent anti-Olympics protests in Milan and alleged sabotage of train infrastructure, calling those responsible “enemies of Italy and Italians” early Sunday.

The protesters “demonstrate ‘against the Olympics,' causing these images to end up on televisions around the world. After others cut the railway cables to prevent the trains from leaving,” Meloni said in a statement on Facebook, adding that thousands of Italians are working to keep the Games running smoothly, many of whom are volunteers.

“Solidarity, once again, with the police, the city of Milan, and all those who will see their work undermined by these gangs of criminals,” she said.

Italy's transport ministry said it has opened a terrorism investigation into the synchronized sabotage of railway lines in northern Italy on Saturday, the first day of the Games. 

No one has claimed responsibility, Italian news agency ANSA reported. 

Protesters rally in Milan against U.S. ICE presence ahead of opening ceremony

The alleged sabotage first hit the central Bologna hub, which governs rail traffic between northern and southern Italy, around 6 a.m. Saturday when it was still dark out, ANSA reported. It then struck Pesaro-area trains along the Adriatic coast. 

Infrastructure was burned or cut to cause the sabotage in both cases, the news agency said.

The transport ministry didn't provide details, but said it would seek millions of euros in compensation from the perpetrators. Thousands of passengers were impacted by the hourslong delays.

In Milan, Italian police fired tear gas and a water cannon on Saturday evening at dozens of protesters who threw firecrackers and tried to access a highway near a Winter Olympics venue. The brief confrontation came at the end of a peaceful march by thousands against the environmental impact of the Games and the presence of U.S. agents in Italy. 

The skirmish comes days after Meloni's government approved a security decree that allows police to detain people for up to 12 hours when there are reasonable grounds to believe they may act as agitators and disrupt peaceful protests. Opposition lawmakers criticized the measure as an attack on freedom of expression.

Peaceful protest is legitimate, but “we draw a line at violence,” International Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams said during the IOC's daily media briefing. “That has no place at the Olympic Games.” 

Police on Saturday held off the violent demonstrators, who appeared to be trying to reach the Santagiulia Olympic ice hockey rink, after the skirmish. By then, the larger peaceful protest, including families with small children and students, had dispersed.

At the earlier, larger demonstration, which police said numbered 10,000, people carried cardboard cutouts to represent trees felled to build the new bobsled run in Cortina. A group of dancers performed to beating drums. Music blasted from a truck leading the march, one a profanity-laced anthem against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Beforehand, a group of masked protesters had set off smoke bombs and firecrackers on a bridge overlooking a construction site about 800 metres from the Olympic Village that's housing around 1,500 athletes.

The demonstration coincided with U.S. Vice President JD Vance's visit to Milan as head of the American delegation. Vance and his family visited Leonardo da Vinci's “The Last Supper” closer to the city centre, far from the protest, which also was against the deployment of ICE agents to provide security to the U.S. delegation.

U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the U.S. is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.

The demonstration on Saturday followed another one last week, when hundreds protested the deployment of ICE agents.

Like last week, demonstrators Saturday said they were opposed to ICE agents' presence, despite official statements that a small number of agents from an investigative arm would be present in U.S. diplomatic territory, and not operational on the streets.

Three incidents of damage to rail infrastructure around Bologna in northern Italy are being investigated. Authorities said journeys to day one of the Winter Olympic Games have been disrupted.

Italy's Transport Ministry on Saturday said that rail infrastructure in northern Italy had been the target of sabotage, which ultimately impacted journeys to day one of Milan Cortina Winter Olympic Games.

Police said they are investigating three incidents of damage to rail infrastructure around Bologna and have not ruled out the possibility that it may be linked to the opening of the Winter Olympics, Italy's ANSA news agency reported.

Police said a structure housing a track switch was set on fire at dawn near the coastal city of Pesaro.

Hours later, electrical cables used to detect train speeds were found to have been cut in ​Bologna, while a makeshift explosive device was found along a nearby track.

""The serious incidents of sabotage that occurred this morning near Bologna train station and in Pesaro, causing significant disruption to thousands of travelers, are worrying,"" Italian Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said in a statement.

The Transport Ministry noted that France's high-speed rail network had also been sabotaged ahead of the Olympic games held in July 2024.

""There are similarities in action and timing"" to the French incident, AFP news agency quoted Salvini's spokesperson as saying.

""These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy's image in the world, an image that the games will make even more compelling ​and ​positive,"" the ministry said.

Bologna is a major transport hub for Italy's east-to-west rail service, and is also a key link for the south to northern cities such as Milan and Venice.

Milan is co-hosting the Winter Games alongside Cortina, reachable by train from Venice.

            • DHS funding: Lawmakers will return to Washington on Monday with just days to find a funding solution on the Department of Homeland Security or see the agency shut down. Democrats are demanding reforms to federal immigration enforcement.
    


            • Racist video: President Donald Trump has faced backlash from Democrats and Republicans alike over a since-deleted racist video depicting the Obamas as apes. The social media post, which Trump refused to apologize for sharing, was the latest in a long line of offensive messages amplified by the president's account.
    


• Epstein fallout: The Department of Justice's release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files is still producing major headlines in the US and around the world, with documents showing the extent to which the late sex offender tried to cozy up to Russian officials. Members of Congress can begin reviewing unredacted versions of the files tomorrow.
    


            The nonprofit group leading the Trump administration's celebrations surrounding the US' 250 birthday is running a public service announcement during tonight's Super Bowl, with a message it says is meant to promote unity as the country hits a new milestone.
    


            The 30-second spot by Freedom 250, first obtained by CNN, features iconic imagery from the nation's past, along with videos of modern Americans.
    


            “Just as Super Bowl Sunday brings Americans together around a shared love of competition, tradition, and excellence, the 250th anniversary will unite our entire nation in celebration of the values and freedoms that make America exceptional,” said Keith Krach, Freedom 250 CEO. “This is our moment to come together as one country and honor the American story and celebrate the bright future ahead. “
    


            The PSA was produced in a partnership with Angel Studios, a media company that's produced films, many with religious themes, that President Donald Trump and prominent conservatives have promoted.



            “After 250 years, the American experiment still isn't finished. It's been built, tested, carried forward and fought for, and we passed it on, hand to hand, life to life,” says a voiceover in the video. “Generations ago, ordinary people risked everything to begin it – 250 years later, the work continues.”
    


            Trump has long touted his desire to shape the nation's 250th celebrations. In the past few weeks, his administration has rolled out a slate of events that align with the president's call for programming that renews national pride.
    


            Freedom 250 plans include an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout on the White House's South Lawn on the president's birthday, an IndyCar race near the National Mall in August, the “Patriot Games,” a competition with young athletes from across the country and the construction of a giant triumphal arch across from the Lincoln Memorial.
    


Correction: This post has been corrected to reflect that the spot is being run as a public service announcement. An earlier version of this post incorrectly indicated Freedom 250 bought the spot.



            Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, one of seven Republicans who voted to convict President Donald Trump in his 2021 impeachment trial, wouldn't say last week whether he regrets that vote, which has put him in Trump's crosshairs.
    


            Trump successfully pushed Rep. Julia Letlow to challenge Cassidy in the Louisiana GOP primary this year, setting the stage for a potentially expensive primary battle for a safe Senate seat.
    


            CNN's Manu Raju on Thursday chased Cassidy down in the halls of Congress, where the lawmaker declined to weigh in on why Trump appears to be angry with him.
    


            “You're asking me the president's motivation. I can't comment on that. Frankly, I don't think you can either,” Cassidy said.
    


            Pressed by Raju on how he looks back on his vote to convict Trump for his role in inciting the 2021 Capitol riot, Cassidy said he's “commonly asked by reporters how do I feel and how do I regret.”
    


            “All I can say, brother, is you live your life forward,” Cassidy said.
    


            Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, questioned Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's ability to lead the nation's intelligence community as lawmakers scrutinize a whistleblower complaint.
    


                    “I do not believe that Director Gabbard is competent for her position. I don't believe that she is making America safer by not following the rules and procedures on getting whistleblower complaints to the Congress in a timely fashion,” Warner said today on CBS' “Face the Nation.”
                





            Gabbard accused Warner of “lying” yesterday after the Virginia Democrat expressed concerns about a delay in her office sharing information on a whistleblower complaint. The complaint includes claims that the distribution of a highly classified intelligence report had been “restricted for political purposes” and that an intelligence agency lawyer had failed to report a potential crime to the Justice Department.
    


            Though Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton, a Republican, has made clear he approves of how the whistleblower complaint has been handled, Warner said, “I'm not comfortable with the process, the timing, and I can't make a judgment about the credibility or the veracity, because it's been so heavily redacted.”
    


            Asked whether the panel will be able to speak to the whistleblower, Warner said he understands the person “has been waiting for guidance, legal guidance, on how to approach the committee.”
    


            President Donald Trump called Olympic skier Hunter Hess a “loser” today after the athlete expressed “mixed emotions representing the US right now” in the Winter Olympic Games.
    


            “U.S. Olympic Skier, Hunter Hess, a real Loser, says he doesn't represent his Country in the current Winter Olympics,” Trump posted on Truth Social Sunday morning. “If that's the case, he shouldn't have tried out for the Team, and it's too bad he's on it. Very hard to root for someone like this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
    


            Hess, who hails from Bend, Oregon, said during a press availability last week that “just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.”
    


            “It's a little hard; there's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of and I think a lot of people aren't,” Hess said. “I think for me, it's more I'm representing my friends and family back home, the people that represented it before me, all the things that I believe that are good about the US. I just think, if it aligns with my moral values, I'm representing it.”
    


            A number of conservatives have criticized Hess for his comments in recent days.
    


            “If you can't say you love America while competing on behalf of our nation then you shouldn't be at the Olympics,” wrote Katie Miller, a Trump ally and the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, on social media yesterday.
    


            Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said today she does not plan on joining the open field in the race this year to be Alaska's next governor.
    


            “Would I not consider returning back to the state that I love and working on hard problems and challenges? Absolutely,” Murkowski told CNN's Manu Raju this week, adding, “I also feel that the role that I'm playing here in the United States Senate is a particularly important one for our state and for the country.”
    


            “So hard decisions, but you got to pick one, and I'm here and going to continue to serve Alaskans here,” she added.
    


            The Alaska Republican has broken with President Donald Trump and many of her GOP colleagues on several key issues, including on the confirmations of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and FBI Director Kash Patel, said she's “not happily” ruling out a gubernatorial bid.
    


            “The idea of being able to be home and shovel real snow instead of ice snow, big difference,” she said, referring to weather conditions in Washington, DC.
    


            President Donald Trump is set to attend a Super Bowl watch party in Palm Beach, Florida, today.
    


            The Seattle Seahawks will play the New England Patriots in Santa Clara, California, a place Trump previously said was “just too far away” for him to travel to in person.
    


            Trump will attend the watch party at 6:30 p.m. ET, and return to the White House some time after this. The event is closed to the press.
    


            Maryland Gov. Wes Moore defended his effort to redraw the Maryland congressional map as part of a push by Democratic-led states to respond to President Donald Trump's efforts to create more Republican seats throughout the country.
    


            The proposed map would eliminate the only Republican-held seat in Maryland, currently occupied by conservative Rep. Andy Harris.
    


            “This is about our democracy. This is about the fact that you know who started this. It wasn't (California Gov.) Gavin Newsom. It was Donald Trump. When Donald Trump first contacted Texas and said, I need you to find the additional congressional seats, and they went to a back room with a sharpie and started redrawing maps,” Moore told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    


            The Maryland House approved the new congressional map last week, but leadership in the state Senate has said the bill doesn't have enough support to advance in that chamber — largely due to concerns it could backfire.
    


            Moore called on his state's Senate to back the proposal, saying that Trump's racist post on social media on Friday, which depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes, “highlights the kind of urgency that we have within this moment … we are watching a president who is just unchecked.”
    


            “It's why I'm urging the Maryland Senate to let democracy not die in the free state and to let a vote to happen on the Maryland Senate,” Moore said.
    


Go deeper: Moore confronts limits of his power in clash with state Dems



            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries demanded President Donald Trump apologize for the racist video depicting the Obamas as apes that was shared on his Truth Social account on Friday.
    


                    “He definitively needs to apologize. It was a disgusting video, and the president was rightly and appropriately and forcefully denounced by people all across the country, Democrats and even a handful of Republicans, who finally showed some backbone in pushing back against the president's malignant bottom feeder-like behavior,” Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
                





            The post has since been deleted after several Republicans, including Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican senator and a close political ally of the president, expressed outrage. Trump has said he doesn't think he needs to apologize since the White House said it was a staffer who shared the content.
    


            Jeffries also accused the president of “unlawfully withholding funds” from a major New York infrastructure project amid reports that Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last month that he would drop his freeze on billions of dollars in funding for a long-planned rail tunnel if Schumer agreed to rename New York's Penn Station and Washington's Dulles International Airport after Trump.
    


            “It's another example of Donald Trump trying to force presidential graffiti down the throat of the American people. It's completely and totally unacceptable,” Jeffries said.
    


            The administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services urged Americans to “please” take the measles vaccine, but denied that the fast-growing South Carolina outbreak of the disease is a consequence of the Trump administration undermining confidence in the vaccine.
    


            “We've advocated for measles vaccines all along. Secretary Kennedy has been at the very front of this,” Mehmet Oz told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” “When the first outbreak happened in Texas, he said, ‘Get your vaccines for measles,' because that's an example of an ailment that you should get vaccinated against.”
    


            While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. encouraged people to get their measles vaccines in April during a Texas outbreak, he advocated against government mandates for vaccines. Bash also pointed out how Children's Health Defense, which Kennedy founded and ran up until April 2023, posted on X, “Despite the media's scare tactics, there's no reason to fear measles.”
    


            Asked by Bash if people should fear measles, Oz said, “Oh, for sure and we actually are pretty aggressive. CMS, we fund any vaccine you want to take. There will never be a barrier to Americans get access to the measles vaccine.”
    


            “Take the vaccine, please,” Oz said. “We have a solution for a problem. Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people equally susceptible to those illnesses, but Measles is one you should get your vaccine,” Oz said.
    


            Republican Rep. Thomas Massie today said Trump should “absolutely apologize” for sharing a since-deleted racist post on his social media network that depicted former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes.
    


            “He's gone too far,” Massie told CNN's Manu Raju on “Inside Politics.”
    


            “He's attacked my wife recently online, and I do think there are limits. For a while it's kind of funny, but once pass certain guardrails like attacking a man's spouse or getting into racist tropes – I think somebody at the White House, maybe (Chief of Staff) Susie Wiles needs to go to the president and just ask him for his phone.”
    


            Trump has for months attacked Massie, who has been among the lawmakers behind the push to compel the Department of Justice to release case files surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, on social media. He recently suggested on Truth Social the lawmaker's wife was part of the “radical left.”
    


            “It doesn't make me angry, but it's unfair to my spouse,” Massie told Raju today.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he's not willing to accept anything less than Democratic leaders' demands and cast blame on Republicans for stalled negotiations on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security before a crucial deadline.
    


            “Not at this point,” Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash just days before DHS, which includes FEMA and TSA, will shutdown without a funding solution, declaring the top immigration enforcement agency is “completely and totally out of control.”
    


                    “The American people want them reined in, because immigration enforcement should be fair, it should be just and it should be humane. So dramatic changes are necessary to the manner in which the Department of Homeland Security officers are conducting themselves before any funding bill should move forward,” he said.
                





            Democrats have put forward their list of requirements for a bill to fund DHS and reform ICE, including requiring immigration enforcement agents to wear body cameras and remove face masks and to use judicial warrants, an issue that has been a nonstarter for Republicans.
    


            Jeffries said Democrats haven't heard back from the White House or GOP leaders on their “common sense” demands, adding, “in our view, the ball is in the court right now of the Republicans” ahead of the February 13 deadline.
    


            “Either they're going to agree to dramatically reform the way in which ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies are conducting themselves, so that they're behaving like every other law enforcement agency in the country, or they're making the explicit decision to shut down the Coast Guard, shut down FEMA and shut down TSA,” he warned.
    


            GOP Rep. Thomas Massie, a coauthor of the law that compelled the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, today called on Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to resign over his links to the late sex offender.
    


            Asked on CNN's “Inside Politics” if Lutnick, who appeared to have corresponded with Epstein multiple times, should testify, Massie responded, “No, he should just resign. I mean, there are three people in Great Britain that have resigned in politics.”
    


            Lutnick said in an interview last year that after a 2005 encounter at Epstein's home, he grew uncomfortable and vowed that he “will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again.” But the documents reveal Lutnick sought to meet with or call Epstein several times since 2005, including after Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008.
    


            A Commerce Department spokesperson told CNN last month, “Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing.”
    


            Massie, who has been a thorn in President Donald Trump's side in large part because of his push to compel the Department of Justice to release the files, also told CNN it is too soon to say if Congress should call on Trump to testify on his own links to Epstein.
    


            “The Democrats want to make this about Trump, and the Republicans want to make it about the Clintons. I want to make it about the survivors and getting them justice and transparency,” he later added.
    


            If you missed it, here's a round-up of some of our reporting from Washington this past weekend.
    


CNN's Kit Maher, Devan Cole, Aleena Fayaz and Camila DeChalus contributed to this reporting.



            US officials have held initial indirect talks with Iran over Tehran nuclear program, while President Donald Trump said he spoke with Honduran President Nasry Asfura.
    


            See below for a round-up of our reporting on the Trump administration's latest foreign policy developments.
    


            Talks between Greenland and the United States are not currently where Greenland would like them to be — and it is too early to say what the outcome will be, the Arctic island's foreign minister said yesterday.
    


                    “There is going to be a long track, so where we are going to land at the end, it's too early to say,” Vivian Motzfeldt said during a news conference in Nuuk alongside Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand and Danish Foreign Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen.
                





            On January 21, Trump announced he had reached a “framework of a future deal” regarding Greenland. The ongoing talks between the US, Greenland and Denmark are aimed at finalizing that deal.
    


            Trump praised his Honduran counterpart, Nasry “Tito” Asfura, saying the pair held a “very important meeting” yesterday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
    


                    It was my Great Honor to support Tito's Campaign. Once I gave him my strong Endorsement, he won his Election! Tito and I share many of the same America First Values,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
                





            Asfura, a conservative, narrowly edged out right-leaning centrist Salvador Nasralla late last year.
    


Trump endorsed Asfura days before the election was held, warning that if he didn't win, “the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.”
    


            The US president yesterday touted the countries' “close partnership” on security, anti-drug-trafficking, and immigration issues. He said the two leaders “discussed many other issues,” including trade.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “is expected” to visit Washington to meet with Trump on Wednesday, “where he will discuss with him the negotiations with Iran,” the Prime Minister's office said in a statement yesterday.
    


            “The Prime Minister believes that any negotiations must include limitations on ballistic missiles and an end to support for the Iranian axis,” the statement concluded.
    


            Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister said Sunday the country must uphold its right to continue uranium enrichment, after initial indirect talks with the United States over the country's nuclear progam. Abbas Araghchi described the program as a “sovereignty necessity.”
    


            A key point of contention remains Iran's demand to enrich uranium – a nuclear fuel that can be used to make a bomb if purified to high levels – which the US and its allies reject.

            President Donald Trump drew swift condemnation for a racist video posted to his Truth Social account last Thursday depicting former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle.
    


            Here's what you need to know about the situation:
    


            The video Trump shared largely discussed false claims that voting machines helped to steal the 2020 election. As that section of the video ended, a separate clip showing the Obamas' faces superimposed on the bodies of apes played, set to the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”
    


            The post, which recalls the racist trope of comparing Black people with monkeys, prompted swift backlash. It was online for roughly 12 hours before it was deleted from Trump's feed.
    


            The White House initially defended the post and downplayed the response to the video, calling it “fake outrage. Following a bipartisan backlash, the White House then told CNN a “staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.”
    


            The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom condemned the video in a post on X, writing: “Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.”
    


            GOP Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, wrote on X that he was “praying (the video) was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House. The President should remove it.”
    


            Trump and Scott spoke about the video on Friday morning before it was deleted from the president's feed, according to a person familiar with the conversation.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in an Instagram video Friday that the “disgusting video, posted by the so-called president, was done intentionally,”
    


            For his part, Trump said Friday evening that neither he nor his staff had seen all of the video before it was posted to Truth Social.
    


            “I looked at the beginning of it. It was fine,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, referring to the first part of the video that contained debunked claims about fraud in voting machines.
    


                    “It was a very strong post in terms of voter fraud,” he said. “Nobody knew that that was in the end. If they would have looked, they would have seen it, and probably they would have had the sense to take it down.”
                





            “Somebody slipped and missed a very small part,” he said, but when asked directly whether he would apologize, he declined.

CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — For Breezy Johnson, the road to an Olympic gold medal was similar to the winning downhill run she turned in Sunday: It was full of jarring bumps that nearly knocked her off course, but not off target.

There was the knee injury here in Cortina during a training crash that ultimately kept the American from competing in the 2022 Beijing Games. There was the 14-month ban for violating “whereabouts” rules when it comes to testing for doping.

She kept a hard-charging attitude and that was on display in Cortina on a day marred by teammate Lindsey Vonn's crash and trip to a hospital. The 30-year-old Johnson joins Vonn, 41, as the only American women to win the Olympic downhill.

“People are jealous of people with Olympic gold medals. They're not necessarily jealous of the journey it took to get those medals,” said Johnson, who has never won a World Cup race. “I don't think my journey is something that many people are envious of and it's been a tough road, but sometimes you just have to keep going because that's the only option. If you're going through hell, you keep walking because you don't want to just sit around in hell.”

Johnson finished in 1 minute, 36.10 seconds to hold off Emma Aicher of Germany by just .04 seconds, securing the first medal for the United States at the Milan Cortina Games in the process. Italy's Sofia Goggia, the 2018 Olympic downhill winner and 2022 silver medalist, finished with the bronze.

The tears began welling in the eyes of Johnson as racer after racer couldn't top her time, wiping them away with a mitten.






Her long-awaited medal? That didn't hold up so well. The clasp holding the ribbon to the medal broke. She placed the pieces in her pocket.

“It's definitely heavier than I expected,” Johnson said of her new hardware. “I think that's maybe why it broke.”

Johnson was just the sixth racer of the day and found speed with a risk-taking trip along the iconic Olympia delle Tofana course on a sunny day in Cortina. She felt confident it was good enough for a medal, but not as sure if it would be gold.

“But I hoped that it would be enough,” she said. “I just tried to keep it rolling. I knew it was fast in some of the places where I made mistakes. I was like, ‘Did I just make a mistake or did I make a mistake because I was going fast?' That's the line that you're always trying to walk, and today was enough.”

She was in the leader's box when Vonn, the No. 13 racer, cut a corner too close and was spun around before crashing. The race was put on hold for more than 20 minutes.

“I kind of wish the TV directors maybe wouldn't have replayed some of the crashes as much as they did,” Johnson said. “It's a little hard when you're surrounded by cameras and stuff, not wanting to watch that.”

It's certainly been a bumpy road to the top for Johnson, given the knee injury and a 14-month ban that expired in December 2024. She returned to win the world championship last February.

Now, she's an Olympic downhill gold medalist. Teammate Jacqueline Wiles finished just 0.27 seconds away from a medal in a tie for fourth place.

“I think that this was the best run Breezy's ever skied,” teammate Bella Wright said. “There was a lot of expectation, and she rose to the challenge.”

Johnson figures to have another shot at gold in the team event and could be paired with Mikaela Shiffrin.

Vonn's crash put a somber mood over the event. Vonn, who won the downhill at the 2010 Vancouver Games, was a gold-medal favorite before her crash in Switzerland last week when she suffered a ruptured ACL for her latest major knee injury. She returned to elite ski racing last season after nearly six years and after receiving a partial titanium knee replacement in her right knee.

“I hope it's not as bad as it looked,” Johnson said. “My heart just goes out to her.”

Like Vonn, Cande Moreno of Andorra also was taken away in a helicopter after a crash in which her left knee appeared to buckle while landing after a jump.

For Aicher, the silver medal pairs with the silver she earned as part of the team parallel event at the 2022 Games.

“At the third turn I thought, ”Oh (crap), what am I doing? Come on, Emma,'” she recounted. “But I managed to let the skis go pretty well.”

Both downhill golds this weekend were won by the reigning world champions after Franjo von Allmen of Switzerland won the men's race on Saturday. Both races also featured up-and-coming silver medalists (Aicher, Giovanni Franzoni of Italy) and Italian veterans in bronze position (Goggia, Dominik Paris).

With her bronze medal, Goggia now has an Olympic downhill medal of every color.

“So-so with my performance, but in the overall I got a medal again,” Goggia said. “It's a privilege.”

LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's chief of staff resigned Sunday over the furor surrounding the appointment of Peter Mandelson as the U.K. ambassador to the U.S. despite his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

Morgan McSweeney said he took responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Mandelson, 72, to Britain's most important diplomatic post in 2024.

“The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself,” McSweeney said in a statement. “When asked, I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice.”

Starmer is facing a political storm and questions about his judgement after newly published documents, part of a huge trove of Epstein files made public in the United States, suggested that Mandelson sent market-sensitive information to the convicted sex offender when he was the U.K. government's business secretary during the 2008 financial crisis.

Starmer's government has promised to release its own emails and other documentation related to Mandelson's appointment, which it says will show that Mandelson misled officials.

The prime minister apologized this week for “having believed Mandelson's lies.” 

He acknowledged that when Mandelson was chosen for the top diplomat job in 2024, the vetting process had revealed that Mandelson's friendship with Epstein continued after the latter's 2008 conviction. But Starmer maintained that “none of us knew the depth of the darkness” of that relationship at the time.




A number of lawmakers said Starmer is ultimately responsible for the scandal.

“Keir Starmer has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions,” said Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party.

Mandelson, a former Cabinet minister, ambassador and elder statesman of the governing Labour Party, has not been arrested or charged.

Metropolitan Police officers searched Mandelson's London home and another property linked to him on Friday. Police said the investigation is complex and will require “a significant amount of further evidence gathering and analysis.”

The U.K. police investigation centers on potential misconduct in public office, and Mandelson is not accused of any sexual offenses.

Starmer had fired Mandelson in September from his ambassadorial job over earlier revelations about his Epstein ties. But critics say the emails recently published by the U.S. Justice Department have brought serious concerns about Starmer's judgment to the fore. They argue that he should have known better than to appoint Mandelson in the first place.

The new revelations include documents suggesting Mandelson shared sensitive government information with Epstein after the 2008 global financial crisis. They also include records of payments totaling $75,000 in 2003 and 2004 from Epstein to accounts linked to Mandelson or his husband Reinaldo Avila da Silva.

Aside from his association with Epstein, Mandelson previously had to resign twice from senior government posts because of scandals over money or ethics.

Starmer had faced growing pressure over the past week to fire McSweeney, who is regarded as a key adviser in Downing Street and seen as a close ally of Mandelson.

Starmer on Sunday credited McSweeney as a central figure in running Labour's recent election campaign and the party's 2004 landslide victory. His statement did not mention the Mandelson scandal.

TOKYO (AP) — The governing party of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi secured a two-thirds supermajority in a key parliamentary election Sunday, Japanese media reported citing preliminary results, earning a landslide victory thanks to her popularity.

Takaichi, in a televised interview with public television network NHK following her sweeping victory, said she is now ready to pursue policies that would make Japan strong and prosperous. 

NHK, citing results of vote counts, said Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, alone secured 316 seats by early Monday, comfortably surpassing a 261-seat absolute majority in the 465-member lower house, the more powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament. That marks a record since the party's foundation in 1955 and surpasses the previous record of 300 seats won in 1986 by late Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. 

A smiling Takaichi placed a big red ribbon above each winner's name on a signboard at the LDP's headquarters, as accompanying party executives applauded.

Despite the lack of a majority in the other chamber, the upper house, the huge jump from the preelection share in the superior lower house would allow Takaichi to make progress on a right-wing agenda that aims to boost Japan's economy and military capabilities as tensions grow with China and she tries to nurture ties with the United States.

Takaichi said that she would firmly push forward her policy goals while trying to gain support from the opposition. 




“I will be flexible,” she said.

Takaichi is hugely popular, but the governing LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the last seven decades, has struggled with funding and religious scandals in recent years. She called Sunday's early election only after three months in office, hoping to turn that around while her popularity is high.

The ultraconservative Takaichi, who took office as Japan's first female leader in October, pledged to “work, work, work,” and her style, which is seen as both playful and tough, has resonated with younger fans who say they weren't previously interested in politics.

The opposition, despite the formation of a new centrist alliance and a rising far-right, was too splintered to be a real challenger. The new opposition alliance of LDP's former coalition partner, Buddhist-backed dovish Komeito, and the liberal-leaning Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, is projected to sink to half of their combined preelection share of 167 seats.

Takaichi was betting with this election that her LDP party, together with its new partner, the Japan Innovation Party, would secure a majority. 

Akihito Iwatake, a 53-year-old office worker, said he welcomed the big win by the LDP because he felt the party went too liberal in the past few years. “With Takaichi shifting things more toward the conservative side, I think that brought this positive result,” he said. 

The prime minister wants to push forward a significant shift to the right in Japan's security, immigration and other policies. The LDP's right-wing partner, JIP leader Hirofumi Yoshimura, has said his party will serve as an “accelerator” for this push.

Japan has recently seen far-right populists gain ground, such as the anti-globalist and surging nationalist party Sanseito. Exit polls projected a big gain for Sanseito.

The first major task for Takaichi when the lower house reconvenes in mid-February is to work on a budget bill, delayed by the election, to fund economic measures that address rising costs and sluggish wages. 

Takaichi has pledged to revise security and defense policies by December to bolster Japan's offensive military capabilities, lifting a ban on weapons exports and moving further away from the country's postwar pacifist principles. 

She has been pushing for tougher policies on foreigners, anti-espionage and other measures that resonate with a far-right audience, but ones that experts say could undermine civil rights.

Takaichi also wants to increase defense spending in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's pressure for Japan to loosen its purse strings.

She now has time to work on these policies, without an election until 2028.

Though Takaichi said that she's seeking to win support for policies seen as divisive in Japan, she largely avoided discussing ways to fund soaring military spending, how to fix diplomatic tension with China and other issues.

In her campaign speeches, Takaichi enthusiastically talked about the need for proactive government spending to fund “crisis management investment and growth,” such as measures to strengthen economic security, technology and other industries. Takaichi also seeks to push tougher measures on immigration, including stricter requirements for foreign property owners and a cap on foreign residents. 

Sunday's election “underscores a problematic trend in Japanese politics in which political survival takes priority over substantive policy outcomes,” said Masato Kamikubo, a Ritsumeikan University politics professor. “Whenever the government attempts necessary but unpopular reforms ... the next election looms.”

Sunday's vote coincided with fresh snowfall across the country, including in Tokyo. Record snowfall in northern Japan over the past few weeks blocked roads and was blamed for dozens of deaths nationwide.

R-CALF USA CEO Bill Bullard joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss President Donald Trump's plan to import beef from Argentina as U.S. ranchers face rising bankruptcies and a shrinking domestic market.

President Donald Trump's beef import plan aims to cut prices, but cattle ranchers say it misses what's crushing them most — the power of meat packers.

""Meat packers have created a system where they win no matter what — at the cost of everyone else,"" said Will Harris, a fourth-generation cattleman and owner of White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, Georgia.

Harris, who plans to hand off the operation to his children, said his farm handles every step of production, from raising cattle to processing and selling beef, giving him a clear view of how prices are set.

AMERICA'S SMALLEST CATTLE HERD IN 70 YEARS MEANS REBUILDING WILL TAKE YEARS AND BEEF PRICES COULD STAY HIGH

At the center of that pricing power sit the ""Big Four"" — Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef — anchoring the U.S. beef supply chain from pasture to plate.

Together, the packing titans process about 85% of the grain-fattened cattle that become steaks, roasts and other supermarket cuts.

""The U.S. beef market is so highly concentrated that a small number of dominant packers control processing, distribution and pricing. This allows them to pay ranchers less for cattle while charging consumers more at the store. When cheap imported beef enters the system, it allows packers to increase their margins,"" Harris told Fox News Digital.

It's a concern echoed deep into cattle country.

Texas cattle rancher Cole Bolton said he sees the same problem in the Lone Star State.

""What the real issue is, is the price differential between the big four packers and what they're paying us for the product,"" said Bolton, the owner of K&C Cattle Company.

Those margins, Bolton said, have been squeezed for decades. ""Ranchers have dealt with such thin margins of profitability for the last 20 years.""

While ranchers like Bolton and Harris say Trump's temporary expansion of U.S. beef imports from Argentina may help ease prices in the short term, both warn it is no substitute for rebuilding domestic production.

""Imports should be a bridge, not a long-term replacement,"" Harris said. ""We must rebuild the American cattle herd, protect American farmers and ensure transparency, so consumers understand where their beef comes from. Long-term affordability depends on a healthy, resilient domestic cattle industry — not permanent dependence on foreign beef.""

Years of drought, high feed costs and an aging ranching population have thinned herds, leaving the U.S. cattle supply at its lowest level in more than 70 years.

""I think it's going to take a while to fix this crisis that we're in with the cattle shortage. My message to consumers is simple: Folks, be patient. We've got to build back our herds,"" Bolton told Fox News Digital.

He noted that the cattle industry, over the last five years, has weathered one setback after another, from market turmoil to extreme weather conditions.

SAN FRANCISCO – The Super Bowl marks the biggest gambling day of the year, and as it becomes more prevalent, there are plenty of more options.

DraftKings, of course, has taken notice of what fans may like, giving oddsmaker Johnny Avello quite the fun job for Super Bowl LX and the entire season leading up to it.

Bets simply used to be spreads, moneylines or over/unders, but Avello saw a trend and ran with it.

""The props that really do write the most money over the last two, three years? That would be touchdown scorers,"" Avello told Fox News Digital on radio row.

""We started off three, four years ago with first touchdown scorer, and that was the bet: first touchdown scorer in every game. And now we're up to anytime scorer in every game, and then two touchdown scorers, three touchdown scorers, last touchdown scorer. That is the prop that has the most growth over the last two or three years.""

Avello also said he enjoyed taking a deep dive into next-gen stats, including the fastest ball carrier, farthest thrown ball, and other similar wagers that cannot be determined simply from the box score.

The Super Bowl is also the king of the prop bet, including national anthem length, Gatorade color and other miscellaneous wagers. But Avello decided to give in to NFL history for one available bet.

49ERS' CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY, BROCK PURDY TALK UP DIVISION RIVAL SEAHAWKS BEFORE SUPER BOWL: ‘HELL OF A TEAM'

""We put up a prop: Will the Seahawks have a one-yard passing attempt, and will they complete it?"" Avello said, noting that it's a play on Super Bowl XLIX, which, like this year, featured the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots. That game, of course, is best known for Russell Wilson's interception by Malcolm Butler on the 1-yard line with Marshawn Lynch in the backfield.

Avello said most of the spread bets are on the favored Seahawks to cover the 4.5-point spread, but lots of moneyline bets are on New England. And that would not be great for DraftKings.

""People who want to bet the Patriots say, ""I don't need the 4.5 points. Patriots are gonna win straight up."" That's the main reason for the Patriots taking the underdog on the moneyline, Avello said. ""So we're kind of balanced out on the game.""

""We do have a little bit of hazard on the Patriots to win the whole thing. We opened them, like, 70-1 to win the Super Bowl, but we also opened the Seahawks high, too. But they haven't taken anywhere near the money that the Patriots did. So we're in a little bit of jeopardy there.""

The cupcake boom, a twenty-year dessert trend that once captivated the nation, ended with a thunk. However, America's sweet tooth doesn't retire — it just hunts for its next obsession.

When all of Sprinkles' stores abruptly closed at the end of 2025, a curtain dropped on an era. Not because the dessert chain, cofounded by pastry chef and entrepreneur Candace Nelson in 2005, was the biggest, but because it was the name-brand symbol of the nation's cupcake years.

Timing matters. As restaurant chains face higher costs and more cautious consumers who have less patience for one-note indulgences, the sudden disappearance of a once-dominant dessert brand underscores how little room there is for concepts that don't necessarily drive frequent repeat visits.

Asit Sharma, a senior investing analyst at The Motley Fool, put it bluntly: ""Sprinkles Cupcakes just punched way beyond its weight in the public imagination than it ever did on the ground.""

At its peak, Sprinkles had fewer than 100 stores, and yet, Sharma added, the brand got a lot of great press and ""sometimes the perception is larger than the business.""

Sprinkles is credited with being the world's first cupcake-only bakery, helping to popularize the craze that spawned dozens, if not hundreds, of copycats. Nelson, the founder, served as a permanent judge on the Food Network show ""Cupcake Wars,"" further elevating her brand's status — and cementing her version of the handheld treats as the gold standard.

Still, the closure of Sprinkles, Sharma argued, wasn't shocking, since Nelson had sold her stake in the company to the private equity firm KarpReilly LLC in 2012.

""We know that expansion isn't always the first priority of a private equity firm when it takes over a chain; profits are, so that's not surprising,"" Sharma said.

The bigger takeaway for him wasn't just ownership — it was the cyclical fate of dessert fads.

""Dessert chains in particular are really prone to fads — frozen yogurt is a perfect example,"" Jonathan Maze, editor in chief of Restaurant Business, said.

""We've had two frozen yogurt booms, one in the 80s and 90s, and then one coming out of the Great Recession,"" Maze added. In the boom phase, he said, ""You just get a lot of copycat concepts. They franchise. They start aggressively selling these locations.""

Then the market turns, consumers move on to something else, and as quickly as they came, ""they start declining."" Gourmet doughnuts followed a similar trajectory in the late 2000s before cupcakes gained steam.

The cupcake trend, Maze said, although once promising, in part due to its early, pre-social media, viral appeal, ""just didn't quite have the legs that people thought it did — but that happens fairly routinely.""

Dessert spending remains significant. The $143.63 billion sweets market is projected to reach $193.56 billion by 2030, according to Research and Markets.

If Sprinkles' closing is a symbolic endpoint, the obvious question is what fills the gap. That question carries new weight in a tighter economy, where consumers are increasingly choosy about when — and how often — they treat themselves.

Sharma's immediate answer: ""I think it's got to be the international bakery craze."" He described noticing both Korean and Vietnamese concepts start to crop up across both coasts — with brands like Paris Baguette, 85°C Bakery Cafe, and Tous les Jours trending online and growing their footprints nationwide.

Nothing Bundt Cakes also shows promise as a contender to become the next ""it"" sweet after years of being a quiet hit. Maze described the Nothing Bundt Cakes as ""one of the best-performing and most consistent restaurant chains in the country,"" having steadily grown to over 700 locations since its 1997 founding.

The company, which had the most positive review sentiment for quality and taste of all food brands on Yelp's ""Most Loved Brands of 2025"" list, is on track to open 1,000 units by 2027.

Maze, meanwhile, thinks cookies have an advantage that cupcakes and fro-yo never fully did: they're an everyday treat that doesn't require a dedicated occasion to enjoy. That accessibility has led to names like Crumbl, Insomnia Cookies, and Levain Bakery gaining momentum quickly.

""Cookies are actually pretty fascinating, to be perfectly honest,"" Maze said. The format, he argued, can be resilient, and crucially, ""it's not a major investment to get yourself a cookie.""

He also credited Insomnia Cookies' model for creating specific demand after the brand designed its own occasion — late-night cookie cravings — and answered the make-or-break question for any specialty dessert chain: how often will customers really show up?

""The biggest challenge with that sector by a long shot is that you only get a Blizzard or doughnuts so often,"" Maze said.

That constraint — how often people realistically want dessert — is what ultimately determines which chains endure and which burn out. When too many concepts flood the market offering the same product for the same narrow occasion, the model goes stale, no matter how beloved the brand once was.

That dynamic is what doomed frozen yogurt, dulled the cupcake boom, and now leaves the dessert category in a moment of reshuffling, as chains chase recipes that feel special enough to justify the splurge in a stretched economy. What comes next — cookies, international bakeries, bundt cakes, or something still incubating on TikTok — will face the same test.

Pressure on Starmer:

Keir Starmer's Chief of Staff Morgan McSweeney quit his post on Sunday, becoming the casualty of a furor over the decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to Washington that now threatens the prime minister's own position.

The loss of his key aide is a hammer blow to Starmer, who as recently as Wednesday said he retained confidence in McSweeney and considered him an “essential part of my team.” With the Irishman the architect of Labour's 2024 election landslide win and the prime minister's closest senior adviser, his departure leaves the prime minister exposed at a time when frustrated members of parliament are braying for change at the top.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Gold is seen as a store of wealth, but what does Bitcoin offer?

Gold is a metal that has long been used as currency. At one point, paper currency was backed by a gold reserve. That's no longer the case, but gold is still seen as a store of wealth because it is a physical asset. In the digital world, things are different. Investors have taken to cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC +2.69%) as a store of wealth. Is that a good idea in light of recent divergent price moves in gold and Bitcoin?

Geopolitical and economic concerns have investors on edge. Sure, the S&P 500 is trading near all-time highs, but that hasn't stopped Wall Street from buying gold as a hedge against a market or economic crash. To be fair, gold has risen dramatically over the past year, though sometimes in a volatile fashion. As a commodity, gold is prone to material price swings. Given the emotionally driven price advance, the swing can be pretty large even on a day-to-day basis.

Still, gold is a physical asset. If you buy a gold coin, it will still be a gold coin 100 years from now. That means you can use it to buy things in a worst-case scenario, no matter what happens on Wall Street or Main Street.

Bitcoin is a digital asset. The only value it has is the value that other owners of the asset assign to it. Like gold, Bitcoin is highly volatile. Also like gold, investors view it as a store of wealth because it exists outside government control. Unlike gold, however, Bitcoin isn't a physical asset. That limits its use in the worst scenarios, like a total economic collapse.

Such a dire outcome is unlikely. However, there's still a good reason to question Bitcoin's value as a store of wealth. This is evident in Bitcoin's price not always moving in the same direction as gold's. From a historical perspective, gold's role as a diversification tool and store of wealth is well established. Bitcoin has been around for a few years, but compared to gold, it is still a brand-new asset class. It's largely untested as a store of wealth.

Until Bitcoin has been through a deep bear market or recession, there's no way to know whether it will be a store of wealth like gold has historically been. Only the most aggressive investors should own Bitcoin, thinking that it is a store of wealth like gold.

Of course, it's also true that only the most aggressive investors should allocate more than a small portion of their assets to gold. Speculating on gold or Bitcoin price moves isn't for the faint of heart.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin Price Reclaims $71,000 as Institutions Buy the Dip and Retail Interest Surges","https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-price-71000-buy-the-dip","Sun, 08 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT","

After a rocky week, the bitcoin price is trading above $71,000.

The Bitcoin price climbed back above $71,000 over the weekend, extending its rebound after one of the sharpest sell-offs of the cycle sent the price briefly plunging toward $60,000 earlier this week.

The recovery comes as institutional investors appear to be treating sub-$70,000 bitcoin as a renewed buying opportunity, even while retail traders search for signs the market has reached a bottom.

Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said in a CNBC interview that bitcoin's pullback is landing differently with large investors than with long-time holders.

“I think long-time holders are feeling unsure,” Horsley said. “And I think the new investor set, institutions are sort of getting a new crack at the apple.”

Horsley added that some institutional buyers are now seeing price levels they believed they had permanently missed, as bitcoin gets “swept up” in a broader macro-driven selloff across liquid risk assets.

While institutions have been stepping in, retail participants have been scanning the market for confirmation that the sell-off has fully exhausted itself.

Sentiment platform Santiment said in a weekend report that retail traders are “meta-analyzing” the downturn, looking for proof that others are quitting before re-entering the market — behavior that often emerges near market lows.

“Retail traders are trying to meta-analyze the market, looking for signs of others quitting to time their own entries,” Santiment wrote.

Google Trends data reflects the spike in attention. Worldwide searches for “Bitcoin” hit a score of 100 for the week starting Feb. 1 — the highest level in the past 12 months — as bitcoin's price whipsawed from above $81,000 down to $60,000 before rebounding.

Searches for the term “crypto capitulation” also surged, rising from 11 to 58 in the week ending Feb. 8.

Adding to all this, ProCap Financial CIO Jeff Park suggested bitcoin price's next major bull-market catalyst may not come from Federal Reserve rate cuts — but from bitcoin's ability to rise even in a tightening environment.

Park described a scenario where the bitcoin price climbs alongside higher interest rates as the asset's “holy grail,” challenging traditional assumptions about liquidity and the global monetary system.

Last week, crypto exchange Bithumb said it accidentally sent out more than $40 billion worth of Bitcoin during a promotional rewards event after a payout error gave some users thousands of BTC instead of a small cash reward.

The exchange quickly restricted trading and withdrawals, recovering 99.7% of the excess Bitcoin and stressing the incident was not caused by hacking or a security breach. 

A small amount — about 125 BTC worth roughly $9 million — remains unrecovered, and Bithumb said it will cover the losses with corporate funds.

Bitcoin price was trading above $71,400 at the time of publication, stabilizing after days of extreme volatility that rattled both crypto and broader financial markets.

Ethereum isn't being recognized for the improvements it's making.

Most assets simply can't reinvent themselves every few quarters, but Ethereum (ETH +0.74%) arguably does just that. After pushing two major upgrades, Pectra and Fusaka, in 2025, the chain has another two big improvements on the docket for 2026.

Nonetheless, the coin's price is down by 38% during the past three months alone, largely for macro reasons that are well beyond its control. Thus it's likely undervalued, and potentially by quite a lot. Does that make it a screaming buy with a hearty investment of $5,000?

Image source: Getty Images.

Ethereum's 2025 upgrades were a lot more than cosmetic improvements, and they laid the technical groundwork for a lot of the follow-on work that's going to happen this year. This stuff might sound boring (and it might actually be) but knowing what's going on with it is key to appreciating the chain's place in the crypto sector's competitive landscape, not to mention its future opportunities for growth.

The Pectra upgrade went live in May 2025, and it bundled changes aimed at providing better wallet UX, more efficient staking, and more throughput for Layer-2 (L2) chains.  Fusaka followed on Dec. 3, and its headline feature, peer-to-peer data availability sampling (PeerDAS) is also a game changer for the chain's ability to provide rapid performance at scale, and substantially cheaper than before. Today, the chain's average transaction fees are roughly 75% lower than three years ago, with an average token swap now costing about $0.30, so these successive upgrades are definitely succeeding in making Ethereum a cheaper and easier technology to use.

For 2026, the next upgrade, Glamsterdam, will build on those past successes while also adding new censorship resistance features.  But, if the coin's price performance after past updates is any indication, investors simply can't count on a boost.

There's not exactly a rush to buy Ethereum before Glamsterdam drops.

Ethereum's upside comes from being the settlement layer that L2s and on-chain finance route through. Given that its upgrades tend to reduce transaction costs rather than increase them, the coin's value capture from the traffic it supports is still very weak, and it would likely take a deluge of new traffic to move the needle for investors. Realistically, the new traffic will probably ramp up slowly over time, assuming it arrives at all, so buying the coin means getting exposure both to the value generated from the improvement of its underlying tech and also the value generated from people using it to pay for decentralized finance (DeFi) apps and services.

But it's still very much an asset worth owning, as it's one of the most important in the crypto sector. An investment of $5,000 buys roughly 2.5 coins, which is enough exposure in case 2026's development road map plays out such that the coin's price significantly rises, which is still possible.

Of course, if you're usually intolerant of risk, it's probably better to aim for a much smaller allocation.

Ethereum (ETH) has declined noticeably over the past week, with price data from CoinMarketCap reporting a net 14% decline within this period. At the time of the most recent data, ETH is trading around $2,000, significantly lower than the past week's level near $2,500. 

ETH Funding Rates Signal A Bullish Turn

In a QuickTake post on the CryptoQuant platform, analyst Amr Taha draws attention to recent developments in ETH funding rates, a key sentiment indicator in perpetual futures. The funding rate shows the market sentiment, whether it's optimistic/greedy (positive) or fearful/cautious (negative).

Typically, when funding is highly positive or negative, it means that too many traders are on one side, positions are overleveraged, and then the market becomes unstable. At that point, even a small price move in the opposite direction can trigger liquidations, causing sharp and fast price moves.

Although Ethereum's funding rate was deeply negative over the week, analyst Amr Taha noted there has been a flip as ETH derivatives data shows a clear shift toward bullish positioning. Notably, Funding rates have turned strongly positive on BitMEX (Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange), reaching 0.049%, their highest level since October and well above the previous peak near 0.03. This signals aggressive leverage on the long side.

Extreme Optimism In ETH Could Spark Sharp Moves

At the same time, ETH funding on Binance has moved from deeply negative levels at -0.025% on February 5 back towards neutral, indicating that short positions are being replaced by new long exposure. In essence, the market has moved from fear to optimism.

While this shift reflects a rise in bullish sentiments, history shows that periods of extreme positive funding driven by leverage often increase the risk of liquidations and sharp corrective moves, rather than supporting sustained upside. In short, when everyone is bullish at the same time, the market becomes easier to knock over.

In all, Ethereum Derivatives traders have become aggressively bullish, and while that can push price higher in the short term, history shows it often increases the risk of sudden corrective moves rather than a sustained uptrend. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,089 after a 14.9% decline in the past seven days. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 32.39% and valued at $37.39 billion.

The Pudgy Penguins team is helping fans celebrate Valentine's Day in the real world with Pudgy Petals, a three-day immersive pop-up event in New York City that highlights gifting and connection via its colorful characters.

Running February 12-14, the activation invites guests into the love story of Polly and Pengu (aka Pax), core characters in the Pudgy Penguins universe. The team told Decrypt that the brand—which has expanded from NFTs to games, real-world toys, and beyond—is using Valentine's Day as a cultural entry point to continue to translate its internet-native IP into a broader brand.

At the center of the pop-up is the Pudgy Penguins Plush Bouquet ($49.99), an alternative to traditional flowers. The bouquet features plush characters and soft textures designed to last well beyond the holiday. An online drop of the bouquet has already sold out, but it will also be available at the pop-up.

“The Plushie Bouquet marks our first Valentine's Day expression,” Pudgy Penguins Director of Business Development Steve Starobinsky told Decrypt. “The item is intentionally positioned as a long-lasting symbol of companionship designed to be kept and revisited rather than discarded after a few days like traditional flowers or candy. This item embodies our aim of creating new rituals of affection rooted in meaning rather than tradition.”

The event includes on-site bouquet customization with flash tattoos, free aura readings, and couples photo booths. There will also be pink and blue matcha drinks and treats outside the space.

The programming will shift slightly each day. Thursday, February 12, aligns with both New York Fashion Week and the New York Toy Fair, tapping into a creative crowd already circulating downtown Manhattan. Friday, February 13, is branded as Polly's Galentine's, with a focus on friendship and groups. And Saturday, February 14, centers on couples and classic Valentine's moments, leaning fully into the holiday vibe.

“Every detail of the pop-up is intentionally designed to encourage guests to linger, participate, document the experience, and share it socially,” Starobinsky said. “The space will be inviting and joyful, for all those who join the fun.”

Beyond the Valentine's theme, Pudgy Petals represents a broader brand evolution. Pudgy Penguins, which began as an internet-native phenomenon and NFT project, is continuing its shift into physical retail and experiential spaces that require no familiarity with crypto. The pop-up prioritizes emotional storytelling and accessibility, rather than technology.

“We are a four-quadrant brand appealing to adults and kids, women and men, with categories such as toys, gifting, lifestyle, and experiential retail drawing people in,” Starobinsky added.

The timing of the activation is equally strategic, with Starobinsky noting that the overlap with those other NYC events puts “Pudgy Penguins at the intersection of fashion, toys, pop culture, and retail innovation.” And it won't be the last V-Day event, he said.

“Pudgy Petals is not a one-time activation,” Starobinsky added. “We are going to expand this pop-up globally in 2027, leveraging it to launch more product capsules for this holiday.”

In a motion to dismiss, Nvidia argues authors suing over AI training have not plausibly alleged copying of their works.

Nvidia is pushing back against claims that it trained AI models on pirated books, telling a federal court in California that its alleged contact with the library ‘Anna's Archive' doesn't amount to proof of copyright infringement.

In a motion to dismiss filed January 29, the company argues that the authors behind Nazemian v Nvidia have failed to plausibly show that their specific works were downloaded or used in training, despite expanding their complaint to include new theories and datasets.

The Nazemian case was filed in early 2024 and heard in the Northern District of California before Judge Jon Tigar and concerns allegations that Nvidia's AI tools and reference models were trained on copyrighted books sourced from so-called shadow libraries, including Anna's Archive and Books3. The plaintiffs' amended complaint references internal discussions during which Nvidia employees allegedly sought confirmation regarding access to Anna's Archive, arguing that this amounts to evidence of unlawful use.

In its motion to dismiss, Nvidia argues that the amended complaint fails to allege even the most basic elements required for a copyright infringement claim. According to the filing, the plaintiffs “do not allege facts showing that Nvidia copied any of their copyrighted works, when any such copying occurred, or which Nvidia models supposedly contain those works.” The company says that without those details, the claims are entirely speculative.

Addressing the Anna's Archive allegations directly, Nvidia states that while the complainant describes internal discussions and inquiries about potential access to the site, they don't allege that Nvidia actually obtained or downloaded any of the plaintiffs' works from it. The motion goes on to argue that discussing or evaluating possible data sources isn't equivalent to copying copyrighted materials, and that copyright law requires plaintiffs to plead facts showing reproduction of protected works. “It's equally plausible Nvidia did not [obtain the Plaintiffs' works].”

Pulling no punches, Nvidia also criticizes the plaintiffs' reliance on allegations made “on information and belief,” arguing that this approach improperly attempts to use discovery as a substitute for pleading. Nvidia goes on in its motion to remind the court that copyright plaintiffs must allege infringement before discovery begins, not rely on discovery to determine whether infringement occurred in the first place, which Anna's Archive appears to be attempting to do in this case.

Beyond Anna's Archive, Nvidia seeks to narrow the scope of the case by challenging the inclusion of additional datasets and models, such as Megatron 345M, added in the amended complaint, arguing that the plaintiffs improperly lump together multiple models and tools without explaining how any particular model was trained on their works. In several instances, Nvidia points to its own public documentation to argue that the plaintiffs' assumptions about training data are contradicted by publicly available sources.

The amended complaint also introduces a secondary liability theory tied to Nvidia's NeMo Megatron framework and its support for downloading large public datasets such as The Pile. Nvidia responds that the complaint doesn't allege a predicate act of direct infringement by any third party, which is required to sustain claims of contributory or vicarious copyright infringement. Providing optional tooling, the company argues, doesn't establish liability absent specific allegations that users infringed copyrights using that tooling.

The motion to dismiss is due to be heard in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, on April 2, 2026.

Orange barrels and the sound of jackhammers have become a temporary staple of the Downtown Houston skyline, but the city says the mess is paving the way for a historic transformation. FOX 26's Mekenna Earnhart explains the upcoming city's upcoming 'Promenade' for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

HOUSTON - Orange barrels and the sound of jackhammers have become a temporary staple of the Downtown Houston skyline, but the city says the mess is paving the way for a historic transformation.

Why you should care:

The $12 million Main Street Promenade project is officially in its final sprint. The initiative, which permanently closes seven blocks of Main Street (from Commerce to Rusk) to vehicular traffic, aims to turn the corridor into a pedestrian-first ""outdoor living room"" just in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

What they're saying:

For business owners in the heart of the construction zone, the project represents both a challenge and a massive opportunity.

At Day 6 Coffee Co., owner Julius Chatton says the construction has definitely changed the way people get to his shop, but he's keeping his eyes on the prize.

""The construction has sort of impeded vehicular traffic to an extent,"" Chatton said. ""But with the FIFA World Cup, of course, we will get international business and an opportunity to expose people to Houston and the way we do hospitality.""

Chatton, whose shop sits in a historic protected building, hopes the millions of international fans expected to descend on Houston in June will see a side of Texas they aren't expecting.

""People's notions of Texas are pretty linear,"" Chatton said. ""It will be nice to showcase the diversity that exists in Houston.""

Just down the street at Taste Kitchen + Bar, General Manager Jordon Graves has already seen the light at the end of the tunnel. While construction was a hurdle when it was directly in front of their doors, that phase is complete for his block.

""In the beginning, we did have problems... people looking for the restaurant, couldn't get by,"" Graves said. ""Now that they're finished, it's getting back better.""

Graves says the vision of a walkable Main Street is what keeps the staff excited. ""Once we get different people from all around the world, getting our flavor... we'll be on a different level.""

The backstory:

The project grew out of a successful pilot program during the COVID pandemic, proving that Houstonians were hungry for more walkable, outdoor spaces. When the final brick is laid in May 2026, the Promenade will feature expanded dining patios, shaded canopies, and public art.

While the World Cup is the catalyst for the speed of the project, city officials say the Promenade is a permanent gift to the city, one that small business owners hope will keep downtown vibrant long after the final whistle blows.

The Sporting KC Training Centre will serve as a Team Base Camp Training Site during FIFA World Cup 26™ for reigning champions Argentina, the club announced today.

Each team participating in FIFA World Cup 26™ selects a Team Base Camp Training Site where the team's delegation will be headquartered to prepare for matches, including practice sessions, player workouts, team meetings and staff operations. This “home away from home” is designed to provide a hub where teams will arrive ahead of their first match and will be available for those teams to return to between matches.

   Argentina's Schedule for FIFA World Cup 26™

   June 16: Argentina vs. Algeria in Kansas City, Mo.

   June 22: Argentina vs. Austria in Arlington, Texas

   June 27: Argentina vs. Jordan in Arlington, Texas

Argentina are three-time World Cup champions, winning the sport's biggest prize in 1978, 1986 and 2022. Currently No. 2 in the FIFA rankings, La Albiceleste finished first in World Cup qualifying in South America and are led by head coach Lionel Scaloni – named The Best FIFA Football Coach in 2022 – and a star-studded pool of players headlined by Lionel Messi. The back-to-back MLS MVP has appeared in a record 26 World Cup matches and is poised to play in a record sixth World Cup this summer.

“Following several inspection trips and after a thorough final report, it was concluded that Kansas City would be the ideal location for the tournament, considering the distances between cities and, more importantly, the amenities available to the team,” the Argentine Football Federation wrote in confirming Kansas City as their Team Base Camp for FIFA World Cup 26™.

The Sporting KC Training Centre opened in 2018 as the team's official training ground and the $75 million state-of-the-art facility features five fields, highlighted by a super pitch spanning seven acres with three full-size natural grass fields in addition to two synthetic turf fields with LED sports lighting. Inside the world-class venue is a luxury of accommodations, including a gymnasium, sports performance lab, hydrotherapy pools, training room, locker rooms, team lounge, offices, classrooms and media studio.

Located in Kansas City, Kansas, the Sporting KC Training Centre is less than a mile from Sporting Kansas City's home stadium, Sporting Park, which is designated as a Venue-Specific Training Site to host training sessions for national teams preparing to play matches in Kansas City during FIFA World Cup 26™.","{'href': 'https://www.sportingkc.com', 'title': 'Sporting Kansas City'}","soccer"

 Felix Auger-Aliassime, back to raising the roof. 

 The top seed downed home favourite Adrian Mannarino 6-3, 7-6(4) on Sunday afternoon to successfully defend his crown at the Open Occitanie in Montpellier. Auger-Aliassime did not face a break point in a 96-minute win to secure his ninth tour-level title, and his eighth on indoor hard courts. 

FAAbulous title defence ✅@OpenOccitanie | #OpenOccitanie26 | @felixtennis pic.twitter.com/IoUusPDBlC

 “Adrian is always a very tough opponent to play, for all players, I think,"" said Auger-Aliassime in his on-court interview. ""That's why myself and all our peers on Tour have so much respect for him and the challenge he poses on the court. I knew it was going to be a tough match today, so I'm very happy. It's amazing emotions to win again here. I'm thrilled with my whole week and especially today.” 

 After defeating Stan Wawrinka, Arthur Fils, Titouan Droguet and Mannarino to go back to back in Montpellier, Auger-Aliassime moved clear of Milos Raonic to set a new record for the most Tour titles by a Canadian in the Open Era. Auger-Aliassime has now won 89 tour-level matches indoors this decade, the most of any player. 

 Having retired from his first-round match at the Australian Open due to cramp, Auger-Aliassime will now head to the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam full of confidence following his Montpellier bounceback. Before he steps on court in the Netherlands, he will on Monday rise two spots to No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings. 

 Auger-Aliassime rode a fast start to the first set of Sunday's final in the south of France. The 25-year-old won the first eight points to assume control and closed out the set with his second break of Mannarino's serve in the ninth game. 

 The second set was a hard-fought affair dominated by serve. Auger-Aliassime carved out the first break point of the set at 5-4, 30/40, which doubled as a championship point. Mannarino fended it off with an unreturnable serve, but Auger-Aliassime later reeled off five consecutive points from 2/4 in the tie-break to complete a straight-sets win and take a 2-1 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. 

 As it so often is when he competes indoors, Auger-Aliassime's serve was the foundation of his final victory. He finished the match having won 87 per cent (39/45) of points behind first serves, according to Infosys ATP Stats, a number which was boosted by 13 aces.

 Theo Arribage and Albano Olivetti continued the fruitful start to their partnership on Sunday by claiming an ATP 250 title on home soil at the Open Occitanie. 

 The fourth-seeded home favourites defeated third seeds Constantin Frantzen and Robin Haase 7-6(6), 6-1 to lift the trophy on the indoor courts of Montpellier. Arribage and Olivetti only made their team debut last September, but the pair has now won three tour-level trophies (Almaty 2025, Auckland 2026, Montpellier 2026). 

Home heroes 🥳🇫🇷Arribage/@albano_olivetti rule Montpellier 7-6(6), 6-1 over Frantzen/Haase@OpenOccitanie | #OpenOccitanie26 pic.twitter.com/xJmQXAf97R

 “It's an unbelievable week for me and Albano,” said Arribage. “A first win for me in France, so I'm very happy with this title. It was a very tough first match. We lost a set and [were a break down], and faced a point for a double break, so it was not easy. We stayed focused, did our best and we are very happy with this win.” 

 Olivetti added: “This week, the beginning was very complicated, we had a tough first match. Even the quarters were not easy, and then somehow we played a better rhythm together. We played a very good semi-final, very good final, so we are really happy to win our first tournament in France together. We had good support from the crowd, lots of family and friends here, so it's a very special week and a special win for us.” 

 The French duo let slip all five break points it earned in the first set of Sunday's final, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Yet Arribage and Olivetti held their nerve in the subsequent tie-break before racing through the second set for a 79-minute championship-match win. 

 Arribage and Olivetti now lead 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Frantzen and Haase, having defeated the German-Dutch pair in all three of their ATP 250 title runs. The 25-year-old Arribage is now a four-time ATP Tour champion overall, while 34-year-old Olivetti has won five crowns.

The Texas native appeared in three films for exploitation director S.F. Brownrigg, including ‘Don't Look in the Basement' and ‘Poor White Trash Part II.'

Senior Editor


	Camilla Carr, the Texas-born actress who appeared for director S.F. Brownrigg in the low-budget 1970s horror films Don't Look in the Basement, Poor White Trash Part II and Keep My Grave Open, has died. She was 83.


	Carr died Wednesday in El Paso, Texas, of complications from Alzheimer's and a dislocated hip, her son, writer, poet and painter Caley O'Dwyer, told The Hollywood Reporter.




	Carr also stood out on CBS' Designing Women when she portrayed a Sugarbaker client who thinks gay men who contract AIDS are getting what they deserve in the October 1987 episode “They're Killing All the Right People,” written by series creator Linda Bloodworth Thomason.

	Carr played an unhinged patient who kills a nurse in Don't Look in the Basement (1973) and a devious hillbilly daughter in Poor White Trash Part II (1974) — a drive-in hit also known as Scum of the Earth — before she starred in Keep My Grave Open (1977) as a woman with a murderous split personality (she thinks she's also her brother).


	All three were cult exploitation films from Brownrigg, a producer-director known for his ability to create creepiness with very little money.


	Born on Sept. 17, 1942, in Memphis, Texas, Carr attended Kermit (Texas) High School and the University of North Texas. She first met her future husband, Hugh Feagin, when they were actors at Theatre Three in Dallas, and they appeared together in the Texas-shot A Bullet for Pretty Boy (1970), starring Fabian as 1930s bank robber Pretty Boy Floyd. (Feagin was in Don't Look in the Basement and Poor White Trash Part II as well.)

	











	Carr and future Designing Women star Jean Smart acted together in Jane Chambers' landmark lesbian play Last Summer at Bluefish Cove, which opened for what proved to be a long run at The Fountain Theater in East Hollywood in 1983.


	As Mrs. Imogene Salinger on Designing Women, Carr overhears plans for a funeral for a young interior designer (Tony Goldwyn) dying of AIDS and remarks, “As far as I'm concerned, this disease has one thing going for it: It's killing all the right people.” (Watch the scene here.)


	“It was a shitty character, but she did a great job for an important cause,” her son said.


	Bloodworth Thomason, whose mother had recently died after getting AIDS through a blood transfusion, earned an Emmy nomination for writing the episode.


	Carr also showed up in the Michael Anderson-directed Logan's Run (1976); played housekeeper/snoop Nellie Maxwell on three episodes of CBS' Falcon Crest in 1988; appeared on One Day at a Time and Another World; and played Maxine in 1991 in Tennessee Williams' The Night of the Iguana, one of several productions she did for the Los Angeles Theatre Center.


	And in 2015, she came out of retirement to appear in Don't Look in the Basement 2, directed by S.F. Brownrigg's son, Anthony Brownrigg.


	Carr also wrote on telefilms and authored the comic 1989 novel Topsy Turvy Dingo Dog, which revolved around a B-movie actress, Mary Jane Shady, who returns to her hometown of Uncertain, Texas, for her 20th high school reunion.

	











	Her second husband was Oscar-winning screenwriter Edward Anhalt (Panic in the Streets, Becket). They were married from 1968 until their 1976 divorce, and she was one of his five wives.

	Before the Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie steamy lovefest, Wuthering Heights, takes over the world, this weekend belonged to K-Pop group Stray Kids as their Live Nation concert movie, Stray Kids: The dominATE Experience, danced to a $19.1M global win from 61 territories, electrified largely by Universal International. The pic also had bragging rights for the No. 1 pic at the weekend foreign B.O. with $13.5M, while domestic delivered $5.6M from Bleecker Street‘s new event cinema label Crosswalk at 1,724 locations.


	CJ has Korea but the movie didn't fare that well over there with an estimated $227K (we're still figuring out why that is). Japan didn't go this weekend. For Uni, it's their first K-Pop movie. In several territories, the movie is besting such comps as Taylor Swift / The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, Break The Silence: The Movie, Bring the Soul: The Movie, BTS World Tour Love Yourself in Seoul and Moonage Daydream.

Italy took in $800K at 220 screens (including six Imax), surpassing the lifetimes of Bring the Soul: The Movie, BTS Permission to Dance on Stage, Break the Silence: The Movie, and BTS World Tour Love Yourself in Seoul. Stray Kids ranked No.3 in the market, behind two local titles, and achieved the highest location average of the top titles ($2.3k).

Brazil was $600K at 506 screens (11 Imax), France $500K at 210 screens (8 Imax/3 4DX), Peru was No. 1 with $400K at 78 screens (1 Imax and 1 4DX).

Meghan Markle was pretty in pink as she attended he annual Fifteen Percent Pledge Fundraising Gala in Los Angeles solo on Saturday night.

The Duchess of Sussex looked glam in a custom strapless pink gown designed Charles Harbison of Harbison Studio. 

She wore a black cloak with a long train draped over her arms.

Markle, 44, slicked her hair back in a tight bun as she wore a natural makeup look.

She accessorized the look with black earrings and Stuart Weitzman black suede heels.

Harbison posted a video of himself inside the event smiling and laughing with Markle.

The Fifteen Percent Pledge, which was founded by Aurora James, is a non-profit organization that encourages retailers to commit at least 15 percent of their shelf space and revenue to black-owned businesses.

Beyonce's mom Tina Knowles was honored at the annual event for her advocacy for the community.

Chloe Bailey, Kimora Lee Simmons and Winnie Harlow were among the guests in attendance at the gala, which was held at Paramount Studios. 

Prince Harry did not accompany Markle to the event, though just days earlier, the As Ever founder posted a video of her husband as she brought him sweet treats as he worked in his office.

The video was promoting her latest As Ever collaboration with Compartés Chocolates, which includes her brand's signature raspberry and strawberry spreads along with a collection of chocolate treats.

As part of the collab, she posted a photo of herself wearing a familiar-looking navy Roland Mouret dress from when she was a working member of the royal family.

Markle previously wore the elegant strapless midi in November 2018, when she and her husband, Prince Harry, attended the Royal Foundation Dinner at Kensington Palace.

Markle and Harry were last spotted together at Sundance Film Festival in Utah last month for the premiere of their documentary “Cookie Queens.” 

Page Six Hollywood exclusively reported the pair appeared “guarded” during the event and Harry, 41, only “wanted to talk about was his Daily Mail trial.”

Last month, Harry testified that wife Markle's royal life was “absolute misery” during his trial against the UK tabloid.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, on Feb. 6.

After rebounding Friday to nearly erase a brutal mid-week slide, US stocks are facing more selling this week from trend-following algorithmic funds, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s trading desk.

The S&P 500 Index has already breached its short-term trigger that prompted Commodity Trading Advisers, or CTAs, to sell stocks. Goldman expects these systematic strategies — which follow the stock market direction rather than fundamental factors — to remain net sellers over the coming week, regardless of market direction.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, quit on Sunday, saying he took responsibility for advising Starmer to name Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the U.S. despite his known links to Jeffrey Epstein.

After new files revealed the depth of the Labour veteran's relationship with the late sex offender, Starmer is facing what is widely seen as the gravest crisis of his 18 months in power over his decision to send Mandelson to Washington in 2024.

The loss of McSweeney, 48, a strategist who was instrumental in Starmer's rise to power, is the latest in a series of setbacks, less than two years after the Labour Party won one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern British history.

With polls showing Starmer is hugely unpopular with voters after a series of embarrassing U-turns, some in his own party are openly questioning his judgment and his future, and it remains to be seen whether McSweeney's exit will be enough to silence critics.

The files released in the U.S. on January 30 sparked a police investigation for misconduct in office over indications that Mandelson leaked market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was a government minister during the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010.

In a statement, McSweeney said: ""The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself.

""When asked, I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice.""

The leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, said the resignation was overdue and that ""Keir Starmer has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions"".

Nigel Farage, head of the populist Reform UK party, which is leading in the polls, said he believed Starmer's time would soon be up.

Starmer has spent the last week defending McSweeney, a strategy that could prompt further questions about his own judgment. In a statement on Sunday, Starmer said it had been ""an honour"" working with him.

Many Labour members of parliament had blamed McSweeney for the appointment of Mandelson and the damage caused by the publication of the exchanges between Epstein and Mandelson. Others have said Starmer must go.

One Labour lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said McSweeney's resignation had come too late: ""It buys the PM time, but it's still the end of days.""Starmer sacked Mandelson as ambassador in September over his links to Epstein.

The government agreed last week to release virtually all previously private communications between members of his government from the time when Mandelson was being appointed.

That release could come as early as this week, creating a new headache for Starmer just as he hopes to move on. If previously secret messages about how London planned to approach its relationship with Donald Trump are made public, it could damage Starmer's relationship with the U.S. president.

McSweeney had held the role of chief of staff since October 2024, when he was handed the job following the resignation of Sue Gray after a row over pay and donations.

Starmer on Sunday appointed his deputy chiefs of staff, Jill Cuthbertson and Vidhya Alakeson, to serve as joint acting chiefs of staff.

The Ball is Round. The Place is Philly.

The United States' Men's Under-17 National Team went on a 10-0 rout Saturday evening against Saint Kitts and Nevis in its second match of the 2026 CONCACAF U-17 World Cup Qualifying. 

Earlier in the day, fellow Group E member the Dominican Republic bested Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 10-0, extending their goal differential to 15. Thus, the United States needed to beat Saint Kitts and Nevis by eight or more goals to bring its own goal differential above that mark going into the final match of the qualifier. 

Philadelphia Union II's striker Malik Jakupovic, who had scored two goals off the bench against Saint Vincent on Thursday, and Union Academy's goalkeeper Matthew White started in the match. The US U-17s made nine changes to the lineup from Thursday's victory due to the quick turnaround between matches in this tournament. 

The United States got on the board right away in the seventh minute through Malik Jakupovic. He scored his third goal in two matches after a ball perfectly whipped in by Myles Gardner on the right sideline. Gardner assisted Jakupovic's first goal in the U17s previous match, too. 

Jakupovic doubled the advantage in the 23rd minute, juggling the ball to hold it up and get past two defenders to place it confidently into the net. He received the ball from a long, lobbed pass by Mattheo Dimareli from about the halfway mark.

The Union striker nearly got his hat trick a minute later, but the goalkeeper, Victor Hart, made an impressive kick save to keep it out. A goal from Myles Gardner was called offside in the 26th minute. Jakupovic had the would-be assist with a touch while laying on the pitch.

Jermaine Powell of Saint Kitts and Nevis saw the first caution of the match for a foul just outside the box on Mattheo Dimareli. The challenge required a stoppage in play so that Dimareli could receive treatment. Dimareli hit the bar on the ensuing free kick. 

Vincente Garcia was fouled inside the box in the 35th minute. He stepped up to the spot for the penalty and scored his first-ever goal for the US U-17s. 

After the goal, the hosts made a change at right back, bringing on T'Quandre Burroughs for Jermaine Powell, who received a yellow earlier. 

Jakupovic got his hat trick in the 44th minute, receiving a through ball from Gardner, then cutting inside to hammer the shot into the side netting. 

The ball rarely left St. Kitts and Nevis' defensive half, but the hosts were able to keep up a high press against the USA, suffocating a few promising chances. 

Saint Kitts and Nevis were forced to switch keepers at the half after earlier concerns for the lower extremity of Victor Hart Jr, who has been a mainstay in the U17 side for the past two years. Brian Collins made his first international appearance by coming on for him. 

Within a minute of kickoff, another St. Kitts' Jaheem Hazel went down and required attention. He ended up being fit to continue. 

Collins brought down Mattheo Dimareli just outside of the box in what looked like a DOGSO foul. The referee chose to give a yellow card to the substitute goalkeeper and award a penalty. Saint Kitts and Nevis did not have a third keeper on their roster.

Dimareli stepped up to the spot and slotted it in to make it five. 

The United States made its first substitutions in the 61st minute, bringing on Peter Molinari and Paul Sokoloff for Landry Walker and Vincente Garcia. 

Saint Kitts and Nevis' Joshua Finch took a hit while trying to make a tackle and required the stretcher to get off the pitch. Roko Pehar missed an open net on the following corner kick. 

The United States made two more changes in the 68th minute. KK Spivey and Will Ostrander entered for Roko Pehar and Myles Gardner.

A sixth goal came in from the head of fullback Eddie Chadwick after some strong buildup by the United States right after the changes. Astin Mbaye of AC Milan played the ball over the box for the assist. 

Dimareli scored his second three minutes later, having been left unmarked at the back post. Malik Jakupovic added to his outing with an assist on that goal. 

The United States' final change was Prince Forfor for Mattheo Dimareli. 

A handball in the box by Saint Kitts' Adondre Eddy gave a third penalty to the United States. Jakupovic made easy work of it to bag his fourth. The goal solidified the United States' goal differential to put them at the top of the group going into the final match.

That did not stop Jakupovic, who went on to get a fifth in the 84th minute from outside the box. 

Substitute Prince Forfor got in on the scoring in the 90th minute to make it double-digits for the USA. By then, the US coaching staff seemed to require their team to make a certain number of passes between them before they could push forward and attack. 

The result eliminated Saint Kitts and Nevis from qualification contention. 

The U17MNT will finish this year's CONCACAF World Cup Qualifier against the Dominican Republic on Tuesday, February 10th at 1 PM. Both a win or a draw will see the United States qualify for a record 20th U17 World Cup later this year.
