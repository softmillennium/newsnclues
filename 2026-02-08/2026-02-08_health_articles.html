                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sepsis is a leading global cause of hospital deaths, occurring when the body's response to infection damages tissue and causes organs to fail. Africa bears the world's highest burden of sepsis, with an estimated 48 million cases each year leading to about 11 million deaths. An associated Phase 3 clinical trial called the ATLAS study found that starting tuberculosis (TB) treatment immediately, even before a TB diagnosis is confirmed, could significantly reduce sepsis deaths among HIV patients. The study and ATLAS trial were conducted by Tulane University and University of Virginia in collaboration with Mbarara University in Uganda and the Tanzania's Kibong'oto Infectious Diseases Hospital, among others. The findings of the study and clinical trial were published in Lancet E-Clinical Medicine and Lancet Infectious Disease, respectively. "Our analysis of the clinical trial results found that Mtb (the bacteria that causes TB) is a much more common cause of sepsis that we thought," said Dr. Eva Otoupalova, an assistant professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Tulane University School of Medicine, who co-led the study and was also an author on the ATLAS trial. "Usually, anti-TB treatments are reserved for those diagnosed with TB. We found that, in African hospitals where HIV and TB are a common co-infection, patients with sepsis may benefit from being given anti-TB medications as soon as possible." The ATLAS trial found that immediately treating HIV-related sepsis patients with anti-TB medication caused a 23% reduction in mortality when compared to those who only received treatment after receiving a TB diagnosis. Put another way, early anti-TB treatment saved 1 in every 4 patients. An immediate but higher dose of the same medication was not associated with a decrease in mortality. Previous studies have shown that TB can cause sepsis, however those studies are few, and I don't think we realized how high the prevalence is. Our analysis also found that our diagnostic tools are missing a lot of TB-sepsis, which is impactful if anti-TB treatment is only given to those diagnosed with the disease." It's been known that TB can be difficult to detect in children, the elderly, those with HIV and those with pulmonary TB, all cases where sputum needed for testing is more difficult to obtain. However, the researchers found that combined urine and sputum testing missed 32% of Mtb bloodstream infections. "These studies underscore two things: First, we successfully intervened in TB-related sepsis, and second, we used every rapid test available and found that they just don't detect all of the Mtb," Otoupalova said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stroke patients treated intravenously with loberamisal, a novel neuroprotective medication, daily for 10 days and starting within 48 hours of stroke symptoms, had better recovery than patients who received a placebo, according to a preliminary late-breaking science presentation at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference 2026. The meeting, from February 4 to 6, 2026, in New Orleans, is a world premiere meeting for researchers and clinicians dedicated to the science of stroke and brain health. The study goal is to test loberamisal, a new-generation dual-target treatment strategy designed to protect brain cells (neuroprotective agent) within the first 2 days after a stroke. Neuroprotective agents may help improve patient outcomes since they are aimed at preserving the function of neurovascular units. However, trials for most of these agents have not been successful. New treatments for stroke may come from multi-target neuroprotective agents, which could lead to important advancements in reducing or preventing disability after a stroke." Shuya Li, M.D., study author, director of the Clinical Trial Center and head of the Phase I Clinical Research Unit at Beijing Tiantan Hospital in Beijing The American Stroke Association's new 2026 Guideline for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke notes that neuroprotection has garnered renewed interest. Current knowledge gaps need to be addressed in future research. Study limitations include that the trial was conducted only in China, therefore, the results cannot be directly translated to people living in other countries. "We want to confirm our findings with larger groups of people, including people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, patients with more severe strokes and those who also have had vascular surgery. We need to better understand how loberamisal works by studying biomarkers in multiple population groups," Li said. Other limitations were that most patients in the study had moderate to severe strokes, which may affect applicability to people who have a more severe stroke.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Until now, scientists have never fully understood why this cancer advances so fast. A new study led by Nagoya University explains why. Published in Science Advances, the study shows that cancer cells recruit help from protective mesothelial cells that normally line the abdominal cavity. These hybrid cell clusters resist chemotherapy better than cancer alone. Researchers examined abdominal fluid from ovarian cancer patients and found something unexpected. Cancer cells do not float alone in the abdominal cavity. Instead, they often grab onto mesothelial cells and form hybrid spheres. About 60% of all cancer spheres contain these recruited mesothelial cells. The cancer cells release a protein called TGF-β1 that transforms the mesothelial cells and causes them to develop spike-like structures that cut through tissue. These cells enter the abdominal fluid and float freely. The fluid moves around as you breathe and move your body. They travel through the bloodstream to reach distant organs. Doctors can sometimes track these cancers through blood tests because blood moves in predictable paths through vessels. They float in fluid that has no fixed path. This floating stage happens before the cancer cells attach to new organs. Scientists did not fully understand what happened during the floating period or how cells worked together to spread cancer so quickly. The research team discovered that cancer cells recruit protective mesothelial cells that have shed from the abdominal cavity lining during this floating stage. The two cell types stick together and form hybrid spheres. The mesothelial cells then grow invadopodia, spike-like structures that drill into surrounding tissue. The hybrid spheres resist chemotherapy drugs more effectively and invade tissues faster when they land on organs. The researchers examined abdominal fluid from ovarian cancer patients using advanced microscopy to watch this process in real time. They confirmed their findings with mouse models and single-cell genetic analysis. Lead author Dr. Kaname Uno, a former PhD student and current Visiting Researcher at Nagoya University's Graduate School of Medicine, explained that the cancer cells do not need to become more invasive themselves. "They manipulate mesothelial cells to do the tissue invasion work. Dr. Uno worked as a gynecologist for eight years before he pursued research. She had clear screening results just three months before doctors found advanced ovarian cancer. This motivated Dr. Uno to investigate why ovarian cancer spreads so rapidly. Current chemotherapy targets cancer cells but ignores the mesothelial accomplices. The research also suggests that doctors could monitor these cell clusters in abdominal fluid to predict disease progression and treatment response.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from National Jewish Health helps explain how exposure to burn pit smoke and desert dust may damage the lungs of military service members deployed to regions such as Afghanistan and Iraq. The research, published in Free Radical Biology and Medicine(Opens in a new window), sheds light on why veterans exposed to these environments face higher rates of asthma and other long-term respiratory conditions. Burn pits, which are used to dispose of waste during military operations, release tiny particles into the air. These particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, but until now, scientists have not fully understood how they trigger lasting lung damage. In this study, researchers compared particulate matter collected from Afghanistan with similar desert dust from California to better understand their effects on lung immune cells. The findings show that particles linked to burn pit exposure cause stronger inflammation and stress in lung immune cells than typical desert dust. These particles activate an immune response that can lead to ongoing inflammation and tissue damage, helping explain why some service members develop chronic breathing problems after deployment. This study provides important insight into how deployment-related particulate matter affects immune cells in the lungs. Our findings identify the Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2) as a key mediator of inflammation caused by burn pit–associated particulate matter and suggest that targeting this pathway may offer new strategies to protect or treat individuals exposed during military service." They measured the production of nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide and inflammatory cytokines, which are key drivers of lung inflammation and tissue damage. The results showed that APM was significantly more toxic to macrophages than CPM, producing stronger oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that deployment-related particulate exposure may place warfighters at heightened risk for long-term respiratory disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The researchers found there are cross-cultural regularities in some aspects of the development of cooperation - namely, that younger children tend to be self-interested, and that as children get older their behavior starts to reflect local norms, according to the report. The researchers examined the development of four cooperative behaviors - fairness, trustworthiness, forgiveness, and honesty - in more than 400 children aged 5 to 13 from five societies. "Cooperation is crucial to the success of our species," said McAuliffe. "We were interested in how behaviors related to cooperation-fairness, trustworthiness, honesty, and forgiveness-emerge with age across diverse populations. We found some similarities, such as fairness and trustworthiness behaviors aligning with adult norms over age across societies. And we found some differences, such as variations in the norms themselves." For instance, adults across cultures have different ideas of what constitutes "fair" behavior. "There are cross-cultural regularities in some aspects of the development of cooperation - namely, that younger children tend to be self-interested, and that as children get older their behavior starts to reflect the norms of their broader society," said co-author Dorsa Amir, a former post-doctoral researcher in McAuliffe's lab and now an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience and Duke University. For instance, adults across cultures have different ideas of what constitutes 'fair' behavior. Dorsa Amir, assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience, Duke University They designed four different child-friendly activities to measure fairness, trustworthiness, forgiveness, and honesty. For example, in the fairness activity, children used an intuitive wooden apparatus to make decisions about whether to accept or reject uneven divisions of candies between themselves and a peer. The team also identified three cooperative strategies – maximization, generic cooperation, and partner-contingent cooperation – that become more prevalent with age and differ across societies. McAuliffe said the study, undertaken with funding from the John Templeton Foundation, built on previous work that had looked at children's sharing and fairness behavior across societies to understand a broader suite of cooperative behaviors. "By including a 'cooperative task battery' we were in a good position to explore how cooperative behaviors relate to one another," said McAuliffe, referring to the collection of activities and tasks they administered during their sessions with participants in the study. "Our lab has done a lot of work on punishment behavior, finding punishment to be a common response to transgressions across societies," she said. "Yet, here, both adults and children seemed to endorse forgiveness over punishment. It's possible that, in past work, we have overestimated how much people want punishment because we haven't given them alternative options such as forgiveness." McAuliffe and her team are working on a follow-up report from four of these same countries that looks at the mechanisms of norm transmission. "Specifically, we are comparing the influence of adult and peer models in influencing children's fairness and trustworthiness behavior," she said. "This is an important extension of the current work because it goes beyond showing that children vary in their cooperative behavior and looks at how that variation may come about."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Antibiotic resistance (AR) has steadily accelerated in recent years to become a global health crisis. University of California San Diego scientists have now applied cutting-edge genetics tools to counteract antibiotic resistance. The researchers developed a new CRISPR-based technology similar to gene drives, which are being applied in insect populations to disrupt the spread of harmful properties, such as parasites that cause malaria. The new Pro-Active Genetics (Pro-AG) tool called pPro-MobV is a second-generation technology that uses a similar approach to disable drug resistance in populations of bacteria. "With pPro-MobV we have brought gene-drive thinking from insects to bacteria as a population engineering tool," said Bier, a faculty member in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology. "With this new CRISPR-based technology we can take a few cells and let them go to neutralize AR in a large target population." In 2019 Bier's lab collaborated with Professor Victor Nizet's group (UC San Diego School of Medicine) to develop the initial Pro-AG concept, in which a genetic cassette is introduced and copied between the genomes of bacteria to inactivate their antibiotic-resistant components. The cassette launches itself into an AR gene carried on plasmids, circular types of DNA that replicate within cells, thereby restoring sensitivity of the bacteria to antibiotic treatments. Building upon this idea, Bier and his colleagues developed a follow-on system that spreads the antibiotic CRISPR cassette components via conjugal transfer, which is similar to mating in bacteria. They demonstrated the process working within bacterial biofilms, which are communities of microorganisms that contaminate various surfaces and can be extremely difficult to remove under conventional cleaning methods. Biofilms also contribute to the spread of disease and are created in the majority of infections that lead to serious disease, in part because biofilms help combat antibiotics by creating a protective layer of cells that is difficult for antibiotics to diffuse through. The new technology therefore carries potential in health care settings, environmental remediation and microbiome engineering. The biofilm context for combatting antibiotic resistance is particularly important since this is one of the most challenging forms of bacterial growth to overcome in the clinic or in enclosed environments such as aquafarm ponds and sewage treatment plants. Ethan Bier, Professor, UC San Diego School of Biological Sciences The researchers also found that components of the active genetic system could be carried and delivered by bacteriophage, or phage, which are viruses that are natural evolutionary competitors of bacteria. Phage are being specially engineered to combat antibiotic resistance by evading bacterial defenses and inserting disruptive factors inside cells. pPro-MobV elements, the researchers envision, would work in conjunction with such engineered phage viruses. This active genetic platform also can incorporate a highly efficient process known as homology-based deletion as a safety measure to remove the gene cassette if desired. Brain microphysiological systems are reshaping in vitro neurotoxicity testing through functional validation and advanced disease modeling. Targeted protein degradation presents a promising strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, focusing on innovative approaches for gram-negative bacteria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the millions of people living with end‑stage kidney disease, hemodialysis is more than a medical procedure, it is a thrice‑weekly lifeline that keeps the body's chemistry in balance. Yet even with decades of clinical experience and numerous technological advances, one stubborn challenge persists: determining how much fluid to remove during treatment without tipping a patient into dangerous instability. Too little fluid removal leaves patients overloaded, too much can trigger sudden drops in blood pressure, cramping, nausea, or even early termination of the session. These events are not rare, in fact, they affect nearly half of all dialysis patients. A new pilot study from Boston University and Boston Medical Center suggests a promising way to address this longstanding problem. By using a custom optical device that illuminates the skin and underlying muscle with near‑infrared light, the researchers captured real‑time changes in tissue water content and other physiological signals during hemodialysis. As reported in Biophotonics Discovery, their research results point to a future in which clinicians may be able to anticipate adverse events earlier, and intervene before a patient becomes unstable. Current monitoring tools provide only a partial picture of what happens during fluid removal. For example, devices like Crit‑Line track how the blood's hematocrit changes as water is removed from circulation. When this delicate balance breaks down, when fluid leaves the bloodstream faster than it can be replenished, patients become vulnerable to hypotension and other complications. Because existing tools cannot reliably detect this mismatch in real time, clinicians often rely on patient symptoms or heuristic rules to adjust treatment. The researchers created a compact device that combines two forms of near‑infrared spectroscopy: frequency‑domain (FD) and broadband continuous‑wave (CW), to gather complementary information. Patients continued their dialysis as usual while the device recorded continuous optical data. Their medical histories reflected a typical inpatient dialysis population, including high rates of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Researchers logged any signs of trouble including cramping, dizziness, vomiting, headache, shortness of breath, or hypotension, and tagged these events in the data stream. The researchers also found that reduced scattering amplitude, a parameter reflecting how light interacts with tissue structure, differed between groups. This lines up with earlier work showing that tissue scattering decreases as hydration increases. Together, water ratio and scattering measures formed a signature that could discriminate between the two groups. A multifeature model using three optical parameters classified subjects with strong accuracy, better than any single marker alone. Crit‑Line, the widely used optical hematocrit monitor, did not distinguish between stable and unstable patients in this cohort in a statistically significance manner. Likewise, systolic blood pressure only showed a difference because most complications were hypotension‑related, and by the time blood pressure drops, an adverse event is already underway. This points to possible future use as an early warning tool, rather than a reactive one. Yet clinics have few objective, real‑time tools for assessing the physiological mechanisms that actually drive those complications. This study is small, but it opens a meaningful path forward: Beyond dialysis, tools that measure tissue hydration could help manage edema in heart failure, monitor weight‑loss interventions, or support athletes tracking hydration status. Fluid removal during hemodialysis will always be a balancing act. But with the ability to monitor tissue water in real time, clinicians may soon have a clearer view of the underlying physiology that shapes each patient's response. This optical approach doesn't just add another number to the chart, it opens a new window into how the body manages fluid, second by second. For patients whose treatments can suddenly shift from routine to dangerous, that insight could make all the difference. Suciu, D., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from CU Anschutz scientists suggests that staying physically active after heart rhythm treatment may significantly reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) returning, offering patients a simple, low-cost way to support long-term heart health. The study, published this month in the Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology, found that adults who engaged in regular, moderate physical activity after catheter ablation had markedly lower rates of AF recurrence compared with those who were less active. Atrial fibrillation often comes back even after a technically successful ablation, which can be frustrating for patients and clinicians alike. Our findings suggest that moderate exercise for 30 minutes three times a week, something most people can realistically do, may help protect against recurrence after undergoing catheter ablation." Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder worldwide and is linked to a higher risk of stroke, heart failure and repeated hospitalizations. The CU Anschutz study examined whether post-procedure lifestyle behaviors could influence outcomes. Researchers analyzed data from 163 adults who underwent catheter ablation and tracked both their physical activity levels using wearables and heart rhythm outcomes over time. "For many patients, recovery after ablation raises questions about what they can do beyond medications or procedures to reduce the chances of recurrent AF," Garg said. "This study suggests that physical activity may directly support the durability of AF treatment." The researchers also observed that regular physical activity is associated with better blood pressure control, improved sleep, mood and weight management, all of which are known contributors to heart rhythm stability. "Exercise should be part of the post-ablation conversation," Garg said. "It's one of the few interventions patients can control themselves that may meaningfully affect their long-term recovery." The study's authors emphasized that patients should always consult their healthcare provider before beginning or changing an exercise routine, particularly following a heart procedure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rice University bioengineer Antonios Mikos is part of a team of researchers led by the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine awarded up to $24.8 million over five years to help address the nation's growing organ donor shortage by bioprinting on-demand kidney tissues. The new funding, from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), will enable the team to produce bioprinted, vascularized kidney tissue that augments renal function in patients suffering from kidney disease. "These are highly complex materials that have to not only be able to mimic the tissue microenvironment but that can also sustain cells over their culture period prior to them being implanted." The task will involve developing a library of bioinks that can be adapted to different patients and also vascularizing the 3D-printed constructs to enable their long-term maintenance and function in the body. PRINT will use state-of-the-art bioprinting technology and a regenerative medicine approach to 3D-print personalized, on-demand human organs that do not require immunosuppressive drugs. In addition, transplanted organs last about 15 to 23 years on average and require immunosuppressive drugs for life. "Just as tissue engineering is considered a convergent science that requires the convergence of many different disciplines, ARPA-H funding mechanisms like PRINT allow for the convergence of different laboratories, different institutions that contribute different expertise needed to address a major health care problem ⎯ in this case, kidney disease," said Mikos, the Louis Calder Professor of Bioengineering and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and director of the Biomaterials Lab, the Center for Excellence in Tissue Engineering and the J.W. Cox Laboratory for Biomedical Engineering at Rice. Mikos said the project builds on a long history of collaboration between researchers at Rice, Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine and the University of Maryland. Other program partners include PrintBio Inc. and the University of Texas at El Paso. The project also includes plans to develop a scalable pathway for the manufacturing and commercialization of personalized bioprinted organs and tissues. What we are trying to do with PRINT is extraordinarily hard. It requires major breakthroughs in cell manufacturing, bioreactor design and 3D-printing technology to reliably build organs that function like the real thing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most promising approaches, known as immune checkpoint blockade, works by releasing molecular "brakes" on T cells. This allows them to better recognize and attack cancer cells. While these therapies can be very effective for some patients, many solid tumors, including most forms of breast cancer, remain largely unaffected. Cancer Center at Illinois (CCIL) Program Co-leader Erik Nelson and his research group are working to understand why these treatments fail. Elevated blood concentrations of cholesterol have long been linked to cancer outcomes. In a new study, they found that a protein called ABCA1 is involved in transporting cholesterol out of a type of immune cell called macrophages, and in so-doing shifts them to an "attack cancer" mode. Immune based therapies have revolutionized how we can treat cancer, basically taking the brakes off of a type of immune cell called T cells so they can attack cancer. While this approach works well for some patients, many so-called solid tumors fail to respond or develop resistance mechanisms." They focused on myeloid immune cells, particularly macrophages, which are abundant in many solid tumors and play a major role in shaping the tumor environment. "Here, we find that ABCA1, which is a protein that transports cholesterol from inside the cell to the outside, plays a big role in directing how myeloid cells, specifically macrophages, behave," Nelson said. "When we engineer macrophages to express more ABCA1, they become much better at fighting cancer and supporting the other immune cell type, T cells." Immune checkpoint blockers are currently approved for only one subtype of breast cancer, and even among those patients, only about a quarter respond to treatment. These cells can suppress immune activity, promote new blood vessel growth that feeds tumors, and limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy. "Tumors grew quicker in these mice, and perhaps even more importantly, immune based therapies failed to control tumors in these mice." The researchers also found strong evidence that these mechanisms matter in humans. In patient tumor samples, higher levels of ABCA1 in myeloid immune cells were associated with increased numbers of cancer killing T cells and improved outcomes for breast cancer patients. "This tells us that what we are seeing in the lab is relevant to patients with cancer," Nelson said. "It gives us confidence that targeting ABCA1 could be a meaningful new strategy for cancer immunotherapy." Looking ahead, Nelson's team is now focused on developing ways to increase ABCA1 activity specifically in tumor associated macrophages and testing whether these approaches can be combined with existing immune therapies. Cholesterol efflux protein, ABCA1, supports anticancer functions of myeloid immune cells.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wistar scientists have combined a promising cancer therapy with a molecule that targets tumors to treat cancer more effectively. The new approach could be a way to deliver treatment directly to tumors at higher doses, while reducing side effects in healthy tissue. An Aurora kinase A (AURKA) inhibitor is viewed as a lethal synthetic molecule in cancer therapy, but the problem is you can't dose it high enough, because then it starts to spill over and target normal cells, causing toxicity. By using this cancer-targeting approach, we can direct this molecule, which is already in clinical use, to cancer cells, increasing its exposure in the tumor itself." Salvino is professor in the Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis Program at the Ellen and Ronald Caplan Cancer Center, and scientific director of Wistar's Molecular Screening & Protein Expression Facility. The new chimeric molecule takes two existing molecules and attaches them together like LEGO blocks to make what's called a small molecule drug conjugate. One half of the conjugate, an Aurora kinase A (AURKA) inhibitor, works by blocking a protein that controls cell division and helps tumors to grow. While this molecule has shown promise in clinical trials, it's also caused toxic side effects that limited its use. The second half is a molecule that binds to a protein called HSP90, which cancer cells produce to help them survive stress. By targeting HSP90, which is found at high levels in cancer cells, researchers hoped to show that they could concentrate the compound within the tumor, preferentially over healthy tissue. In a proof-of-concept study, they demonstrated that the new chimeric molecule successfully binds to both the AURKA and HSP90 proteins. When researchers tested it in cell samples taken from multiple cancer types, including head and neck, lung, and melanoma, they found that it stopped the cancer cells from dividing and replicating, eventually causing the cells to die. They found that it concentrated inside the tumors at levels sometimes 10 times higher than when the original AURKA inhibitor was used on its own. The compound was also well tolerated in preclinical models, with no significant toxicity. "Our approach will take an existing compound and improve its pharmacokinetic properties, enhancing its exposures in the tumor." They also want to develop the new chimeric molecule into a formulation that can be given orally. NN-01-195, a novel conjugate of HSP90 and AURKA inhibitors, effectively targets solid tumors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American women now have the option of screening for cervical cancer at home, using newly approved self-collection tools. While experts hope this will increase uptake in the under-screened population, a first-of-its kind study by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center found the majority (60.8%) still prefer to see a medical professional in-clinic. The study, published today in JAMA Network Open, also revealed that marginalized were more likely to prefer at-home self-sampling, and women with low income and those who do not trust the health care system were more likely to be uncertain about which option to choose. Of 2,300 screening-eligible women, just 20.4% prefer to screen for cervical cancer at home, and 18.8% were unsure about their choice. By expanding screening options and pairing them with targeted education, we can empower more women to participate in screening in a way that fits their lives." Sanjay Shete, Ph.D., lead author, deputy division head of Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences While cervical cancer screening rates have increased over the last 25 years, there has been a shift since the COVID-19 pandemic toward decreased annual screening coverage. Experts say there is still a need to improve cervical cancer screening uptake among under-screened populations, and this study suggests that these groups would benefit from having options that best fit their preference. The most reported reasons for preferring at-home self-sampling were privacy (54.9%), time constraints (35.1%) and avoiding embarrassment (33.4%). Both the Health Resources and Services Administration and the American Cancer Society have adopted home-based self-collection for cervical cancer screening. "Major public health and medical organizations should consider updating their recommendations to include home-based self-sampling. This policy shift could play a critical role in reducing screening inequities and improving uptake among populations that have historically been underserved," said co-author Joël Fokom Domgue, M.D., senior researcher of Epidemiology. This cross-sectional study was based on data from the 2024 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults in the civilian population. This study included all women aged 21-65 who completed the survey and were eligible for cervical cancer screening as per U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What makes it more dangerous is the ability of cancer cells to move quickly through the body, allowing them to invade surrounding tissues. Researchers from Kyushu University set out to fill this gap and unveiled a new physical process that helps cancer cells move rapidly throughout the body. The findings of this study, published in The EMBO Journal on February 3, 2026, reveal how water pressure generated inside cells aids in cancer cell migration. While existing therapies can target this adhesion-based movement, cancer cells evade this treatment approach by following a different strategy: amoeboid migration. In this mode, cells form temporary bulges called blebs, enabling them to squeeze through tight spaces without attaching to their surroundings. For a long time, it was believed that bleb expansion was driven by internal pressure-until research by Ikenouchi in 2021 overturned that assumption. In our previous research, we observed that expanding blebs show unique cytoplasmic properties such as high levels of calcium ions, suggesting that blebs are not just passive, pressure-driven protrusions but specialized cellular compartments." Professor Junichi Ikenouchi, Kyushu University's Faculty of Medical Sciences Furthermore, they also noticed significantly higher levels of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) present in the cells, prompting a critical question: does CaMKII have a more direct physical role in shaping cells and their movements? As the researchers probed deeper into bleb dynamics, they discovered that CaMKII does much more than act as a signaling protein. In response to this surge, CaMKII present in the cell undergoes a structural change and assembles into a large protein supercomplex together with other molecules. Once formed, this supercomplex behaves like an osmotic engine, creating a concentration gradient that draws water into the bleb through osmosis. This newly discovered process was named "CODE" which stands for "CaMKII-based osmotically-driven deformation." "Surprisingly, cells can generate force simply by changing how proteins are distributed inside them," says Ikenouchi. These findings hold great significance in molecular biology, as most advanced cancer cells rely on amoeboid movement. In such cases, treatment becomes difficult; most current therapies only target cell proliferation or adhesion-dependent migration. Uncovering the CODE mechanism opens new avenues for therapies that specifically target amoeboid movement. Apart from cancer, understanding how cells generate force through changes in their physical properties could also have implications for regenerative medicine, developmental biology, and tissue engineering. This research may inspire new therapeutic strategies that target cellular mechanics rather than classical signaling pathways, opening the door to more robust and effective treatments. CaMKII nucleates an osmotic protein supercomplex to induce cellular bleb expansion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Importantly, up to 80% of patients with long-term pain also experience anxiety or depression. This creates a vicious cycle that not only worsens prognosis and quality of life but also poses significant challenges for treating both the pain and the accompanying emotional disorders. Current treatments mainly focus on pain intensity, while emotional symptoms often remain inadequately addressed. Acupuncture, an ancient Chinese practice, is now widely recognized and integrated into global pain management. It offers a drug-free option for conditions such as chronic back pain, migraines, and arthritis. High-quality clinical trials have further confirmed its efficacy in treating both acute and chronic pain. Beyond pain relief, acupuncture also demonstrates certain advantages in managing pain-induced negative emotions. Previous studies have indicated that the prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in integrating pain perception and emotional regulation, yet it remains unclear whether acupuncture exerts its effects by modulating the prefrontal cortex. Given these challenges, there is a pressing need to investigate whether and how acupuncture intervention influences the prefrontal cortex and modulates specific neuronal circuits, thereby alleviating pain-induced emotional disturbances. The study provides direct neural evidence connecting acupuncture-based intervention with brain circuit modulation. A battery of behavioral tests—including open field, elevated plus maze, forced swimming, and tail suspension assays—revealed that nerve injury induced persistent anxiety- and depression-like behaviors alongside heightened pain sensitivity. Electroacupuncture was then applied daily for seven days at specific hindlimb acupoints ("Yanglingquan" (GV34) and "Xuanzhong" (GB34)) commonly used in pain treatment. Results showed that electroacupuncture markedly improved emotional behaviors without affecting overall locomotion, indicating a genuine anxiolytic and antidepressant effect rather than a motor artifact. Immunofluorescence analysis further confirmed increased neuronal activation following electroacupuncture, demonstrating that excitatory prefrontal neurons are a critical neural substrate linking pain relief and emotional regulation. "Chronic pain is not merely a sensory experience—it fundamentally alters emotional brain circuits," said one of the study's senior authors. By restoring the activity of this circuit, emotional symptoms such as anxiety and depression can be alleviated. This provides a biological explanation for the clinical observation that acupuncture improves both pain and mood, and highlights its potential as a complementary strategy for treating complex pain-related disorders." These results have important implications for the treatment of chronic pain conditions complicated by emotional disorders. By identifying a specific prefrontal neural circuit involved in pain-induced anxiety and depression, the study opens new avenues for precision neuromodulation therapies. Electroacupuncture, as a low-risk and non-pharmacological intervention, may help reduce reliance on antidepressants or opioids, particularly in patients with comorbid pain and mood disorders. More broadly, the findings support an integrative neuroscience framework in which traditional therapeutic techniques are evaluated and optimized through modern brain circuit analysis, potentially accelerating their translation into evidence-based clinical practice.
