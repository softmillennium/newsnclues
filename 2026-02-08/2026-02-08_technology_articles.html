                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following last year's trend of showcasing AI in multimillion-dollar ad spots, the 2026 Super Bowl advertisements took it a step further by leveraging AI both to create the commercials and to promote the latest AI products. Love it or hate it, the technology has become a star in its own right, alongside the latest movie trailers and snack brands. Let's explore the biggest moments from this year's Big Game ads, which featured everything from robots and AI glasses to a touch of drama involving tech founders. Vodka brand Svedka went with what it touts as the first “primarily” AI-generated national Super Bowl spot. The 30-second ad, titled “Shake Your Bots Off,” features the company's robot character, Fembot, and her new companion, Brobot, dancing their circuits off at a human party. Silverside AI is the same team behind recent AI-generated Coca-Cola commercials that sparked controversy. ​It's a bold move to debut AI-generated content during the Super Bowl, an event known for star-studded, high-production ads. But not to Claude.” Rather than focus solely on Claude's features, it poked fun at the idea of your helpful AI assistant suddenly turning into a hype man for “Step Boost Maxx” insoles, for example. OpenAI's Sam Altman fired back on social media, calling the ad “clearly dishonest.” So while we didn't get any more Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef this time around, maybe we did get our own AI, nerdy version of it. Meta spotlighted its Oakley-branded AI glasses, designed for sports, workouts, and adventures, including extreme scenarios such as chasing down a departing plane. Famous faces like IShowSpeed and filmmaker Spike Lee made appearances, demonstrating capabilities like filming a basketball dunk in slow motion, posting hands-free to Instagram, and other advanced features. The tech giant also featured its wearable AI tech in last year's Super Bowl ad to spark consumer interest, with stars like Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner showing off Ray-Ban Meta glasses. The commercial exaggerates common fears about AI, with Hemsworth humorously accusing Alexa+ of plotting against him. Scenes included Alexa+ closing the garage door on his head and shutting the pool cover while he swam, each mishap escalating in absurdity. Alexa+ had been available in early access for over a year and officially launched to all U.S. users on Wednesday. Ring's commercial spotlighted its “Search Party” feature, which leverages AI and a community network to reunite lost pets with their owners. The ad followed a young girl searching for her dog Milo, illustrating how users can upload a pet's photo to the app, where AI works to identify matches and taps into nearby cameras and the broader Ring user community to help track down missing furry family members. Google's ad showcased the Nano Banana Pro, its newest image-generation model. In the spot, Baumgartner uses Ramp's AI-powered spend management platform to “multiply” himself, effortlessly tackling a mountain of work. And, as a playful nod to his TV persona, Baumgartner is seen carrying a pot of chili in the ad, referencing Kevin's legendary scene where he brings his cherished recipe for his co-workers to try, only to disastrously spill the entire pot on the floor. Rippling, the cloud-based workforce management platform, went all in on its first-ever Super Bowl ad. The company tapped comedian Tim Robinson in a spot about onboarding an alien monster, poking fun at HR headaches and the promise of AI automation. Health company Hims & Hers used its Super Bowl spot to address disparities in healthcare access. In recent years, the company launched an AI-powered “MedMatch” tool to deliver more personalized treatment recommendations, especially for mental health and wellness. Wix's biggest competitor, Squarespace, also has a Super Bowl ad this year. Squarespace's ad has a more cinematic approach starring Emma Stone and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.

Over the years, we've seen plenty of attempts by DIY modders and PC enthusiasts to shrink gaming PCs down to the size of traditional game consoles. This is often done with the goal of enjoying PC gaming on a large TV from the comfort of their couch. From custom small form factor builds to console-inspired enclosures, the idea of a living room-friendly PC isn't exactly new. Now there have been similar projects in the past where modders have managed to install an entire PC inside the chassis of an old console. But, as pointed out in the video, most of them rely on an external power brick and / or integrated graphics. To make the project a bit more challenging, PhasedTech set out to use an internal power supply, a discrete graphics card, as well as an optical disc drive so the system could functionally mimic the original console. Additionally, the build avoids the use of glue, ensuring that all components are properly mounted and bolted in for a more professional finish. The modder used a mini-ITX motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU cooled by a Noctua NH-L9i, along with 16GB of DDR4 ultra-low-profile memory. They then shaved off some internal supports to make room for the hardware, followed by drilling a few holes to secure the power supply and motherboard using standoffs. Using a custom right-angle mount and screws, a USB Type-A extender cable is installed at the front of the console chassis. By making use of two threaded mounting points and some plastic grooves inside the top chassis, the modder 3D-printed a two-part custom bracket to securely mount the disc drive, GPU riser cable, power button, and eject button in place. Notably a four-lane PCIe riser cable is used due to the limited internal space as opposed to a traditional 16-lane cable. The system boots into Windows without any issues, but due to the relatively low-end hardware, it is best suited for less resource-intensive and eSports titles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Super Bowl LX rolls around this year, all eyes will be on the NFL. In addition to football fans and people who just want to mindlessly watch advertisements, there will be an armada of cameras fixing their gaze on Levi Stadium in San Francisco. Those “eyes” are dedicated to capturing each and every solitary moment of the sport's most pivotal day—big plays, fan reactions, and any potential Janet Jackson-style “wardrobe malfunctions,” just to name a few. This year's impending Super Bowl will be just the first ever to feature Sony's Hawk-Eye tech, a camera system that uses a half dozen 8K cameras installed in the catwalks of NFL stadiums to assist on-field officials with the critical task of determining the line to gain. For those not fluent in NFL lingo, that's the line—the yellow one superimposed on TV broadcasts—that teams need to reach in order to keep their offense on the field. After footage is captured by the cameras, it's then sent to the NFL's Art McNally GameDay Central Officiating Center in New York. From there, on-field officials are informed of the distance, while virtual recreations of those measurements are made to be shown to the in-stadium audience and anyone watching on TV in real time. It might not sound like a lot, but for diehard fans and the teams in the game, it's a critical facet in determining whether, after 22 weeks of grueling televised violence, a team walks away with the Lombardi Trophy and some shiny new rings or with empty hands and a demoralizing start to the offseason. Obviously, with those kinds of stakes, the pressure is on Sony for its systems to really get things right. “Working with Sony allows us to flawlessly deliver every angle, replay, and on-field moment to viewers watching around the world.” In tennis, the tech is famously used for automated line-calling, determining whether the ball is in or out, and deciding which player gets awarded points. In this capacity, the tech is apparently accurate within an impressive 5mm. In soccer, Hawk-Eye can be of equal importance, since it's used to determine whether the entire ball has crossed the line and whether a goal has been scored—not a minor task in a sport that is often decided by one score. The NFL also implemented Hawk-Eye to assist with replay assistance in 2021, though that stopped short of determining concrete stuff on a consistent basis, like the line to gain. It's clear that professional sports have faith in the efficacy of Hawk-Eye for making critical decisions, but as important as Sony's cameras have become, there is one thing they still do not do in the NFL; neither Sony, nor the NFL uses Hawk-Eye to actually spot the ball. It may seem odd not to use this advanced tech to potentially improve the accuracy of the game, but according to former NFL referee Jeff Bergman, who worked as an NFL line judge for 30 years until retiring in 2023, things aren't as straightforward as they seem. “Spotting the ball is an art,” Bergman tells Gizmodo. So, there are four or five different things you have to be aware of.” And as to whether Hawk-Eye is actually speeding the game up, Bergman, who was officiating in the NFL when Hawk-Eye was merely being tested on replay assistance in 2021, is even more skeptical. Well, on the field, we know it's less than a foot.” Sony did not wish to comment for this story. Imperfect or not, there's a vocal constituent of people who would like to see Hawk-Eye, or technology like it, go further. Take a stroll through Reddit, YouTube, or online sports punditry, and you'll see plenty of feedback urging the NFL to introduce more technology like Hawk-Eye to make rulings more consistent and accurate. Even Bergman, a skeptic though he may be, is open to the expansion of technology in the NFL, telling Gizmodo, “Any type of additional intel that you can get as an official to help you make decisions is something that should be really embraced.” Here's what NFL executive, Kimberly Fields, told the Associated Press almost exactly a year ago when asked about Hawk-Eye: So I think it's probably been a point of confusion around what the technology can and can't do. There will always be a human element because of the forward progress conversation.” The NFL does have other technologies outside of Hawk-Eye tech that seem promising, but those are also imperfect for the time being. While those chips are capable of determining ball position, they fall short of being able to measure forward progress, which is the football terminology for how far a player gets before being officially ruled down. Then again, so could a shoddy spot by the referee. Bergman, for his part, says he'd like to see technology be used to make officials better at their jobs, not replace their say on the field entirely. “I'm huge on technology, but it has to be able to be as reliable as the people on the field, and it has to expedite the play, not slow it down.” Gizmodo reached out to another provider of technology to the NFL, Catapult, which makes similar player-tracking tech that can monitor metrics in practices, determining things like speed and injury risk, but didn't exactly get a straight answer on whether a ball-spotting future for technology is a real possibility. “The sports industry has made great strides, but we've only just begun to unlock the power of performance tech,” Matt Bairos, Chief Product Officer at Catapult, said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. Coaches think, teach, and make decisions through video. That sounds grand, but not everyone is optimistic about the future of sports tech like Hawk-Eye. Bergman, retired from a life in the NFL though he may be, saw a different future on the field this year—a much longer one. The Super Bowl is almost here, so if you'd like something super to go along with it, we've got you covered. Sure, TVs and sound systems are the crux of any good Super Bowl party, but there's so much more you could do to upgrade the NFL's Big Game. The NFL and OneCourt are providing about 10 Super Bowl attendees a device that translates live gameplay into tactile feedback.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a motion to dismiss, Nvidia argues authors suing over AI training have not plausibly alleged copying of their works. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Nvidia is pushing back against claims that it trained AI models on pirated books, telling a federal court in California that its alleged contact with the library ‘Anna's Archive' doesn't amount to proof of copyright infringement. In a motion to dismiss filed January 29, the company argues that the authors behind Nazemian v Nvidia have failed to plausibly show that their specific works were downloaded or used in training, despite expanding their complaint to include new theories and datasets. The plaintiffs' amended complaint references internal discussions during which Nvidia employees allegedly sought confirmation regarding access to Anna's Archive, arguing that this amounts to evidence of unlawful use. In its motion to dismiss, Nvidia argues that the amended complaint fails to allege even the most basic elements required for a copyright infringement claim. “It's equally plausible Nvidia did not [obtain the Plaintiffs' works].” Pulling no punches, Nvidia also criticizes the plaintiffs' reliance on allegations made “on information and belief,” arguing that this approach improperly attempts to use discovery as a substitute for pleading. In several instances, Nvidia points to its own public documentation to argue that the plaintiffs' assumptions about training data are contradicted by publicly available sources. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The amended complaint also introduces a secondary liability theory tied to Nvidia's NeMo Megatron framework and its support for downloading large public datasets such as The Pile. Nvidia responds that the complaint doesn't allege a predicate act of direct infringement by any third party, which is required to sustain claims of contributory or vicarious copyright infringement.

The otherwise redundant floppy drive in this Mac Mini brain transplanted desktop looks almost perfect for spewing forth coils of thermal copy paper. The above perfectly valid answer is provided by Japanese pickle store manager and Mac enthusiast, Meinan, on X. Apparently, they were lucky enough to get this thermal printer in some kind of auction for ‘1 yen', and were looking for a good way to make use of it. We don't know how it is hooked up to the computer, but would guess it simply interfaces via USB, like printers have done for decades now. A brief glance at the display of this Mac Plus, shows that it has been seriously ungraded in the processing department too. But we don't know what happened to this aged computer before its shell was reused. It seems to be a particularly interesting cross-generation sample. Overall, the thermal printer mod is a pretty interesting one. Similarly, a Mac Mini was squeezed into the retro-shell in that project. Sadly, Action Retro didn't reuse the vestigial optical drive during that mod, which seemed like a missed opportunity.

Therefore, G.Skill's Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 C34 memory kit is worth paying attention to if you have the cash for such a hefty kit. G.Skill has always understood that premium memory deserves premium aesthetics, and the Trident Z5 Neo RGB memory modules are the perfect example. The meticulously crafted aluminum heat spreader features a matte black exterior, a complementary black brushed aluminum inset, and silver highlights, making the fin-like design stand out. At a builder-friendly 1.65 inches (42mm) tall, we expect these memory modules to slide effortlessly under even the most aggressive CPU air coolers without any clearance nightmares. Crowning each memory module is a streamlined RGB light bar with vibrant colors and illumination. G.Skill offers two alternatives for RGB customization and control: its dedicated Trident Z Lighting Control software or seamless integration with your motherboard's native RGB software. Choose the latter route, and you'll find the Trident Z5 Neo RGB fits in nicely with all the major platforms, including Asus Aura Sync, Gigabyte RGB Fusion 2.0, MSI Mystic Light Sync, and ASRock Polychrome Sync. At the heart of this kit are two 64GB DDR5 memory modules, each with a dual-rank design, which is essential for achieving this level of capacity. In its default stock configuration, the memory modules operate at DDR5-5600 with relaxed 46-45-45-90 timings to ensure maximum compatibility across a wide range of system configurations. G.Skill includes only a single overclocking profile, conveniently available in both Intel XMP 3.0 and AMD EXPO formats. For additional details on timings and frequency choices, refer to our PC Memory 101 feature and the How to Shop for RAM article. The Corsair iCUE Link Titan 360 RX LCD CPU liquid-cooling solution efficiently maintains optimal temperatures for both the Arrow Lake and Zen 5 processors, ensuring efficient thermal management across platforms. The MSI GeForce RTX 4080 16GB Gaming X Trio efficiently handles demanding graphics workloads, preventing any bottlenecks during our gaming RAM benchmarks. The TeamGroup A440 Lite PCIe 4.0 SSD balances performance and capacity, delivering 2TB of ultra-fast storage with speeds up to 7,400 MB/s—perfect for Windows 11 24H2 installations, benchmarking software, and gaming applications.

The Corsair RM1000x Shift ATX 3.0 power supply delivers reliable and ample power to our test systems, directly supporting the GeForce RTX 4080 via its native 16-pin (12VHPWR) cable. The Streacom BC1 open-air test bench offers flexible, tool-free accommodation for all hardware components, streamlining assembly and component swaps. It shows that performance can vary depending on the workload. Sometimes you already know how an overclock will likely turn out, but it's still fun to push memory beyond the manufacturer's specifications. On this occasion, we overclocked the memory from DDR5-6000 to DDR5-6333 while maintaining the memory timings at 34-44-44-96, with DRAM voltage increased from 1.35V to 1.45V. The other timings, however, responded well with 1.45V applied. We managed to decrease the tRCD and tRP by four clock cycles and the tRAS by 12 clock cycles, a solid result overall. From a compatibility standpoint, DDR5-6000 is more likely to run perfectly on AMD's platform without any performance penalty than DDR5-6400. That's why many budget-conscious buyers choose DDR5-6000, and it's where the Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 C34 excels. G.Skill's memory kit delivers the complete package: beautiful aesthetics, good performance, and more than generous capacity. On the bright side, Newegg generously includes a $50 Starbucks gift card so you can “drink coffee while you game.” Jokes aside, the Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 C34 is an excellent memory kit that's worth every dollar once pricing stabilizes.

In the years since SpaceX launched its first batch of Starlinks back in 2019, numerous competitors have entered the market, including two you've almost definitely heard about lately: Amazon Leo and Blue Origin's newly announced TeraWave. Starlink, Amazon Leo, and TeraWave are far from the only players in this rapidly growing industry, but they stand out because of their massive financial backings and the ambitious strategic visions of their respective billionaire owners. The first thing to understand is that these networks came on the scene at different times, and their parent companies have chosen different deployment strategies. As a result, they are in various stages of development. SpaceX was first to market with its satellite project, announcing it in 2015. Since the start of deployment in 2019, the company has rapidly built up the Starlink megaconstellation through hundreds of launches aboard its Falcon 9 rocket, with 9,555 Starlinks currently active and providing broadband internet to millions worldwide. Amazon unveiled plans to develop a competitor—called Project Kuiper at the time—about one month before SpaceX launched its first batch of operational Starlinks, “but was much slower to really ramp up and start production,” Kevin Bell, senior vice president of the Engineering and Technology Group (ETG) at The Aerospace Corporation, told Gizmodo. While SpaceX's approach to Starlink development prioritized rapid iteration and deployment, Amazon took its time finalizing the design of its satellites and conducted more extensive prototype testing. Because Amazon does not have its own rockets to support satellite deployment, it partners with launch providers—including SpaceX—to build its constellation. The company launched its first operational batch of satellites aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket in April 2025. The company will presumably use its New Glenn rocket to launch its satellites, but that has not yet been confirmed. According to the announcement, the TeraWave constellation will ultimately scale to 5,408 satellites situated in low-Earth orbit (where Starlink and Amazon Leo reside) and in medium-Earth orbit. That's larger than Amazon Leo's planned deployment of 3,236 satellites, but if Musk gets his way, Starlink will eclipse both of Bezos's constellations. The Federal Communications Commission recently approved a SpaceX application to launch up to a million more Starlinks for the purpose of building an orbital data center. Broadly speaking, the satellite internet industry serves two types of customers: enterprise and individual users. “While Starlink is really kind of spread across all of them, Amazon and TeraWave have chosen—at least initially—to position themselves towards the higher end,” Bell said. Starlink indeed serves a diverse array of users, from individuals to the American government. Its primary customer base, however, consists of people living in rural and remote areas who lack access to reliable, high-speed internet. Amazon Leo ultimately plans to target that market, but its initial phase of deployment will serve select enterprise, government, and telecommunications customers. “One of the big differences there is that, typically, an enterprise would negotiate a service level agreement—so there is a requirement that the company be able to provide a certain level of speed, a certain level of capacity,” Tom Stroup, president of the Satellite Industry Association, told Gizmodo. By comparison, Starlink and Amazon Leo offer speeds ranging from hundreds of megabits to around 1 gigabit per second, which is suitable for individuals and some enterprise customers but not tailored toward high-capacity backhaul or large-scale enterprise operations. As these networks grow, the satellite internet industry is undergoing a rapid transformation. Competition between them—and their many other competitors—will continue to drive innovation, bringing faster speeds, higher capacity, and broader coverage to users around the world. “We're just iterating much more quickly than ever before.” Even with the full rollout of Amazon's Alexa+ and Google's Gemini for Home, it feels like we're still shouting into the void. The paper is reportedly cutting roughly a third of its staff while its billionaire owner sits on a $261 billion fortune. In a newly filed FCC application, Musk's SpaceX outlines plans to launch a data center constellation of up to 1 million satellites.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether sitting in class, a meeting, or an interview, I've never been fond of taking notes, and I'm far from alone. Not only does the process of scribbling something down cause me to miss what was said immediately after, but I also suffer from awful handwriting, meaning that I can rarely read the notes anyway. Recording interviews has long been a solution, but transcribing interviews is another step (with extra cost) that can leave you with thousands of words of material to sift through, much of it irrelevant. AI notetakers—massively popular at CES 2026—have emerged to offer a new way of making IRL notetaking easier and faster, putting the power of AI into (or at least adjacent to) a portable device that evokes the microcassette recorder of yesteryear. As with all things AI, the jury's out on whether AI notetakers are actually useful or whether bypassing the intellectual rigor of writing down what people say is going to make us all even stupider, but at the very least I've found them to be a convenient way to capture the main points of a conversation—and helpful at keeping a record of discussions and meetings I might otherwise have promptly forgotten. For this guide, I evaluated six AI notetaker products, using them in person and online for meetings, interviews, and conference calls. In addition to “daily life” use cases, I tested each one by recording the same prerecorded presentation to use as a control. (I won't identify it by name to mitigate the risk of companies attempting to tune their AI models for that specific dialog.) An onboard microphone records the discussion, transcribing all that is said on the fly, then beams it to a companion app on your smartphone. When the discussion is finished, the transcription is uploaded to the cloud for AI processing, where it is crunched and then turned into outline form, often featuring AI-selected quotes from the discussion, action items, and other takeaways designed to make sense out of lengthy, meandering meetings. You don't need a physical device to AI-ify your notes. Services like Bluedot and Otter.ai, ubiquitous on Zoom calls these days, can do the job from your phone or computer. On Pixel phones, Google's Recorder app has been offering transcription and summarizations for several years, and Apple's Voice Memos app can do the same if you have an iPhone with Apple Intelligence. But physical gadgets are handy for complicated in-person situations where the speaker is far away or difficult to hear, or where you want to use your phone for something else besides its voice recorder function. Just drop a notetaker where it's convenient, and the rest is taken care of. More advanced systems like the $1,600 Vibe Bot are also available for conference room settings, working as a sort of permanent stenographer for business meetings. Every AI notetaker pushes a paid subscription plan, and while all offer a stripped-down, no-cost tier, the utility of these plans varies greatly. The slim device, at 28 grams, is small enough to fit in a wallet or attach unobtrusively with the included magnetic ring to the back of your handset (note: it requires a special USB dongle to charge). The 64 GB of storage space and a 45-hour battery life aren't massive, but both should be more than enough to handle a full week of interviews without offloading or recharging, all processed through OpenAI's GPT-5 and Google's Gemini. This makes it a lot more foolproof than other notetakers, which offer nothing more than a colored LED to tell you if it's on. It's not a full solution if you need a complete, direct translation, but if you just need the gist of a foreign news story or speech, Comulytic can uniquely handle it. It was also the only device to correctly transcribe a punny product nickname mentioned in passing in one interview, indicating that a more sophisticated language model may be behind the scenes. It doesn't transcribe in real time, it's one of the slowest products at completing analyses, and I never got its “fast transfer” mode working, which meant all recordings had to be sent to my phone via a pokey Bluetooth connection, but these are minor dings against an otherwise solid solution. Best of all, for a limited time, the company includes a generous three months of premium service at no charge. Even if you don't want to subscribe, the free plan, which offers three “deep dives” and 10 abstracts a month, is better than nothing. The eponymous Pocket is quite a bit fatter and heavier (56 grams) than Comultyic, but it offers 128 GB of storage space (new models are down to 64 GB), a beefier battery with a whopping 96 hours of recording time, and the inclusion of Claude, Gemini, and GPT-5 models. And it can attach magnetically to your phone out of the box (assuming you have a MagSafe or Qi2 smartphone). A tiny switch on the side lets you shift into a mode that can record phone calls without being on speakerphone. But I did sometimes struggle with the lone button on the Pocket, as presses sometimes wouldn't register or would cause me to tap it twice, which culminated in several two-second-long recordings being stored on the device. The tiny LED, which turns yellow when recording, is also tough to see. Pocket's free plan isn't bad—offering unlimited transcriptions, summaries, and mind maps—but it limits history to 14 days and throttles exporting to one recording at a time. It didn't help that all exported documents I made were corrupted if I opted to save them in Word format. The luxe Pocket Pro plan offers a lot of refinements (and unlimited history), but it's costly considering what you get. The 33-gram disc (no stated storage capacity, 15 hours of battery life) can live on its own or slap onto the back of your phone, and with the press of a button, it's ready to transcribe conversations in your native tongue and in the language of your choice. It remains frustrating to use, and the free plan offers only 120 minutes per month of real-time translation and meeting minutes. (Unlimited use is pricey at $25 per month or $179 a year.) It's an imperfect product, but if you have a frequent need for transcriptions of multilingual communications, it's arguably the best on the market. OSO's AI Earbuds are a quirky concept, designed to transcribe what you hear—including phone calls—rather than specifically recording the broader world. Technically, you can remove your earbuds and drop them in the middle of the conference table to record what happens in a room, but people will look at you funny. The best use case for these earbuds is to leave them in place, doing double duty as standard Bluetooth headphones and switching into AI recording mode when needed. Transcriptions are not displayed in real time, and—critically—the app is very finicky. Any hiccup (like closing the app) aborted recording in my testing. The unit can record in 100-some languages, but it can't translate from one to another. OSO's free plan is very limited (with 300 minutes per month of transcription), and even its $16 per month or $120 a year subscription only gets you 2,000 minutes per month instead of the usual unlimited service. Expect to see some competition in this space, and soon. Here are others we've tested, but we'll also be keeping an eye on upcoming new hardware from companies like Omi, Boya, Mobvoi, and SwitchBot. Transcriptions are not displayed in real time, though their eventual analysis is solid. It's a handy little device with multi-language support (though not translation), 20 hours of battery life, and 64 GB of internal storage—but it's just too costly in comparison to the field to recommend. It's far more complicated than other notetakers, though its microphone is powerful, and its analyses are fast (at least when connected to a PC).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here at WIRED, a related question has been floating around the Gear desk for some time. What's better, one all-rounder premium watch, or a varied collection garnered for exactly the same cash outlay as that piece that also covers every scenario? However, we also love to argue, and one permanent conversation starter is the concept of a one-and-done. It can't be too high-end, for the true GADA watch must be something you can wear on a hike and in the pool, as well as to a formal function. Ideally, you'd be able to wear it around a major city without fear of theft, which rules out pretty much any Rolex, but we'd still want it to be something you can take pride in among horological snobs. One and done: WIRED's current “go anywhere, do anything” timepiece is this Tudor Black Bay GMT. Some brands make this kind of sweet spot their comfort zone. We considered the Nomos Glashütte Club Sport Worldtimer, or a Longines Spirit Zulu Time—both brands with an eye on value, a reputation for quality, and an all-around approach to design that's not too polarizing. But rest assured it'll have you covered 95 percent of the time. For $4,550, you get a 41-mm stainless-steel piece with 200 meters of water resistance, a COSC-certified chronometer movement that's actually descended from the last generation of Rolex GMT movements, and a design that's smart enough to blend into most formal outfits, even though it's most at home in more casual settings. With the dual time zone functionality it's a useful travel tool, too, and Tudor's brand name and build quality mean it's respected by watch geeks the world over. First stop on our shopping list is a dive watch: something that can at least match the Black Bay's 200-meter water resistance rating and speak to its underpinnings as a daily diver. We don't need a hardcore dive monster, but something that blends style and spec. We could head to Seiko, but while the Prospex range holds a lot of phenomenal beaters, few could be said to be truly stylish. Powered by a Miyota automatic movement, the Baltic focuses on more visible premium touches, like the domed sapphire crystal and applied 3D luminous hour markers. It's water-resistant to 200 meters and available in blue, green, gray, or silver. The Black Bay isn't hulking, and our choice to opt for the fabric strap makes the whole watch a lot lighter (although it does add a millimeter in height), but it's not slim by any definition. The one time you can really get away with a quartz watch is at a formal occasion, where the chance of someone asking you for precision timing or to fiddle with your complications will be pretty low. Next, we've got space in our collection for a real everyday watch: something that's not overburdened with functionality, but that will cover us for the working day. Here we can look at a simple automatic from Hamilton, whose military-inspired Khaki Field and Pilot watches would also be worthy inclusions. However, for a more everyday staple we've gone for the Khaki Field “Murph” 38 mm ($995), a compact version of the watch Matthew McConaughey's character gives to his daughter in Interstellar. With an 80-hour power reserve and 100-meter water resistance, it's a versatile choice in its own right. We looked at Farer's 36-mm Lander IV, with its preppy color scheme and distinctive character, but ultimately we went for another cult favorite from the affordable end of the Swatch Group stable. The obvious gap in this collection is a chronograph of some kind. We could buy a MoonSwatch—in fact, at $285 we could buy two and have enough left for the Uber home—but we're on our mission to find something more substantial, more interesting, and (let's face it) more likely to stand the test of time. And that something is the Brew Super Metric ($475), a hybrid mecha-quartz chrono from a New York microbrand with more personality than every MoonSwatch put together. The unashamedly loud retro styling isn't for everyone, but we think that the cushion-shaped case and steel bracelet help broaden our stylistic options, and although it's not a pedigree mechanical chronograph, it costs less than $500 while looking and feeling like no one's idea of a compromise. That brings the challengers to a grand total of $4,380, which means we'd be able to buy a six-watch case to keep our collection in (of course it's got space for one more …) and maybe even a couple of spare straps.

Everything else is largely irrelevant.id,name,email,email_confirmed,email_confirmation_token,stripe_platform_customer_id,is_global_admin,is_ghost,created_at,anonymous_id,email_bounce_count,photo_url,publisher_agreement_accepted_at,bio,updated_at,profile_set_up_at,tos_accepted_at,email_digest_at,has_passed_captcha,import_confirmation_required,post_notification_preference,reader_installed_at,activity_items_viewed_at,dismissed_ios_app_promo_at,email_notifications_last_resumed_at,previous_name,release_group,handle,phone,bank_payment_failures,is_globally_banned,session_version A friend of mine received a very well-crafted physical letter at his home about resetting his cryto ledger.He is now very stressed because there are news about people with crypto getting abducted.And with the ledger leak they have:- his name and address- how much money he has on his ledger He is now very stressed because there are news about people with crypto getting abducted.And with the ledger leak they have:- his name and address- how much money he has on his ledger And with the ledger leak they have:- his name and address- how much money he has on his ledger - how much money he has on his ledger Surely a list of services that allow phone number logins exists so that one can avoid signing up in the first place and we would then see it in another connecting breach.</p>
