                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) prices have surged by over 3% in the past day in line with a bullish upswing across the broader crypto market. However, Ethereum on-chain data reveals the altcoin has stumbled in a range-bound market hinting at a potentially prolonged sideways movement. In a recent post on X, prominent blockchain analytics firm Glassnode reports that Ethereum is trading in a tight range between $1,548 and $1,599. This development is revealed by the asset's cost basis distribution (CBD), which shows the various price levels at which current ETH holders bought their coins. CBD is an important on-chain metric used to identify potential support or resistance levels based on the accumulation levels seen at price zones. According to Glassnode, a combined 1.53 million ETH, valued at $2.4 billion, was acquired between $1,548 and $1,599 indicating a high level of investor interest at these price regions. In particular, 793,900 ETH currently in circulation was purchased at $1,548, ultimately transforming this price floor into a major support zone for the current Ethereum price. Interestingly, Ethereum has tested both price zones over the past day failing to produce either a price breakout or breakdown. Interestingly, such price behavior would align with the broader market uncertainty amidst unstable macroeconomic factors and tightening liquidity conditions. However, the ETH market remains in a deep corrective phase with 14.56% and 18.45% losses in the last seven and thirty days, respectively. Meanwhile, the asset's daily trading volume has declined by 34.06%, indicating a fall in market participation and a potential reversal of the recent rally, which would allow Ethereum to maintain a range-bound movement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He got rich off pixelated punks — and punked the Internal Revenue Service in the process. A Pennsylvania man faces federal prison after pleading guilty to flipping more than $13 million worth of digital art from the infamous CryptoPunks NFT collection — and reporting none of it to the IRS, prosecutors said Friday. Waylon Wilcox, 45, of Dillsburg, pleaded guilty Tuesday to filing false tax returns in 2021 and 2022. Over those two years, Wilcox sold 97 CryptoPunks — tiny, pixelated avatars from a 10,000-piece digital series — and made $7.4 million one year and $4.9 million the next. But on his tax returns, he told the government he hadn't touched crypto at all — checking “no” on both years when asked about virtual asset income. CryptoPunks, created in 2017, became breakout stars of the NFT craze. “When a taxpayer sells an NFT, including a Punk, then the taxpayer must report sales proceeds and any gains or losses from the sale of the NFT on their tax return,” the Justice Department wrote in a press release Friday. Wilcox, who filed the bogus returns from his quiet home in Cumberland County, now faces up to six years in prison, plus supervised release and a hefty fine. And one more accessory, courtesy of the feds — an orange jumpsuit. It is not immediately clear when he will be sentenced, according to a review of his court records.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain is no longer just a buzzword tossed around during bull runs. With this shift comes a new breed of crypto projects that are built to handle real-world demands, not just speculative hype. For those paying attention, the question isn't whether crypto will return in 2025—it's which coins will be leading the next breakout. Spoiler alert: it's probably not the same old players. A handful of projects are already building the rails for what's coming next—systems that prioritize privacy, user control, and seamless chain interoperability. Among them is Qubetics, an ambitious Layer 1 that's quickly becoming known for its focus on Decentralized VPN infrastructure and frictionless cross-chain access. Unlike legacy coins stuck in echo chambers, these new leaders are forging use cases that extend beyond crypto natives and into the mainstream. Whether it's privacy, scalability, or Web3 usability—these powerhouses are shaping the crypto landscape in ways that actually matter. Let's break them down, starting with the one that's redefining privacy and performance. Qubetics isn't just another altcoin riding the narrative wave. It's a Web3 aggregator that brings together the best of blockchain in one platform—and at the heart of it lies a decentralized VPN solution that could revolutionize how privacy works online. Most VPNs today rely on centralized nodes, exposing users to single points of failure and censorship. For a world increasingly obsessed with digital sovereignty, this alone makes Qubetics one of the Best cryptos to Invest In right now. The project also integrates full-blown interoperability through its QubeQode IDE—a low-code development environment that lets anyone build, deploy, and scale dApps across multiple chains without switching platforms. With Qubetics, this all happens seamlessly under one roof. For solo developers, small businesses, and enterprise platforms alike, this kind of all-in-one accessibility is a game-changer—and another reason why Qubetics leads the pack of Best cryptos to Invest In right now. The presale is in its 29th stage with a token price of $0.1573, and it's raised more than $16 million so far. Over 507 million tokens have been distributed, and the community now exceeds 24,600 holders. Each presale stage runs for just 7 days before prices climb 10%, making now the smartest entry point. It's no surprise Qubetics is being labeled the best crypto presale opportunity this year. RippleNet's core use case—facilitating instant, cross-border payments—is now back in focus, and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution is already in active use across several payment corridors globally. XRP's technical model is all about speed, low fees, and finality. With transaction settlements in under 5 seconds and minimal gas costs, it remains one of the most scalable and enterprise-ready digital assets. XRP may not have the flashiest DeFi ecosystem or the loudest community anymore, but its fundamentals are solid and its real-world integrations are growing. As the demand for cross-border efficiency and regulatory-friendly crypto rails increases in 2025, XRP stands tall as a battle-tested asset with a clear use case. At the core of Cosmos' architecture is the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), which allows different chains to talk to each other, send assets, and execute commands—no bridges, no wrappers, just native-level performance. It's already being used by dozens of independent chains including Osmosis, Juno, and Cronos. With upgrades like Interchain Security and Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs), the Cosmos Hub is becoming more integral to the broader ecosystem's success. Rather than operating in isolation, chains are now being secured by ATOM while also contributing value back to its economy. This creates a new layer of tokenomics that's more sustainable than what we've seen in earlier boom cycles. Cosmos may not always dominate headlines, but it's building the foundation of Web3 infrastructure with surgical precision. For those looking past flashy metrics and into long-term architecture, ATOM is worth a deep look. Polkadot remains one of the most forward-thinking blockchain projects, thanks to its Layer 0 architecture that supports multiple parachains with specialized use cases. Built by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot takes a different approach to scaling. Instead of fighting over one congested chain, Polkadot's parachain model allows each connected blockchain to operate independently while sharing security, governance, and communication protocols. DOT, the native token, serves multiple purposes—governance, staking, bonding for parachain slots, and fee payments. Projects like Moonbeam (Ethereum compatibility), Astar (dApp support), and Acala (DeFi hub) are all active within the Polkadot ecosystem, building services that can scale beyond the limits of traditional smart contract chains. Polkadot's long-term value proposition is its ability to connect purpose-built blockchains in one cohesive network. As the crypto landscape shifts from monolithic to modular, Polkadot is poised to play an essential role in creating the multi-chain universe. There are plenty of promising blockchain projects in the space right now, but very few are solving the biggest problems with such precision and accessibility as Qubetics. While others are still catching up to the concept of interoperability, Qubetics is combining it with user privacy, real-world VPN applications, and developer-friendly tooling through its QubeQode IDE. The platform doesn't just talk decentralization—it delivers it in a way that makes onboarding seamless and growth inevitable. For anyone looking seriously at the Best cryptos to Invest In right now, Qubetics doesn't just stand out—it leads. The crypto presale is still open—but it won't stay that way for long. Qubetics delivers real interoperability and privacy through a decentralized VPN model and a cross-chain developer IDE that simplifies Web3 app deployment. Because of its innovative decentralized VPN solution, $16M+ raised, high ROI potential, and real-world blockchain application, Qubetics leads this cycle's early movers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United States President Donald Trump has exempted an array of tech products including, smartphones, chips, computers, and select electronics from tariffs, giving the tech industry a much-needed respite from trade pressures. According to the US Customs and Border Protection, storage cards, modems, diodes, semiconductors, and other electronics were also excluded from the ongoing trade tariffs. "Large-cap technology companies will ultimately come out ahead when this is all said and done," The Kobeissi letter wrote in an April 12 X post. US Customs and Border Protection announces tariff exemptions on select tech products. Crypto markets are correlated with tech stocks and could also rally as risk appetite increases on positive trade war headlines. Related: Billionaire investor would ‘not be surprised' if Trump postpones tariffs Macroeconomic trader Raoul Pal said the tariff policies were a negotiation tool to establish a US-China trade deal and characterized the US administration's trade rhetoric as "posturing." Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser argued that exempting select tech products from import tariffs would not reduce bond yields or further the Trump administration's goal of lowering interest rates. Confidence in US bonds and the US Dollar has been eroding for years and won't stop now," Keiser wrote on April 12. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been an exceptionally volatile week, but one measure may be signaling longer-term bullish sentiment for bitcoin. The sell-off in equities began on April 3, spurred by President Donald Trump's tariff-led uncertainties. Each day since then has been marked by sharp moves in both directions. In response, the S&P Volatility Index (VIX)—often called Wall Street's "fear gauge" —has surged to its highest level since last August and this is where things get interesting for bitcoin. At the time, bitcoin had reached a bottom of around $49,000. If this trendline continues to serve as reliable support, it could suggest that bitcoin might have once again found a long-term bottom.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit AUSTIN — On a Friday morning last spring, Mark Suman called out sick from his job as a senior engineering project manager at Apple and made his way downtown to a place called the Bitcoin Commons, a sort of clubhouse for enthusiasts of the world's largest cryptocurrency, situated a few blocks south of the Texas State Capitol. At the time, Suman was, in his words, "an active hobbyist," tinkering with the technology in his spare time. "I actually played around with it a bit within Apple as well," he says. "There's not a lot I can say, other than we were always exploring new technologies, and so I was playing around with some of the open-source bitcoin tools within Apple and doing some exploratory work." Suman was there for the annual 'Bitcoin Takeover' event. He had followed many of the speakers online and when he saw the gathering pop up on his feed, he took the day off to see it for himself. "I was sitting in the crowd wanting to get into the space and really build something new and build something novel," Suman recalled. Within a few months, Suman handed in his notice at Apple and with the developers he'd met, pivoted into something bigger — co-founding Open Secret, a startup reimagining how user data is stored in the cloud. Instead of relying on centralized databases, the company encrypts data to each individual user — even after it's uploaded. "There are plenty of sleepless nights," he said. He had spent years working on privacy infrastructure — tackling tough technical problems around user protection at scale — but saw a way to do it better with blockchain. "Apple likes to talk a big game about privacy," he says. "And having been there, I've seen very deep within a lot of their systems that they do care about privacy at every level." That vision — and the Commons — helped give him conviction. The builders there were all laser focused on creating something that mattered. It's an apt metaphor for the space itself. By day, it serves as a clean, open-plan coworking hub for bitcoin operators and builders. At night, it transforms into a gathering place for rogue developers and off-the-record meetups. Events here draw a blend of venture capitalists, open-source contributors, off-grid energy technicians, and Lightning engineers — developers who build software to make bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. "Bitcoin is the most important technological innovation in any of our lifetimes, and it needs its due," said Parker Lewis, one of the stewards of the Commons and the author of a new book on bitcoin called "Gradually, Then Suddenly." "And so while bitcoin has no CEO and no marketing team, we here at the Bitcoin Commons and Bitcoiners all over the world help educate people about bitcoin, why it's important, what's being built, and present a vision for the future," continued Lewis. "The vibe, it's always high signal," said Dan Lawrence, CEO of OBM, which manages energy use for industrial-scale mining farms. Lawrence said he was "thankful" that the U.S. government had become a little more pro-bitcoin under the new administration, but added, "No matter what happens anywhere, everybody here is always going to bleed bitcoin." This year, the Commons feels different — not because bitcoiners have changed, but because the world around them has. Bitcoin's price mirrored this optimism, surging to an all-time high of nearly $110,000 in January, coinciding with Trump's inauguration. The question then was, who would be next? Trump's return to the White House brought with it a full-court press of pro-bitcoin policy moves. Within his first 100 days, he'd pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and three co-founders of the BitMEX crypto exchange, established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and appointed a "crypto czar" to oversee the federal government's digital asset efforts. "I was in Nashville when Trump spoke," Suman recalled of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Tennessee, where Trump made his first major address to the crypto industry. Suman says he feels Trump has delivered on his promises to the crypto community for the most part. "I am not one who embraces politicians," Suman said. Kevin Hurley, CTO at Lightspark, says Washington's stance toward crypto appears to be shifting, with regulators like the SEC taking a less combative approach — moving away from lawsuits and toward clearer capital markets rules. Joe Kelly, CEO of Unchained — a startup that helps clients store bitcoin securely by holding their own private keys — said it's smart to be careful what you wish for when it comes to the U.S. government owning a lot of bitcoin. To date, the government's so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has underwhelmed some digital asset advocates, since it's limited to bitcoin previously seized in enforcement actions — not newly purchased assets or sovereign investment. Still, the administration has directed the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore budget-neutral ways to acquire more bitcoin. Kelly acknowledges a shift in the regulatory atmosphere, but he's also wary of premature celebration, even with big market wins like the launch of exchange-traded funds that allow investors widespread access to bitcoin. "We've had the fortune that for most of Unchained's life there wasn't an ETF," he added of the firm's efforts to educate investors on how to store their crypto. Becca Rubenfeld, COO of Anchor Watch, says regulatory movement is opening the door for bitcoin to be treated like any other financial asset. Traditional insurers don't cover bitcoin directly — they insure the infrastructure around it. But if bitcoin becomes an admitted asset on insurance company balance sheets, that changes everything. "Currently, the industry is extremely underserved," Rubenfeld told CNBC. And when customers use us for custody services, Lloyd's of London backed insurance is included in those services." Mike Schmidt, executive director of Brink, which funds open-source bitcoin developers through a nonprofit structure, emphasized the importance of supporting the engineers maintaining bitcoin's underlying infrastructure. We have strategic reserves of bitcoin being held by countries, and there's just this small group of engineers that are keeping this thing together at the code base," Schmidt said. "There's only maybe 40 full-time engineers working on this. So we want to make sure that the engineering growth can keep pace with its broader adoption." Lisa Neigut started as a back-end engineer at Cash App, where she worked on their internal bitcoin product, before moving to Blockstream and spending six years as an open-source developer on the Lightning Network. These days, she runs Bitcoin++, one of the largest technical conference series in the space, with six events planned across six countries this year. "Bitcoin++ is focused on bringing together bitcoin developers and builders to talk about what they're working on — the frontier of bitcoin," Neigut said. "You can get an idea of what bitcoin is going to look like tomorrow." That sense of momentum resonates with filmmaker Alana Mediavilla, who spent five years at Google working on films about big data and cloud infrastructure. "I understood what data centers were, I understood where it was going, and I also understood how much energy it takes to run these huge facilities that right now are running the backbone of our society." She describes the crowd in Austin as a coming together of people "very committed to their craft" — and in her view, driven more by shared ideals than by profit-seeking. "People think that it's like a get-rich-quick," she said. "Maybe those were the old days for bitcoin. "What brings them together is that they want to have better money, and they want to have a more fair world," she added. How we implement those principles — that's where the variety and spice of life comes in." A surge of new funding is also reshaping bitcoin's builder economy. The number of pre-seed deals in the space climbed 50% last year, according to research from Trammell Venture Partners, an Austin-based VC firm focused on bitcoin-native startups. Across all early-stage funding rounds, nearly $1.2 billion has been invested in bitcoin companies since 2021. The renewed interest comes after years of technical upgrades to the bitcoin protocol and growing confidence in its long-term resilience. "Serious people no longer question whether bitcoin will remain 15 or 20 years into the future," said Christopher Calicott, managing director at Trammell. "So the next question becomes: Is it possible to build what the founder is trying to achieve on bitcoin? PitchBook projects that crypto venture funding will surpass $18 billion in 2025 — nearly doubling the annual average from the previous two-year cycle. Much of that capital is flowing into bitcoin infrastructure and applications — payments, privacy tools, custody solutions — rather than the speculative trading platforms of previous cycles. This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts Bernstein tech analyst's best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks 'alpha' opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside Turning ideals — and venture dollars — into reality still requires real-world infrastructure. And that's where entrepreneurs like Steve Barbour, the founder of Canadian firm Upstream Data, come in. He's spent years building off-grid mining containers for remote oilfields, but this spring, he's expanding operations into Wyoming, a bet he attributes directly to the Trump administration's rollback of energy regulations and renewed push for domestic production. Wyoming — home to both sprawling coal operations and some of the country's most permissive crypto laws — has emerged as a hub for bitcoin miners and the lawmakers who support them. The administration's latest executive orders loosen environmental restrictions and encourage more fossil fuel development — a boon for oilfield miners like Barbour, even as critics warn it could come at a steep climate cost. "I'm extremely optimistic and bullish on Trump's administration," Barbour said. "The EPA finally came out with a new stance on all these things they've been doing to just destroy the energy sector in America, which has affected us very negatively. I'm seeing a lot of things going the right way now with the decisions the Trump administration is making, and clearly they're trying to attract investment in America and manufacturing." Zaprite's Lewis, one of the Commons' most vocal policy thinkers, agrees that things are moving in the right direction — particularly around the government's decision to establish a formal national bitcoin reserve. While a crypto executive order is an important first step, "codifying it with law will help drive further regulatory clarity that the U.S. is open for bitcoin," Lewis said. Senator Lummis, a longtime advocate for the industry, is pushing legislation to codify bitcoin protections into federal law. Her proposed legislation outlines a plan for the U.S. to buy bitcoin with "existing funds" of the Treasury Department, which includes tax revenue. The idea, in part, is to position bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset — one that could appreciate over time and reduce reliance on debt. Without the Bitcoin Act becoming law, Lewis warns that today's tailwinds could reverse with a single administration change. But while Washington debates bitcoin's role in the future of the U.S. economy, Suman was already betting his own on it. "Why did I leave this really cushy job at Apple, where I was getting paid a lot and had stock and that kind of stuff, to come here, where my future is uncertain?" If it doesn't, and we go down in a glory of fire, at least I will have tried something that I really believe in." Even after he accepted the offer to join Mutiny — later pivoting into Open Secret — things didn't calm down. "That was right when a prominent group of developers were arrested," he recalled. "Knowing that people were being arrested and there was a lot of uncertainty, I still dove in," he said. "The guys said, 'Listen, if you're worried, we can just call this off and you can stay at Apple,'" Suman recalled. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Vision's chief crypto analyst, Jamie Coutts, is highlighting the outperformance of Bitcoin (BTC) amid a correction experienced by stocks and crypto assets. Coutts says that even though Bitcoin has traditionally been more volatile than stocks, it has recently witnessed a relatively lower level of correction than would be expected based on its historical levels of price swings. “Folks don't understand what is happening with Bitcoin during this risk-asset panic. Perhaps it's not just BTC's strength, but a reflection of the increasing fragility of the fiat system and its asset markets – complex systems inherently trend toward entropy/chaos. Going forward, Coutts says that Bitcoin will grow in importance as two of its use cases gain prominence across the globe. The fiat fractional reserve credit-based system's fragility is on full display, yet again. Look through the next couple of days and understand Bitcoin's ascendancy as a global settlement layer and collateral asset is accelerating. Before it was the plebs who understood this, this time it will be nation states.” Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tornado mixes different transactions together to disguise a token's history. For that matter, many Ethereum developers steered clear of Tornado to protect themselves from the government. Moreover, ethereum validators and block builders limited their use of Tornado, making the blockchain slower. In his roadmap, Buterin relied heavily on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to solve the privacy problem. ZKP uses cryptographic algorithms to verify transactions without uncovering the underlying data. Algorithms that enhance privacy, especially at the lower layers (e.g., L1), are being sought after, providing security for both customers and businesses. The roadmap includes a plan to simplify operations, with FOCIL and EIP-7701 standards, so that unnecessary metadata is reduced to a bare minimum, disallowing censors from filtering out content. Eavesdropping will be reduced by incorporating the short term TEE based Remote Protocol Calls (RPC), until Private Information Retrieval becomes more viable. Eavesdropping will be reduced by using multiple RPC, so that sensitive data is not exposed on the network. Private transactions, moreover, will be made more secure and cost-effective by using proof aggregation protocols. And links between applications should remain concealed so that RPC nodes, by accident or on purpose, cannot access metadata. Pascal Caversaccio, an Ethereum security researcher, pointed out that trustless technology opens the door to surveillance and a lack of privacy. EIP-7701 simplifies security protocols by increasing their modularity, restructuring them so they don't need relays or public broadcasters. RPC nodes could be used to eavesdrop on a user's transaction. Ethereum has a very modular structure, and this strategy could fit in with the overall direction and expertise of the Ethereum community. Ethereum has always stressed the importance of transparency, being an open-source project. But now, transparency is proving to be a double-edged sword, with increased accountability on one side and the dangers of censorship on the other side. Many enterprises prefer Ethereum because it has a strong development team. But various sectors like healthcare and finance require more secure transactions to preserve the privacy of their customers.</p>

As lawmakers move from enforcement to innovation, the focus is on projects that offer both creativity and real-world functionality. While it uses meme culture for community growth, it's backed by a functional core, AIdriven trading algorithms, staking ecosystem, and transparent, audited smart contracts. For a more in-depth overview for Dawgz AI, you can check Crypto Chino's YouTube video where he explains why Dawgz AI is one of the top cryptos to buy right now. As US lawmakers push for clearer blockchain legislation and ease enforcement pressure, the door is opening for projects that blend compliance, creativity, and utility. Whether it's infrastructure, AI integration, or community-driven ecosystems like Dawgz AI, this shift means a new chapter for the crypto space, one where being built to last matters more than hype. What crypto is best to invest in right now? Projects like Dawgz AI are gaining attention for blending AI tech with a strong community and early-stage momentum, especially as US regulation turns more favourable. High-risk, high-reward plays like Dawgz AI often carry that elusive 1000x potential, especially when paired with strong narratives and early adoption. While no outcome is guaranteed, low-cap tokens with actual use cases, staking, and audited smart contracts are where many investors start hunting for those rare gains. 2025 could be a breakout year for coins that combine utility, community, and regulatory readiness.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to TRONSCAN data, TRON's global user base has now crossed the 300 million mark. As of April 12, 2025, the network's reach is no longer merely impressive — it's historic. This isn't just a flashy statistic — it reflects real-world impact. Its low fees and high throughput have made it a popular choice for users looking for a fast, inexpensive transaction — from micro-tipping and rent payments to billion-dollar mints of tokens. Several gaming platforms have also begun integrating TRON-based assets for in-game economies and player-owned content. As the web3 boom takes off in its wake, TRON has become a global value network—bridging people, platforms, and the flow of capital for a cross-border economy. By removing intermediaries and delays, TRON enables near-instant payments even in areas with minimal fintech infrastructure. Developers migrating from Ethereum often find TRON's environment more scalable and cost-effective for launching dApps. It's an ambitious goal, but one that fits in with TRON's historical vision of creating a decentralized internet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has swung wildly over the last week as traders ride U.S. president Donald Trump's tariff rollercoaster (with Michael Saylor's Strategy issuing a shock warning). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price is holding up following the latest tariff shots fired by Trump and China after plunging along with stock markets in early April—even as Wall Street grapples with a looming “existential threat” from crypto. Now, while traders bet on a Federal Reserve game-changer, the bitcoin price is braced for a dollar "confidence crisis" as the ICE U.S. dollar index plummets to its worst day since 2022. “The question of a potential dollar confidence crisis has now been definitively answered—we are experiencing one in full force,” ING analysts including Francesco Pesole wrote in a note seen by Bloomberg. "What we are going through now is worse than when former President Nixon took us off the gold standard in August 1971," Marc Chandler, the New York-based chief market strategist for Bannockburn Global Forex, told MarketWatch. “Bitcoin is too young for us to know how it would have behaved in past episodes, but historical data shows that ​​​​‌‍​‍​‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‌‍‍‌‌‍‍​‍​‍​‍‍​‍​‍‌​‌‍​‌‌‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‌​‌‍‌​‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍​‍​‍​​‍​‍‌‍‍​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‍​‍​‍​‍‍​‍​‍‌‍‍​‌‌​‌‌​‌​​‌​​‍‍​‍​‍‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍‍‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌‌​‌‌​​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‍‍​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​​​‌‍‌​​​‌​‌​‌‍‌​‌‍​‌​‍‌​‌​​​‍​​​​‍‌​‍‌​‌​‌‍​‍‌‍​‍​‍​​‍‌​‍‌​‌‌​​‌​‌​‍‌‌‍​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍‌‌​​​​‍‌‍​‌‍​‌​‌‍‌‍‌‌‌‍​​​​‌‍‌‍​‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‌​​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍​​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍​‍​‌‍‌‍​‍​​​‌‍‌‌​​‍​‌‌‍‌‌​​‌‌‍​​​‌​​​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍‌​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​​‍​‌​‌‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍​‍​‍​​​‍‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​​‍‌​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​​‌‍​‍‌‍​‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‌‌‌‌​‍‌‍​​‌‌‍‍​‌‌​‌‌​‌​​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​​‌​‍‌‌​​‍‌​‌‍​‍‌‌​​‍‌​‌‍‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍‍‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​​​‌‍‌​​​‌​‌​‌‍‌​‌‍​‌​‍‌​‌​​​‍​​​​‍‌​‍‌​‌​‌‍​‍‌‍​‍​‍​​‍‌​‍‌​‌‌​​‌​‌​‍‌‌‍​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍‌‌​​​​‍‌‍​‌‍​‌​‌‍‌‍‌‌‌‍​​​​‌‍‌‍​‍‌‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍‌​​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍​​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍​‍​‌‍‌‍​‍​​​‌‍‌‌​​‍​‌‌‍‌‌​​‌‌‍​​​‌​​​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍‌​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​​‍​‌​‌‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍​‍​‍​​​‍‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​​‍‌​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​​‍‌‍‌​​‌‍‌‌‌​‍‌​‌​​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‌‍‌‍‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‍​‍‌‍​‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‍​‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​​‍​‍‌‌stagflation tends to be negative for traditional asset returns and favorable for scarce commodities like gold,” the researchers wrote, adding that during the 1970s, "the price of gold appreciated at an annualized rate of about 30%, significantly above the rate of inflation." "Like a rising tide, the dollar's decline is lifting other assets," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments, adding “a falling dollar supports cryptocurrencies.” “Bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities may have garnered excessive attention, while its ties to Federal Reserve policy and the U.S. dollar's trajectory deserve greater scrutiny,” LMax Group's market strategist Joel Kruger said via email. Trump has been pushing Fed chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates as he embarks on his global trade war, fuelling expectations the Fed could be forced to cut interest rates through 2025, either in response to a tariff-led economic slow down or because Trump has fired Powell. “Market dynamics are shifting as the Fed's outlook adjusts to pressures from U.S. trade policy, with expectations of steeper rate cuts in 2025 now taking hold. This pivot toward a more accommodative stance is poised to narrow yield differentials, weakening the dollar's appeal and, in turn, creating a supportive tailwind for bitcoin," Kruger said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto is cooking up another bull run, and if history's taught the space anything, it's that momentum favors the well-prepped. This next leg up won't just reward hype coins and memecoins—it's going to favor projects with utility, traction, and tech that fits the times. And with everything from macro trends to layer upgrades taking shape, the setup for 2025 is already looking spicy. It's not some recycled project with new branding—it's a fresh play on solving one of crypto's oldest headaches: interoperability. Qubetics is giving people from all walks of life, from solo hustlers to full-scale enterprises, the tools to move value and data across blockchains without breaking a sweat. For folks looking to make moves before the next breakout, here are the 3 best altcoins to buy for next bull run: Qubetics, Stellar, and EOS. Qubetics is bringing something real to the table—interoperability that makes sense for regular folks, not just developers. Think about it like this: a freelance developer in Chicago gets paid in ETH, but needs to use funds on a Solana-based platform. That level of frictionless value flow is what blockchain's been missing for years. Qubetics is running an advanced interoperability layer that connects blockchains natively, with real-world support for compliance, multi-sig, and scalability. It's built for the folks who need tools that just work. Over 507 million $TICS tokens have already been scooped up by more than 24,600 holders, with $16 million raised so far. Each token is going for $0.1573, but good luck grabbing that price much longer. Analysts are throwing out bold predictions—and they're not off base. If $TICS hits $1 after launch, that's a 535% return. Some are calling for $10–$15 after mainnet hits, which would land early backers a sky-high ROI of 9,434%. With working interoperability tech, community buzz, and real-world integration, it's shaping up to be one of the most anticipated launches of the cycle. Why did this coin make it to this list Qubetics made the list because it's solving interoperability in a way that real people and businesses can use—without all the confusing layers. Its presale success, combined with cross-chain functionality, makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. Stellar is making a serious comeback—quietly but powerfully. With nearly $300 million in USDC now circulating on Stellar, the network's usage has jumped across fintech, peer-to-peer payments, and even NGO disbursements. For community members and small businesses, this means fast, cheap payments without dealing with complex wallet setups or unpredictable fees. In New York, independent service providers are using Stellar wallets to accept global payments instantly. In parts of Latin America, Stellar's being tapped for remittances that beat traditional banking by a mile in speed and cost. New wallet integrations and developer tools have made building on Stellar faster and easier, especially for financial tools. The chain recently updated its AMM and token issuance frameworks to support stablecoin-based DeFi—something that could bring in serious traction in 2025. Stellar has processed over 70 million transactions in just the last month, with active addresses jumping 15% in North America alone. Price-wise, XLM is rebounding off long-term support at $0.22. On-chain activity keeps rising while the price still floats below historical averages. Why did this coin make it to this list Stellar made the cut because it's still the king of low-cost global transactions. EOS has been counted out before, but it's quietly laying the groundwork for a big return. With one of the fastest consensus mechanisms out there, EOS is built for apps that need high throughput, low latency, and real scalability. The EOS community is also doing something rare in crypto: overhauling governance in a way that actually makes it more decentralized. The EOS Network Foundation (ENF) has been rolling out tools to give DAOs and users more say over resources, upgrades, and validator actions. With new grants and performance upgrades, EOS is seeing growth in Web3 gaming, DeFi, and enterprise tooling—especially in areas that Ethereum still struggles with, like real-time transactions. After bottoming out near $0.60, EOS has started forming higher lows and building volume. The ecosystem is getting leaner and more focused—and that sets it up for real momentum if the market turns bullish. The EOS comeback story isn't loud, but it's happening. Why did this coin make it to this list EOS earned its spot because it's still one of the fastest, most scalable chains out there. With a governance revamp and ecosystem upgrades underway, it could be a sleeper hit in the next bull run. Qubetics, Stellar, and EOS aren't just buzzy names. They're platforms with real features, active communities, and growth potential that isn't tied to market noise. Whether it's Qubetics' game-changing interoperability, Stellar's cross-border dominance, or EOS's high-speed enterprise focus—these altcoins are built for what's coming. Qubetics delivers real cross-chain interoperability that works for small businesses, professionals, and enterprises without tech complexity. 2.How much has Qubetics raised so far in its top crypto presale? Stellar's low-fee transactions and growing USDC activity have made it a go-to network for stablecoin payments and remittances. EOS is gaining momentum through its governance upgrades, speed, and performance-based features tailored to real-world applications. 5.What kind of ROI can early $TICS buyers expect? Analyst predictions suggest $TICS could return anywhere from 535% to 9434% depending on the price after launch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the recent Paris Blockchain Week on April 9, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed plans for a significant airdrop associated with the Midnight sidechain project. During the recent Paris Blockchain Week on April 9, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed plans for a significant airdrop associated with the Midnight sidechain project. This initiative aims to reach approximately 37 million users across eight prominent blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche and Polygon. The Midnight project focuses on enhancing user privacy through the use of zero-knowledge proofs, allowing seamless interaction across different blockchains without requiring token conversion. Unlike traditional airdrops, which typically target early funders and select users, the Midnight airdrop will encompass a much broader audience, significantly expanding the reach of Cardano's ecosystem. In his keynote address, Hoskinson also discussed the evolution of blockchain technology, outlining four distinct phases. The first phase, exemplified by Bitcoin, emphasized decentralization. The second phase, represented by Ethereum, introduced smart contracts—self-executing programs that operate under specific conditions. Hoskinson noted that blockchain technology is currently entering its fourth phase, which prioritizes privacy. This shift reflects an increasing awareness of user confidentiality in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a recent X post by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum (ETH) may have already gone through its capitulation phase for this market cycle. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), and SUI, Ethereum has endured a challenging two-year stretch. The cryptocurrency was trading at $1,892 exactly two years ago, on April 11, 2023, and is now priced around $1,560 – over 17% lower. In contrast, BTC has surged from approximately $41,000 two years ago to $82,127 at the time of writing – an increase of nearly 100%. While SOL currently trades below its April 2023 price, unlike ETH, it did manage to reach a new all-time high (ATH) of $293 earlier this year in January. Understandably, sentiment toward ETH – among both retail and institutional investors – is hovering near all-time lows. However, Martinez believes that “smart money” may be accumulating at current levels, anticipating a near-term reversal. The analyst pointed out that Ethereum's Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow has recently dropped below one million. This historically indicates a macro bottom zone, meaning $ETH might be undervalued and long-term holders are less inclined to sell. It also suggests: sentiment is low, capitulation may have occurred, smart money might be accumulating. If ETH follows historical trends, it may be approaching a momentum reversal. A potential pivot by the US Federal Reserve toward quantitative easing (QE) could inject fresh liquidity into the market, possibly sparking a mini altcoin rally. While there are multiple signs that ETH may be close to bottoming out, some indicators suggest that there could be continued weakness for the digital asset before any meaningful momentum shift. Further, ongoing capital outflows from US-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) remain a concern for the asset's short-term outlook. That said, crypto analyst NotWojak recently noted that ETH may be on the verge of a breakout, with a potential upside target of $1,835. Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Funding rates are essential for perpetual contracts within the cryptocurrency space. They represent the cost to hold a position, which can shift based on market conditions. If funding rates soar, long positions may suffer, leading to a decline in investor confidence. Such dynamics can sway investor behavior, making it crucial for traders to monitor these rates closely. Investor confidence is everything in crypto, where price swings can be swift. Funding rates play an integral role in shaping this confidence. Understanding what funding rates signal can help traders manage risk and make informed choices. For example, Binance's adjustment of the funding rate settlement frequency for its USDⓈ-M ORCAUSDT perpetual contract from four hours to two hours aims to boost investor confidence. They help maintain price parity between perpetual futures contracts and spot prices, essential for preventing drastic price deviations that could disrupt the market. However, rapid fluctuations in funding rates can lead to increased volatility, particularly when liquidity is low. Understanding and managing these rates is crucial for preserving a stable trading environment. The long-term consequences of changes in funding rates extend beyond immediate market responses. Traders will likely adapt by creating strategies that account for funding rate costs. Furthermore, consistently using funding rates as a sentiment indicator may help traders better predict market movements. This foresight can contribute to long-term market stability by mitigating the effects of rapid sentiment changes. As the crypto landscape evolves, funding rates will remain an important factor in shaping investor confidence and market dynamics. In summary, Binance's funding rate adjustments impact both investor confidence and market stability. While they may raise costs and influence sentiment, they also maintain price parity and encourage market participation, which are essential for long-term stability. By keeping an eye on funding rates and their effects on market dynamics, investors can refine their trading strategies and help build a more stable cryptocurrency ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The announcement of Donald Trump's poorly named reciprocal tariffs has in recent weeks set off a period of extreme volatility in global markets. Wall Street closed last week having lost more than 10% in two days. On Wednesday, the official announcement of a 90-day tariff pause sparked stock market euphoria, with double-digit rebounds on the Nasdaq (12.6%). While the stock market suffered constant large fluctuations, its most volatile asset par excellence, bitcoin, registered fewer trades. Despite so much disruption, it has remained stagnant, holding steady in recent weeks, and is now trading at $81,000. “Normally, it had a multiplier effect of two or three; in 2020 and 2021, when the stock market fell by 10%, bitcoin tended to do much worse, falling by between 25% and 30%. And the behavior of the altcoins was even more exaggerated, with falls of 40% to 50%,” explains Javier Pastor, Bit2Me's training director. “In the early years, it had even bigger movements,” says Pastor. On November 11, 2024, when it exceeded $86,000 for the first time in history, bitcoin rose by 11.52%. Analysts consulted agree that the correlation between these assets has changed over time, primarily due to the change in their user profile. Javier Molina, an analyst at eToro, points out that long-term investors, who hold bitcoin in their portfolios for more than a year and who represent 72% of all those investing in the asset, are not getting rid of their positions. “There have also been many liquidations, but with a lower volume than in previous sharp falls. The market seems to have less appetite and there is a rotation of investors: now the short-term speculator is not in bitcoin, but in Tesla. “The market seems more mature and legitimate,” he says. Javier Cabrera, a market analyst, points to another factor: tariffs fall mainly on companies, rather than on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has no major event hanging over its head, while for U.S. companies, there is still great uncertainty, hence that market's more abrupt movements. Molina agrees with this reading and points out that while bitcoin maintains its behavior, the volatility of other assets has increased. “Right now Tesla, Apple and Google are showing more volatility than bitcoin, because that's where the tariffs have a direct impact,” Molina says. In the case of the bitcoin industry, there are no direct consequences — apart from those on bitcoin mining, whose companies have supply chains in Asian countries subject to tariffs — while other U.S. companies do suffer from levies on their business and the macroeconomic ramifications they bring. Such developments have also supported the asset's price. In the short term, experts make clear, volatility is to be expected. However, if tariffs lead to a recession and force governments to launch economic stimulus measures, it would increase liquidity, a factor that benefits bitcoin. “More than with the Nasdaq, bitcoin now has more of a relationship with liquidity and has a time lag of approximately 60 days. Faced with an increase in global liquidity, investors tend to invest in different types of assets, such as the stock market, gold, and bitcoin. “And bitcoin captures liquidity very well,” Pastor adds. But in the medium term they have different views. Manuel Villegas, an analyst at Julius Baer, considers bitcoin unlikely to be recession-proof. Instead, escalating tensions and a more aggressive trade war between the U.S. and China could benefit bitcoin, according to Pastor. We already saw that with the tariff war of 2017-2018, when it absorbed a lot of the positions that Chinese citizens wanted to hold in reserve assets. And that could be another element to favor the de-correlation of the traditional market with reserve assets such as bitcoin,” Pastor concludes.
