                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the AI startup led by OpenAI's co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised an additional $2 billion in funding at a $32 billion valuation, according to the Financial Times. The startup had already raised $1 billion, and there were reports that an additional $1 billion round was in the works. SSI did not comment on the new funding, which was reportedly led by Greenoaks. Sutskever left OpenAI in May 2024 after he appeared to play a role in an ultimately failed attempt to oust CEO Sam Altman. That product is presumably still in the works, with SSI's website little more than a placeholder with a mission statement.

They say it includes a high frequency transformer (HFT). So in order to get the transformer working, one would have to chop up the incoming dc power into a square wave or a sine wave. But what transistors can you use to do this, considering you are dealing both with very high power and very high frequencies? It transmutes some of the silicon atoms into phosphorus: https://nrl.mit.edu/facilities/ntds/ Packaged semiconductors are going to be more metal interconnect / plastic encapsulation / ceramic insulation than silicon by weight.These systems will also have a significant weight fraction in magnetic materials, either ferrite ceramics or amorphous metals.Still a huge weight savings, but the weight fractions you are giving see off and are missing some important materials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of Trump's stated goals is to bring manufacturing back to the United States, but others believe the dream of an American-made iPhone is a fantasy. Those debates may be paused after Friday evening, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a list of product categories that are “excluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257,” with the exclusions backdated to April 5. Those categories appear to include smartphones, laptops, hard drives, and semiconductors. (Other tariffs, such as the previous 20% tariff on Chinese goods, would presumably still apply.) Notable Silicon Valley figures led by Elon Musk have joined the Trump administration, while other tech CEOs have been courting Trump, most visibly with millions of dollars donated to his inauguration. Those efforts seemed to bear little fruit — until last night's announcement, which Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, described as “a dream scenario for tech investors.” But the industry could still be hit with more targeted tariffs and other restrictions.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. While the initial reciprocal tariffs will remain for imports, U.S. Customs and Border Protection shared some new exemptions on tech-related goods. The update was announced yesterday evening and follows various tariff increases, particularly on Chinese imports. The exemptions include many products we're excited to see get some relief. The complete list is available in the official bulletin, but it includes computers, smartphones, semiconductor chips, and other tech goods like flat panel TVs, solar cells, and flash drives. The most recent tariff increase from Trump was 145% on Chinese goods. This sent waves across the tech industry, as many realized the significant impact it would have on many tech products that we rely on, including laptops, desktops, CPUs, semiconductor chips, and any PC component. Large companies like Apple, HP, Dell, and more preemptively imported extra stock before the tariff announcement to skirt some of the impact. These exemptions should benefit industry leaders and consumers alike, who have been anticipating serious price hikes on imported products. The United States imports around 66% of its tech goods from China, which caused significant concern when tariffs were first announced and subsequently raised on Chinese imports. We recently reported expectations that consoles, monitors, and laptops would be among the most impacted. The situation is subject to change, but we'll report any significant updates on the tariff situation as things progress, so be sure to check back regularly for more information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Broadcast Positioning System (BPS) replaces satellites with ATSC 3.0 digital TV signal data. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. CNX Software reports that BPS is being positioned as a backup, alternative, or confirmation data source for the Global Positioning System (GPS). However, this satellite-based system, which provides precise location, velocity, and time information, is not always available and can be interfered with by bad actors. GPS is under attack, and its reliability is easily put into question, so a backup positioning technology seems like a great idea. Being able to reuse existing infrastructure would be a bonus, and what is more widespread and suitable than TV broadcast antennae? BPS uses TV signals for timing and positioning data, but the base stations must be broadcasting ATSC 3.0 'Next Gen TV' signals, specifically for this technology. The BPS tech works by adding an ATSC frame to the output, and this will usually provide timing accuracy to 100ns, which is good but not quite as good as GPS (~10ns). However, for BPS positioning, you will need to be in the signal range of four transmitters, and even then, accuracy will be in the order of a 100-meter radius... Then, by 2029, ATSC 3.0-based timing should be added to the mix. While the BPS technology doesn't impress in its stats, compared to the dominant GPS (for example), it is hard to argue against its use for verifying GPS data. Hopefully, the U.S. won't need this GPS backup in its home turf, where ATSC 3.0 digital TV signals are found. Different digital TV standards exist in other regions, such as the popular DVB-T/T2. However, we don't know if positioning data can be added to those broadcast signals. The Russians might be interested in melding DVB-T with their Glonass satellite positioning system for backup/verification. Likewise, Europeans may find implementing some non-satellite backup/verification for their Galileo satellites worthwhile. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Elon Musk announced that his AI startup, xAI, had acquired his social media company, X (formerly known as Twitter), in an all-stock deal, it raised some eyebrows. xAI's chatbot, Grok, was already deeply integrated with X, X was floundering financially, and Musk needed a way to make his $44 billion Twitter acquisition look less like an impulsive takeover and more like a strategic play for AGI dominance. It also pointed to something deeper about how Musk's empire works: investing in any one of his companies isn't about a quick return on investment. Some call it a grift, pointing to Musk's history of overpromising and underdelivering. “All of Elon's companies today are basically one company,” Yoni Rechtman, a principal at Slow Ventures, told TechCrunch. Other businesses under Musk's control include Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink – some of which reportedly share resources. When he decided he wanted to go to Mars with SpaceX, did he really think initially that there's a real opportunity here for the internet around the world, and there's gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue opportunity? When he started off with EVs for Tesla, did he really think that this is gonna merge into self-driving, where you can make hundreds of billions of dollars a year of extra profits, and Grok […] and you're gonna have connected cars all around the world? Firms like 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ Growth, Fidelity Investments, Manhattan Venture Partners, Saudi Arabia's PIF, Sequoia Capital, Vy Capital, and others also hold positions throughout Musk's corporate web. Pundits questioned how the acquisition could value X at $33 billion, more than triple its valuation just a few months ago, and how it could value xAI at $80 billion considering the AI company reportedly has little in the way of revenue. But valuations aren't always based on what exists today. Rather, they take into account what investors are hoping for – and that's particularly true when it comes to Musk's ventures. “The reason why [Tesla's] stock trades at 80 times earnings and the comp group trades at 25 times earnings is that people are making a bet on the long term, and it's not about what happens to numbers this year,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. “That's one of Elon's superpowers, this ability to keep investors engaged for the long term.” It's exactly the type of all-in Musk backer that stands to benefit the most from a deal like xAI buying X, assuming Musk can indeed deliver on his pledge of marrying X's real-time data trove and distribution platform with xAI's infrastructure and AI expertise. The SEC has argued that this allowed Musk to buy more Twitter shares at artificially low prices. Wang listed a few other risk considerations, such as anticompetition and user privacy concerns, particularly regarding how X quietly opted all users into data collection for AI model training. The opt-in change has already raised the ire of one regulator, Ireland's DPC, which recently began investigating it as a potential breach of Europe's GDPR law. “Another kind of risk here is that there isn't a consensus framework for how the AI market is going to be regulated, but you're already seeing traces of this in Europe and, up until recently, in California,” Wang said. Musk might also simply lose interest in a project, Rechtman said. “I think that is what a lot of Tesla shareholders are feeling right now,” he said, “where for the last several months, Elon's number one company has been the Trump campaign, and his other projects have languished.” When asked about some of these risk factors, Munster appeared nonplussed. He suggested they're inconsequential given the enormity of, for example, xAI's value proposition and potential to become a dominant player in AI. Rechtman said that Musk bulls aren't blindly loyal, per se, but simply trust in Musk's superpower to “bend capital markets to his will” in a way that allows him to do things and build businesses that nobody else can. Not for nothing, buying into Musk's more speculative bets, like X, is one way to potentially unlock more investment opportunities in the Muskverse, Rechtman said. “SpaceX is a real thing, and it will never go public,” he said.

Having a power bank on hand is now essential if you spend most of your time on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Live streaming and videos can quickly drain your smartphone battery within hours which makes you miss out when you need your device the most. For those who use their phones a lot, the INIU 10000mAh power bank is a must-have accessory—and now, it's even cheaper than it was on Black Friday. What's so amazing about this deal is that it comes at rising tariffs that are purported to impact the cost of electronics in the coming weeks. The INIU charger performs very well and thoughtful design: It has a 10,000mAh capacity and it can charge most smartphones to full capacity several times. Whether you own an iPhone 16 or a Samsung Galaxy S25, this power bank will have your phones charged all day long. Its high-speed charging is 3A output compatible, so you can charge your phone up to 78% in just one hour which is much faster than regular chargers. INIU charger also offers pass-through charging capability, with which you may charge your gadgets and the power bank simultaneously. Its TempGuard technology scans charging temperatures a massive 3 million times daily to prevent overheating or overcharging. This yields optimum performance and maintains your device's battery well-being in the long term—a function that comes in handy to anyone concerned with long-term electronics wear. With tariffs on electronics (and Chinese imports) steadily rising, discounts like this will become increasingly rare. Experts predict that these price hikes will soon affect popular brands like Anker and INIU more significantly which makes it unlikely that such low prices will persist for long.

Ever since I began testing toaster ovens for a living, the ovens from Breville have been at the top of our rankings. Breville's highest-end countertop ovens are far more precise in temperature, preheat faster, don't toast the whole house when you just want to roast some potatoes, and quite simply do more things better. What's more, Breville's takeover of the ChefSteps brand, and partnerships with other recipe makers, mean the phone app offers a huge repertoire of tested recipes and techniques for your countertop cookers. But the air fryer capability of each Breville device has never been as impressive as the ovens' other many good qualities. I always wondered whether the much larger size of each Breville oven's interior didn't allow air to whip around well enough, the way it does in a little basket air fryer that's basically a single-purpose catch-basin for hot air. If Breville made a smaller oven air fryer, I figured, the basket could get better circulation. The Compact is also versatile for its size, with three (or really kinda six) rack positions, an air fryer basket, a roasting pan that doubles as a grease catcher, and a broiler rack. First off, here's what's great about the Smart Oven Air Fryer Compact. Across its appliance line, Breville has made an art out of the elegant hand-hold, little smart bits of automation, and convenience that offer genuine utility to home cooks. The air fryer presets are the exact three things that an American audience will most often want in an air fryer oven preset: wings, fries, bacon. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Wings catch 425 degrees Fahrenheit, but times vary by as much as 10 minutes depending on whether you'd like your wings fried hard, and how many you threw in the basket. Fries, from fresh, caught a little char and needed to be rotated a bit, but results were on point as regards cook times. Wings consistently needed “a bit more” time to get to desired doneness, and weren't necessarily as crisp as you'd get from a basket fryer. That said, they significantly outperformed Breville's similar-sized convection model, as judged by family members in a blind taste test. The same customization for darkness and quantity applies for toast and bagel settings, though this is all pretty standard issue on the toaster oven side of things. As with all Breville's ovens, the “a bit more” button allows you to tack a little bit more time on at previous settings, without having to remember what they were. And the “superconvection” button lets you manually add crisping air at the end of a cook, without otherwise changing your settings. The pizza preset is a bit of an outlier, and I'll admit I haven't played around with it as much. But essentially, it toggles suggested cook times based on whether you want to use superconvection to get a crisper crust, and whether your pizza is frozen. But that said, unlike other Breville ovens whose temperature is sometimes even more precise than the thermometers I used to test them, the Compact is a little glitchy when it comes to airflow and maintaining even temperature around the oven. Toast often ends up a little uneven in terms of browning, not just at different locations around the oven but also between the top and bottom of each slice. When cooking meats with a thermometer inserted, I consistently ended up measuring temperatures about 20 degrees lower than expected. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. But especially, the oven's smaller size doesn't seem to be a magic bullet in terms of airflow and superconvection. One potential reason is that the oven's tight quarters don't leave a lot of room for the air to move around when a roasting tray's in the oven to catch grease. The end effect is that french fries get leopard spotting rather than uniform brownness when air frying. And because this oven doesn't have a light, I sometimes add my own temperature inconsistency by opening the door to check browning. This is a fast-charring broiler, great for precisely this purpose but difficult to use for longer cooks on, say, Brussels sprouts without getting a mix of burnt leaves and underdone centers. Among the grand scheme of air fryer toaster ovens, already a genre built on compromise, Breville's Air Fryer Compact remains a pretty solid entrant. The device packs wild versatility into a very small space. Its smartly designed presets for individual dishes—frankly useless on most company's ovens—are here deftly managed and customized. But even with the Compact's crispier wings and fries, and its smaller countertop footprint, Breville's comparably priced Smart Oven Pro still takes the prize among Breville's budget-friendly options south of $300. This Air Fryer Compact may still need a little time to iron out its bugs. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

China's high-tech industry has a number of world-class companies that develop products that are competitive far beyond Chinese borders. However, given the sanctions imposed against these entities in recent years, it is hard to find products from Huawei, Loongson, or Longsys outside of China. Cambricon Technologies (an AI processor developer), Loongson (CPU designer), Leaguer Microelectronics (an IoT IC designer), Longsys Electronics (a maker of storage systems), and Maxscend Microelectronics (an RF chip developer) all said that they were not going to be impacted by massive tariffs imposed by the U.S. government in their filings for investors, according to SCMP. Hardware makers from China ship tons of hardware, including domestically developed chips and domestically developed systems on those chips. That industry has been aimed mostly internally so far though, so no financial impact on the aforementioned companies at this point.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We must meet the challenge of addressing white nationalist and far-right militia violence without causing further harm to communities already disproportionately impacted by the criminal-legal system.” Meanwhile, a swell of CIA and national security officials eagerly urged the government to create new legal authorities to treat Americans like terrorists. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein is out with a new article on the Trump administration's blossoming counterterrorism strategy, which, according to government insiders, is poised to target Americans who express discontent about the president or his wealthy allies. “So-called Tesla terrorism and potential anti-Trump violence is driving new articulations of the threat,” a senior intelligence official told Klippenstein. Indeed, in recent weeks, the Justice Department has pivoted federal law enforcement away from more traditional enemies and towards people who vandalize Tesla dealerships. Several people arrested and accused of having firebombed the cars will likely be charged with “domestic terrorism” charges, Attorney General Pam Bondi has said. Meanwhile, critics of Israel have also become a target for the government's roving eye. Under Biden, the government developed its first National Strategy to counter “domestic terrorism.” The strategy, which was designed with input from America's national security agencies, set up a broad variety of new programs to counter what it perceived as extremism in the homeland, including new task forces and liaisons with state and local law enforcement. He points to a recently published  Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on America's counterterrorism strategy that notes “officials from DHS, DOJ, and State told us that the classified implementation plan includes some additional guidance for classified activities” and that “DHS and DOJ officials told us that they conduct additional activities to respond to the 2021 Strategy that are classified.” In other words: a secret program that spies on Americans and treats them like terrorists is not available for public consumption. That secret program is now being helmed by the Trump administration, which has very different ideas about who and what poses a danger to this country than its predecessor. That includes focusing more on Trump's political opponents and framing petty crimes taking place at day-to-day protests as terrorism. Worse still, the head of America's counterterrorism strategy, Sebastian Gorka, is described as an Israel-loving gun nut who is fond of “secret operations” and “special operators.” Gorka is tasked with overseeing all of America's counterterrorism operations—both international and domestic. Klippenstein quotes from a federal counterterrorism manual published in 2021 that lists various so-called “mobilization indicators.” These indicators, he writes, are considered “characteristics that could move people to carry out acts of extremist violence.” Under the government's domestic counterterrorism mandate, Americans who demonstrate such indicators could find themselves the subject of a suspected terrorism probe—even if they have never committed a crime. Ever had a heated argument expressing sympathy for Luigi Mangione or HAMAS? If so, you meet the government's criteria listed in its 2021 “Mobilization Indicators” booklet, a document intended to help local and state police to spot a terrorist. These criteria might strike you as creepy because, as the booklet itself concedes, “many of the mobilization indicators included in this booklet may also relate to constitutionally protected activities.” In short, if you've ever been a super-vocal critic of the current administration or its allies, you could end up being a target of the government's national security state. In 2021, when the Biden administration began pushing for a new domestic terrorism program, I thought it was a really, really bad idea. For all the wailing and gnashing of teeth the Democrats did about Trump's authoritarian style, it seems deeply ironic that they would kick off this new moment of party ascendance by pushing for such overwhelming new powers for the nation's security agencies. Such proposals seem destined to do little except further disfigure the already mutilated corpus of civil liberties that Americans used to take such pride in—but which they now ever more sleepily deride as outdated, impractical, and unsafe. Now, here we are, some four years later, and a program that offers the government way too much power could easily be weaponized against peaceful political protesters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. I've always been a sweatpants and leggings girl. Maybe it's a hallmark of having worked from home for eight years and counting, or the burden I bear from being a millennial, but to me, blue jeans are an occassion pant. My favorite pair has been the Vuori Performance Joggers, ever since I first tried them back in 2020 for a now-defunct buying guide. These sweatpants have been beloved across the internet since then and probably before it. These pants have 4.8 out of 5 stars based on over 46,000 customer reviews. But if you haven't heard the gospel, please do yourself the courtesy of listening to me proselytize for just one moment. I know a ton of differently shaped people who love these sweatpants. Be you tall or short, slim or thick, no matter your gender, your weight, or where you like to wear your loungewear, these'll work for you. Some people might think sweatpants are basic. So perhaps my love for the Vuori Performance Joggers is best illustrated with details about what they don't get wrong. I spoke with Sarah Carlson, vice president of design at Vuori, to lift the curtain a bit. Carlson says it's made with advanced knitting techniques to promote a second-skin feel, and she says it is meant to “provide a buttery-soft feel while delivering the durability and functionality needed for active lifestyles.” I'll be the first to admit I'm skeptical of any marketing claims, but these sweatpants genuinely are so soft and stretchy. DreamKnit is made with 89 percent recycled materials. If I wear these sweatpants in the fall, they keep me pretty warm. I can regulate my own body temperature. In the winter, or on particularly windy days, they aren't the warmest, but that breathability is a feature and not a bug. Carlson says, "The initial concept for DreamKnit came from our desire to create a fabric that felt as good as it performed.” And it does! She adds that each iteration was wear-tested by athletes, yogis, and everyday users to get feedback on fit, feel, and functionality. Vuori also conducted lab tests to ”ensure the fabric could withstand repeated washing and activity without losing its shape or softness.” The slash pockets are thoughtfully designed, too, with enough depth that I can stash my phone, wallet, and other essentials inside—and, most importantly, nothing falls out when I sit down or shift around. This is a surprisingly common issue I've found while testing sweatpants. What's the point in a pocket if things don't stay inside it? Again, the Performance Joggers have pockets that work as intended. And they don't stick out or show an obvious outline while I walk around—another added benefit that other sweatpants haven't managed to achieve. Carlson says that “fit is everything, and we spent countless hours perfecting the cut of the Performance Joggers. They're designed to be relaxed but not sloppy, with a tapered leg that flatters the body without restricting movement. The elastic waistband with an adjustable drawstring ensures a customizable, secure fit.” It doesn't slip too easily out of its sleeve, and it's not too thick or obvious. I can adjust the sweatpants to sit high on my natural waist or sling them low around my hips. The drawstring doesn't create an obvious outline or get twisted up over time. But reviewers who are taller than me have said the same thing. The ankle cuff is tight enough to help the pants maintain their shape but not so tight that it pulls them down or restricts movement. Vuori suggests ordering a size up if you want an oversized fit. I wear my usual size, and I find that the pants are tight and loose in all the right places. The shape is downright flattering, and I feel just as comfy wearing them with a gigantic fleece-lined hoodie while lounging as I do pairing them with a bodysuit and some cute sneakers while going out or over my shorts to the gym. I've worn these while hanging out around the campfire. If you conjure a pair of sweatpants in your head, they‘d probably be the Vuori Performance Joggers—whether or not you realize it yet. I appreciate the wide variety of colors (14 at press time) and sizes (XXS to XXL in Regular or Long lengths). I appreciate the way these hold up over time, maintaining their softness and shape over nearly five years of wear. But mostly, I appreciate that they absolutely nail everything a pair of comfy pants should be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. An iPad Instagram app might be on the horizon. According to The Information, a Meta employee claims the long-asked-for app is finally in development, fueled by Meta's desire to ramp up user activity on Instagram as a whole. Images and Reels maintain the same aspect ratio, resulting in an awkward experience. But the terrible user interface hasn't been enough for Instagram chief Adam Mosseri to green-light a version designed for the iPad. Still, Mosseri hasn't been quiet on the topic—despite past pleas, he's taken to posting on X multiple times over the last few years to explain that there's not a big enough group to make an Instagram iPad app a priority. But as TikTok's future remains unclear, Mosseri might have changed his tune. As the report outlines, Instagram is using the looming ban as an opportunity to drive more users to its app. Before the short-lived ban in January, Instagram released an update centered solely on enhancements to Reels—its short-form video feature—to steer users from TikTok to its app. The company extended the maximum length of videos, changed the profile grid to a rectangular format (specifically a 4:5 aspect ratio), and launched a new video app called Edits (similar to CapCut from TikTok's parent company, ByteDance). This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Motorola's Moto AI has been in beta since late 2024—it's an AI companion that can remember things about you, summarize notifications, and transcribe and summarize recordings. Maybe it'll finally come out of beta with the Razr 2025? There's a new Moto G Stylus 2025, which retains the $399 price of its predecessor. It remains the only smartphone that comes with a stylus under $500, and Motorola is putting a little more emphasis on it this time around. You'll be able to turn basic sketches into AI-generated art, write down math problems and have them convert to text with the solution in tow, and you can even use it with Google's Circle to Search. The Moto G Stylus is also IP68 water resistant now, is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset, and still features a headphone jack, OLED 120-Hz screen, and wireless charging. Last year, the CMF Phone 1 blew me away with its stellar performance and design—it outperformed several phones that cost more money, all while looking far more stylish. A teaser was posted on Nothing's Community forum, with video glimpses of the CMF Phone 2 Pro. Rolling out this week, this feature supposedly lets you have a free-flowing conversation with Gemini when it's in Gemini Live mode with your phone camera open. Gemini will be able to see everything you show it. That means you can ask it for a product's name by just pointing the camera at it, or ask for inspiration or ideas on how to redecorate your office. If you don't want to use Gemini Live, you can also attach photos, files, and documents to the standard version of Gemini and ask questions about them. While the new live video function is rolling out to Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 users now, it'll be broadly available to all Gemini Advanced subscribers on Android devices later on. If you like mountain biking but don't have the free time to get out and get as strong as you used to be, then it's time to get an electric mountain bike. It's been several years since Specialized updated its pedal-assist Levo line, so I'm excited to see the announcement of a full-power electric S-Works Levo 4 this week. The new bike has a 720-watt S-Works motor with 111 Nm of torque, promising 27 percent more power than its predecessor, and the ability to haul you up much steeper, more technical climbs, with a huge 1,120-Wh onboard battery so that you don't find yourself stranded powerless in the middle of nowhere. The bike also purports to offer much more refined power assist, so that you don't accidentally bike yourself into a tree on technical terrain, and there's even downtube storage inside the bike for easy access to the battery and an extra tube for your tires. It weighs about 52 pounds (23.6 kg), which, although not light, is comparable to its competitors like the Trek Slash. We're excited to take it out on some singletrack soon. If you've ever felt your portable speaker has let you down in either bass or vibes, Sony's new party speakers are promising to deliver both, with a trio of newcomers joining the ULT Power Sound series—tagline: “Maximum Bass. With its detachable shoulder strap and compact size, the ULT Field 3 is probably the kind of portable speaker you think of when you hear “portable speaker,” and promises a powerful sound from the two-way active driver design. The ULT Field 5 is a bigger speaker that stands upright and has the ability to access two different kinds of bass boost for more low-end wobble. This enormous speaker is officially portable because it comes with wheels and a handle, but that is the beginning and end of its portability. Wheeling it much further than your garden feels unlikely, but it has karaoke and guitar inputs for turning the party up to 11 and more volume than most people will know what to do with. One thing that's a rarity in the world of portable music-making gear is proper software updates. The company, a purveyor of gorgeous music-making tools for creative nerds, has dropped a big software update for its sampler that offers owners and new buyers cool new features. You can now resample things for remixing, chop sounds up, and side-chain your beats for more pump-y mixes, among even larger changes to the playback engine. Folks who want to make more use of playing stuff first and putting it together later will enjoy that you can now arrange tracks of up to 9,801 bars, and will enjoy that there is increased polyphony (the number of samples you can play at once) and better MIDI support for live performances with a laptop and DAW. If TE supports its affordable products this well after launch, it makes us want to keep buying.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This initial version of the administration's budget request calls for an approximately 20 percent overall cut to the agency's budget across the board, effectively $5 billion from an overall top line of about $25 billion. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. According to the "passback" documents given to NASA officials on Thursday, the space agency's science programs would receive nearly a 50 percent cut in funding. Although the budget would continue support for ongoing missions such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, it would kill the much-anticipated Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, an observatory seen as on par with those two world-class instruments that is already fully assembled and on budget for a launch in two years. "Passback supports continued operation of the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes and assumes no funding is provided for other telescopes," the document states. The cuts are in line with what Ars Technica exclusively reported last month, that the Trump administration was considering a massive 50-percent cut to NASA's science programs. However, science policy experts have been more alarmed, characterizing such cuts as an "extinction level" event for what is seen as the crown jewel of the space agency. Nearly all of NASA's most significant achievements over the past 25 years have been delivered by the science programs, including feats such as the Ingenuity helicopter flying on Mars, New Horizons swooping by Pluto, and Cassini's discovery of water plumes on Enceladus. This passback document represents just the opening salvo of the process to establish a federal budget for fiscal-year 2026, which begins on October 1 of this year. The budget is produced by the White House Office of Management and Budget, which is overseen by Russell Vought, who has long made his anti-science budgeting priorities clear through his Center for Renewing America. The Trump administration nominee to lead NASA, private astronaut Jared Isaacman, said during a confirmation hearing this week that he strongly supported NASA's science programs. It is unlikely that Isaacman was involved in drafting this document, as he has not yet been confirmed by the US Senate. Nominees, typically, are excluded from policy prior to confirmation. After receiving passback documents, NASA usually has 72 hours to review the materials and then submit appeals and justification for changes. Any modifications are then incorporated into a final document that becomes the "President's Budget Request" for the next fiscal year. It is not clear when the Trump administration plans to release this budget request, a public document. It could happen within the next four to six weeks. Fierce opposition to some of these NASA cuts is likely in Congress. "This massive cut to NASA Science will not stand," Representative George Whitesides, a California Democrat, told Ars. "For weeks we have been raising the alarm about a rumored 50 percent cut to NASA's world-leading science efforts. I will work alongside my colleagues on the Science Committee to make clear how this would decimate American leadership in space and inflict great damage to NASA centers across the country." Again this will depend on negotiations with Congress, but, using a process called impoundment, some Trump officials believe it may be possible to turn the budget request into an actual budget for all intents and purposes.
