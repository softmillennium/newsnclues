            An intriguing object my husband and I saw during our honeymoon was the Robenhausen door at Switzerland's National Museum Zurich. More than 5,500 years old, the wooden board is one of the most ancient preserved doors in Europe.
    


            Archaeologist Jakob Messikommer uncovered the prehistoric object from the marshes in Wetzikon in 1868, according to the museum.
    


            The door likely belonged to a Neolithic home in a village on Lake Pfäffiker — and seeing it caused me to wonder who built it, and who passed through it, thousands of years ago.
    


            Rare artifacts like this, as well as fossils, help us determine where we came from and reveal more of humanity's story.
    


            When commercial fishing nets dredged up a fossilized jawbone off Taiwan's coast in 2010, scientists puzzled over where it might fit on the human family tree.
    


            Ancient protein fragments within the jaw's teeth revealed the bone, known as Penghu 1, belonged to a Denisovan man who likely lived on a submerged land bridge that once connected what's now China and Taiwan.
    


            Denisovan fossil finds are hard to come by, which means scientists have scant evidence suggesting what our extinct mystery relatives might have looked like. But revisiting fossils in Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science may yield riveting clues.
    


            Don't forget to look up Saturday for a glimpse of April's full moon, known as the pink moon, as it peaks at 8:22 p.m. ET.
    


            Despite the nickname, which is a nod to springtime blooms, the moon will maintain its white-golden hue — but it may appear smaller.
    


            That's because this full moon is a micromoon, meaning that Earth's satellite is at or near its greatest orbital distance from our planet — and April's is the smallest micromoon of the year.
    


            And in space exploration news, tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, President Donald Trump's pick to lead NASA, said Wednesday he would “prioritize sending American astronauts to Mars,” among other potential shifts for the agency, during a Senate confirmation hearing.
    


            The dire wolf that was the inspiration for the fearsome creatures in the “Game of Thrones” series once roamed North America. The real-life canine went extinct about 12,500 years ago — but scientists say they have resurrected the species through gene editing.
    


            Biotech company Colossal Biosciences, which also has “de-extinction” plans to bring back the woolly mammoth, shared footage of its healthy dire wolves, both as adorable pups and as juveniles roaming a 2,000-acre site.
    


            “Our team took DNA from a 13,000 year old tooth and a 72,000 year old skull and made healthy dire wolf puppies,” said Colossal CEO Ben Lamm in a news release.
    


            While experts may argue over how much genetic material constitutes a dire wolf, Colossal scientists have noted some unique behaviors in the wolves as they grow.
    


            While dinosaurs won't be making a comeback anytime soon, scientists have long debated whether the giants were already declining when an asteroid wiped them from the face of the Earth 66 million years ago.
    


            New research adds to a growing body of evidence that, in fact, dinos were doing just fine before the deadly strike.
    


            A team of researchers compared the fossil record of the four main dino groups that lived during the 18 million years before the mass extinction event with data modeling estimates and found a mismatch.
    


            “If it weren't for that asteroid, they might still share this planet with mammals, lizards, and their surviving descendants: birds,” said Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, a Royal Society Newton International Fellow at University College London.
    


            Deep-sea mapping company Magellan has created a full-scale “digital twin” of the RMS Titanic, and the 3D underwater scan has shed new light on the ship's final moments before it tragically sank 113 years ago.
    


            The project is featured in a new National Geographic documentary about the doomed ocean liner, which now rests on the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean.
    


            The scan reveals previously hidden details, including evidence to support a claim that 35 boiler room engineers sacrificed themselves to keep the power on for the ship, enabling the sending of distress signals. And the project's findings exonerate an officer who was accused of abandoning his post at a crucial moment.
    


            There is more to these stories than meets the eye:
    


            — An enigmatic altar found in an ancient Mayan city contains bodies — and wasn't made by the Maya. The ornately decorated structure may hold the key to unraveling the geopolitics of the time.
    


            — Construction on a soccer field in Vienna, Austria, unveiled a mass grave of soldiers from nearly 2,000 years ago, revealing rare but gruesome evidence of clashes between the Romans and Germanic tribes.
    


            — A vast ocean glow reported for more than 400 years has stumped scientists, but they say they're getting closer to solving “milky sea” events.

            Several universities in Florida have signed agreements to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement amid an ongoing push by state leaders to aid the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration.
    


            The University of Florida said Friday it has signed the 287(g) agreement that allows local law enforcement to act as immigration officers.
    


            “We can confirm that we have signed the 287(g) agreement,” a spokesperson for the university told CNN. Under the agreement, ICE delegates to local officers “the authority to perform specified immigration officer functions under the agency's direction and oversight,” according to the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            The move comes as the Trump administration continues to target foreign nationals affiliated with prestigious American universities. The earliest high-profile cases focused on those accused of supporting terror organizations, as was the case with Mahmoud Khalil's arrest following pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University.

More than 500 student visas revoked as the government expands reasons for deportation



            By CNN's count, more than 525 students, faculty and researchers across across 88 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked this year, as an increasing number of student deportation threats involve the revocation of visas based on relatively minor offenses like years-old misdemeanors.
    


            Four University of Florida students have had their visas revoked, the university's director of public affairs told CNN Friday.
    


            The prospect of increased immigration enforcement could cause additional friction on the University of Florida campus. On Wednesday, crowds gathered there to protest the deportation of a Colombian student, according to CNN affiliate WCJB. Demonstrators said international students are afraid after the deportation, WCJB reported.
    


            The agreement in Florida allows local officers to question those they suspect of being in the country illegally and “to serve and execute warrants of arrest for immigration violations,” according to a statement from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in February about other law enforcement agencies in the state who signed similar agreements.
    


            A spokesperson for the governor's office on Saturday referred questions to the Florida Board of Governors, the governing body of the state university system.
    


            “Several police departments at universities within the State University System of Florida are partnering with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” spokesperson Cassandra Edwards said in an email. “Our university police departments are always encouraged to collaborate with other law enforcement entities to enforce state and federal law.”
    


            The University of Central Florida and the University of South Florida have also signed agreements with ICE, according to CNN affiliate WFTV. CNN reached out to Florida International University and Florida Atlantic University about news reports their campus police have done the same.
    


            Across Florida, 200 state, county and municipal law enforcement agencies have entered into 287(g) agreements with ICE, and more than 40 others have agreements pending, according to DHS.

            In May 2024, after 32 years living in Southern California, Karina Nuvo hit a wall.
    


            Coming out of a pandemic-induced lull in the singing gigs that made her happy and left her feeling fulfilled, the two-time Grammy-nominated artist found herself under an incredible amount of stress.
    


            She'd taken on jobs as a real estate agent and property manager at a Pasadena apartment building where she'd had a string of rough moments, including encountering a tenant dead in his apartment.
    


            Nuvo was also busy taking care of her octogenarian father.
    


            “I couldn't focus on singing, I couldn't focus on real estate, I had to put my dad in an assisted living facility. My health just took a toll, it was killing me,” says Nuvo, 55.
    


            By May 2024, with the political climate in the US on tenterhooks again as Donald Trump's presidential campaign swung into full tilt, Nuvo says it all “just felt like too much.”
    


            “I made a decision that I was leaving, that I was going to Europe. The job stress was what pushed my situation, but also politically I just couldn't fathom what was coming,” she says.
    


            She told her parents about her plans to leave.
    


            It was then that Nuvo's father, Jose Novo (Karina uses a modified spelling of this surname professionally), reminded her that they'd always had a way out, a path to try living a different kind of life in Spain, since they were able to apply for citizenship in that country.
    


            Novo was born in Camagüey, Cuba, and came to the United States for a better life at the age of 21. But his father (Karina's grandfather) was born in Spain, which entitled both him and his children to pursue citizenship through the ley de nietos (the “grandchildren's law”).
    


            Also called the Law of Democratic Memory, the ley de nietos, set to expire October 21, 2025, grants descendants of Spaniards persecuted during the Spanish Civil War and subsequent Francisco Franco dictatorship a path to Spanish citizenship.
    


            Nuvo told her father, then 87, she would go to Spain and submit her application for Spanish citizenship there.
    


            “His response was, ‘Please, I don't want to die here in this place,'” she says. So she asked him if he wanted to move there with her.
    


            “He didn't even hesitate, he was like, ‘Yep,'” Nuvo says.
    


            So, she set to work selling most of their worldly possessions on Facebook Marketplace, packed a few suitcases and put her plan into motion.
    


            The only time Nuvo and her father had attempted to travel to Spain together was on a cruise that left from Fort Lauderdale in 2022. He got Covid long before they made it to Spain. They had to disembark from the ship in the Azores, where she checked her dad into a hospital.
    


            “It was the only time I tried to take him to Spain, and I failed miserably,” Nuvo says.
    


            So before leaving California, Nuvo told her father, a bladder cancer survivor, that they had to be on the same page. If something similar happened once they moved to Spain — if he got sick and wasn't well enough to live in their new shared home — he might have to go back into assisted living there. Jose agreed.
    


            Nuvo set to work looking for a place for the two of them to live, tapping the real estate website Idealista for potential rentals and talking to brokers to figure out the best location in Spain for a move.
    


            Originally, she says, she was set on Málaga, along the Andalusia coast, but was dissuaded by the housing prices. A broker suggested Nuvo consider the nearby Costa del Sol town of Fuengirola, about 20 miles south, which has similarly flat terrain that would be easy for her father to navigate, as well as a lower cost of living.
    


            Nuvo was still in California when she found a nearly 1,200-square-foot apartment in the town with two bedrooms that looked perfect. It was a few blocks from the beach and had a view of the sparkling Mediterranean from the balcony.
    


            “I went, ‘oh my god, it's dad's dream, by the ocean,'” says Nuvo. The monthly rent was 1,050 euros (around $1,150), a fraction of what they'd both been paying in California to live.
    


            After a stop in Miami on the way to Europe, they landed in Spain in September 2024 with six pieces of luggage and her dad's walker and wheelchair in tow.
    


            “I have a photo of dad in front of the apartment right after we got to Fuengirola with a huge smile. For me, though, because of the emotional trek it was to get there, I went into a full panic attack at what I'd done,” Nuvo recalls.
    


            She called her son, 20, who's in college back in California, and cried, expressing her doubts. But he assured her it was all going to be OK.
    


            Just a week after Nuvo and her father arrived in Spain, her mother and stepfather, Gloria and Cesar Tarafa, came to visit for 15 days. “We're a modern family, everyone gets along,” Nuvo says.
    


            Nuvo's mother and stepfather were born in Cuba, like her father, but had spent most of their lives in Miami, and later, California. They had been living for years in a fixed-income adult community in Monrovia near Pasadena.
    


            It didn't take long before Gloria and Cesar, then 87 and 73, decided they would make the move to Fuengirola, too. They both also have the right to apply for Spanish citizenship since they have parents or grandparents who were born in Spain.
    


            The couple, who are retired, returned to the US from their Spanish vacation in October 2024, sold nearly everything they owned and were back in Fuengirola a month later. They moved into the apartment Nuvo shared with her father and set about applying for Spanish citizenship.
    


            Cesar says the political climate in the US and cost of living in the Los Angeles area both contributed to their decision to leave.
    


            Cesar first went to Spain shortly before his 15th birthday (the age when military service was mandatory for Cuban youth back then), when his parents sent him away from the island to stay with family friends near Madrid. (He later left for the US).
    


            He and Gloria, who met in Miami as members of the Cuban diaspora there, had also vacationed in Spain on several occasions and enjoyed it. And with Spanish as their mother tongue, imagining a move there was easy, he says.
    


            “We decided we have to make sure we enjoy our lives for however many years we have left,” he says, adding that he knew the quality of life in Spain — and, in particular, Andalusia — was good.
    


            “The culture is also very akin to our culture in Cuba. Cubans have a lot of similarities with the Andalusian way of speaking and expressing ourselves, moving our hands and exaggerating. So we knew if we were going to make the change, it would be to this part of Spain,” he says.
    


            Cesar says the couple's lifestyle has changed for the better because they can “do more with less” in Spain.
    


            “You don't even have to spend a lot of money. You can just go out and see people walking and see the nightlife. This city is alive. People go to dinner at 9 or 10 o'clock at night,” he says.
    


            Back home in Monrovia, the couple would usually be in for the night at 6 p.m. he says, watching TV.
    


            “Here at 6 o'clock you're having a merienda (snack) and then you go to dinner at 9. And the funny thing is people don't rush you at restaurants. You can have a cup of coffee and sit down at a table for two hours. It's just a whole different mentality,” he says.

            Cesar admits it's taken some getting used to Spanish bureaucracy and things moving a little bit slower compared to the US, “but the overwhelming quality of life here is just undeniable. We're just trying to be like a sponge and suck everything in.”
    


            Cesar compared his recent departure from the US for Spain as eliciting similar feelings as when he first left Cuba long ago, since both times he left everything behind.
    


            “I knew when I left Cuba that I was not going to be back ever, and I have the same feeling now,” he says.
    


            Gloria says the people, style and way of living really speak to her in Spain. She left Cuba as a young woman, when she was recruited to work as a flight attendant for PanAm in Miami. She and Cesar lived in Florida for many years before moving to California.
    


            Their American life was so different, especially during the years after the pandemic, she says.
    


            “Our life there was OK. Half of my life is there, and I miss family members. But I have to try to enjoy what is left of me. I'm 88, I'm not young,” Gloria says.
    


            “Here, we go downstairs and have coffee, we sit there and talk. In Monrovia there was no social life for us. I might go to my son's house or a friend's once in a while, but that was it,” she says.
    


            “The quality of life here is life. The food, the people and the weather in this part of Spain, I just love it.”
    


            By January of 2025, Nuvo's father, Jose, was having health complications, she says.
    


            It was becoming far too difficult for her to care for him at home. So together they made the difficult decision to move him into an assisted living facility in February in nearby Marbella, about 20 miles west of Fuengirola.
    


            Nuvo says she felt very guilty and wondered if bringing him to Spain had been a mistake.
    


            “But then he'll just tell me he loves it. He spent months enjoying Fuengirola. And now he says he's sitting out looking at the ocean in Spain, eating his favorite foods like tortilla española and croquetas and speaking Spanish with everyone,” she says.
    


            The facility costs 2,300 euros (about $2,500) a month, far less than his assisted living facility in California, and it includes physical therapy, access to a psychologist and all living expenses and meals as well as daily activities.
    


            Nuvo talks to her father every day on the phone and visits him twice a week in his private room with a balcony overlooking a lush garden, which she says feels more like a palace than an assisted living facility.
    


            The main reason she moved from California to Spain, Nuvo says, was for a better quality of life and “saving our mental, emotional and physical wellbeing.” It's a goal she feels she's so far achieved with her family.
    


            She and her mother and stepfather recently moved into a larger three-bedroom rental apartment in Fuengirola with sea views from a sprawling balcony right in the center of town. The location allows Cesar and Gloria to get out and walk to everything with no car needed and continue enjoying their new Spanish lifestyle. The rent is 1,400 euros, or about $1,500.
    


            Nuvo says her living expenses in Spain compared to Los Angeles have been nearly halved. Once she gets her work permit as a citizen, Nuvo says she plans to get back to what she loves doing for work — pursuing singing gigs around Europe and helping people who are also considering a move find real estate opportunities in Spain.
    


            She loves California, she says, but it was time to go. And she has no regrets.
    


            “Things still take my breath away here, just the kindness of everybody. They have a cherishment and appreciation for their lives. And the elderly are treated like royalty.” she says.
    


            “Even with everything that's happened, even with my son still living in California, I can't explain it. I feel like I'm supposed to be here.”
    


            As for her father, Jose says his whole life has been an adventure, and he chalks this experience up as another one.
    


            “I left Cuba when I was 20 years old. So, from there on I went to Costa Rica, working for my company. Then I went to the Dominican Republic to work for another company. So, it's been one adventure after another adventure,” he says.
    


            He has no complaints about the assisted living facility in California where he was living before he left.
    


            “People there were very nice to me. And I had people that I care very much for. People here are very good, too,” he says, adding that the cost is a big differentiating point and he finds the Spanish facility “more sophisticated.”
    


            As for any regrets about crossing the ocean to finish out his remaining years, Jose says he has none.
    


            “Why would I? I'm in the country of my family because my father was born in Asturias, and my grandparents on my mother's side were born in Galicia. I have Spanish blood running through my veins,” he says.
    


            To anyone who's considering a similar move, no matter at what stage of life, his advice is simple.
    


            “Follow your heart — and don't be afraid.”

            Electronics imported to the United States will be exempt from President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs, according to a US Customs and Border Protection notice posted late Friday.
    


            Smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts are among the exempted products. The exemption applies to products entering the United States or removed from warehouses as early as April 5, according to the notice.
    


            The move comes after the Trump administration imposed a minimum tariff rate of 145% on Chinese goods imported to the United States. The tariffs would have a major impact on tech giants like Apple, which make iPhones and other products in China.
    


            Roughly 90% of Apple's iPhone production and assembly is based in China, according to Wedbush Securities' estimates.
    


            Analysts at Wedbush on Saturday called the tariff exclusion, “the best news possible for tech investors.”
    


            “Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday,” Wedbush said in a statement. “A big step forward for US tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend…now onto the next step in negotiations on the broader China tariff war which will take a number of months at least.”
    


            Nvidia and Microsoft declined to comment to CNN. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            Counterpoint Research, a firm that monitors global smartphone shipments, estimated Apple has up to six weeks of inventory in the United States. Once that supply runs out, prices would have been expected to go up.
    


            The White House said on Saturday that Trump will continue to urge tech companies to move production to the United States.
    


            “President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops. That's why the President has secured trillions of dollars in U.S. investments from the largest tech companies in the world, including Apple, (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), and Nvidia. At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.
    


            Trump had told reporters Friday on Air Force One that there could be possible exclusions to his sweeping tariffs.
    


            “There could be a couple of exceptions for obvious reasons, but I would say 10% is a floor,” Trump said.
    


            Economists have warned the cost of tariffs may ultimately be passed on to the consumer. That fear has sent many Americans rushing to buy big-ticket items, such as cars and electronics, as consumer sentiment has dropped to record lows.
    


            Nintendo said on April 4 that it would postpone the US preorder date of its Switch 2 gaming console to “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Initially priced at $450, the Switch 2 could instead cost around $600 as a result of tariffs, according to experts.
    


            The Trump administration says these tariffs would bring more manufacturing jobs to the United States and reverse a decades-long decline. But some products can't be easily made or found in the United States, thus increasing the costs to produce them in American factories.
    


            Semiconductors and microchips are among the products heavily outsourced to factories in Asia due to lower costs. Those electronic parts are now exempt, according to the Friday notice. That could help Asian chipmakers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix.
    


            “The president has stated that autos, steel, pharmaceuticals, chips and other specific materials will be included in specific tariffs to ensure tariffs are applied fairly and effectively,” a White House official said.
    


            The official said Trump would soon order a study on the national security effects on semiconductor imports — known as a Section 232 study.
    


            At a Republican National Congressional Committee event on Tuesday, Trump criticized the Biden administration's decision to award a $6.6 billion grant to TSMC for semiconductor production in Phoenix as part of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. Trump said he gave TSMC no money and told the company “if you don't build your plant here, you're going to pay a big tax — 25, maybe 50, maybe 75, maybe 100%.”

            An explosion occurred outside the offices of Hellenic Train in Athens, Greek police said on Friday, adding there were no immediate reports of injuries.
    


            Police cordoned off the area after two Greek media organizations received warning calls that an explosive device would go off within 35 minutes, police officials said. A suspicious-looking bag was spotted outside the building which was evacuated.
    


            An investigation is under way. A police official said the cause was likely a makeshift bomb.
    


            There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
    


            Hellenic Train is a unit of Italy's Ferrovie dello Stato IPO-FERRO.MI, which operates passenger and freight routes in Greece.
    


            A deadly 2023 train crash, Greece's worst rail disaster, killed 57 people, mostly students, and injured dozens.
    


            Many Greeks view the crash as emblematic of the neglect of the country's railways in recent decades and also of a persistent failure by the state to address safety concerns. The crash has prompted angry protests, fueled further by a lack of trust in institutions.

            President Donald Trump sent a memorandum to four federal department heads Friday night instructing them to allow the military to use and take jurisdiction of federal land along the US-Mexico border.
    


            The memo, sent to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Agricultural Secretary Brooke Rollins, states that the military must “take a more direct role” in efforts to secure the border and calls on the secretaries to act to provide the Defense Department “use and jurisdiction” over certain federal lands “to enable military activities” on military installations.
    


            The memo states that the Defense Department should be provided jurisdiction over lands including the Roosevelt Reservation – a 60-foot-wide swath of land along the border – for military purposes including border wall construction and installing detection and monitoring equipment. The memo excludes Federal Indian Reservations.

Texas Army base chosen to house migrants, defense officials say



            Trump mandated that the US military step up its presence along the southern border on his first day in office, and thousands of additional active duty US troops have been ordered there as part of the Trump administration's ongoing military mission at the border, CNN previously reported.
    


            Because Trump has declared a national emergency at the border, according to the memo, Burgum “may make withdrawals, reservations, and restrictions of public lands to provide for the utilization of public lands by the Department of Defense.”
    


            The memo also confirms what CNN reported last month was in the works: plans for the military to take command of a swath of territory along the border by designating federal lands as a military installation.
    


            Migrants who cross in this area would be put into “holding” for trespassing onto a military property, CNN previously reported, until the Department of Homeland Security could arrive to pick them up and deport them — putting the military in the position of effectively detaining migrants, something that is traditionally a law enforcement function. The military is prohibited from carrying out domestic law enforcement under the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, but by describing the zone as a “holding” area, DoD could feasibly circumvent that law.
    


            The memo explains that the four agency heads will “initially implement this memorandum on a limited sector of federal lands” designated by Hegseth. However, at any time, Hegseth can “extend activities” under the memo to additional federal lands along the border.
    


            The memo further states that, “members of the Armed Forces will follow rules for the use of force prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.”

            A sightseeing helicopter plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, turning a family outing above Manhattan's misty skyline into a tragedy.
    


            The helicopter carried six people, including three children and their parents – who have both worked for Siemens, a German multinational technology conglomerate. It lifted off from a Manhattan heliport and followed a familiar route: circling the Statue of Liberty, gliding north along the Hudson toward the George Washington Bridge and then turning south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into the water, according to analysis by CNN and FlightRadar24.
    


            Witnesses described the helicopter flipping and spiraling before crashing near the New Jersey shoreline upside down, scattering debris across the river.
    


            “The helicopter was a little bit like nose down, slightly, and I saw the propeller separating from the helicopter. It kept spinning in the air alone. Nothing was attached to it,” Sarah Jane Raymond Ryer, who saw the crash unfold, told CNN affiliate WCBS.
    


            A video obtained by CNN shows the rotor blades detached from the helicopter and flying through the air. “The videotape in this case is very dramatic and very important to the investigation,” former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz told CNN on Friday.
    


            Eyewitness Avi Rakesh told CNN's Jessica Dean that what was left of the helicopter appeared to be so out of control, he didn't feel safe in his own building.
    


            “Debris was flying everywhere. I was concerned that something might come and hit the window,” Rakesh said.
    


            Here's what we know about the crash that killed everyone on board:
    


            The victims include Agustín Escobar, 49, his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, and their three children - two sons, ages 4, and 11, along with a daughter who was to turn 9 today. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the family was visiting from Spain, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a social media post that the family was in New York to celebrate Camprubí's 40th birthday.
    


            “We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,” a Siemens Mobility spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Escobar served as CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, the transportation solutions division of Siemens AG.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, expressed his condolences, calling the incident “an unimaginable tragedy.”
    


            Camprubí was the global commercialization manager for Siemens Energy, according to her LinkedIn page. Siemens Energy is an independent company that was spun off from Siemens AG in 2020.
    


            “We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of a colleague due to a tragic accident during vacation,” said a statement from Siemens Energy. “Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims.”
    


            In addition to her international corporate career, Camprubí is known in Spain as a member of a prominent sports family. Camprubí's grandfather and great-grandfather both served as presidents of FC Barcelona, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world.
    


            The pilot was identified as 36-year-old Seankese Johnson, according to city officials. He was certified to fly commercial helicopters since August of 2023, according to FAA records, and the NTSB noted he had completed 788 hours in the air.
    


            A friend of Johnson, helicopter pilot Matt Klier, told CNN affiliate WABC he was “an amazing pilot.”
    


            “He was just a super good dude,” Klier said, holding back tears. “I'm a helicopter pilot, we started at the same time. The man was an amazing pilot.”
    


            The cause of the crash remains unclear, but its sudden descent stunned witnesses as first responders raced to rescue the victims.
    


            The helicopter took off at 2:59 p.m. from Manhattan's downtown heliport following a popular sightseeing route, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. After circling the Statue of Liberty, it flew north along the Hudson River, reaching the George Washington Bridge by 3:08 p.m. It then turned south along the New Jersey shoreline, where it lost control shortly after, Tisch said.

            Visibility at the time was 10 miles, though the region was cloudy with winds of 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph. A weather system was expected to bring light rain later in the afternoon.
    


            At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a crash near Pier A Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. Witnesses said the helicopter appeared to stop midair before pieces broke off, consistent with preliminary emergency reports, Tisch said.
    


            Jersey City resident, Ipsitaa Banigrhi, described the sound as “such a loud sound. It felt like thunder,” she told WCBS. “Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it's just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that's when it was like, ‘OK, what's happening.'”
    


            With the helicopter's catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN's Kate Bolduan.
    


            “There's nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,” Brandt Anderson said.
    


            First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X.
    


            The aircraft's main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday, according to the NTSB. The search continues for the main rotor, transmission, roof and tail of the aircraft.
    


            The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities.
    


            In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there “may have been corrosion removed” from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter's component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be “considered unairworthy,” according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010.
    


            In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a “bang” that was followed by the “Engine Out warning horn.” The pilot inflated the helicopter's floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat.
    


            “The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,” Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday's crash. “I'm a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn't stopped crying since this afternoon.”
    


            When asked about the helicopter's maintenance, he said, “That's something my director of maintenance handles.” The director of maintenance declined to comment.
    


            Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation.
    


            “(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn't arrive,” Roth told The Telegraph Thursday.
    


            Concern about the safety of low-altitude helicopter flights in the New York City area has a long history.
    


            “Helicopter operations in the Hudson River have been under criticism for many, many years,” former Department of Transportation inspector general Mary Schiavo told CNN.
    


            At least 32 people died in helicopter accidents in New York City from 1977 to 2019, according to the Associated Press. That included a 2018 crash that killed five passengers in a “doors-off” aerial tour, which subsequently became more tightly regulated by the FAA. The victims in that case drowned after being unable to free themselves from their safety harnesses after plunging into the water, an NTSB investigation found.
    


            “I am calling for a serious reevaluation of current policies and am urging the city to consider an immediate moratorium on non-essential helicopter flights from city-owned heliports while investigations are ongoing,” New York City Councilwoman Amanda Farías, chair of the council's Committee on Economic Development, said Friday.
    


            The Eastern Region Helicopter Council, a trade group that represents helicopter operators, says a ban would not be the right solution.
    


            “The helicopter community is in shock and mourning after the tragic and horrific events of yesterday,” chairman Jeff Smith said in a statement. “Unfortunately, some well-meaning but misguided leaders are using this tragedy to exploit and push their decades-old agenda to ban all helicopters. Before taking legislative action, we need to learn more from the investigation.”
    


            The helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, was built in 2004 and held an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid through 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records.
    


            Maintenance records are not public and during investigations NTSB rules prohibit companies from releasing certain information relating to the accident.
    


            The investigation into the cause of the crash will pore over documentation on all the work that was done on the aircraft. That would include the company's compliance with two recent FAA-issued airworthiness directives.
    


            One directive from May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.
    


            The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters' main rotor blades because of “delamination.” That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail.
    


            It remains unclear whether any of these issues played a role in Thursday's crash.
    


            Both the FAA and the NTSB are investigating the crash. The NTSB has dispatched a “go-team” to the site to examine the wreckage and review maintenance records, it said on social media, and is asking the public to submit any additional video or photos they may have.
    


            The helicopter was flying within New York's Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where air traffic control support is limited, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a post on X. Duffy added that the helicopter had received air traffic assistance from LaGuardia Airport shortly before entering the uncontrolled zone.

Video captured one person robbing corpse on idling train before another person robbed and sexually assaulted it

A man sexually violated a corpse on a New York City subway train after stealing from the body, becoming the second of two people to rob that particular dead person, authorities said recently.

One of the more grotesque US crime stories of late unfolded on a southbound R train near the Whitehall Street station in Manhattan at about 12.20am on Wednesday, when “an unidentified individual had sexual contact with an unconscious and unresponsive adult male” in plain view of surveillance cameras, according to a police statement.

The police's statement did not elaborate and did not identify the attacker or the victim – though they released surveillance photos of a suspect carrying a black backpack while wearing a blue baseball cap, a black hooded jacket, a yellow hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans, and red and white sneakers.

Nonetheless, a poster distributed to transit workers alleged that the man wanted in the case had engaged in sexual intercourse with “a dead human body”, as the New York City news website Gothamist reported. The poster, which was reviewed by the Guardian as well, alleged that investigators had probable cause to arrest a 51-year-old man identified as Carlos Garcia – whose last known address is in the Bronx – on a count of sexual misconduct of a dead human body.

Gothamist, citing police, also reported that the man identified in the wanted poster as Garcia could be seen on surveillance footage taking items from the pockets of the dead person before violating the corpse and fleeing.

That attack marked the second time the dead person – who was described as a man – had been stolen from in less than an hour. At about 10.48pm on Tuesday, police said a woman approached the late man, removed unspecified property from him and then left.

Police released surveillance images of a suspect in that initial robbery, which showed a woman wearing a yellow hooded sweatshirt, black pants and a black baseball cap.

A police spokesperson would not comment on the allegations of the wanted poster first reported on by Gothamist and later seen by the Guardian.

Another official on Saturday morning said there had not been any arrests made in the case. Police said anyone with useful information can submit it to New York City's Crimestoppers website.

Wednesday morning's case of necrophilia on the subway not only provided a graphically documented instance of a sexual disorder psychiatrists assume to be among the rarest. It also reignited a discussion about the safety of the New York City subway system that in some quarters is ongoing.

Statistics generally show violence on the subway is relatively rare, though high-profile cases have the tendency to unnerve the public.

For instance, in December, a 57-year-old woman named Debrina Kawam died after being set on fire while sleeping on a train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn. Days later, 45-year-old Joseph Lynskey was pushed in front of an oncoming train at Manhattan's 18th Street station but survived.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Senior Kyiv economist describes latest postion of Trump administration in talks as ‘colonial-type' bullying

The US has demanded control of a crucial pipeline in Ukraine used to send Russian gas to Europe, according to reports, in a move described as a colonial shakedown.

US and Ukrainian officials met on Friday to discuss White House proposals for a minerals deal. Donald Trump wants Kyiv to hand over its natural resources as “payback” in return for weapons delivered by the previous Biden administration.

Talks have become increasingly acrimonious, Reuters said. The latest US draft is more “maximalist” than the original version from February, which proposed giving Washington $500bn worth of rare metals, as well as oil and gas.

Citing a source close to the talks, the news agency said the most recent document includes a demand that the US government's International Development Finance Corporation take control of the natural gas pipeline.

It runs from the town of Sudzha in western Russia to the Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod, about 750 miles (1,200km) away, on the border with the EU and Slovakia. Built in Soviet times, the pipeline is a key piece of national infrastructure and a major energy route.

On 1 January, Ukraine cut off the supply of gas when its five-year contract with the Russian state energy company Gazprom expired. Both countries had previously earned hundreds of millions of euros in transit fees, including during the first three years of full-scale war.

Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist with the Centre for Economic Strategy, a Kyiv thinktank, said the Americans were out for “all they can get”. Their bullying “colonial-type” demands had little chance of being accepted by Kyiv, he predicted.

Last autumn, Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed giving the US access to Ukraine's underdeveloped mineral sector. He envisaged a deal that would see the incoming Trump administration supply Ukraine with weapons, in return for future profits from joint investments.

Instead, Trump has refused to give security commitments or military support but wants the minerals anyway. Last week he complained Zelenskyy was trying to “back out of an agreement” and said Ukraine's president would have “big problems” if he failed to sign.

Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Zelenskyy said he was ready to do a deal to modernise his country but that Ukraine could only agree if there was “parity” between the two sides, with revenues split “50-50”.

“I am just defending what belongs to Ukraine. It should be beneficial for both the United States and Ukraine. This is the right thing to do,” Zelenskyy said. The US Treasury confirmed “technical” talks were ongoing.

Meanwhile, the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said his remarks over a possible partition of Ukraine had been misinterpreted. In an interview with the Times, Kellogg said the country could be divided “almost like the Berlin after world war two” as part of a peace deal.

Writing on X, Kellogg said he was referring to “a post-cease fire resiliency force in support of Ukraine's sovereignty”. Under this plan, Russian troops would remain in territory already seized by Moscow, with British and French forces stationed in Kyiv and in other parts of the country.

On Friday, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. Witkoff's reported solution to the conflict was to give Russia the four Ukrainian provinces it is demanding – including territory that Ukraine controls, and which is home to 1 million people.

Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group on Friday, Kyiv's allies announced a record €21bn (£18.2bn) in additional military help. They accused Putin of dragging his feet over a 30-day ceasefire deal which Ukraine has accepted.

Early on Saturday, Russia carried out further air attacks against Ukrainian civilian targets. Three warehouses were destroyed in Kyiv, with two people injured. The Kremlin has fired 70 missiles and 2,200 drones at Ukraine since the 11 March US ceasefire proposal, Ukrainian officials said.

Zelenskyy paid tribute on Saturday to a 26-year-old pilot, captain Pavlo Ivanov, who was killed during an F-16 combat mission. Ukraine's small air force “heroically” defends the country from Russian missiles and drones, and supported ground operations, he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Abbas Araghchi says ‘initial understanding' could be reached in Oman and lead to ‘path of negotiations'

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has arrived in Oman for mediated talks with the US special envoy Steve Witkoff, saying there is a chance the two sides can reach an initial understanding that leads to a timetable for negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme.

The aim is to agree a format and parameters for talks that in months could lead to some US economic sanctions on Tehran being lifted and a recasting of Iran's civil nuclear programme.

Such a breakthrough, highly implausible a month ago, would represent the biggest improvement in US-Iranian relations since the two countries signed a nuclear deal in 2015. Donald Trump removed the US from the agreement in 2018, claiming “the heart of the deal was a giant fiction – that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program”.

In the initial indirect talks, Araghchi plans to test whether Witkoff has been given, as reported, a narrow mandate to prevent any possibility of Iran's civil nuclear programme being weaponised, or a broader brief to end the programme altogether, as well as to make wider political demands on Iran.

Araghchi said on arriving in the capital of Oman, Muscat, that Tehran's “intention is to reach an honourable agreement from an equal position. If the other side also comes from the same position, God willing, there will be a chance for an initial understanding that will lead to a path of negotiations, and if there is sufficient will, we will decide on a timetable.”

In the wake of Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Iran has piled up a vast stockpile of highly enriched uranium now sufficient for as many as six nuclear bombs, but Tehran insists there is a fatwa opposing Iran's possession of nuclear weapons.

Previous US demands revealed in a Trump executive order in February, which imposed further economic sanctions on Iran, gave the impression that the US president would make maximalist demands that Iran end its nuclear programme, cease all political support for so-called resistance groups, and end its missile programme.

But a personal letter from Trump to the Iranian leadership did not echo these maximalist demands, and Witkoff has hinted at the possibility of compromise, which suggests that an internal debate in the US administration leans in favour of making initial demands focused on handing over its stockpile of uranium, and improved monitoring.

But if Witkoff demands a complete end to Iran's civil nuclear programme, Tehran will make a counterproposal for a Middle East nuclear-weapon-free zone. This would require the US to pressure Israel to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and dismantle its own unconfirmed nuclear arsenal. Such a proposal would be rejected by Israel and the US.

With the Iranian economy in freefall, and Iranians suffering energy blackouts, the country's president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has always favoured talks with the US as the way to escape “the cage of sanctions”, but he has faced resistance from parliamentary hardliners and parts of the group around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On 7 February, Khamenei said experience showed it was “not rational, intelligent or honourable” to hold talks with Trump, a judgment that Pezeshkian said he had no option but to accept.

But the Iranian foreign ministry – supportive of talks – persuaded Khamenei that his regime, already weakened by reverses in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza, might crumble unless he negotiated. Trump also threatened to give Israel the freedom to bomb Iran's nuclear sites.

To preserve Iran's dignity, Khamenei insisted the initial talks at least be indirect, but there will be pressure from the US side to allow direct talks. The two countries broke off formal diplomatic relations after the 1979 Iranian revolution.

Pezeshkian, in an effort to talk Trump's transactional language, said this week: “His excellency [Khamenei] has no opposition to investment by American investors in Iran. American investors: come and invest.”

Trump, too, has relented both in his rhetoric and possibly his demands, saying on Friday: “I'm not asking for much; they can't have a nuclear weapon,” adding: “I want them to thrive. I want Iran to be a great, wonderful, happy country.” Trump and Witkoff also badly need a diplomatic breakthrough since their peace efforts in Gaza and Ukraine have so far been abject flops. A further war in the Middle East is fiercely resisted by the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia.

Netanyahu said this week that a deal would only work if Iran's nuclear facilities were blown up, “under American supervision with American execution”. He also called for a “Libya-style agreement”, a reference to Muammar Gaddafi's voluntary dismantlement of his nuclear programme under international supervision. But Iran senses that Netanyahu is losing influence with Trump over the nuclear file.

Iran's deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who is involved in parallel talks with European leaders, said: “If the American side does not raise irrelevant issues and demands and puts aside threats and intimidation, there is a good possibility of reaching an agreement. The Islamic republic of Iran believes in dialogue and interaction based on mutual respect, and any bullying and coercion is unacceptable in our view.”

Araghchi, a veteran of the 2015 talks who holds a PhD in political thought from the University of Kent, is accompanied by a technical team.

The Omani foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi, is acting as the mediator, a role that Oman has long held to help resolve Middle East conflicts.

Witkoff has admitted he does not have technical expertise about civil nuclear disarmament programmes, but Trump implicitly trusts his judgment.

Iran, which has a reputation for being an exhaustive and exhausting negotiator, knows it is working against a deadline of two months, European officials say, because the UK, Germany and France must signal by the end of July whether they will reimpose punishing UN sanctions against Tehran. The option to reimpose those sanctions, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, will expire on 18 October.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Lasting damage has been done not only to Trump's political credibility but to globalisation as a system

At the beginning of this helter-skelter week, Downing Street was declaring globalisation not only dead but a failure. Now, only five trading days later, the autopsy is still under way but the victim may instead be economic populism, strangled by Wall Street, the citadel of globalisation. Donald Trump's so-called liberation day may in fact have been the anti-globalist's entombment day.

In an effort to deny even a tactical retreat, Trump's aides insist the White House goal all along was not to weaken globalism, or even to protect the US economy with tariffs, but instead to get into a negotiation to lower tariffs around the world and to punish China. As cover stories go, it is hardly credible, partly because the tariffs were repeatedly lauded by Trump as a macroeconomic revenue-raising measure, or a means to bolster US manufacturing.

The reality is that when faced by an attempt to remake the world trading system overnight, or what the former UK Treasury minister Jim O'Neill describes as “a full-on Kamikaze mission”, the markets revolted. But the retreat caused by the sell-off of US Treasury bonds has been only partial, with tariffs set at 10% universally, except for parts of trade with Mexico and Canada.

Washington's all-out trade spat with China, meanwhile, still leaves the average effective tariff rate at 27%, the highest since 1903, according to the Yale Budget Lab.

Amid the chaos, significant long-term damage has been done not only to Trump's political credibility but also to the resilience of globalisation as a system.

Trust, agreed rules and a degree of political stability are the underpinnings of globalisation. They are the prerequisite for specialised and highly extended trade supply lines across political borders to function. Globalisation, after all, is not just about the trade in goods or free markets, it is a set of interconnected ideas and institutions underpinning wealth creation that has dominated political thinking since the end of the second world war.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was not alone in arguing that Trump's liberation day and its aftermath marked the end of an era. In a warning that holds true even after Trump's retreat, Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister and a former governor of the Bank of England, said: “The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. The system of global trade anchored on the United States that Canada has relied on since the end of second world war, a system that while not perfect helped deliver prosperity for Canada for decades, is over.

“The 80-year period when the US embraced the mantle of global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect and championed the free exchange of goods and services, is over. While this is a tragedy, it is also the new reality.”

In short, this is not a phase, however the trade war with China is resolved. The legacy of liberation day will linger for generations.

Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, largely agreed that the US was committing an act of abdication. “The rules governing tariffs and the negotiating process that brought those tariffs down over time grew out of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, devised by Roosevelt in 1934 … It was, in fact, one of America's greatest policy achievements. Donald Trump burned it all down,” he wrote.

When the man elected to lead the country that invented globalisation places the rejection of globalism at his ideological core, even if it means alienating the US's closest allies, a fundamental reordering is under way.

A key difficulty is that Trump, 78, has shown no sign of wanting to learn from this debacle. As far back as September 1987 he spent $95,000 to publish an “open letter to the American people” in three newspapers. “For years, Japan and other wealthy nations have been taking advantage of the US,” he wrote. “It is time to end our vast deficits by making Japan, and others who can afford it, pay.”

While his target may have shifted from Japan to China, Trump's sense of resentment and betrayal, coupled with an aversion to trade deficits, has never left him. His election in 2016, alongside Brexit, merely confirmed to him how his message resonated.

In fairness to Trump, analysis showed that US voting districts with industries vulnerable to Chinese imports tended to elect representatives with more polarised stances.

The vote gave him a mandate to end what he described as the US carnage of “rusted-out factories, scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation”. Many in the Davos establishment acknowledged that he had seen something they had not – globalism had left too many behind, not just in poor countries but among a previously middle-class group in western economies.

Trump's first term would probably have seen a version of this week's debacle if he had chosen different advisers, and if he had not later been knocked off course by Covid.

For the first two years of his first term, in 2017-18, his instincts were largely kept in check by his economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, who dampened Trump's determination to use tariffs to end trade deficits.

Cohn engaged in a two-year running argument, compiling a mass of statistics designed to convince a sceptical Trump that the decline of US manufacturing and its replacement by a service economy was largely benign.

He set out how blanket tariffs rebound on American consumers. He explained the link between consumer uncertainty and the stock market. He challenged Trump to explain why he thought tariffs would not be counterproductive. Trump replied that he did not know, but he just did and it was what he had thought for 30 years. At one point, exasperated, Cohn accused Trump of a dangerous nostalgia, saying: “You have a Norman Rockwell view of America” – the artist remembered for his idealised portrait of American workers.

In the end, Cohn found Trump – who once scrawled “trade is bad” as the summation of his thinking for a keynote speech – so immune to evidence, and so determined to impose steel and aluminium tariffs, that he quit, leaving Peter Navarro, a man Cohn regarded as a tariff flat earther, to take the reins.

Vestiges of opposition to Trump's tactics remained inside the Republican party. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska senator, tweeted a now familiar criticism in 2018: “About those new tariffs: Europe, Canada & Mexico aren't China. You don't treat allies the same way you treat opponents. Blanket protectionism is a big part of why we had a Great Depression. ‘Make America Great Again' shouldn't mean ‘Make America 1929 Again'.”

But Trump largely ignored the critics inside his own party. Re-elected in 2024, with Navarro and other tariff supporters reappointed to lead his trade team, Trump was convinced that his key mistake in the first term had been taking any notice of those advising him that globalisation had brought the US unparalleled wealth.

The path was clear for Trump's headlong assault on tariffs, in part because in the four years out of office the anti-globalist tide had appeared to be heading in his direction. Many on the centre left bought the argument that hyperglobalisation did not suit an era of geopolitical conflict.

The Biden administration, for instance, in the name of reindustrialisation and national security, retained many Trump-era tariffs, especially on China, a decision seen as a mistake by a study published this week by Harvard Kennedy School. In the study, Joe Biden's economic advisers Adam Posen and Jonas Nahm argued that the protectionism was excessive.

Since the 2007-08 financial crisis, there has been a steady increase in trade-restricting measures – such as tariffs, non-tariff measures, export controls and investment restrictions – contributing to growing trade fragmentation. In 2024 alone, more than 3,000 trade restrictions were implemented globally.

Some arose from legitimate concern about unfair competition, but much was being driven by deepening geopolitical competition. Countries of all politics have resorted to ever-expanding definitions of national security to screen foreign investment and trade. New language has entered the vocabulary such as “friend or near-shoring”, a term to encourage companies to align their supply chains with the geopolitical interests of their countries.

The call for resilient supply chains was given a spur by the vulnerabilities exposed by Covid, including the west's dependence on a small number of vaccine suppliers.

After the invasion of Ukraine, Russia further exposed the west's supply chain vulnerability by exploiting Europe's dependence on its gas pipelines. Interconnectors designed to bring countries closer, such as undersea data cables, have become targets – from the Baltic Sea to the Taiwan Strait. The war also blew apart the myth that trade brought peace.

As a result, investment screening measures were introduced by governments all over the west empowering them to block takeovers and investments by foreign firms, mainly Chinese in strategic industries.

Rachel Reeves endorsed the trend in a speech in Washington as the UK's shadow chancellor in May 2023. “Globalisation as we know it is dead. Supply chains that prioritise only what is cheapest and fastest struggle when a crisis strikes, be that PPE during Covid or energy following the war in Ukraine.”

In a diagnosis similar to Trump's, Reeves claimed that a globalised system “can be gamed by countries like China who have undercut and ignored the international trading rules and made it impossible for our own to compete”.

Rajan Raghuram, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and ex-governor of India's central bank, has argued that friend-shoring is “resurgent protectionism, cloaked and augmented by new geopolitical rivalries”. He also criticised the initiative as “concentrating production within the gated community of advanced communities”.

Even so, trade as a proportion of GDP – the best measure of economic openness – has not as yet collapsed. In its 2023 report titled Re-globalisation, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said there had been a slowdown in world trade after the financial crash and Covid, but the change may as much be to do with the growth of services, as opposed to goods, in the world economy. Countervailing trends such as digital trade have kept globalisation alive.

The issue now is what can be preserved from the wreckage of the past week, and whether a new coalition of the willing – this time of free traders – can be assembled, if necessary. There is talk of a G6 – the G7 minus the US – going to China to see if an agreement can be found to reduce its trade imbalances, and distorting subsidies, a subject of complaint to the WTO not just by the west but by emerging markets.

But this will require the UK's Labour party to stop briefing that globalisation has failed. In the current context there is no room for nuance, and it risks sounding as if Labour shares Trump's utterly chaotic prescription. This is the time to declare economic populism, and not free trade, dead.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Gen Keith Kellogg appears to suggest Ukraine could be split into zones of control after a peace deal; Trump warns Putin to ‘get moving' ahead of US-Russia talks. What we know on day 1,144

Ukraine could be partitioned like Berlin after the second world war, Donald Trump's envoy to Kyiv has suggested, as Russia continues to hold out on accepting a truce. Gen Keith Kellogg appeared to suggest the country could be split into zones of control, with British and French troops as part of a “reassurance force” in the west and Moscow's forces in the east. Between them would be Ukrainian forces and a demilitarised zone but the US would not provide any ground forces, he claimed. “You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after world war two, when you had a Russian zone, a French zone and a British zone,” he told the Times newspaper. Kyiv is yet to comment on the remarks.

Donald Trump issued a rare warning to Vladimir Putin ahead of talks between the US president's special envoy Steve Witkoff and the Russian president, saying on the Truth Social platform: “Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – A war that should have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!” Putin was shown on state TV greeting Witkoff in St Petersburg's presidential library at the start of the negotiations and state news agencies later said the talks lasted more than four hours. “The theme of the meeting: aspects of a Ukrainian settlement,” the Kremlin said after the meeting. Putin's investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, who was seen in news footage accompanying Witkoff leaving a hotel in the city, called the talks productive, according to Russia's state news agency Tass.

Ukraine's allies promised a record €21bn ($24bn) in additional military support for Kyiv and accused Vladimir Putin of dragging his feet and delaying US-led negotiations over a ceasefire deal, reports Luke Harding. Speaking at a meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group in Brussels, the British defence secretary, John Healey, said: “Putin said he wanted peace but he rejected a full ceasefire. His forces continue to fire on Ukraine, military and civilian targets alike.” The UK and Germany jointly convened Friday's meeting in Ramstein, which was attended by more than 40 countries but not the US, with Trump's defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, joining by video instead.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Ukraine's military allies to focus on air defence, asking them to provide 10 additional Patriot systems. The Ukrainian president told the Ramstein meeting via video that Russian attacks showed Moscow was not ready to implement any realistic and effective peace proposals. Separately, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ready to purchase additional air defence systems, adding that he discussed it with Donald Trump. “Ukraine is not just asking – we are ready to buy appropriate additional systems,” he said in his nightly address on Friday. The government would also strengthen air defences with additional funds for electronic warfare, he said.

US and Ukrainian officials met on Friday on the US proposal to gain access to Ukraine's mineral wealth but prospects for a breakthrough were scant given the meeting's “antagonistic” atmosphere, a source with knowledge of the matter said. The Reuters report quoted the source as saying the strains in the Washington talks stemmed from the Trump administration's “maximalist” latest draft proposal, which is more expansive than the original version. “The negotiating environment is very antagonistic.” A Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed the discussions, calling them “technical in nature”.

Russia launched 88 drones at Ukraine in overnight attacks, the Ukrainian air force said on Saturday, and damage was reported in the centre, east and south of the country. It said Ukraine's air defences shot down 56 of the drones, while 24 drones were “lost” as the military used electronic warfare to redirect them. The Russian defence ministry said earlier that its air defences destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones in the space of 30 minutes late on Friday. Between 10pm and 10.30pm nine drones were destroyed in the Rostov region, on Ukraine's eastern border, and four in the Kursk region, on Ukraine's north border, it said.

More than a hundred Chinese citizens fighting for the Russian military against Ukraine are mercenaries who do not appear to have a direct link to China's government, two US officials familiar with American intelligence and a former western intelligence official said. Chinese military officers had, however, been in the war behind Russia's lines with Beijing's approval to draw tactical lessons from the conflict, the former official said in the Reuters report. The US confirmed on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces had captured two men of Chinese origin in eastern Ukraine after Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country had information about 155 Chinese citizens fighting there on Russia's behalf.

Ukrainian legislators are almost certain to extend martial law again before it expires on 9 May, the parliamentary speaker has said, even as the US and Russia pressure Kyiv to hold a new vote. Ruslan Stefanchuk underlined the legal and practical implausibility of holding free and fair elections in a country that is part-occupied and still under constant attack, while stressing Ukraine's commitment to democratic elections.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Meera Syal also to star in London production reflecting producer's experience of censorship in Georgia

Hidden from view inside a south London warehouse, a new underground movement will be fighting the international blight of misinformation this summer.

The huge immersive event – half theatrical show, half social campaign – is to involve some of Britain's leading acting talent, including Toby Jones and Meera Syal, and has been put together by a theatre company led by a woman who learned about misinformation the hard way, at the Georgian television station Imedi.

Liana Patarkatsishvili, the founder of Sage & Jester productions, still recalls the moment when the independent newsroom was taken over on the orders of the government of Mikheil Saakashvili. Her experiences have influenced her work on the new show, which is due to take place over 9,000 sq metres in an empty building in Deptford.

“I still remember those days clearly,” she told the Observer. “Before the 2007 crackdown in Georgia, independent media faced significant challenges and mounting pressure.”

The debut show, called Storehouse, is due to run from 4 June until 20 September. The story will take place in a fictional storage facility, where humanity's history has been archived since 1983, the dawn of the internet.

In this arena, a “battle between truth and order” will be waged, “as the powerful manipulate the truth to their own ends and critical thinking is the only effective weapon”. Syal, who will voice Dolly K Guha, one of the imagined radical founders of the movement, said: “I'm thrilled to be part of Storehouse. It is an ambitious immersive production that tackles a critical issue.”

The three other founders are played by Jones, whose performances as postmaster Alan Bates in the ITV drama about the Post Office scandal won widespread acclaim, the renowned actor Kathryn Hunter, recently seen in Netflix's Black Doves and in the film Poor Things, and by rising star Billy Howle from the film On Chesil Beach. They will guide visitors through the warehouse and through a cast of live actors.

Patarkatsishvili is keen to show that misinformation is not just the spreading of deliberate falsehoods. “It's also about creating uncertainty and eroding trust,” she said. “This tactic has been used globally, from casting doubt in the media to flooding the public with conflicting narratives. In today's attention economy, news has been commodified, becoming a product that needs to be ‘sold'. It becomes paramount to be able to discern ‘sellable information' and false narratives from facts and being properly factually informed.”

The show will run in tandem with a series of public debates, or critical conversations, that are being held through the summer on the other side of London at the Pleasance theatre. The sessions, staged in collaboration with Intelligence Squared, will be compered by the journalist Sophia Smith Galer.

The discussions are intended to help inform or “inoculate” the audience against misinformation by showing them how it can work. “We want to empower individuals by better understanding the powers at play. A key point for us is to give people a sense of agency, as this topic can make us feel apathetic and disempowered, which ultimately feeds the problem,” said Patarkatsishvili, whose late father, known as Badri, founded the Imedi radio station and television station in Georgia.

Debate, she argues, might be a more conventional way to develop critical thinking skills, but theatre can be more effective. “In its own way, this is what Storehouse aims to do; immerse audiences in a world where they decide what's true,” she said. “The art of storytelling creates empathy and understanding in ways that facts alone cannot. When audiences step inside, they're not just watching a story – they're living it. They're forced to grapple with difficult questions about truth, power, and their own complicity in shaping narratives. Entertainment has always been a powerful tool because it humanises abstract issues and makes them personal.”

Patarkatsishvili's hope is that Storehouse will be “more than a show – it's a call to action”.

“It asks audiences to reflect on their role in today's information ecosystem, and challenges them to take responsibility for the stories they believe and share.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Temperatures exceeding 40C trigger deadly thunderstorms, as Mali agency issues hot weather warning

Northern India has been experiencing early extreme heat this week as temperatures topped 40C (104F), including in the capital, New Delhi.

Hot weather across the north-west of the country peaked on Tuesday as Barmer, a city in the state of Rajasthan, reached 46.4C – more than 6C above the average maximum in April.

New Delhi rose to 40.3C on Wednesday, surpassing 40C for the first time this year. Farther south, Jaipur exceeded 40C for five consecutive days from Sunday, with a maximum temperature of 43C recorded on Wednesday, almost 5C above the average April high.

The Indian meteorology bureau said last week that most parts of the country would experience an intense heatwave this summer, with two to four more such days than normal.

The extreme early heat this week triggered severe thunderstorms across Bihar, including in Patna. At least 19 people have died in the past two days amid frequent lightning, significant hail and strong winds.

There was extensive damage to crops – including wheat, mango and lychee – weeks before the harvest. Stormy conditions are likely to persist across Bihar until Saturday, owing to a low-pressure system over the west-central Bay of Bengal.

Meanwhile, parts of east Africa are experiencing higher-than-average temperatures, which could approach the April record.

In Mali, the national meteorological agency issued an extreme weather warning covering the entire country from Wednesday to Sunday. Maximum temperatures are expected to reach 40-47C for at least three consecutive days.

This is comparable to average temperatures during the height of summer in June and July, whereas April averages tend to be 38-40C. People have been advised to stay indoors during the hottest hours, wear light-coloured clothing, eat foods with high quantities of liquid and drink plenty of water.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Government introduces measure to prevent spread of foot-and-mouth disease after rise in cases across Europe

Tourists from Great Britain who travel to the continent to satisfy their epicurean desires for cured meats and fragrant cheeses will be frustrated in their attempts to bring home some of their favourite foods after a ban on meat and dairy imports from EU countries came into force this weekend.

From Saturday, holidaymakers will no longer be able to bring meat from cattle, sheep, goats or pigs, or dairy products, from EU countries into Great Britain for personal use, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) after a rise in cases across Europe.

Even those attempting to bring sandwiches with offending items such as cheese and ham will be stopped by customs and excise. Cured meats, raw meats and milk are off limits regardless of whether they are packed, packaged or have been bought at duty-free.

FMD does not directly affect humans, but it can be devastating to cattle, and while there are no cases in the UK at present, the government wants to keep it that way.

FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cattle, sheep, pigs, and other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boars and deer.

In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the outbreak in Europe “presents a significant risk to farm businesses and livestock”. The disease can cause “significant economic losses due to production shortfalls in the affected animals, as well as loss of access to foreign markets for animals, meat and dairy”, it added.

Earlier this year, the government placed bans on imports of cattle, sheep, other ruminants, pig meat and dairy products from Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Austria in response to outbreaks of FMD in those countries.

The new restrictions apply only to travellers arriving in Great Britain and will not be imposed on personal imports arriving in Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man.

The minister for food security and rural affairs, Daniel Zeichner, said: “This government will do whatever it takes to protect British farmers from foot-and-mouth. That is why we are further strengthening protections by introducing restrictions on personal meat and dairy imports to prevent the spread of the disease and protect Britain's food security.”

The UK deputy chief veterinary officer for international and trade affairs, Jorge Martin-Almagro, said: “Robust contingency plans are already in place to manage the risk of this disease to protect farmers and Britain's food security. This biosecurity measure, combined with all others we have implemented, are critical to limit the risk of FMD incursion.”

Martin-Almagro urged livestock keepers to keep an eye out for signs of disease, maintain biosecurity, and immediately report any suspicion of disease to the Animal and Plant Health Agency.

There are exemptions from the new rules, including a limited amount of infant milk, medical foods, and certain composite products such as chocolate, confectionery, bread, cakes, biscuits and pasta.

The government said: “Those found with these items will need to either surrender them at the border or will have them seized and destroyed. In serious cases, those found with these items run the risk of incurring fines of up to £5,000 in England.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Resurgence could be on horizon as outbreaks pick up speed in US and abroad amid public health program cuts

As tuberculosis outbreaks pick up speed in the US and abroad amid deep cuts in funding for local, state and international public health programs, a resurgence of the deadliest infectious disease – including drug-resistant tuberculosis – could be on the horizon.

Increasing funding for public health responses could end tuberculosis (TB) altogether, says James Brookes, an IT specialist from Idaho, who told this to his representatives in Congress on Wednesday.

Unlike many advocates, Brookes has no personal connection to tuberculosis. No one he knows has gotten it, and it was not top of mind until fairly recently.

But he has followed John Green, the prominent vlogger and author, and his brother, Hank, on social media for nearly two decades now. When Green created a group called TBFighters, Brookes joined; after Green, along with the non-profit Partners In Health, asked for volunteers to travel to Washington DC, to participate in a TB Hill Day, Brookes booked flights and a hotel.

“I'm looking for a way to help in any way I can. I can help here. I can do this,” Brookes said. “We're a global community, and how the least of us is doing in the world impacts how the best of us is doing.”

About 250 TBFighters gathered in Washington this week to learn more about advances in TB testing, treatment and prevention and to attend a total of 210 meetings with senators, representatives and legislative aides representing 49 states on Capitol Hill.

Organizers were stunned by the response. Last year, only 35 or so advocates attended a handful of TB Hill Day meetings.

Tuberculosis has long suffered a PR problem. Despite impressive advances in treatments and progress toward effective vaccines, it has been championed by only a few dedicated people in the field.

But John Green, as close to a celebrity as authors can get, wants to change that.

“We know how to live in a world without tuberculosis, and that means, ultimately, that we're choosing to live in a world with tuberculosis,” he told TBFighters on Tuesday – an argument underlying his new book, the bestseller Everything Is Tuberculosis. “But all of y'all are making a different choice. And that is my great encouragement.”

While there's an effective cure for TB, developed in the 1950s, it has persisted. It's now known as a disease of poverty that tends to hit hardest among people living with HIV or malnutrition and those with unstable or crowded housing.

“We should have eliminated this scourge decades ago,” Green said.

Kate O'Brien, a television producer, became a TB advocate after contracting the illness in New York while pregnant with her son. She still doesn't know how she got it.

“I truly, truly believe that eliminating this disease is possible,” O'Brien said. “It's just a little fucking money.”

Recent cuts to public health efforts – including the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local and state heath departments – have possibly set back progress on TB by years or decades.

Nick Enrich, a former deputy administrator at USAID, estimated in an agency memo projections of a 28-32% increase in TB cases globally, including drug-resistant TB, which becomes more of a risk as people are unable to access care.

“We are looking at a world whereby, two years from now, 2 million people will die of tuberculosis, instead of 1.25 million,” Green said. “This is getting worse, not better, and I really, really hate it when we have the ability to make something better and we let it get worse.”

For his part, Green and the TBFighters had recent success pushing to lower prices of the drug bedaquiline and diagnostic tests.

“I've mobilized them, but they've also mobilized me,” Green said. They developed a 100-page document about how to respond to the crisis. “I think probably most people weren't aware of tuberculosis, but when they became aware of it, they became very angry, like I did.”

Like Green, Brookes found the more he learned about tuberculosis, the more important it is to fight to keep everyone safe.

“It is the number one infectious disease currently and throughout history, and the only thing stopping us from eradicating it is logistics? Let's end TB and start working on the harder stuff,” Brookes said.

Before this week, he was involved in some local activism; his daughter has cerebral palsy and autism. He is hoping the skills he's learned now will translate into more advocacy for people with disabilities.

“I didn't know how easy it was to just reach out to my senators and be like: ‘Hey, can we have a meeting?' And they just say ‘Yes'?” he said, in disbelief.

Of his daughter, Brookes said: “This is one piece of a larger picture for us just to learn how to advocate for and make a better world for her. The better the health outcomes are for our community and for the world, the more protected she is.”

Brookes was nervous as he walked into the US Senate and House buildings, donning a suit and a pin that read “TB is not over”.

The meetings went much better than he expected. He is now following up with Partners In Health to send more information to his Congress members.

“In a lot of ways, this trip is just the beginning,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

JENA, La. (AP) — Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil can be forced out of the country as a national security risk, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled Friday after lawyers argued the legality of deporting the activist who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

The government's contention that Khalil's presence in the U.S. posed “potentially serious foreign policy consequences” satisfied requirements for deportation, Immigration Judge Jamee E. Comans said at a hearing in Jena.

Comans said the government had “established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.”

After the immigration court hearing, Khalil attorney Marc Van Der Hout told a New Jersey federal judge that Khalil will appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals within weeks.

“So nothing is going to happen quickly,” he said.

Addressing the judge at the end of the immigration hearing, Khalil recalled her saying at a hearing earlier in the week that “there's nothing more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness.”

“Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process,” he added. “This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to the court, 1,000 miles away from my family.”

Van Der Hout, also criticized the hearing's fairness.

“Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent,” Van Der Hout said in a statement.




Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, was detained by federal immigration agents March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned apartment, the first arrest under President Donald Trump's promised crackdown on students who joined campus protests against the war in Gaza. 

Within a day, he was flown across the country to an immigration detention center in Jena, far from his attorneys and wife, a U.S. citizen due to give birth soon. 

Khalil's lawyers have challenged the legality of his detention, saying the Trump administration is trying to block free speech protected by the First Amendment.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited a rarely used statute to justify Khalil's deportation, which gives him power to deport those who pose “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

At Friday's hearing, Van Der Hout told the judge that the government's submissions to the court prove the attempt to deport his client “has nothing to do with foreign policy” and said the government is trying to deport him for protected speech.

Khalil, a Palestinian born and raised in Syria after his grandparents were forcibly removed from their ancestral home in Tiberias, isn't accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia.

The government, however, has said noncitizens who participate in such demonstrations should be expelled from the country for expressing views that the administration considers to be antisemitic and “pro-Hamas,” referring to the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Khalil, a 30-year-old international affairs graduate student, had served as a negotiator and spokesperson for student activists at Columbia University who took over a campus lawn last spring to protest Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

The university summoned police to dismantle the encampment after a small group of protesters seized an administration building. Khalil is not accused of participating in the building occupation and wasn't among those arrested.

But images of his maskless face at protests and his willingness to share his name with reporters have drawn scorn from those who viewed the protesters and their demands as antisemitic. The White House accused Khalil of “siding with terrorists” but has yet to cite any support for the claim.

Federal judges in New York and New Jersey have ordered the government not to deport Khalil while his case plays out in multiple courts.

The Trump administration has said it is taking at least $400 million in federal funding away from research programs at Columbia and its medical center to punish it for not adequately fighting what it considers to be antisemitism on campus.

Some Jewish students and faculty complained about being harassed during the demonstrations or ostracized because of their faith or their support of Israel. 

Immigration authorities have cracked down on other critics of Israel on college campuses, arresting a Georgetown University scholar who had spoken out on social media about the Israel-Gaza war, canceling the student visas of some protesters and deporting a Brown University professor who they said had attended the Lebanon funeral of a leader of Hezbollah, another militant group that has fought with Israel.

Six people were killed when a sightseeing helicopter broke apart and crashed into the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey. Pieces of the aircraft could be seen floating in the river Friday as divers resumed searching for clues as to the cause of Thursday's crash.

NEW YORK (AP) — A New York City sightseeing helicopter broke apart and crashed into the Hudson River near the New Jersey shoreline, killing the pilot and a Spanish family of five who were on board.

Pieces of the aircraft could be seen floating in the river on Friday as divers searched for clues about what caused the Thursday crash. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. It's the latest in a series of recent aircraft crashes and close calls that have left some people worried about the safety of flying in the U.S.

Here's what we know so far:

Witnesses described seeing the helicopter's tail and main rotor breaking away and smoke pouring from the spinning chopper before it slammed into the water.

The helicopter took off from a downtown heliport at around 3 p.m. and flew north along the Manhattan skyline before heading south toward the Statue of Liberty. Less than 18 minutes into the flight, parts of the aircraft were seen tumbling into the water.

Rescue boats circled the submerged aircraft within minutes of impact, and recovery crews hoisted the mangled helicopter out of the water just after 8 p.m. using a floating crane.

The bodies were also recovered from the river, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said.




The victims included passengers Agustin Escobar, 49, his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, 39, and their three children, Victor, 4, Mercedes, 8, and Agustin, 10. Mercedes would have turned 9 on Friday, officials said.

Escobar, an executive at Siemens, was in the New York area on business, and his family flew in to meet him for a few days, Steven Fulop, mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey, wrote in a post on X. Photos on the helicopter company's website show the couple and their children smiling just before taking off.

In a statement posted on the social platform X on Friday night by Joan Camprubí Montal, Montal's brother, family members said there were “no words to describe” what they are experiencing.

“These are very difficult times, but optimism and joy have always characterized our family. We want to keep the memory of a happy and united family, in the sweetest moment of their lives,” he said. “They have departed together, leaving an indelible mark among all their relatives, friends, and acquaintances.”

The pilot was Seankese Johnson, 36, a U.S. Navy veteran who received his commercial pilot's license in 2023. He had logged about 800 hours of flight time as of March, Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters Friday.

In the summer of 2023, Johnson announced on Facebook that he was flying a helicopter to fight fires for a Montana-based firm. In March this year, he changed his profile to an image of him piloting a helicopter with a view of One World Trade Center and the Manhattan skyline in the background. 

His father, Louis Johnson, told The New York Times his son had moved to New York this year for “a new chapter in his life.”

Hemendy said the NTSB would not speculate on the cause of the crash so early in the investigation.

The main and rear rotors of the helicopter, along with its transmission, roof and tail structures had still not been found as of Friday, she said.

“We are very factual, and we will provide that in due course,” she said.

Justin Green, an aviation lawyer and former Marine Corps helicopter pilot, said videos of the crash suggest that a “catastrophic mechanical failure” left the pilot with no chance to save the aircraft. It is possible the helicopter's main rotors struck the tail boom, breaking it apart and causing the cabin to free fall, Green said.

Michael Roth, who owns the helicopter company, New York Helicopter, told The New York Post that he doesn't know what went wrong with the aircraft.

“The only thing I know by watching a video of the helicopter falling down, that the main rotor blades weren't on the helicopter,” he said, noting that he had never seen such a thing happen in his 30 years in the business, but that, “These are machines, and they break.”

In the last eight years, the New York Helicopter has been through a bankruptcy and faces ongoing lawsuits over alleged debts. Phones rang unanswered at the company's offices Friday.

In 2013, one of the company's helicopters suddenly lost power in midair, and the pilot maneuvered it to a safe landing on pontoons in the Hudson. 

FAA data shows the helicopter that crashed Thursday was built in 2004. According to FAA records, the helicopter had a maintenance issue last September involving its transmission assembly. The helicopter had logged 12,728 total flight hours at the time, according to the records.

At least 38 people have died in helicopter crashes in New York City since 1977. A collision between a plane and a tourist helicopter over the Hudson in 2009 killed nine people, and five people died in 2018 when a charter helicopter offering “open door” flights went down into the East River.

Thursday's crash was the first for a helicopter in the city since one hit the roof of a skyscraper in 2019, killing the pilot.

Recently, seven people were killed when a medical transport plane plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood. The crash in January happened two days after an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter collided in midair in Washington in the deadliest U.S. air disaster in a generation. 

On Friday, three people were killed when a small plane crashed in South Florida near a major highway.

AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — The end of a long Friday that reshaped the Masters had Scottie Scheffler sitting in the pine straw under a magnolia tree left of the 18th fairway, waiting for a rules official but looking very much like someone who simply needed to catch his breath.

Rest up for a weekend at Augusta National that doesn't figure to lack for drama.

It starts with Justin Rose, who did just enough in his round of 1-under 71 to be the 36-hole leader for the third time in his career as the 44-year-old from England tries to become the second-oldest Masters champion behind Jack Nicklaus (46).

The leading role returns to Rory McIlroy, who came to life with a birdie-birdie-par-eagle start to the back nine. Maybe that's where his Masters started, because he roared into contention with a bogey-free 66 that renewed hopes of a green jacket to complete the career Grand Slam.

U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau might have learned to putt the Augusta National greens, a scary proposition for someone who already knows how to bash the golf ball. He shot 68 and was a shot behind Rose in his best start ever at the Masters.

And Scheffler?

The defending Masters champion did his best to survive the worst of the conditions, mainly wind that caused a little discomfort and a lot of uncertainty. He made five bogeys over his last 12 holes, the last one by going from under the magnolia, back to the fairway, over the green and then hitting a superb chip to limit the damage. 




All that and he was only three behind after a 71.

“We've got a great golf course, conditions should be really good, challenging, and we've got some great guys on top of the leaderboard,” Scheffler said. “So it should be a fun weekend.”

Indeed.

Sixteen players were separated by five shots at the halfway point, nine of them major champions, three of them with experience winning at Augusta National.

“The leaderboard is stacking up very favorably for what looks like world-class players right up there,” Rose said after a round that featured birdies on the par 5s on the front nine and on the par 3s on the back nine. 

Rose took a three-shot lead into the second round and had the advantage of playing early, before the wind became strong enough to make flags snap and create just enough indecision. He hit a 9-iron over Rae's Creek to 4 feet for birdie on the par-3 12th, and he stuffed his tee shot on the par-3 16th for another birdie. That allowed him to atone for a few mistakes.

He was at 8-under 136, the third time he has had the 36-hole lead at the Masters.

The buzz came from behind him.

DeChambeau picked up an unlikely birdie by holing a bunker shot on the par-3 fourth hole on his way to a 32 on the front nine that kept him on Rose's heels the rest of the way.

“This is what golf is about,” DeChambeau said. “Got a lot of great names up there, and looking forward to an unbelievable test of golf.”

And then there was McIlroy, who had two double bogeys over the last four holes Thursday, the latest frustrating chapter for him at the Masters. This time, he managed to forget about it and move on. He went birdie-birdie-par-eagle to start the back nine and was on his way to a bogey-free 66.

“I had to remind myself I was playing well,” McIlroy said. “I couldn't let two bad holes dictate the narrative of the 16 good ones. I also had to remind myself this morning not to push too hard too early.”

Corey Conners of Canada quietly put together a 70 and joined McIlroy at 6-under 138.

The group three shots back included Scheffler (71), former British Open champion Shane Lowry (68) and Tyrrell Hatton, who got within one shot of Rose until a pair of three-putts. One of them did a U-turn down the hill at the 16th. The other was a sleepy tap-in that lipped out.

It shapes up for a wide-open weekend, led by a 44-year-old from England who has gone a dozen years since winning his only major at the 2013 U.S. Open. Rose spoke last year about finding another stretch of magic in his career, and opportunity awaits.

“This is nice to be back in that mix.”

McIlroy was thrilled, too. There was plenty of temptation to come out firing, but that's what he did in 2023 when he played Friday afternoon and saw he faced a 10-shot deficit. He tried to charge and wound up charging right out of the parking lot after missing the cut.

This time, he played the front nine with one birdie and eight pars. But he came to life quickly, stuffing a three-quarter 8-iron to a foot on No. 10 and a similar play with a 9-iron to about 4 feet on No. 11. Best of all was hitting 4-iron off the pine straw on the par-5 13th that narrowly cleared the tributary of Rae's Creek and set up a 10-foot eagle.

“Things sort of clicked into gear on the back nine,” McIlroy said.

Scheffler and Tyrrell Hatton faced the worst of the wind. Scheffler's tee shot on the par-3 12th sailed into the azaleas over the green, bounced out and he chipped in for birdie. He played with limited stress one day, and it felt like chaos the next.

“Golf is a funny game. It's a day-to-day thing. Yesterday I felt really sharp. Today not as sharp,” Scheffler said. “Could the conditions have contributed to that? I'm sure a little bit. It was definitely much harder to hit the ball where you were looking today just because the wind was blowing from everywhere.”

The cut was at 2-over 146, marking the end of 67-year-old Bernhard Langer's career at the Masters. He needed to make a 10-foot par putt on the last hole, only for it to tickle the right side of the cup.

Five-time major champion Brooks Koepka might have had the most shocking departure. He was in good shape, needing a bogey on the 18th. He made a quadruple bogey, starting with a tee shot into the trees and ending with a three-putt from 10 feet.

Now the attentions shifts back to the top.

“You're going to have to play great golf, and you're going to have to go out there and want it and go for it and get after it,” Rose said. “It's as simple as that, really.”

President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet at the White House amid reciprocal tariffs uproar, and the president addresses a wide range of questions.

Nearly a month into Israel's renewed ground operation, U.S. backing appears to be shaping the conflict on multiple levels—militarily, diplomatically and politically. Israeli officials have suggested the chances of a hostage deal have significantly increased, with some anticipating developments within the next two weeks.

On Monday, sitting beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump told reporters, ""We are trying very hard to get the hostages out. We're looking at another ceasefire. We'll see what happens."" The remarks highlighted Trump's dual-track approach: continued diplomatic pressure on Iran and direct support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza. 

With what Israeli officials describe as a ""free hand"" to operate, Israel has expanded its offensive into Rafah and the strategically significant Morag Corridor. The stated aim is to increase pressure on Hamas and help secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages.

ISRAEL LAUNCHES NEW GROUND OPERATION IN GAZA

A senior Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that the campaign is being carried out in close coordination with the United States. ""Everything is coordinated with the Americans — both the negotiations and the operational activity. The goal is to bring the hostages home. We now have a free hand to act, and no longer facing the threat of a veto at the UN Security Council, unlike during the previous administration.""

The same official pointed to a shift in humanitarian policy that, in their view, has enhanced Israeli leverage. ""Unlike the previous administration, the U.S. is not forcing 350 aid trucks into Gaza every day. That gives us leverage,"" the official said, adding that limiting aid reduces Hamas's ability to control the population.

On Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced the IDF had completed the takeover of the Morag Axis. The Morag Corridor — which separates Rafah from Khan Younis — is part of an effort to establish a new buffer zone and degrade Hamas's operational capabilities. ""The logic is that the more territory Hamas loses, the more likely it will be to compromise on a hostage deal,"" the official said.

IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir reinforced that strategy during a visit to front-line units this week. ""I expect you to defeat the Rafah Brigade and lead to victory wherever you are fighting,"" he told troops. The IDF had previously declared the Rafah Brigade dismantled in September, but forces have returned to key strongholds, where tunnel networks remain.

HAMAS LAUNCHES FIRST ATTACK ON ISRAEL SINCE CEASEFIRE COLLAPSE

In the same statement on Saturday, Katz warned Gazans, ""Hamas is unable to protect the residents or the territory. Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with their families or living in luxury hotels abroad, with billions in bank accounts, using you as human shields. Now is the time to rise up, to get rid of Hamas, and to release all the Israeli hostages — that is the only way to stop the war.""

In their Oval Office meeting, Trump and Netanyahu reiterated their alignment on core issues. Netanyahu stated that Gazans should be ""free to choose to go wherever they want,"" in what some analysts view as a reference to renewed discussions about third-country resettlement. Trump went further, floating the idea of a U.S. presence in the Strip, noting, ""Gaza is an incredible piece of important real estate. Having a peace force like the United States there, controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing.""

Javed Ali, a former senior director at the U.S. National Security Council and now a professor at the University of Michigan, offered a more measured view of the current military strategy. ""Now that we're almost a full month into the resumption of high-intensity IDF operations in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, Israel's military strategy appears to be focused on clearing and holding remaining pockets of known Hamas elements, which at the same time is displacing Palestinians throughout the territory.""

CEASEFIRE OVER AS ISRAEL STRIKES GAZA AFTER HAMAS REFUSED TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, OFFICIALS SAY

Ali said it remains unclear how Israel intends to manage or govern areas it clears. He drew comparisons to the U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""The U.S. encountered its own challenges in the post-9/11 wars with similar 'clear and hold' approaches, since insurgent and jihadist elements in both conflicts utilized guerrilla warfare tactics and terrorist attacks.""

While the Biden administration had previously emphasized humanitarian access, Ali noted that the current White House has not publicly pressed Israel to scale back its operations. ""That could change,"" he said, particularly as humanitarian conditions worsen or if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program progress. ""If those talks gain momentum, Iran may pressure the U.S. to rein in Israel's campaign against Hamas to preserve what remains of the group. Whether the U.S. team, led by Steve Witkoff, entertains such demands will be a key regional development to watch.""

On the ground, Israel has moved to reshape the humanitarian landscape in Gaza. The decision to restrict Hamas's access to aid reflects a broader policy shift under IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reversed his predecessor's stance and authorized the military to directly oversee the distribution of supplies. ""Hamas will not regain control over the aid, because that was its lifeline,"" an Israeli security official explained. ""It's what allowed it to maintain control over the territory throughout this period. People in Gaza know that Hamas controls the aid; if they realize that Hamas no longer does, its control within the Strip becomes ineffective.""

Humanitarian organizations and international leaders continue to condemn Israel. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, speaking on April 8, condemned the ongoing blockade of aid. ""More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. Gaza is a killing field — and civilians are in an endless death loop,"" he said.

Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, strongly rejected the Secretary-General's claims. ""As always, you don't let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel,"" he posted on X. ""There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip — over 25,000 aid trucks have entered during the 42 days of the ceasefire. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine. Yet, not a word in your statement about the imperative for Hamas to leave Gaza. The people of Gaza are braver than you — they're calling, loud and clear, on Hamas to leave and stop abusing them.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz (Israeli PM)

Eugene Kontorovich, a senior legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital: ""One doesn't need the Israeli Supreme Court to say there is no starvation in Gaza — this was admitted by the UN's own Food Security Phase Classification, which in June found that prior UN reports were inaccurate and that there is no famine. There is no serious evidence of starvation in Gaza, and what food scarcity does exist can be attributed to Hamas pillaging and hoarding aid. As the truth comes out, it becomes clear that the starvation claims were designed to halt Israel's legitimate self-defense against a genocidal attack.""

As military and diplomatic tracks converge, Israeli officials remain cautiously optimistic that talks may soon produce results.

MLB umpire Mark Ripperger is receiving praise for how he called a recent game.

Ripperger was behind home plate for Thursday's game between the Kansas City Royals and the Minnesota Twins. While the Royals' shortstop Bobby Witt Jr.'s sacrifice fly broke the tie in the seventh inning, much of the talk after the game was about Ripperger.

The umpire was credited with calling a ""perfect game,"" which is something that reportedly has happened just one other time in the Umpire Scorecards era.

Umpire Scorecards compile the major league's advanced pitch-tracking data to rate how accurate an umpire was during a given game. The data also considers how an umpire's call impacts the game. 

Ripperger made calls for 136 pitches on Thursday. According to Umpire Scorecards metrics, he called every pitch accurately.

Kansas City trailed Minnesota by a run on Thursday before rallying in the seventh inning. Royals starter Michael Wacha pitched 5.1 innings, giving up two earned runs. He also struck out four batters.

Emmanuel Acho, LeSean McCoy, James Jones and Chase Daniel debate whether Steph Curry or LeBron James needs another NBA Finals run more ahead of tonight's Los Angeles Lakers-Golden State Warriors matchup. 

Basketball Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas took exception to LeBron James shooting shirtless before the Los Angeles Lakers took on the Houston Rockets on Friday night.

Thomas, an analyst for NBA TV, took issue with James' alleged lack of professionalism as he warmed up.

""I just totally 100% object to this,"" Thomas said. ""If I were the GM or coach, I would never let one of my players walk out on the floor looking like this. I mean, we're a professional NBA league. We ain't summer league. We ain't at the YMCA.""

Thomas agreed with Steve Smith when he said he thought the NBA should go back to making players wear suits.

""I just think the professionalism in our NBA league has diminished so much,"" he continued. ""Look, I like LeBron, I'm a fan of his so forth and so on. But to walk out on the floor before a game with no shirt on and shoot – I mean come on man. Where we at? What we doing?

""Adam Silver, if you want to fine somebody, fine that. Put a fine on that.""

James appeared to respond to Thomas' comment in a post on X after the Lakers won the game, 140-109.

""Man I was going to say something but it's useless at this point in my career! Anyways more important CONGRATULATIONS JJ on a 50 win season in the WEST & Post Season nod!"" he wrote.

Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul reports on Moscow's release of a U.S.-Russia dual national who was jailed over a pro-Ukraine donation on 'Special Report.'

At least 26 Americans held hostage abroad have been freed since President Donald Trump entered the Oval Office in January. Those who gained their freedom include a ballerina, a teacher and a mechanic, among others.

On Jan. 21, 2025, just one day after Trump's second term began, Ryan Corbett and William McKenty were released from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan. While Corbett and McKenty were freed under Trump, the deal that secured their release was completed by the Biden administration.

Corbett and his family moved to Afghanistan in 2010, where they lived in Kabul and Jalalabad. According to a website set up by his family, Corbett did work for NGOs, which focused on education, birth and life-saving skills. He also started a project in 2017, Bloom Afghanistan, with the goal of strengthening the country's private sector. In 2021, the Corbett family evacuated as the Taliban took control of the country. Corbett returned to Afghanistan a year later and was captured by the Taliban, which his family suspects was because of his ""value as political leverage.""

There aren't many details on McKenty or exactly why he was in Afghanistan. According to the BBC, his family asked for privacy.

2 AMERICANS RELEASED IN EXCHANGE FOR TALIBAN PRISONER

Anastasia Nuhfer, who was detained in Belarus during the Biden administration, gained her freedom Jan. 26, 2025. While Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Nuhfer's release, he did not give details on when she was detained or why. However, according to The Associated Press, a former high-ranking Belarusian official said the arrest was linked to 2020 protests against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. 

Special envoy Ric Grenell secured the release of six Americans after meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Grenell posted a photo of himself and the men on a plane and said that they ""couldn't stop thanking"" Trump when speaking to him on the phone. The men were not identified.

On April 8, Siegel, who has credited Trump with saving his life, thanked the president during an NRCC event in Washington, D.C.

""President Trump, I am here, and I am alive. President Trump, you saved my life,"" Siegel said. He also asked Trump to continue working to secure the freedom of the 59 remaining hostages in Gaza.

American schoolteacher Marc Fogel was released from Russian captivity Feb. 11, 2025, more than three years after he was detained. Fogel was carrying less than one ounce of medical marijuana, according to his family's website, which he used for severe pain. The Fogel family criticized former President Joe Biden's handling of Marc's case, especially in light of his work to release WNBA player Brittney Griner, who was also arrested for having marijuana. 

On July 13, 2024, Fogel's mother, Malphine, attended a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Marc's hometown. She spoke with Trump, who promised to bring her son home.

Trump invited Marc and Malphine to attend his address to a joint session of Congress in March 2025.

On Feb. 12, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that an American ""unjustly detained in Belarus"" had been released. The statement did not include details or identifying information about the hostage. In a press release, Rubio affirmed the administration's commitment to releasing Americans held hostage across the globe.

On Oct. 7, 2023, Israeli American Sagui Dekel-Chen was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists from his home at Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was shot in the shoulder during the massacre and endured torture while in captivity.

Dekel-Chen spent almost 500 days as a hostage in Gaza and gained his freedom in February 2025. While he was in captivity, his wife gave birth to their third child. He only learned about his daughter's birth after being released.

On March 13, 2025, 10 unidentified Americans, including veterans and military contractors, were released from captivity in Kuwait. According to The Associated Press, the American citizens were detained on drug charges.

Delta Airlines mechanic George Glezmann spent more than two years as a hostage in Gaza after being detained by the Taliban in December 2022. According to senators John Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, both Democrats from Georgia, Glezmann went to ""Afghanistan for a five-day trip to explore the cultural landscape and rich history of the country."" The two senators advocated for Glezmann's release, which eventually occurred March 20, 2025.

Tom Brady threw footballs to fans at the American Dream in New Jersey as he opened up a new CardVault store at the mall.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – Tom Brady rarely heard cheers when he was in New Jersey playing in the NFL but the environment at the American Dream on Friday night was completely different than what it was at MetLife Stadium during his career.

The seven-time Super Bowl champion opened a CardVault by Tom Brady premium trading card store at the American Dream. It's the first flagship store located outside of the Boston Area.

Brady fans wearing New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers gear flocked to the enormous shopping center and filled all three levels just to get a glimpse of the legendary quarterback. He spoke to co-founder Chris Costa for a brief Q&A session before he had a treat for the fans.

He showed off his legendary arm, firing footballs into the crowd – not showing any signs of rust. Fans were extremely excited about the possibility of catching a football from one of the greatest players of all time.

Brady spoke about some of the favorite trading cards in his collections. One, a dual autograph with San Francisco 49ers legend Joe Montana, and the other he has of teammates Randy Moss, Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski and Wes Welker.

He talked about his admiration for Montana first.

""The San Francisco 49ers were the team to beat in the NFL and they had a tremendous run from the early 80s through the late 90s – they were a dynasty. When you grow up in the Bay Area and you have that, it gives you a lot of reasons to love sports and love football,"" he said. ""And that's when I fell in love with football, because of Joe Montana. And he's still my idol today.

""He was an incredible quarterback and he set the tone every single day for what greatness really looks like. And every pro football player, every quarterback that's ever played in the NFL understands how talented and how poised this guy was. This guy was a champion – four Super Bowl wins in for Super Bowl appearances. Nobody performed in Super Bowls as great as this guy and the fact that I'm on a card with him signed, it had to be in my collection.""

Brady then talked about how he needed to rely on his teammates when the Patriots came back to defeat the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI.

The Patriots famously trailed 28-3 when they stormed back to stun the Falcons and win the Super Bowl title in overtime.

""It's 2016, the end of the season, came down to one game against the Falcons and it was pretty rough being down 28-3,"" he recalled. ""But I had a group of teammates that never quit and we did fight to the end. We played our butts off for the last 18 minutes of that game and went from what would have been the toughest loss of my career to the greatest victory that maybe the sport has even seen.

""And we get to make jokes with Falcons fans for the rest of our lives.""

The Navy recently deployed another warship, which successfully repelled multiple Iranian-backed Houthi attacks, to secure the southern border.

USS Stockdale, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, left Naval Base San Diego on Friday to support U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) southern border operations, in accordance with President Donald Trump's recent executive orders.

The executive orders included a national emergency declaration and clarification of the military's role in protecting the territorial integrity of the U.S.

""Stockdale's departure reinforces the Navy's role in the Department of Defense's coordinated efforts to comply with the order,"" according to a statement from the Navy.

The ship will continue operations with an embarked U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment. 

In February, Stockdale returned to San Diego after a seven-month independent deployment to the U.S. 3rd, 5th and 7th Fleet areas of operation.

It joined the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and remained in 5th Fleet following the departure of the ABECSG.

While in the 5th Fleet, Stockdale ""successfully repelled multiple Iranian-backed Houthi attacks"" during transits of the Bab el-Mandeb strait and escorted operations of U.S.-flagged vessels in the Gulf of Aden, according to the Navy. 

It also engaged and defeated one-way attack uncrewed aerial-ship cruise missiles, according to officials.

As impressive as this technology is, it's impossible to ignore the concerns it raises. For some, the FlashBot Arm represents progress — streamlining tasks and enhancing services in ways that were once unimaginable. For others, it's a sign of growing automation that could displace human workers, particularly in roles traditionally filled by manual labor. While robots like the FlashBot Arm can create new opportunities in areas like maintenance and programming, they also bring the risk of job displacement for those without access to retraining or alternative career paths. The reality is that automation isn't going away — it's expanding. But its adoption isn't instantaneous, giving us time to adapt and find ways to balance innovation with workforce stability.

Tech expert Kurt ‘CyberGuy' Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software.

All Windows PCs come with a built-in security feature called Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), which helps prevent unauthorized software from running by allowing only trusted applications. 

However, despite its purpose, hackers have discovered several ways to bypass WDAC, exposing systems to malware, ransomware and other cyber threats. 

As a result, what was once considered a strong layer of defense may now serve as a potential vulnerability if not properly managed.

Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is a security feature in Windows that enforces strict rules about which applications can run. It helps block unauthorized software, but researchers have found ways to bypass these protections.

Bobby Cooke, a red team operator at IBM X-Force Red, confirmed that Microsoft Teams could be used as a WDAC bypass. He explained that during Red Team Operations, they were able to get around WDAC and execute their Stage 2 Command and Control payload.

To find and fix these security gaps, Microsoft runs a bug bounty program that rewards researchers for reporting vulnerabilities in WDAC and other security components. However, some bypass techniques go unpatched for long periods.

DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS

One of the key ways attackers get around WDAC is by using Living-off-the-Land Binaries, or LOLBins. These are legitimate system tools that come pre-installed with Windows, but hackers can repurpose them to execute unauthorized code while avoiding security detection. Since these tools are trusted by the system, they provide an easy way to slip past defenses.

Some bypass techniques involve DLL sideloading, where attackers trick legitimate applications into loading malicious DLLs instead of the intended ones. Additionally, if WDAC policies are not enforced properly, attackers can modify execution rules to allow unauthorized software to run.

Hackers also use unsigned or loosely signed binaries. WDAC relies on code signing to verify an application's authenticity. However, attackers sometimes exploit misconfigurations where loosely signed or unsigned binaries are mistakenly allowed, letting them execute malicious payloads.

Once an attacker bypasses WDAC, they can execute payloads without being flagged by traditional security solutions. This means they can deploy ransomware, install backdoors, or move laterally within a network without triggering immediate suspicion. Since many of these attacks use built-in Windows tools, detecting malicious activity becomes even more difficult.

RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID

Since this attack exploits a vulnerability within WDAC, there is little you can do to fully protect yourself. It is up to Microsoft to fix the issue. However, here are three best practices you can follow to reduce your risk.

1. Keep Windows updated: Microsoft regularly releases security updates that patch vulnerabilities, including those related to WDAC. Keeping Windows and Microsoft Defender up to date ensures you have the latest protection against known threats. If you're not sure how to do that, see my guide on how to keep all your devices and apps updated.

2. Be cautious with software downloads: Only install applications from trusted sources like the Microsoft Store or official vendor websites. Avoid pirated software, as it can come bundled with malicious code that bypasses security protections like WDAC.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

3. Use strong antivirus software: Based on the report, it does not appear that hackers require user interaction to bypass WDAC. The methods described suggest that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities without direct user input, especially if they already have some level of access to the system.

However, in real-world scenarios, attackers often combine such exploits with social engineering or phishing to gain initial access. For example, if an attacker gains access through a phishing attack, they might then use WDAC bypass methods to execute further malicious payloads. 

So, while direct user input may not be necessary for some bypass techniques, attackers often use user actions as an entry point before exploiting WDAC vulnerabilities. The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to have a strong antivirus software installed. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC

While Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) offers a valuable layer of security, it isn't foolproof. Hackers are actively developing and using WDAC bypass techniques to exploit gaps in system defenses. Understanding how WDAC bypass works is essential to protecting your devices. By keeping your software up to date, using trusted applications, and relying on reputable security tools, you can significantly lower your risk.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The CEO of Microsoft AI has some 'sort of obvious' advice for young people looking to succeed","https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-advice-young-people-2025-4","Sat, 12 Apr 2025 11:06:00 GMT","

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman expects the workers of the future to develop close relationships with artificial intelligence agents, to the point of symbiosis.

""I do think your day-to-day workflow just isn't going to look like this in 10 or 15 years time,"" Suleyman said on a recent episode of the ""Big Technology"" Podcast.

""It's going to be much more about you managing your AI agent, you asking it to go do things, checking in on its quality, getting feedback, and getting into this symbiotic relationship where you iterate with it,"" he said.

Suleyman, the cofounder of Google DeepMind, believes that people are too tied up in the ""day-to-day"" of AI and failing to reckon with its possible long-term impacts.

""After all, it is intelligence that has produced everything that is of value in our human civilization,"" Suleyman said. ""Everything around us is a product of smart human beings getting together, organizing, creating, inventing, and producing everything that you see in your line of sight at this very moment.""

Artificial intelligence, shrouded in its fair share of hype, hasn't yet delivered on the vision often painted by tech leaders — such as breakthroughs in medicine, like treatments for deadly diseases, or solutions to the climate crisis.

But the technology has certainly begun to alter the world we live in. In some cases, applications of the technology have drawn concerns  — such as AI's use in warfare or companies leaning on AI agents over human workers. Demis Hassabis, who co-founded Google DeepMind with Suleyman, has gone so far as to say he worries about ending up like Robert Oppenheimer.

And there's no going back now — Suleyman, who's particularly optimistic about AI's future effects, only expects the pace of innovation to increase.

""And we're now about to make that very same technique, those set of capabilities, really cheap — if not, like, zero marginal cost,"" he said.

In order for younger generations to best prepare themselves to inherit a changed world, Suleyman suggests they familiarize themselves with the technology.

""It's a little bit like saying, 'What should young people do when they get access to the internet for the first time?'"" he said. ""Like, part of it is sort of obvious, where it's like — use it, experiment, try stuff out, do crazy things, make mistakes, get it wrong.""

It's technology's users, Suleyman added, rather than its creators, that ultimately help determine the direction of its future development by identifying how it's best used.

""As we've seen over and over in the history of technology, the things that people choose to do with their phones, with internet, with their laptops, with the tools that they have are always like mind-blowing,"" Suleyman said. ""They're always way more inventive and surprising than anything you could possibly think of ahead of time.""

""I think the same applies to a 15-year-old who's in high school, thinking about what they do next in college or whatever, or whether or not they go to college,"" he added.

In order to sort through the noise, Suleyman said, anyone curious should experiment with the models themselves.

""I think the answer is, play with these things,"" he said. ""Try them out, keep an open mind. Try everything that you possibly can with these models, and then you'll start to see their weaknesses as well, by the way, and you'll start to chip away at the hype.""

Big ambitions clashed with delays, cost overruns, and political controversy.

The lavish Saudi TV drama ""Muawiya"" debuted in March, just in time to ride the surge in TV viewership that hits the region around Ramadan each year. One of the most expensive Arab series ever made, it portrays seventh-century life in the desert, with sweeping overhead shots, charging armies on horseback, and massive flotillas.

""Muawiya"" was a ratings hit, but behind the dazzling visuals, it had problems emblematic of Saudi Arabia's broader TV and movie struggles.

The 30-episode series from MBC Studios, Saudi Arabia's marquee TV and movie studio, faced years of delays and a ballooning budget, two people familiar with the production told Business Insider. The budget had reached more than $50 million by the time of a previously unreported internal audit dated December 2022, which was viewed by BI.

The show also sparked a religious uproar, particularly among Shiite Muslims, and was banned in Iran and Iraq.

""It's super edgy, super sensitive,"" said Mazen Hayek, who worked for 14 years as a spokesperson for MBC Group — the majority Saudi government-owned parent of MBC Studios — and is now a media consultant based in Dubai.

""Muawiya"" centers on the life of Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan, a figure in early Islam who is generally held in high esteem in the Sunni Muslim world — including Saudi Arabia — but loathed by many Shiites. The show, in part, dramatizes the events in the years after the death of the Prophet Muhammad that propelled the two groups into the religious rift that endures to this day.

""Muawiya's"" problems are familiar to MBC Studios. Delays, cost overruns, and political land mines have hampered its ambitious projects for years, according to the audit and BI's conversations with people who have worked for and with the company.

MBC Studios was a key part of Saudi Arabia's plan, unveiled in 2018, to spend $64 billion on entertainment projects and venues at home, largely funded by its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. But five people close to the company said it hasn't lived up to its aspirations to be a calling card for the country's film and TV prowess.

MBC Group founded the studio in 2018 and brought in a former NBCUniversal exec to run it. MBC Studios soon began to jump into projects at a dizzying pace. By the time of the 2022 audit, it had over 100 projects in various stages of production. The audit, which ran over 50 pages, said that while the studio was growing fast, it was undermined by unclear strategy, disorganization, and a lack of internal controls.

The audit identified a litany of issues, including consultants hired without oversight, conflicts of interest, a lack of market research, and companies chosen outside a competitive process.

It recommended tightening production practices to avoid overspending, hiring competitively, and monitoring projects' performance.

Since that time, MBC Studios has had some wins, particularly with local-language productions.

The five people close to the company told BI it has scaled back some of its original production ambitions, however. They said it's also been plagued by leadership shake-ups and jettisoned a series of Hollywood experts brought on to take its operations to the next level.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's other big entertainment bet besides MBC Studios, Neom Media — the filmmaking facility in its futuristic city of Neom — has seen some similar problems. It has faced leadership turnover and fallen off the radar in Hollywood, multiple industry insiders said.

Neom Media said in a statement that it's hosted 40 productions from Hollywood and elsewhere and has plans for more.

""They have a fast-growing local sector that caters toward a local audience,"" one person who works in the region said broadly of Saudi Arabia's entertainment efforts, the two most prominent of which are MBC Studios and Neom Media. But, this person added, ""They're yet to convince the international community that they can make first-class entertainment on the ground.""

MBC Studios didn't provide comment by press time following multiple requests.

MBC Studios' first two big swings in the movie business disappointed.

""Kandahar,"" the action film the studio funded starring Gerard Butler, and one of the first US films to be shot in Saudi Arabia, was released in 2023 to tepid reviews and a lackluster box office.

Another, the unreleased ""Desert Warrior,"" has been stymied by rising costs and delays.

Directed by British filmmaker Rupert Wyatt, who also made ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" ""Desert Warrior"" was the first feature film shot at Neom Media. By the time of the 2022 audit, the budget had reached $140 million. People familiar with the financing characterized that as double its original budget.

Some of the added costs, such as COVID protocols, were due to timing. Others were self-imposed. Infrastructure had to be built in the desert, and crew had to be flown in from other countries. The film went big on talent, enlisting Anthony Mackie of Marvel movie fame and Oscar winner Ben Kingsley, in addition to local stars.

Insiders said fights over creative direction and the film's length also hung up production. Filming ended in 2022, but there's been no festival premiere — the film will miss out on another Cannes Film Festival premiere this year — and the movie has yet to get a release date. That type of delay would be virtually unheard of in Hollywood.

MBC Studios has had some local success stories, like ""Rashash,"" a show about a notorious criminal figure in Saudi Arabia that was well received, and ""Inheritance,"" billed as the first Arab soap opera.

But Sheikh Waleed Al Ibrahim — the politically connected founder of MBC Group — also wanted to make projects about historical events, which often courted controversy.

In addition to ""Muawiya,"" there was ""Embassy 87,"" which revisited the deadly 1987 clash between Saudi police and Iranian pilgrims at Mecca. It was shelved. Then there was ""Flight 422,"" about the hijacking of a Kuwaiti flight by Hezbollah. That one was removed from streaming after Kuwait demanded it be taken down.

Hayek, the media consultant, said MBC Studios has to strike a tricky balance. It needs to embrace edgy topics to be relevant to audiences and fend off competitors like Netflix and Amazon Prime. That means standing up to ""extremists"" and ""ultra-conservatives"" who want to censor its content, Hayek said. But it can't go too far.

""You don't push the envelope to the extreme of creating turbulence in society,"" he said.

Despite these challenges, in early 2024, MBC Group undertook an IPO, part of a boom of other Saudi public offerings. It was considered a big success, raising $222 million and valuing the company at nearly $3 billion.

A prospectus promoting the offering touted the studio's relationships with Hollywood and its hiring of international talent. Behind the scenes, however, MBC Studios was pulling away from Hollywood, four people close to the company said.

Since the IPO, MBC Studios has cut ties with many of the international players it leaned on. Those included the former Amazon exec who led its film and TV efforts, its head of global series, an Oscar-nominated producer, its longtime distributor, and talent giant CAA.

The studio is now run by a veteran MBC executive, Samar Akrouk, and has cut back its ambitions to focus on lower-risk dramas and comedies, particularly productions for Shahid, its streaming service.

""They're focused more on local language programs with local language budgets and putting the 'Desert Warriors' and 'Kandahars' on the back burner,"" a person who has worked with the company said.

It's also a time of transition at parent MBC Group, which replaced its CEO in early April.

As MBC Studios has withdrawn from Hollywood, Neom Media has also faced challenges in attracting global productions.

Industry insiders describe its facilities as top-notch but say its rebate of up to 40% on production costs — cash grants given to incentivize international and other productions to film there — is still unproven and hard to apply for. Those who get it could find the rebate benefit wiped out by the need to fly in crew members. Between Ramadan and the summer months, when the temperature exceeds 100 degrees Fahrenheit, shooting can be difficult for a quarter of the year.

Filmmakers wanting a desert landscape may kick the tires on Saudi Arabia but often end up going to more established filmmaking locales like Jordan, Morocco, or Abu Dhabi, where ""Dune: Part Two"" was shot. Some are put off by Saudi Arabia's alcohol ban.

Turmoil at the top can't have helped. Wayne Borg, an Australian exec who was tapped to run Neom Media, was replaced in September after a Wall Street Journal report alleged he made racist and sexist comments about workers. Borg did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

""They've created the highway but haven't gotten the cars yet,"" said one top Hollywood agent who's worked extensively in the region.

Neom Media said it's in advanced discussions with unspecified international productions to film there in 2025. It touted the quality of its facilities and ease of production.

""We're not just attracting international productions; we're also becoming a hub for regional content and international content, with projects in the pipeline,"" Michael Lynch, another Australian exec who now leads Neom Media, said in a statement.

Some people who have done business in the region preached patience. They compared Saudi Arabia's efforts to China's and Qatar's moves into entertainment and emphasized that it takes decades to build such a business. They said they see progress in Saudi Arabia, especially considering it didn't even have movie theaters until 2018.

""It would be unrealistic to expect fast results,"" someone who has worked in the country said. ""They really are at the start of the journey.""

Donald Trump has — for now — backed off of his steepest tariff increases. But with other duties still in place, doing business in the US is about to get costlier for EU companies. 

While nobody knows for sure what's going to happen, firms are rushing to secure their supply lines and protect their US business. Some are boosting inventories in the US, others are considering price hikes, and others still are shifting production. And as Trump looks to chalk up concessions, some firms are seizing the moment to unveil or expand US investments they had already been planning.

Emily Ley's stationery business, Simplified, could be destroyed by Trump's levies on Chinese imports. A conservative legal group is backing her claim.

The cost of doing business just went up.

When Emily Ley started her stationery business 17 years ago in Florida, she felt like it was the embodiment of the American dream. Today, she's the unlikely face of opposition to a trade war against China instigated by the American president. Those tariffs threaten to extinguish Ley's business and the operations of millions of companies like hers. 

“It wasn't on my Bingo card this year to sue the president,” said Ley, the CEO and founder of Simplified, a Pensacola-based stationery company. That changed after a social media post went viral in which she warned of the devastation President Donald Trump's tariffs would have on small businesses.

Ever since US Vice President JD Vance lashed out at Romania in February for cancelling its presidential election, officials in Bucharest have been trying to get the White House back onside.

Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu's aides have mounted a discreet campaign to convince Donald Trump and his team that the far-right candidate whose bid was thwarted by the courts is not the ally that they thought he might be, according to people familiar with the effort. Three weeks after Calin Georgescu was barred from the running in May's rescheduled race, they are cautiously optimistic the outreach might have succeeded, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

President Donald Trump exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech devices and components from his reciprocal tariffs, new guidance from U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows.

The guidance, issued late Friday evening, comes after Trump earlier this month imposed 145% tariffs on products from China, a move that threatened to take a toll on tech giants like Apple, which makes iPhones and most of its other products in China.

The guidance also includes exclusions for other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells, flat panel TV displays, flash drives, and memory cards.

The White House said on Saturday the exemptions were made because Trump wants to ensure that companies have time to move production to the U.S.

White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump ""has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.""

""At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible,"" Desai said.

The 20 product categories listed in the CBP guidelines are apparently exempt from the 125% tariff imposed by Trump on Chinese imports and the 10% baseline tariff on imports from other countries. A 20% tariff on all Chinese goods remains in effect.

CNBC has asked the White House and CBP to confirm the total effective tariff rate on the exempted products but so far has received no definitive answer.

The exemptions are a win for tech companies like Apple, which makes the majority of its products in China. The country manufactures 80% of iPads and more than half of Mac computers produced, according to Evercore ISI.

""This is the dream scenario for tech investors,"" Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC. ""Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs.""

He added that the tariffs have been a ""black cloud over tech since the day of liberation, because no sector was going to be more hurt than big tech.""

""I think ultimately big tech CEOs spoke loudly, and the White House had to understand and listen to the situation that this would have been Armageddon for big tech if were implemented,"" Ives said.

In the days since Trump's tariff announcement, Apple lost over $640 billion in market value, CNBC previously reported. The cost of an iPhone under Trump's tariff plan could have ballooned to as high as $3,500 under some estimates.

Since Trump's tariffs announcement, stocks have sold off sharply as uncertainty and volatility on Wall Street spiked. The S&P 500 plunged more than 5% during the period until Friday's close.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield soared more than 50 basis points during the week, one of its largest jumps on record, as the whiplash from Trump's trade policy led investors to sell off U.S. assets.

The bond market's move higher may have forced the White House's hand into some reversals, including a 90-day tariff reprieve on most countries in favor of a universal 10% rate announced Wednesday — excluding China.

The items excluded from Trump's reciprocal tariffs under the new guidelines are retroactive for products that have left the warehouse by April 5, 2025. This provides clarity and financial planning for the U.S. shipper, who is responsible for paying the tariff once it arrives weeks later at U.S. Customs for processing and release.

Taiwan officials held their first tariff talks with U.S. officials on Friday, with both sides looking forward to further discussions soon, the island's government said on Saturday.

While Taiwan, a major semiconductor producer facing tariffs of 32%, complained they were unfair, it moved quickly to lay out proposals with the United States, offering a zero-tariff regime and greater purchases and investments in the country.

In a statement, Taiwan's Office of Trade Negotiations said its officials held a video conference with U.S. officials whom it did not identify.

The talks focused on reciprocal tariffs between Taiwan and the United States, non-tariff barriers to trade, and a number of other economic and trade issues, including export controls, it added.

""Both sides look forward to conducting follow-up consultations ... in the near future and jointly building a strong and stable economic and trade relationship between Taiwan and the United States,"" it said.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of Washington work hours.

On Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump said he would temporarily lower the hefty duties he had just imposed on dozens of countries, while further ramping up pressure on China.

Home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, Taiwan has long sought a free trade deal with the United States, its most important international backer and arms supplier, even though the two have no formal diplomatic ties.

Taiwan faces increasing military and political pressure from its giant neighbour China, which views the democratically governed island as its own territory.

Taiwan's government rejects those claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.

If the vision of Larry Fink — CEO of BlackRock, the world's biggest money manager — becomes reality, all assets from stocks to bonds to real estate and more would be tradable online, on a blockchain.

""Every asset — can be tokenized,"" Fink wrote in his recent annual letter to investors.

Unlike traditional paper certificates signifying financial ownership, tokens live securely on a blockchain, enabling instant buying, selling, and transfers without paperwork or waiting — ""much like a digital deed,"" he wrote.

Fink says it would be nothing short of a ""revolution"" for investing. Think 24-hour markets and a trading settlement process that can be compacted down into seconds from a process that today can still take days, with billions of dollars reinvested immediately back into the economy.

But there's one big problem, one technology challenge that stands in the way: the lack of a coordinated digital identity verification system.

While technology experts say Fink's idea isn't improbable, they agree that there are cybersecurity challenges ahead in making it work.

Today, it's not easy to verify online that the person you are interacting with is that person because of the prevalence of AI deepfakes and sophisticated cybercriminals, according to Christina Hulka, executive director of the Secure Technology Alliance, an organization focused on identity, access and payments. As a result, having a unified verification system would be useful because there would be cryptographic validation that people are who they say they are.

""The [financial services] industry is focused on how to build a zero-trust framework for identification. You don't trust anything until it's verified,"" Hulka said. ""The challenge is getting everyone together about which technology to use that makes it as simple and as seamless for the consumer as possible,"" she added. 

It's hard to say precisely how a broad-based digital verification system would work but to support a fully tokenized financial structure, a system would, at a minimum, need to meet stringent security requirements, particularly those tied to financial regulations like the Know Your Customer rule and anti-money laundering rules, according to Zulfikar Ramzan, chief technology officer at Point Wild, a cybersecurity company.

At the same time, the system would need to be low friction and quick. There's no shortage of technical tools today, especially from the field of cryptography, that can effectively bind a digital identity to a transaction, Ramzan said. ""Fifteen to 20 years ago, this conversation would have been a non-starter,"" he added.

There have been some successes with programs like this across the globe, according to Ramzan. India's Aadhaar system is an example of a digital identity framework at a national scale. It enables most of the population to authenticate transactions via mobile devices, and it's integrated across both public and private services. Estonia has an e-ID system that allows citizens to do everything from banking to voting online. Singapore and the UAE have also implemented strong national identity programs tied to mobile infrastructure and digital services. ""While these systems differ in how they handle issues like privacy, they all share a key trait: centralized government leadership that drove standardization and adoption,"" Ramzan said.

While a centralized system solves one challenge, the storage of personally identifiable information and biometrics data is a security risk, said David Mattei, a strategic advisor in the fraud and AML practice at Datos Insights, which works with financial services, insurance and retail technology companies. 

Notably, there have been reports of data stolen from India's Aadhaar system. And last year, El Salvador's government had the personal data of 80% of its citizens stolen from a centralized, government-managed citizen identity system. ""A lot of security experts do not advocate having a centralized security system because it's kind of like the pot at the end of the rainbow that every fraudster is trying to get his hands on,"" Mattei said.

In the U.S., there's a long-standing preference for decentralized systems for identity. On mobile devices, Face ID and Fingerprint ID are done not by centralizing all of that data in one spot at Apple or Google, but by storing the data in a secure module on each mobile device. ""This makes it much harder, if not impossible, for fraudsters to steal that data en masse,"" Mattei said.

It would take a significant coordinated effort to come up with a national identity system used for identity verification.

Identity systems in the U.S. today are fragmented, Ramzan said, giving the example of state departments of motor vehicles. ""To move forward, we will either need a cohesive national strategy or a way to better coordinate identity across the state and federal levels,"" he said.

That's not an easy task. Take, for example, the effort many states are making to adopt digital driver's licenses. About a quarter of states today, including Utah, Maryland, Virginia and New York, issue mobile driver's licenses, according to mDLConnection, an online resource from the Secure Technology Alliance. Other states have pilot programs in effect, have enacted legislation or are studying the issue. But this undertaking is quite ambitious and has been underway for several years.

To implement a national identity verification system would be a ""massive undertaking and would require just about every company that does business online to adopt a government standard for identity verification and authentication,"" Mattei said.

Competitive forces are another issue to contend with. ""There is an ecosystem of vendors who offer identity verification and authentication solutions that would not want a centralized system for fear of going out of business,"" Mattei said. 

There are also significant data privacy hurdles to overcome. States and the federal government would need to coordinate to resolve governance issues, and this might prompt ""big brother"" concerns about the extent to which the federal government could monitor the activities of its citizens.

Many people have ""a bit of an allergic reaction"" when anything resembling a national ID comes up, Ramzan said.

The idea is not a brand new one for Fink. At Davos earlier this year, he told CNBC that he wanted the SEC ""to rapidly expand the tokenization of stocks and bonds.""

There's BlackRock self-interest at work, and potential cost savings for the firm and many others, which Fink has spoken about. In recent years, BlackRock has been dragged into political battles, and lawsuits, over its voting of a massive amount of shares held in its funds on ESG issues. ""We'd never have to vote on a proxy vote anymore,"" Fink told CNBC at Davos, referring to ""the tax on BlackRock.""

""Every owner would be notified of a vote,"" he said, adding that it would bring down the cost of ownership of stocks and bonds.

It is clear from Fink's decision to give this issue prominent placement in his annual letter — even if it came in third in the order of issues he covered behind both the politics of protectionism and the growing role of private markets — that he isn't letting up. And what's needed to make this a reality, he contends, is a new digital identity verification system. The letter is short on details, and BlackRock declined to elaborate, but, at least on the surface, the solution for Fink is clear. ""If we're serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won't suffice. We must solve digital verification, too,"" he wrote.

Blockchain continues to evolve and people are learning to understand it better. Accordingly, there are initiatives underway to think about how the U.S. can achieve a broad-based identity verification system, Hulka said. There are technical ways to do it, but finding the right way that works for the country is more of a challenge since it has to be interoperable. ""The goal is to get to a point where there is one way to verify identity across multiple services,"" she said.

Eventually, there will be a tipping point for the financial services industry where it becomes a business imperative, Hulka said. ""The question is when, of course.""

From rising clothing and food prices to unexpected car repairs, everyday expenses are creeping up — and the prospect of government-imposed tariffs aren't helping. Add in a rocky stock market and a few losses in my retirement accounts, and it would be really easy to panic. But I haven't ... yet.

I've paid off $300,000 of debt, and as an elder millennial, I have weathered recessions and economic storms before. What's helped me the most is not overreacting out of fear. 

Instead, I try my best to make calm, clear decisions based on what matters most to me — and what I want my money to do for me. Here's what I'm doing with my money right now:

Even though things are getting more expensive, I'm still spending money — I'm just not wasting it. For example, I'm a fashionista, but I haven't bought any new clothes this year, and I don't plan to anytime soon.

I'm getting creative with what I already own, thanks to what I call the ""$1 rule"": If I've worn it as many days as every dollar I paid for it, it's a keeper. Otherwise, it's time to repurpose it (think jeans into cutoffs) or donate it.

Instead of throwing money at ""convenience inflation"" — impulse buys, random Amazon finds or dupes that don't last, I'm redirecting those funds toward what truly supports my health and happiness: nutritious food, better sleep, and time-saving services that keep my stress low.

DON'T MISS: How to change careers and be happier at work

I am saying yes to buying things I use every day, like my favorite health supplements and imported items I know will see a price hike (hello, matcha!). As an Asian American, I'm especially aware that many of my household staples are imported, and I'm stocking up now ahead of potential price spikes.

One of my clients is a therapist, and she's already seeing patients drop off because of fears around job loss. I encourage my clients to keep therapy in the budget, especially now, by cutting what's not essential so they can keep what is. Emotional support is just as important as financial planning when things feel uncertain.

I'm not hoarding cash out of fear, but I am building in a little more flexibility.

I'm slightly increasing my cash reserves to prep for higher costs in essentials — especially groceries, clothing, and car repairs. I even have a little ""car-buffer fund"" now, just in case auto part tariffs sneak up on me.

I still keep six months of emergency expenses in a high-yield savings account, but that's because I'm debt-free, a lifestyle choice that has served me well in the last two recessions.

For my clients who still carry credit card debt, I'm urging them to pay that off now. If the interest rate is 20% and prices on goods go up another 20%, that's a recipe for cash flow chaos, even if your spending habits stay the same. Paying down credit card debt is saving 20% that would have gone to the credit card company instead of staying in your pocket.

One easy shift that's helping me and my clients: pay your credit card weekly instead of monthly. It helps catch price creep in real time. Paying your credit card bills on a monthly basis means you're still paying for purchases from up to 30 days ago.

Yes, I've looked at my retirement account recently — and yes, it stung. Watching something I've worked so hard for drop in value because of man-made economic decisions is frustrating.

But I'm not pulling my money out. I've done the panic withdrawal in the past, and I regretted it.

I'm still maxing out my 401(k), IRA, and Flexible Spending Account and sticking to my plan with dollar-cost averaging. I'm not putting extra into my brokerage right now, and this particular downturn in the stock market sped me up to what I knew I had to do all along: diversify. 

We often mistake having multiple stocks as diversification, but as we saw recently, many stocks tend to move in the same direction, so it's important to look at the asset classes you are invested in. 

I'm not withdrawing a dime of my retirement, and you shouldn't either unless you are prepared to pay the extra taxes and penalties. But I am shifting away from companies that don't align with my values within my retirement accounts. To me, investing isn't just about returns — it's about what kind of world you want to build.

This is the advice I've shared with my money coaching clients lately: manage your money as though the recession is already here. If I've learned anything from the last two decades, it's that uncertainty isn't going anywhere.

I've stopped waiting for the ""perfect"" economy to make decisions. Instead of doom scrolling, use this time to refine your budget, double down on stacking cash and paying down debt, and stay vigilant of your present progress, rather than trying to predict the future.

The threat of rising tariff rates on U.S. imports could hobble the economic trajectory of countries such as Vietnam. 

Foreign direct investment in Vietnam has increased in recent years as firms search for ways to manage risks stemming from production in China. Vietnam has received approximately $18.5 billion in net foreign direct investment, according to World Bank records that go back to 1970.  

President Donald Trump's 46% ""reciprocal"" tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from Vietnam briefly went into effect April 9. Later that day, Trump reset tariff rates on products from countries such as Vietnam to 10%. Countries subject to higher tariffs have less than 90 days to negotiate better trade terms with the White House.

""Vietnam is highly vulnerable,"" said Tuan Chu, an associate program manager at RMIT University Vietnam. 

Vietnam's potentially heightened tariff rates are based, in part, on its U.S. trade surplus, according to Cullen Hendrix, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Vietnam's trade surplus was roughly $123.5 billion in 2024 and $39.5 billion in 2018, according to the Census Bureau.

A portion of Vietnam's rising exports to the U.S. may be Chinese products that were rerouted to evade higher tariff rates. Evidence of this comes from trade data collected after 2018, as a U.S.-China trade war escalated, according to a research paper from Harvard Business School. 

Edmund Malesky, a Duke University professor of political science and one of the authors of the Harvard paper, estimates that 84% of Vietnam's increase in manufacturing activity was value-added production. ""But there's a smaller part, maybe 16%, depending on how you measure it, which is rerouting, which became a concern for the United States,"" Malesky said.

Firms may alter their international supply chains if higher tariff rates on U.S. imports come to pass. 

""This is kind of part of a game of global whack-a-mole,"" Hendrix said. 

Watch the video to learn how China may use countries such as Vietnam as a side door to trade with the U.S.

New York University's Grossman School of Medicine made history in 2018 when it became the first top-ranked medical program to offer full-tuition scholarships to all students, regardless of need or merit. 

The number of applicants, predictably, spiked in the year that followed. But then, the share of incoming students considered ""financially disadvantaged"" sank to 3% in 2019, down from 12% in 2017, reports showed. 

""Tuition-free schools can actually increase inequity,"" said Jamie Beaton, co-founder and CEO of Crimson Education, a college consulting firm. 

""Tuition-free colleges experience surges in application numbers, dramatically boosting the competitive intensity of the admissions process,"" he said. ""This in turn can skew admissions towards middle- or higher-income applicants who may be able to access more effective admissions resources, such as tutoring or extracurriculars.""

More from Personal Finance:How to maximize your college financial aid offerTop colleges roll out more generous financial aid packagesCollege hopefuls have a new ultimate dream school

""Our goal for tuition-free education was to clear pathways for the best and brightest future doctors from all backgrounds to attend NYU Grossman School of Medicine without the stress of taking on the average $200,000 in debt medical students typically incur,"" Arielle Sklar, a spokesperson for the school told CNBC. ""This allows students to align career choices with their passions in medicine rather than immediate economic pressures.""

Sklar, however, did not directly address the issue of declining low-income student enrollment.

Since the initiative by NYU's Grossman School of Medicine, other top schools and programs have embraced the tuition-free model.

Harvard University was the latest undergraduate school to announce that it will be tuition free for undergraduates with family incomes of up to $200,000 beginning in the 2025-26 academic year, following similar initiatives at Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Nearly two dozen more schools have also introduced ""no-loan"" policies, which means student loans are eliminated altogether from their financial aid packages.

In the case of Harvard, ""you may see a trend of families with income closer to $200,000 outcompeting low-income students for slots,"" Beaton said. ""This may shift the proportion of Harvard students from the top 1% of income down, but it might also decrease the share of low-income students to the benefit of middle or middle-upper income families.""

More generous aid packages and tuition-free policies remove the most significant financial barrier to higher education but attract more higher-income applicants, other experts also say. 

""Even though it sounds like lower-income students are going to be advantaged, it's the middle class that's going to win here,"" said Christopher Rim, president and CEO of college consulting firm Command Education.

""These colleges are trying to build a well-rounded class, they need middle class and wealthy students as well,"" he added. ""They are not trying to take fewer rich kids — they need them because they're the ones that are also going to be donating.""

For lower income students, ""anything that increases the number of applications will be detrimental,"" said Eric Greenberg, president of Greenberg Educational Group, a New York-based consulting firm.

These days, taking on too much debt is the top worry among all college-bound students, according to a survey by The Princeton Review. 

College tuition has soared by 5.6% a year, on average, since 1983, significantly outpacing other household expenses, a recent study by J.P. Morgan Asset Management also found.

This rapid increase means that college costs have risen much faster than inflation, leaving families to shoulder a larger share of the expenses, experts say.

For the 2024-25 school year, tuition and fees plus room and board for a four-year private college averaged $58,600, up from $56,390 a year earlier. At four-year, in-state public colleges, it was $24,920, up from $24,080, according to the College Board.

To bridge the affordability gap, some of the nation's top institutions are in an ""affordability arms race,"" according to Hafeez Lakhani, founder and president of Lakhani Coaching in New York. 

However, overall, most institutions do not have the financial wherewithal to offer tuition-free or no-loan aid programs, added Robert Franek, The Princeton Review's editor in chief. ""More than 95% of four-year colleges in the U.S. are tuition driven,"" he said. 

Even if a school does not offer enough aid at the outset, there are other ways to bring costs down, according to James Lewis, co-founder of National Society of High School Scholars.

""Get beyond, 'I can't afford that,""' he said. ""A lot of institutions will have a retail price but that's not necessarily what a student will pay.""

Many schools will provide access to additional resources that can lower the total tab, he said, either through scholarships, financial aid or work-study opportunities.

Bank of England interest rate-setter Megan Greene said on Saturday it was unclear what U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs would do to UK inflation with the unpredictable behaviour of the dollar adding to the puzzle.

Higher barriers to trade were likely to weigh on economic growth in countries in Europe, Greene said during a panel discussion at the Delphi Economic Forum conference in Greece.

""The implications for inflation, though, are somewhat ambiguous,"" she said, noting the possibility of Chinese exports being diverted away from the U.S. and towards Europe which could push down on prices.

But the most important thing to watch is what happens to currencies, Greene said.

""The key channel, really is exchange rates, and that's been really difficult because exchange rates haven't operated in the past week as the models would suggest,"" she said. ""The dollar has fallen instead of appreciating as you would expect.""

A stronger dollar would normally push up inflation in other countries, Greene said.

BoE deputy governors Clare Lombardelli and Sarah Breeden both said earlier this week that it was too early to say what the inflation implications from Trump's tariffs will be.

04/12 update below. This post was originally published on April 11

Bitcoin has swung wildly over the last week as traders ride U.S. president Donald Trump's tariff rollercoaster (with Michael Saylor's Strategy issuing a shock warning).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price is holding up following the latest tariff shots fired by Trump and China after plunging along with stock markets in early April—even as Wall Street grapples with a looming “existential threat” from crypto.

Now, while traders bet on a Federal Reserve game-changer, the bitcoin price is braced for a dollar ""confidence crisis"" as the ICE U.S. dollar index plummets to its worst day since 2022.

“The question of a potential dollar confidence crisis has now been definitively answered—we are experiencing one in full force,” ING analysts including Francesco Pesole wrote in a note seen by Bloomberg. “The dollar collapse is working as a barometer of ‘sell America' at the moment.”

The escalating Trump-led global trade war saw the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of global currencies, fall sharply this week, dropping under the 100 level and putting it on course to return to its 2022 range.

04/12 update: The U.S. dollar has fallen to its lowest level in three years as U.S. president Donald Trump's hot-and-cold approach to global tariffs drives extreme volatility on U.S. financial markets.

""What we are going through now is worse than when former President Nixon took us off the gold standard in August 1971,"" Marc Chandler, the New York-based chief market strategist for Bannockburn Global Forex, told MarketWatch. “The biggest damage right now is to the U.S. brand.”

Meanwhile, the chaos and uncertainty of the escalating tariff war could help bitcoin close the gap on gold's $22 trillion market capitalization, according to a report from bitcoin and crypto asset manager Grayscale.

“In our view, ​​​​‌‍​‍​‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‌‍‍‌‌‍‍​‍​‍​‍‍​‍​‍‌​‌‍​‌‌‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‌​‌‍‌​‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍​‍​‍​​‍​‍‌‍‍​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‍​‍​‍​‍‍​‍​‍‌‍‍​‌‌​‌‌​‌​​‌​​‍‍​‍​‍‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍‍‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌‌​‌‌​​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‍‍​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​​​‌‍‌​​​‌​‌​‌‍‌​‌‍​‌​‍‌​‌​​​‍​​​​‍‌​‍‌​‌​‌‍​‍‌‍​‍​‍​​‍‌​‍‌​‌‌​​‌​‌​‍‌‌‍​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍‌‌​​​​‍‌‍​‌‍​‌​‌‍‌‍‌‌‌‍​​​​‌‍‌‍​‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‌​​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍​​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌​‌‍‌​​‌‍​​‌​‌‍‌‍​‌​​​​​‍‌‍‌​​​​​‍‌​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍‌​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍​‍​‌​‌‍‌‌​‌‌​‌‍​‌​​​​​​‌​​‌‍​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​​‌‍​‍‌‍​‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‌‌‌‌​‍‌‍​​‌‌‍‍​‌‌​‌‌​‌​​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​​‌​‍‌‌​​‍‌​‌‍​‍‌‌​​‍‌​‌‍‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍‍‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​​​‌‍‌​​​‌​‌​‌‍‌​‌‍​‌​‍‌​‌​​​‍​​​​‍‌​‍‌​‌​‌‍​‍‌‍​‍​‍​​‍‌​‍‌​‌‌​​‌​‌​‍‌‌‍​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍‌‌​​​​‍‌‍​‌‍​‌​‌‍‌‍‌‌‌‍​​​​‌‍‌‍​‍‌‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍‌​​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍​​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌​‌‍‌​​‌‍​​‌​‌‍‌‍​‌​​​​​‍‌‍‌​​​​​‍‌​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍‌​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍​‍​‌​‌‍‌‌​‌‌​‌‍​‌​​​​​​‌​​‌‍​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​​‍‌‍‌​​‌‍‌‌‌​‍‌​‌​​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‌‍‌‍‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‍​‍‌‍​‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‍​‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​​‍​‍‌‌disruptions to the dollar-centric international trade and financial system could result in more reserve diversification by central banks, including into bitcoin,” Grayscale analysts wrote.

“Bitcoin is too young for us to know how it would have behaved in past episodes, but historical data shows that ​​​​‌‍​‍​‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‌‍‍‌‌‍‍​‍​‍​‍‍​‍​‍‌​‌‍​‌‌‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‌​‌‍‌​‍‍‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍​‍​‍​​‍​‍‌‍‍​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‍​‍​‍​‍‍​‍​‍‌‍‍​‌‌​‌‌​‌​​‌​​‍‍​‍​‍‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍‍‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌‌​‌‌​​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‍‍​‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​​​‌‍‌​​​‌​‌​‌‍‌​‌‍​‌​‍‌​‌​​​‍​​​​‍‌​‍‌​‌​‌‍​‍‌‍​‍​‍​​‍‌​‍‌​‌‌​​‌​‌​‍‌‌‍​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍‌‌​​​​‍‌‍​‌‍​‌​‌‍‌‍‌‌‌‍​​​​‌‍‌‍​‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‌​​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍​​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍​‍​‌‍‌‍​‍​​​‌‍‌‌​​‍​‌‌‍‌‌​​‌‌‍​​​‌​​​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍‌​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​​‍​‌​‌‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍​‍​‍​​​‍‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​​‍‌​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​​‌‍​‍‌‍​‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‌‌‌‌​‍‌‍​​‌‌‍‍​‌‌​‌‌​‌​​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​​‌​‍‌‌​​‍‌​‌‍​‍‌‌​​‍‌​‌‍‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‍‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‍‍‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‌‍‌​‍‌‍‌‍‍‌‌‍‌​​‌‌‍‌‌​‌‍​​​‌‍‌​​​‌​‌​‌‍‌​‌‍​‌​‍‌​‌​​​‍​​​​‍‌​‍‌​‌​‌‍​‍‌‍​‍​‍​​‍‌​‍‌​‌‌​​‌​‌​‍‌‌‍​‍‌‍‌‍‌‍‌‌​​​​‍‌‍​‌‍​‌​‌‍‌‍‌‌‌‍​​​​‌‍‌‍​‍‌‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌​​‌‍‌‌​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌​‍‌‍‌​​‌‍​‌‌‌​‌‍‍​​‌‌‍​‌‌​‍‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌​​‍‌‍‌‍‌​‌‍‌​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍‌‍​‍​‌‍‌‍​‍​​​‌‍‌‌​​‍​‌‌‍‌‌​​‌‌‍​​​‌​​​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‍​‌‍‍​‌‍‍‌‌‍​‌‍‌​‌​‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​​‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‌​‌​​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​​‍​‌​‌‌‍​‌‌‍​‌‍​‍​‍​​​‍‌‍​‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​​‍‌​‍‌‌​​‍​​‍​‍‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‍‍‌‌​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​​‍‌‍‌​​‌‍‌‌‌​‍‌​‌​​‌‍‌‌‌‍​‌‌​‌‍‍‌‌‌‍‌‍‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‍​‍‌‍​‌‍‍‌‌​‌‍‍​‌‍‌‌‌‍‌​​‍​‍‌‌stagflation tends to be negative for traditional asset returns and favorable for scarce commodities like gold,” the researchers wrote, adding that during the 1970s, ""the price of gold appreciated at an annualized rate of about 30%, significantly above the rate of inflation.""

Bitcoin, sometimes called digital gold due to its scarcity, has so far failed to follow gold higher as traders panic-sell assets in the face of a looming global trade war, with the gold price hitting a record, all-time high this week. 

“The market is re-assessing the structural attractiveness of the dollar as the world's global reserve currency and is undergoing a process of rapid de-dollarisation,” Deutsche Bank's global head of FX research George Saravelos wrote in a note seen by City AM.

The dollar's decline is seen by some as boosting the bitcoin price as traders bet bitcoin will follow in gold's footsteps, performing as a safe haven asset.

""Like a rising tide, the dollar's decline is lifting other assets,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments, adding “a falling dollar supports cryptocurrencies.”

“Bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities may have garnered excessive attention, while its ties to Federal Reserve policy and the U.S. dollar's trajectory deserve greater scrutiny,” LMax Group's market strategist Joel Kruger said via email.

Trump has been pushing Fed chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates as he embarks on his global trade war, fuelling expectations the Fed could be forced to cut interest rates through 2025, either in response to a tariff-led economic slow down or because Trump has fired Powell.

“Market dynamics are shifting as the Fed's outlook adjusts to pressures from U.S. trade policy, with expectations of steeper rate cuts in 2025 now taking hold. This pivot toward a more accommodative stance is poised to narrow yield differentials, weakening the dollar's appeal and, in turn, creating a supportive tailwind for bitcoin,"" Kruger said.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin Price Tops $84.5K, Looks to End Downtrend as Trump Exempts Key Tech From Reciprocal Tariffs","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/12/bitcoin-price-tops-usd84-5k-looks-to-end-downtrend-as-trump-exempts-key-tech-from-reciprocal-tariffs","Sat, 12 Apr 2025 14:44:17 GMT","

Bitcoin (BTC) rose over 1.5% to $84,900 Saturday, looking to break a three-month downtrend after the Trump administration issued new guidance on reciprocal tariffs, listing several exemptions like smartphones, computers, chips and other electronics. 

These exclusions, published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, list products from President Donald Trump's 125% China tariff and his baseline 10% global levy. 

""The US imports over $60 BILLION of smartphones per year. These exemptions cover some of the most crucial imports in another sign of the U.S. conceding in the trade war. After all, the bond market is forcing Trump to concede,"" The Kobeissi Letter said on X. 

The U.S. and China ratcheted up trade tensions this week, imposing import tariffs in excess of 100% over each other. Still, some sections of the financial market have priced in disinflation in the U.S., going against popular inflation fears and suggesting that the Fed might soon have a leeway to cut interest rates. 

The chart shows that BTC is looking to establish a foothold above the descending trendline, characterizing the steep sell-off from record highs above $109K. The so-called trendline breakout could entice more chart-driven buyers to the market.

Meanwhile, major alternative cryptocurrencies like ETH, XRP, and ADA surged by 6% on the day, indicating a trend of increased risk-taking in the broader crypto market. The cumulative market cap of the top two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, held steady above $200 billion, just shy of record highs.

This positive momentum in the crypto market, which opened for trading over the weekend, suggests the potential for price gains on Wall Street come Monday.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

AUSTIN — On a Friday morning last spring, Mark Suman called out sick from his job as a senior engineering project manager at Apple and made his way downtown to a place called the Bitcoin Commons, a sort of clubhouse for enthusiasts of the world's largest cryptocurrency, situated a few blocks south of the Texas State Capitol.

At the time, Suman was, in his words, ""an active hobbyist,"" tinkering with the technology in his spare time. ""I actually played around with it a bit within Apple as well,"" he says. ""There's not a lot I can say, other than we were always exploring new technologies, and so I was playing around with some of the open-source bitcoin tools within Apple and doing some exploratory work.""

Suman was there for the annual 'Bitcoin Takeover' event. He had followed many of the speakers online and when he saw the gathering pop up on his feed, he took the day off to see it for himself.

""I was sitting in the crowd wanting to get into the space and really build something new and build something novel,"" Suman recalled.

What happened instead was the beginning of a professional pivot: he struck up a conversation with a developer after a talk at the Commons, and was introduced to other coders who were winding down a project called Mutiny. Within a few months, Suman handed in his notice at Apple and with the developers he'd met, pivoted into something bigger — co-founding Open Secret, a startup reimagining how user data is stored in the cloud. Instead of relying on centralized databases, the company encrypts data to each individual user — even after it's uploaded. So if there's a breach, there's nothing to steal, Suman explained. No honeypot.

The leap was not without stakes.

""There are plenty of sleepless nights,"" he said. ""I've got a family, I've got kids, I've got a kid off at university.""

He had spent years working on privacy infrastructure — tackling tough technical problems around user protection at scale — but saw a way to do it better with blockchain. ""Apple likes to talk a big game about privacy,"" he says. ""And having been there, I've seen very deep within a lot of their systems that they do care about privacy at every level.""

That vision — and the Commons — helped give him conviction. The builders there were all laser focused on creating something that mattered.

Bitcoin Commons sits on the second floor of the Littlefield Building at the corner of Congress Avenue and Sixth Street — where the broad boulevard to the Capitol collides with the noisy sprawl of Austin's nightlife district. It's an apt metaphor for the space itself.

By day, it serves as a clean, open-plan coworking hub for bitcoin operators and builders. At night, it transforms into a gathering place for rogue developers and off-the-record meetups. Events here draw a blend of venture capitalists, open-source contributors, off-grid energy technicians, and Lightning engineers — developers who build software to make bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. On some afternoons, once happy hour hits, the kitchen in the back converts into a bar.

""Bitcoin is the most important technological innovation in any of our lifetimes, and it needs its due,"" said Parker Lewis, one of the stewards of the Commons and the author of a new book on bitcoin called ""Gradually, Then Suddenly.""

""And so while bitcoin has no CEO and no marketing team, we here at the Bitcoin Commons and Bitcoiners all over the world help educate people about bitcoin, why it's important, what's being built, and present a vision for the future,"" continued Lewis.

""The vibe, it's always high signal,"" said Dan Lawrence, CEO of OBM, which manages energy use for industrial-scale mining farms. Lawrence said he was ""thankful"" that the U.S. government had become a little more pro-bitcoin under the new administration, but added, ""No matter what happens anywhere, everybody here is always going to bleed bitcoin.""

This year, the Commons feels different — not because bitcoiners have changed, but because the world around them has. The mood is bullish. Strategic. Triumphant, even.

Bitcoin's price mirrored this optimism, surging to an all-time high of nearly $110,000 in January, coinciding with Trump's inauguration. By early April, it had retraced to the low $70,000s before rebounding to nearly $85,000 as of Saturday morning — volatility that underscores the market's sensitivity to political developments and investor sentiment.

Just a year ago, the vibe in the Commons was cautious. Even bitcoin — the asset largely spared by securities law — felt the chill of an aggressive regulatory regime. Developers were being arrested around the world. Wallet providers were being pressured. Open-source projects landed on sanctions lists. The question then was, who would be next?

Then came the election. Trump's return to the White House brought with it a full-court press of pro-bitcoin policy moves. Within his first 100 days, he'd pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and three co-founders of the BitMEX crypto exchange, established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and appointed a ""crypto czar"" to oversee the federal government's digital asset efforts. Even skeptics found themselves nodding.

""I was in Nashville when Trump spoke,"" Suman recalled of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Tennessee, where Trump made his first major address to the crypto industry. ""I wasn't planning on going. But you know, when someone like that is in town, you go see it.""

Suman says he feels Trump has delivered on his promises to the crypto community for the most part. Still, he remains cautious. ""I am not one who embraces politicians,"" Suman said. ""I'm kind of apolitical as far as which side. So I only trust them until I see how it's actually playing out in our life. So far, I think it's going well, but it could really change.""

Kevin Hurley, CTO at Lightspark, says Washington's stance toward crypto appears to be shifting, with regulators like the SEC taking a less combative approach — moving away from lawsuits and toward clearer capital markets rules. ""Hopefully now we're actually going to have some clarity on what is and what isn't a security, what can actually be done,"" he said.

But even in a friendlier political climate, caution over government involvement remains a feature, not a bug, of the crypto community.

Joe Kelly, CEO of Unchained — a startup that helps clients store bitcoin securely by holding their own private keys — said it's smart to be careful what you wish for when it comes to the U.S. government owning a lot of bitcoin. ""That can go other ways,"" he said.

To date, the government's so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has underwhelmed some digital asset advocates, since it's limited to bitcoin previously seized in enforcement actions — not newly purchased assets or sovereign investment. Still, the administration has directed the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore budget-neutral ways to acquire more bitcoin.

Kelly acknowledges a shift in the regulatory atmosphere, but he's also wary of premature celebration, even with big market wins like the launch of exchange-traded funds that allow investors widespread access to bitcoin.

""If something like the ETF had launched too soon, I think it could have distracted from the people building on the actual technology itself,"" Kelly said. ""We've had the fortune that for most of Unchained's life there wasn't an ETF,"" he added of the firm's efforts to educate investors on how to store their crypto.

The shift has had ripple effects across the industry, including insurance.

Becca Rubenfeld, COO of Anchor Watch, says regulatory movement is opening the door for bitcoin to be treated like any other financial asset. Traditional insurers don't cover bitcoin directly — they insure the infrastructure around it. But if bitcoin becomes an admitted asset on insurance company balance sheets, that changes everything.

""Currently, the industry is extremely underserved,"" Rubenfeld told CNBC. ""But what Anchor Watch is doing is specifically insuring the asset itself. So we built a proprietary custody solution. And when customers use us for custody services, Lloyd's of London backed insurance is included in those services.""

The demand is growing. So is the pressure to build — and secure — the technical infrastructure that makes bitcoin work.

Mike Schmidt, executive director of Brink, which funds open-source bitcoin developers through a nonprofit structure, emphasized the importance of supporting the engineers maintaining bitcoin's underlying infrastructure. ""Bitcoin needs engineers,"" he said.

""We have a $2 trillion asset. We have strategic reserves of bitcoin being held by countries, and there's just this small group of engineers that are keeping this thing together at the code base,"" Schmidt said. ""There's only maybe 40 full-time engineers working on this. So we want to make sure that the engineering growth can keep pace with its broader adoption.""

Lisa Neigut started as a back-end engineer at Cash App, where she worked on their internal bitcoin product, before moving to Blockstream and spending six years as an open-source developer on the Lightning Network. These days, she runs Bitcoin++, one of the largest technical conference series in the space, with six events planned across six countries this year.

""Bitcoin++ is focused on bringing together bitcoin developers and builders to talk about what they're working on — the frontier of bitcoin,"" Neigut said. ""You can get an idea of what bitcoin is going to look like tomorrow.""

That sense of momentum resonates with filmmaker Alana Mediavilla, who spent five years at Google working on films about big data and cloud infrastructure. She screened her new documentary, Dirty Coin, a feature-length project looking at bitcoin's energy footprint and the people behind the infrastructure, at the Commons.

""I had put in my time in the cloud space,"" she says. ""I understood what data centers were, I understood where it was going, and I also understood how much energy it takes to run these huge facilities that right now are running the backbone of our society.""

Her goal wasn't to necessarily defend bitcoin mining but to broaden the conversation. ""I just want to get everybody's data center literacy up to a certain point where we can continue to have conversations about it, because it's not going away.""

She describes the crowd in Austin as a coming together of people ""very committed to their craft"" — and in her view, driven more by shared ideals than by profit-seeking.

""People think that it's like a get-rich-quick,"" she said. ""Maybe those were the old days for bitcoin. Now, if you want 100x you should look at altcoins and meme coins and other stuff, but you're probably not going to get that with bitcoin.""

""What brings them together is that they want to have better money, and they want to have a more fair world,"" she added. ""So the principles are solid. How we implement those principles — that's where the variety and spice of life comes in.""

A surge of new funding is also reshaping bitcoin's builder economy.

Venture investment in bitcoin-related startups soared in 2024 alongside the crypto market's rally. The number of pre-seed deals in the space climbed 50% last year, according to research from Trammell Venture Partners, an Austin-based VC firm focused on bitcoin-native startups. Across all early-stage funding rounds, nearly $1.2 billion has been invested in bitcoin companies since 2021.

The renewed interest comes after years of technical upgrades to the bitcoin protocol and growing confidence in its long-term resilience.

""Serious people no longer question whether bitcoin will remain 15 or 20 years into the future,"" said Christopher Calicott, managing director at Trammell. ""So the next question becomes: Is it possible to build what the founder is trying to achieve on bitcoin? Increasingly, the answer is yes.""

PitchBook projects that crypto venture funding will surpass $18 billion in 2025 — nearly doubling the annual average from the previous two-year cycle. Much of that capital is flowing into bitcoin infrastructure and applications — payments, privacy tools, custody solutions — rather than the speculative trading platforms of previous cycles.

Turning ideals — and venture dollars — into reality still requires real-world infrastructure. And that's where entrepreneurs like Steve Barbour, the founder of Canadian firm Upstream Data, come in. He's spent years building off-grid mining containers for remote oilfields, but this spring, he's expanding operations into Wyoming, a bet he attributes directly to the Trump administration's rollback of energy regulations and renewed push for domestic production.

Wyoming — home to both sprawling coal operations and some of the country's most permissive crypto laws — has emerged as a hub for bitcoin miners and the lawmakers who support them.

The administration's latest executive orders loosen environmental restrictions and encourage more fossil fuel development — a boon for oilfield miners like Barbour, even as critics warn it could come at a steep climate cost.

""I'm extremely optimistic and bullish on Trump's administration,"" Barbour said. ""The EPA finally came out with a new stance on all these things they've been doing to just destroy the energy sector in America, which has affected us very negatively. I'm seeing a lot of things going the right way now with the decisions the Trump administration is making, and clearly they're trying to attract investment in America and manufacturing.""

Zaprite's Lewis, one of the Commons' most vocal policy thinkers, agrees that things are moving in the right direction — particularly around the government's decision to establish a formal national bitcoin reserve.

While a crypto executive order is an important first step, ""codifying it with law will help drive further regulatory clarity that the U.S. is open for bitcoin,"" Lewis said. ""It will also be good for the country ... the biggest priority would be for the regulatory clarity piece, pushing Sen. Lummis' Bitcoin Act to codify and make permanent.""

Senator Lummis, a longtime advocate for the industry, is pushing legislation to codify bitcoin protections into federal law. Her proposed legislation outlines a plan for the U.S. to buy bitcoin with ""existing funds"" of the Treasury Department, which includes tax revenue. The idea, in part, is to position bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset — one that could appreciate over time and reduce reliance on debt. The senator has said that the ultimate goal is to reduce the federal deficit, as well as position bitcoin alongside gold and other hard assets as a way to strengthen the dollar over time.

Without the Bitcoin Act becoming law, Lewis warns that today's tailwinds could reverse with a single administration change.

But while Washington debates bitcoin's role in the future of the U.S. economy, Suman was already betting his own on it.

""Why did I leave this really cushy job at Apple, where I was getting paid a lot and had stock and that kind of stuff, to come here, where my future is uncertain?"" he said. ""It's the possibility of building something new that I think is really needed in the world. And I hope that it pans out. ... If it doesn't, and we go down in a glory of fire, at least I will have tried something that I really believe in.""

Even after he accepted the offer to join Mutiny — later pivoting into Open Secret — things didn't calm down. ""That was right when a prominent group of developers were arrested,"" he recalled. ""They were developing an app called Samurai, and they got arrested. I had accepted my offer with Mutiny, but I had not yet left Apple.""

The gamble wasn't just career-based. It was emotional. Existential.

""Knowing that people were being arrested and there was a lot of uncertainty, I still dove in,"" he said. ""The guys said, 'Listen, if you're worried, we can just call this off and you can stay at Apple,'"" Suman recalled. ""But I said, 'No, I really believe in what we're building. Let's make this thing scale.'""

Real Vision's chief crypto analyst, Jamie Coutts, is highlighting the outperformance of Bitcoin (BTC) amid a correction experienced by stocks and crypto assets.

Coutts says that even though Bitcoin has traditionally been more volatile than stocks, it has recently witnessed a relatively lower level of correction than would be expected based on its historical levels of price swings.

“Folks don't understand what is happening with Bitcoin during this risk-asset panic. BTC with 2.5x the volatility of the S&P 500 experienced a drawdown of 28% vs. the S&P 500's 19%. That is a massive OUTPERFORMANCE.

Perhaps it's not just BTC's strength, but a reflection of the increasing fragility of the fiat system and its asset markets – complex systems inherently trend toward entropy/chaos. Bitcoin is mirroring this unraveling.”

Going forward, Coutts says that Bitcoin will grow in importance as two of its use cases gain prominence across the globe.

“What is happening right now is epic. Things are breaking. The fiat fractional reserve credit-based system's fragility is on full display, yet again. Look through the next couple of days and understand Bitcoin's ascendancy as a global settlement layer and collateral asset is accelerating. Fast.

Before it was the plebs who understood this, this time it will be nation states.”

Bitcoin is trading at $83,227 at time of writing.

Bitcoin is on fire again. A Scottish private school just announced it accepts $BTC for tuition, and analysts are calling for an ‘up only mode' as institutions pile in.

But let's be real – for most everyday investors, Bitcoin at $85K feels like trying to jump on a rocket ship that's already halfway to Mars. Pricey, intimidating, and just a little too late.

That's where BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) comes in.

It's a small but mighty altcoin that offers the flavor of Bitcoin with a bigger upside – all for the price of less than a penny. Think of it as a spicy side dish that might end up stealing the whole show.

Bitcoin isn't just for tech bros and Reddit forums anymore – it's earning serious mainstream respect.

A boarding school in Edinburgh is now accepting $BTC for tuition, making it one of the first in the UK to treat crypto like cash in the classroom.

Meanwhile, Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, says we're entering Bitcoin's ‘up only mode,' driven by central banks printing money and investors fleeing traditional assets.



Even long-time safe havens like gold and bonds are losing their luster. The old guard of ‘safe' investments – gold and government bonds – is starting to slip.

It's clear $BTC has made it to the big leagues. But when institutions start buying in, the easy gains are usually gone.

That's why everyday investors are eyeing new crypto projects that still have room to grow – like BTC Bull Token.

Let's face it – Bitcoin is king, but buying into it at $85K can feel like showing up to the party just as the pizza runs out. That's where BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) charges in, horns up and ready to rumble.

This isn't your average meme coin.

$BTCBULL is a community-powered, Bitcoin-linked token designed for one purpose: to help everyday investors catch the upside of $BTC's journey to $1M – without needing a six-figure investment account.



At just $0.00246 per token and already over $4.5M raised in presale, $BTCBULL offers Bitcoin exposure, meme coin energy, and some serious incentive to HODL.

For starters, $BTCBULL rewards holders with real Bitcoin. It's the first Bitcoin meme coin to do so. Every time Bitcoin hits a key milestone – like $150K, $200K – $BTCBULL triggers airdrops of actual $BTC to its loyal holders.

But there's a catch most people miss: to qualify, you must buy $BTCBULL through Best Wallet and keep it there. No Best Wallet, no airdrops. It's that simple.

There's more. BTC Bull Token is programmed with $BTC-linked token burns.

Every time Bitcoin smashes a new level, $BTCBULL supply is permanently reduced – meaning your holdings could become more valuable as scarcity increases. Fewer tokens, stronger demand, higher potential price.



And if you're wondering about upside, some crypto analysts believe $BTCBULL could hit $0.25 in the next bull run — a staggering 100x from where it is today.

It's not just another meme coin hoping for Elon to tweet. It's a Bitcoin-powered, community-fueled movement aimed at making the next bull run more rewarding for regular investors.

If Bitcoin is the bull, $BTCBULL is your chance to grab the horns.

Bitcoin may be shaping up to be the reserve asset of the future – trusted by institutions, adopted by schools, and embraced as digital gold.

But if you're chasing serious upside in 2025, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) could be the bolder, smarter play. It offers more flavor, more flexibility, and a lot more room to run. And unlike most meme coins, it rewards you with actual Bitcoin along the way.

As always, do your own research (DYOR) before investing in any crypto asset, as this article doesn't constitute financial advice.

According to a recent X post by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum (ETH) may have already gone through its capitulation phase for this market cycle. Notably, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is down more than 55% over the past year.

Is Ethereum Capitulation Over?

Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), and SUI, Ethereum has endured a challenging two-year stretch. The cryptocurrency was trading at $1,892 exactly two years ago, on April 11, 2023, and is now priced around $1,560 – over 17% lower.

In contrast, BTC has surged from approximately $41,000 two years ago to $82,127 at the time of writing – an increase of nearly 100%. While SOL currently trades below its April 2023 price, unlike ETH, it did manage to reach a new all-time high (ATH) of $293 earlier this year in January.

Understandably, sentiment toward ETH – among both retail and institutional investors – is hovering near all-time lows. However, Martinez believes that “smart money” may be accumulating at current levels, anticipating a near-term reversal.

The analyst pointed out that Ethereum's Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow has recently dropped below one million. Martinez added:

This historically indicates a macro bottom zone, meaning $ETH might be undervalued and long-term holders are less inclined to sell. It also suggests: sentiment is low, capitulation may have occurred, smart money might be accumulating.

For the uninitiated, Ethereum's Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow is an on-chain metric that compares the market cap to the dormancy – the average age of ETH being moved – adjusted for unique entities instead of raw addresses. The metric helps identify whether the market is overheated or undervalued by tracking the behavior of long-term holders.

If ETH follows historical trends, it may be approaching a momentum reversal. In a separate X post, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader suggested that Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is nearing a peak, which could shift capital into altcoins and trigger a short-term rally.

At the time of writing, BTC.D stands around 63.5%. A potential pivot by the US Federal Reserve toward quantitative easing (QE) could inject fresh liquidity into the market, possibly sparking a mini altcoin rally.

ETH Demands Cautious Optimism

While there are multiple signs that ETH may be close to bottoming out, some indicators suggest that there could be continued weakness for the digital asset before any meaningful momentum shift.

In a recent analysis, Martinez warned that ETH could fall as low as $1,200 if the current sell-off continues. Further, ongoing capital outflows from US-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) remain a concern for the asset's short-term outlook.

That said, crypto analyst NotWojak recently noted that ETH may be on the verge of a breakout, with a potential upside target of $1,835. At press time, ETH is trading at $1,557, down 2.3% in the past 24 hours.

Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder, published a privacy roadmap to increase security for the Ethereum ecosystem. Responding to calls from community members to address privacy concerns involving crypto mixers, transparency, and regulation, Buterin outlined a brief plan to tackle the problem of balancing privacy with decentralization. 

Tornado Cash, the Ethereum mixing service, was sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2022. Tornado mixes different transactions together to disguise a token's history. The U.S. government contended that the mixer facilitated money laundering and stamped down on anyone connected to the network. For that matter, many Ethereum developers steered clear of Tornado to protect themselves from the government. Moreover, ethereum validators and block builders limited their use of Tornado, making the blockchain slower. 

In his roadmap, Buterin relied heavily on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to solve the privacy problem. ZKP uses cryptographic algorithms to verify transactions without uncovering the underlying data. Algorithms that enhance privacy, especially at the lower layers (e.g., L1), are being sought after, providing security for both customers and businesses. 

Buterin's roadmap includes four main areas of privacy: on-chain privacy, partial anonymization of applications, safeguarding privacy of ‘reads' to the blockchain, and network-level anonymity. He suggests this could be achieved by introducing privacy functions to wallets, including a user-friendly interface and security features activated by default. He further indicates that modularity could be used to enhance privacy, such as with the ‘one address per application model', where an address links to itself rather than to other addresses in the network. 

The roadmap includes a plan to simplify operations, with FOCIL and EIP-7701 standards, so that unnecessary metadata is reduced to a bare minimum, disallowing censors from filtering out content. Eavesdropping will be reduced by incorporating the short term TEE based Remote Protocol Calls (RPC), until Private Information Retrieval becomes more viable. Eavesdropping will be reduced by using multiple RPC, so that sensitive data is not exposed on the network. By lowering the attack space, Buterin aims to increase the security of blockchain users. Private transactions, moreover, will be made more secure and cost-effective by using proof aggregation protocols. Private wallets should have added features to keep private keys safe and should keep user data private to avoid data leakage. And links between applications should remain concealed so that RPC nodes, by accident or on purpose, cannot access metadata. 

Pascal Caversaccio, an Ethereum security researcher, pointed out that trustless technology opens the door to surveillance and a lack of privacy. A graph could be mined from the Ethereum metadata to detect the flow of money through the blockchain and view an individual's balance.

EIP-7701 simplifies security protocols by increasing their modularity, restructuring them so they don't need relays or public broadcasters. RPC nodes could be used to eavesdrop on a user's transaction. Security, therefore, can be enhanced by using programming techniques such as modularity to decrease the amount of data roaming around on the blockchain. Buterin seems to propose a programming approach to improving anonymity, with the added benefit of improving speed and efficiency. Ethereum has a very modular structure, and this strategy could fit in with the overall direction and expertise of the Ethereum community. 

Blockchain transactions have had increased scrutiny regarding privacy concerns. Ethereum has always stressed the importance of transparency, being an open-source project. But now, transparency is proving to be a double-edged sword, with increased accountability on one side and the dangers of censorship on the other side. Many enterprises prefer Ethereum because it has a strong development team. But various sectors like healthcare and finance require more secure transactions to preserve the privacy of their customers.

With EIP 1559 activated, Ether's economic model became similar to that of tech stocks, while Bitcoin BTCUSD solidified its ""store of value"" status. That was a major mistake for Ethereum that damaged ETH, Frax and Everipedia founder says.

Ethereum's network utility fails to catalyze ETH price

Ethereum ETHUSD, the largest smart contracts platform, remains ""amazing"" and is still on its way to becoming a major issuance layer in the world. At the same time, this inspiring tech journey has nothing to do with ETH price performance, Frax's Sam Kazemian shared on X.

This has been my thesis: Ethereum the network is amazing & going to be the major issuance ledger of the world. But very little, if any, of that value will be captured by the $ETH asset (due to ETH pivoting to a P/E DCF tech stock model). Empirical validation: https://t.co/91N2Sx8Qg6

As Ether ETHUSD keeps disappointing its community, Kazemian sees the wrong narrative as a root cause of its underperformance. With periodical token burn events introduced by EIP 1559 activation on Aug. 5, 2021, ETH pivoted to the wrong utility model:

Biggest mistake was changing the social Overton window of EIP1559 burns as revenue/stock buybacks instead of 'ETH is digital gold/silver/oil like $BTC & some of the commodity gets used up every block as part of the design."" Instead, it's now more tech stock instead of BTC-like.

Also, he opined that, if an EIP 1559 analogue was implemented in Bitcoin BTCUSD, the ""digital gold"" narrative of BTC maxis would also be damaged.

As such, with its P/E DCF (price-to-earnings discounted cash flow) valuation model, the ETH cryptocurrency fails to benefit from the battle-tested utility of its underlying blockchain.

As covered by U.Today previously, EIP 1559 with its fee burn events was the most radical upgrade of Ether tokenomics ever.

ETHBTC routinely finds new low; is it over for Ether?

Ethereum's ETHUSD underperformance compared to major cryptocurrencies is in the spotlight for the global crypto community.

In his thread, Nic Puckrin, Coin Bureau founder and CEO, shared some reasons for this painful situation. He noticed that the average ETH owner bears paper losses right now.

Ethereum is having a rough year.

With ETHBTC hitting fresh 5-year lows, the data tells an uncomfortable story.

Will the bleed continue?

Here's what's really going on 👇

Ethereum ETHUSD has lost its narrative battle to Bitcoin BTCUSD. Other L1s are eating its lunch when it comes to smart contracts deployment. Even Ether-based L2s siphon liquidity and damage ETH's value.

Institutional money — based on spot ETF performance in the U.S. — clearly chose Bitcoin BTCUSD over Ethereum ETHUSD. Also, it is highly unlikely to benefit from monetary injections globally.

That's why more blood might be ahead for the ETHBTC pair.

Today, on April 12 in early morning hours, ETHBTC hit another bottom at 0.18666. It means that 1 Bitcoin BTCUSD is now equal to 53.5 Ethers. This is the lowest rate for ETHBTC since early 2020, data says.

Bitcoin Dominance Rises To Major Rejection Zone","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:e52b39ea5094b:0-is-it-time-for-altcoin-season-bitcoin-dominance-rises-to-major-rejection-zone/","Sat, 12 Apr 2025 01:30:00 GMT","

Crypto analyst El Crypto has raised the possibility of an altcoin season happening soon. The analyst alluded to Bitcoin's dominance rising to a major rejection zone, which could be bullish for altcoins. 

Altcoin Season May Be Imminent As Dominance Hits Major Rejection Zone

In an X post, El Crypto suggested that the altcoin season may be imminent as Bitcoin's dominance hits a major resistance zone. He revealed that BTC's dominance again touched a zone that has led to rejection every time in the last one and a half years. He added that the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also in the overbought area, while a bearish cross has now happened again. 

Based on this, the analyst remarked that the market looks to be in for some fun, hinting at an altcoin season. Crypto analyst CryptoElites also affirmed that Bitcoin's dominance has reached its peak. He further affirmed that next up is a massive altcoin rally, which will usher in the alt season. 

In another X post, the crypto analyst alluded to the USDT and USDC dominance ratio. He claimed that the market was at a critical trend reaction point right now. CryptoElites then mentioned that if the stablecoins' dominance breaks down, then the altcoin season will officially begin. 

Crypto analyst Kevin Capital also looked to provide a bullish outlook towards the altcoin season. In an X post, he highlighted the global liquidity index overlaid with the Dogecoin price. In line with this, he remarked that it might be time for market participants to start paying attention to this. 

So far, altcoins have been mirroring Bitcoin's price action, suffering a similar downtrend amid the trade war. However, if the altcoin season were to kick into full gear, these altcoins could easily decouple from the flagship crypto and outperform. Ethereum is known to lead this altcoin season, but that may not be the case this time, as ETH has underperformed throughout this cycle. 

Still Bitcoin Season For Now

Blockchain Center data shows that it is still Bitcoin season for now, as the flagship crypto continues to outperform most altcoins. In the past 90 days, only seven out of the top 50 coins have outperformed the flagship crypto. These coins include Mantra, GateToken, Monero, LEO, Tron, and FastToken. 

For it to be altcoin season, 75% of the top 50 coins would need to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Although almost all coins have witnessed declines within this timeframe, BTC has suffered a 22% drop, which is less than what these altcoins have seen during this period. 

At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $80,900, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin whales just made waves again – snapping up a jaw-dropping $3.6B worth of $BTC in a single day.

As Bitcoin hovers above its 365-day moving average and funding rates turn bullish, the smart money is already scouting what comes next. And while the whales rarely speak, their actions say it all – they're not just betting on Bitcoin.

They're eyeing the next altcoin wave, and so should you.

From meme coins with brains to Bitcoin-leveraged moonshots, here are three new crypto projects that might just be catching the attention of the deep-pocketed few:

Whales don't just buy blindly. They're the early movers – the ones with research teams, insider connections, and deep conviction. When they act, it often signals a larger trend in motion.

Whales recently snapped up a staggering $3.6B in Bitcoin in just one day – a clear signal that big players are re-entering the market with conviction.

Right now, the market's mood is shifting. Bitcoin holding strong above its 365-day moving average is like a thumbs-up from the technical gods – historically, a signal of renewed strength.

Funding rates are also turning bullish again, suggesting leverage is being deployed on the long side. And while altcoins haven't yet exploded, the conditions are building. In fact, new crypto projects are already making headlines.

All of this adds up to one thing: altcoin season might not be official yet, but it's warming up fast. The question now isn't if altcoins will run — it's which ones.

If Bitcoin whales are back, then BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is their meme-powered shadow – designed to surge as Bitcoin sentiment explodes.

But this isn't just a hype coin. $BTCBULL is one of the first meme tokens that directly rewards its holders with real Bitcoin – and not just once.

Here's how it works: every time Bitcoin hits major price milestones – like $150K, or $200K – $BTCBULL holders can receive automatic $BTC airdrops.



But there's a catch: you only get these airdrops if you purchased $BTCBULL through Best Wallet and continue to hold it there. No Best Wallet, no rewards. It's a smart way to reward committed holders and keep the community sticky.

At just $0.00246 per token and with over $4.5M already raised in presale, $BTCBULL is turning heads.
It's more than just a meme — it's a leveraged, community-driven way to ride Bitcoin's run to $1M without needing to buy a full $BTC. Think of it as a Bitcoin-themed lottery ticket – with way better odds and actual utility.

Let's be honest – meme coins aren't going anywhere. But not all memes are created equal. With $DOGE drifting and $SHIB losing steam, there's a new contender riding in on a unicycle of chaotic genius: Mind of Pepe ($MIND).

Priced at $0.0037065 and already raising over $9.1M in presale, $MIND is much more than another frog-themed token. It's the first major meme coin brand powered by an autonomous AI agent – one that's not just smart, but self-evolving.



Mind of Pepe isn't here to follow trends. It's here to create them. Its AI agent interacts with X, analyzes hive-mind behavior, and generates real-time crypto insights. This isn't passive tracking – it's influence in motion.

The AI also has access to its own wallet, can interact with dApps, launch tokens, and even offer early access to new crypto projects before they go public.

Presale buyers also benefit from exclusive staking rewards (up to 283%) – making early entry even sweeter.
It's a meme coin with a mind, a wallet, and maybe even a soul.

If $BTCBULL is the bullish amplifier and $MIND is the frog with a brain, Smog Token ($SMOG) is the dragon blowing smoke all over Solana – and possibly Ethereum next.

It started as a meme, sure, but with an explosive entry into the Solana ecosystem and a fast-growing fanbase – including 34.4K followers on X – $SMOG is now turning heads across crypto circles.

Currently trading at $0.007729, $SMOG has captured attention with its unique approach to community engagement. The project boasts a massive 1B $SMOG allocation dedicated to rewarding its community through various initiatives.

What sets $SMOG apart is its multi-chain vision. While it originated on Solana, it then expanded to Ethereum, creating cross-chain liquidity and broader market exposure.

This strategic move positions $SMOG as a versatile player in the meme coin arena.​

With its fiery branding, robust community incentives, and ambitious roadmap, $SMOG is more than just vapor – it's a meme coin with momentum.

The whales are back, and they're swimming in circles that suggest more than just a Bitcoin bounce.

With new crypto projects like $BTCBULL, $MIND, and $SMOG catching attention, it might be time to follow the fin and see where the real action's going next.

Crypto World News

April 12, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

Crypto is cooking up another bull run, and if history's taught the space anything, it's that momentum favors the well-prepped. This next leg up won't just reward hype coins and memecoins—it's going to favor projects with utility, traction, and tech that fits the times. And with everything from macro trends to layer upgrades taking shape, the setup for 2025 is already looking spicy.

One altcoin making serious waves is Qubetics. It's not some recycled project with new branding—it's a fresh play on solving one of crypto's oldest headaches: interoperability. Qubetics is giving people from all walks of life, from solo hustlers to full-scale enterprises, the tools to move value and data across blockchains without breaking a sweat.

For folks looking to make moves before the next breakout, here are the 3 best altcoins to buy for next bull run: Qubetics, Stellar, and EOS. Let's dig in.

Qubetics is bringing something real to the table—interoperability that makes sense for regular folks, not just developers. Think about it like this: a freelance developer in Chicago gets paid in ETH, but needs to use funds on a Solana-based platform. Qubetics makes that seamless. No bridges, no clunky swaps, no wallet headaches.

For small businesses, it's even bigger. A boutique in Austin running its loyalty tokens on Avalanche can interact with a supply chain dApp on Ethereum without writing a single line of code. Even Web2 businesses are jumping in. A digital agency in Toronto is already using Qubetics to let clients pay in the token of their choice while the agency settles in stablecoins. That level of frictionless value flow is what blockchain's been missing for years.

This isn't just talk. Qubetics is running an advanced interoperability layer that connects blockchains natively, with real-world support for compliance, multi-sig, and scalability. It's built for the folks who need tools that just work.

Stage 29 of the Qubetics top crypto presale is live, and the numbers are wild. Over 507 million $TICS tokens have already been scooped up by more than 24,600 holders, with $16 million raised so far. Each token is going for $0.1573, but good luck grabbing that price much longer.

Analysts are throwing out bold predictions—and they're not off base. If $TICS hits $1 after launch, that's a 535% return. At $5? A 3,078% ROI. Some are calling for $10–$15 after mainnet hits, which would land early backers a sky-high ROI of 9,434%.

And this isn't some hopium fantasy. With working interoperability tech, community buzz, and real-world integration, it's shaping up to be one of the most anticipated launches of the cycle.

Why did this coin make it to this list Qubetics made the list because it's solving interoperability in a way that real people and businesses can use—without all the confusing layers. Its presale success, combined with cross-chain functionality, makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Stellar is making a serious comeback—quietly but powerfully. The rise of stablecoins has pulled XLM right back into the spotlight. With nearly $300 million in USDC now circulating on Stellar, the network's usage has jumped across fintech, peer-to-peer payments, and even NGO disbursements.

For community members and small businesses, this means fast, cheap payments without dealing with complex wallet setups or unpredictable fees. In New York, independent service providers are using Stellar wallets to accept global payments instantly. In parts of Latin America, Stellar's being tapped for remittances that beat traditional banking by a mile in speed and cost.

And devs love it, too. New wallet integrations and developer tools have made building on Stellar faster and easier, especially for financial tools. The chain recently updated its AMM and token issuance frameworks to support stablecoin-based DeFi—something that could bring in serious traction in 2025.

The numbers are solid. Stellar has processed over 70 million transactions in just the last month, with active addresses jumping 15% in North America alone. Price-wise, XLM is rebounding off long-term support at $0.22. A clean break above $0.25 could kick off a rally toward $0.40 or higher.

On-chain activity keeps rising while the price still floats below historical averages. That kind of divergence is usually a recipe for a bullish breakout.

Why did this coin make it to this list Stellar made the cut because it's still the king of low-cost global transactions. With stablecoin demand booming and cross-border payments on the rise, XLM is right in the sweet spot for the next bull run.

EOS has been counted out before, but it's quietly laying the groundwork for a big return. With one of the fastest consensus mechanisms out there, EOS is built for apps that need high throughput, low latency, and real scalability. In 2025, that's not optional—it's a requirement.

The EOS community is also doing something rare in crypto: overhauling governance in a way that actually makes it more decentralized. The EOS Network Foundation (ENF) has been rolling out tools to give DAOs and users more say over resources, upgrades, and validator actions. That builds trust, and in crypto, trust is currency.

And developers are coming back. With new grants and performance upgrades, EOS is seeing growth in Web3 gaming, DeFi, and enterprise tooling—especially in areas that Ethereum still struggles with, like real-time transactions.

After bottoming out near $0.60, EOS has started forming higher lows and building volume. Traders are watching for a break above $1.00, which could ignite a run toward $1.80 or more. The big play? The ecosystem is getting leaner and more focused—and that sets it up for real momentum if the market turns bullish.

The EOS comeback story isn't loud, but it's happening. And when it clicks, it'll surprise a lot of people.

Why did this coin make it to this list EOS earned its spot because it's still one of the fastest, most scalable chains out there. With a governance revamp and ecosystem upgrades underway, it could be a sleeper hit in the next bull run.

Qubetics, Stellar, and EOS aren't just buzzy names. They're platforms with real features, active communities, and growth potential that isn't tied to market noise. Whether it's Qubetics' game-changing interoperability, Stellar's cross-border dominance, or EOS's high-speed enterprise focus—these altcoins are built for what's coming.

When the market heats up again, the ones building now will be the first to pop. These three should be at the top of the watchlist for anyone looking for the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

1.What makes Qubetics stand out from other altcoins? 

Qubetics delivers real cross-chain interoperability that works for small businesses, professionals, and enterprises without tech complexity.

2.How much has Qubetics raised so far in its top crypto presale? 

Over $16 million, with 507 million tokens sold across 24,600+ buyers.

3.Why is Stellar gaining traction again? 

Stellar's low-fee transactions and growing USDC activity have made it a go-to network for stablecoin payments and remittances.

4.Is EOS still relevant in 2025? 

Yes. EOS is gaining momentum through its governance upgrades, speed, and performance-based features tailored to real-world applications.

5.What kind of ROI can early $TICS buyers expect? 

Analyst predictions suggest $TICS could return anywhere from 535% to 9434% depending on the price after launch.

Key Takeaways:

According to TRONSCAN data, TRON's global user base has now crossed the 300 million mark. As of April 12, 2025, the network's reach is no longer merely impressive — it's historic.

TRON founder Justin Sun called the milestone just the beginning, emphasizing that the ultimate mission is to build a single blockchain network serving all 8 billion people. The network adds over 200,000 new accounts daily, which makes it one of the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems globally.

This isn't just a flashy statistic — it reflects real-world impact. DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, global payments, and more have been built on the backbone that TRON has provided over the past several years. Its low fees and high throughput have made it a popular choice for users looking for a fast, inexpensive transaction — from micro-tipping and rent payments to billion-dollar mints of tokens. Retail users and institutions alike are drawn to the combination of reliability, speed, and affordability.

TRON's ascent has also been paralleled by the growing popularity of TRON-based decentralized applications (dApps), including JustLend, SunSwap, and WinkLink, all of which have added to the stickiness of the ecosystem. Several gaming platforms have also begun integrating TRON-based assets for in-game economies and player-owned content.

As the web3 boom takes off in its wake, TRON has become a global value network—bridging people, platforms, and the flow of capital for a cross-border economy. Its infrastructure has been instrumental in reshaping financial inclusion — most notably in areas where conventional banking is unreliable or simply out of reach. By removing intermediaries and delays, TRON enables near-instant payments even in areas with minimal fintech infrastructure.

It was once just a blockchain content-sharing project, and now it's a game-changing platform for finance, entertainment, even governance. Developers continue to build on TRON Virtual Machine (TVM), harnessing the scale of TRON with ETH compatibility to avoid congestion and high gas fees. Developers migrating from Ethereum often find TRON's environment more scalable and cost-effective for launching dApps.



TRON's ambition doesn't stop at 300 million. The next challenge is clearly defined: reaching 8 billion people. It's an ambitious goal, but one that fits in with TRON's historical vision of creating a decentralized internet.

TRON is targeting several core sectors to get there:

The symbolic weight of 300 million accounts is hard to ignore. Reaching that number demonstrates how blockchain has moved beyond a niche tool for crypto natives and is now becoming part of everyday infrastructure. Whether it is tipping creators on social platforms or sending remittances home, users are witnessing real value creation in the TRON ecosystem.

TRON's success may also put pressure on other blockchain platforms to optimize for speed, low cost and simplicity — attributes that have allowed it to flourish even as competitors have faltered over scalability.

The best crypto to buy now might not just be about hype, it could be about timing. 

As US lawmakers push to accelerate blockchain-friendly legislation, the stage is quietly being set for a new wave of innovation and investment. 

Projects with real utility, strong narratives, and community momentum like Dawgz AI are well-positioned to benefit from this policy shift. 

With regulators easing off the brakes and Washington finally showing signs of support, the crypto space is getting a much-needed green light. 

For years, crypto in the US has been in regulatory limbo, too big to ignore, yet too risky to embrace fully. But that's changing. 

A bipartisan group of lawmakers is now working to fast-track crypto legislation to create clearer rules around digital assets, blockchain infrastructure, and decentralized technologies.

And the Department of Justice is signalling a softer stance on crypto enforcement, focusing more on collaboration than crackdowns.

Here's why that matters:

Clear regulations mean institutional investors, fintech partnerships, and long-term capital.Innovation without fearDevelopers and startups can build without fear of shutdowns or lawsuits.US-based projects get a boostAs the environment becomes more welcoming, domestic projects can grow, and global crypto startups may choose to move to the US.What makes crypto worth buying in a pro-innovation climate?Regulatory Compliance.

Dawgz AI fits that bill. While it uses meme culture for community growth, it's backed by a functional core, AIdriven trading algorithms, staking ecosystem, and transparent, audited smart contracts.That mix of tech, accessibility, and community appeal is what makes it a good example of the kind of project that could benefit from a more structured, pro-crypto US landscape.

During the recent Paris Blockchain Week on April 9, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed plans for a significant airdrop associated with the Midnight sidechain project. 

During the recent Paris Blockchain Week on April 9, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed plans for a significant airdrop associated with the Midnight sidechain project. This initiative aims to reach approximately 37 million users across eight prominent blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche and Polygon.

The Midnight project focuses on enhancing user privacy through the use of zero-knowledge proofs, allowing seamless interaction across different blockchains without requiring token conversion. Hoskinson referred to this capability as ""chain abstraction.""

The upcoming airdrop will distribute two types of tokens: the governance token, NIGHT, and the privacy transaction token, DUST. Unlike traditional airdrops, which typically target early funders and select users, the Midnight airdrop will encompass a much broader audience, significantly expanding the reach of Cardano's ecosystem.

In his keynote address, Hoskinson also discussed the evolution of blockchain technology, outlining four distinct phases. The first phase, exemplified by Bitcoin, emphasized decentralization. The second phase, represented by Ethereum, introduced smart contracts—self-executing programs that operate under specific conditions.

The third phase focused on scalability and interoperability, enhancing transaction throughput and network interactions.

Hoskinson noted that blockchain technology is currently entering its fourth phase, which prioritizes privacy. This shift reflects an increasing awareness of user confidentiality in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.

India, the world's second-largest tea producer after China, is set to implement a blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered auction system to enhance transparency and streamline operations within the tea industry.

The northeastern state of Assam has announced its plans to collaborate with various tea industry stakeholders to establish India's first AI-driven, blockchain-based tea auction platform. This innovative system is poised to transform the tea trade by ensuring secure transactions and promoting fair pricing practices. By leveraging these advanced technologies, the platform is expected to not only boost the efficiency of the tea industry but also strengthen Assam's reputation as a global leader in the tea sector. 

As the largest tea-producing state in India, Assam contributes more than 50% of the nation's total tea output, making this initiative a key step in solidifying its dominance in the global tea industry.

“Assam will work with tea industry stakeholders to introduce India's first AI-driven, blockchain-based tea auction system to enhance transparency and efficiency,” the Assam Budget 2025-2026 said.  

“This digital platform will revolutionize the tea trade by ensuring secure transactions and fair pricing. The initiative will strengthen Assam's position as a global leader in the tea industry.”

Assam's finance minister, Ajanta Neog, presented the 2025-26 fiscal year budget in the state Assembly. The state is gearing up for provincial elections due in early 2026.

Assam, known for producing premium tea, is a vital contributor to India's tea exports. However, issues such as price manipulation and lack of transparency have long plagued the auction system. Integrating blockchain and AI technologies is poised to revolutionize the tea industry, driving economic growth for both Assam and India.

This digital transformation aligns with Assam's broader goal of embracing advanced technologies to foster sustainable development. By adopting these innovations, Assam sets a benchmark for other states and industries to follow. The new platform is expected to provide equal market access for all participants, from small-scale farmers to large estates, offering data-driven insights, fair pricing, and a secure, decentralized system to eliminate fraud. In addition to auctions, the blockchain system will enhance supply chain transparency, while AI is expected to streamline the auction process by analyzing market trends, reducing delays, and improving efficiency.











Indian tea auctions are some of the largest and most influential globally, with prominent centers in cities like Kolkata, Guwahati, and Cochin, which are key to the country's tea industry. A tea auction is a platform where tea growers, sellers, and buyers gather to bid on and purchase different types of tea. These auctions are typically held at specialized centers and are essential in setting the prices and determining the supply of tea in the market. Producers present samples of their tea, and potential buyers—ranging from traders to packers and distributors—place bids based on the quality and demand for the tea. This auction process plays a vital role in price determination, ensuring transparent and fair transactions for both buyers and sellers. 

Tea, or “chai” as it is commonly known in India, is far beyond a mere drink; it is a cornerstone of the nation's cultural identity. India's deep-rooted connection with tea spans hundreds of years, and it has grown to become the world's second-largest producer of this beverage. The country's rich cultural traditions and varied landscapes provide an ideal setting for tea cultivation, making it a vital agricultural product. Tea plays a central role in social interactions, daily routines, and even religious practices, making it an inseparable element of Indian life.

According to Tea Board of India data, India produced 1284.78 million kilograms of the tea crop during January and December 2024, a drop of 7.8% during the same period in 2023 when the production figure was 1393.66 million kilograms. The decline was due to unfavourable weather conditions, including heat waves and floods, which disrupted production during the crucial harvesting period. This drop in production caused a significant rise in tea prices. The average cost of tea in 2024 reached 198.76 rupees ($2.32) per kilogram, marking an increase of nearly 18% compared to the previous year.

However, Indian tea exports in 2024 jumped almost 10% compared to 2023, driven by demand from UAE, Iraq, and Russia. According to the Tea Board data, India exported 254.67 million kilograms of the crop between January and December 2024, about 10% higher than the 231.69 million kilograms it exported during the same period in 2023. India primarily exports CTC (crush-tear-curl) grade tea to markets like Egypt and the United Kingdom, while the orthodox variety is shipped to Iraq, Iran, and Russia.

Assam's other initiatives

Assam is also planning India's first AI-powered anti-deepfake and cyber surveillance laboratory.

“Assam Police will be encouraged to set up India's first AI-based lab to combat deepfake threats and enhance cyber surveillance. This cutting-edge facility will strengthen cybersecurity, digital forensics, and online threat detection. The initiative will position Assam as a leader in AI-driven law enforcement and cybercrime prevention,” the provincial government said in the Budget document.

The Assam government plans to modernize land revenue collection and make it more accessible. Assam is transitioning to the National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) under the “One Nation, One Software” initiative. Additionally, the state plans to use geospatial tools for accurate land valuation and implement blockchain in NGDRS for secure and faster transactions, the Budget document stated.

Home » AB Charity Foundation Launches with Blockchain-Powered Mission

The AB Charity Foundation has officially commenced its global operations alongside the unveiling of its revamped website, www.ab.org. This milestone marks the formal entry of the organization into the international nonprofit arena, introducing a public-interest initiative that merges technological innovation with institutional integrity. Headquartered in Ireland and operating under recognized legal frameworks within the European Union, the Foundation is structured as a nonprofit committed to reshaping the landscape of sustainable development and rebuilding global trust in governance and collaboration.

Positioning itself at the intersection of governmental, civil, and technological sectors, the Foundation is guided by a board of directors composed of highly respected former European leaders. The board is chaired by Bertie Ahern, Ireland's former Prime Minister who played a significant role in brokering the historic Good Friday Agreement. Other board members include Lawrence Gonzi, Péter Medgyessy, Danilo Türk, and Petar Stoyanov—former heads of state and government from Malta, Hungary, Slovenia, and Bulgaria, respectively.

Alongside its executive leadership, the Foundation is in the process of assembling a globally representative advisory board. This body is intended to include esteemed individuals from all five continents—ranging from former presidents and scientists to diplomats and cultural influencers. Their collective expertise will guide the Foundation's strategic direction and promote collaboration across borders in the execution of high-impact social initiatives.

The Foundation's overarching mission centers around the advancement of global welfare, with a focus on education, health care, environmental protection, and humanitarian support. The organization has conveyed that its approach is built upon a foundation of transparent governance and cutting-edge blockchain systems, aiming to create a model of cooperation that is verifiable and trustworthy. The leadership has articulated the belief that technological change is not driven by innovation alone, but by the global consensus that trustworthy institutions are essential to meaningful progress.

The operational backbone of the Foundation is supported by AB DAO, which supplies the blockchain framework that powers its financial and administrative functions. A key feature of this infrastructure is the automated redirection of 15% to 30% of the gas fees from each transaction on the AB public blockchain to a dedicated charity pool. This on-chain funding mechanism enables a new philanthropic model—one that integrates automated donations, real-time transparency, blockchain-based audits, and third-party compliance oversight.

Additionally, a portion of the returns generated through the AB Ecosystem Fund—ranging from 15% to 30%—is allocated to the Foundation's charitable reserves. This fund has already financed numerous initiatives, with additional programs under development. These financial inflows contribute to the long-term sustainability of the Foundation's global mission.

By incorporating the core strengths of blockchain technology—namely traceability, auditability, and automation—the AB Charity Foundation aims to set a precedent for future philanthropic frameworks. Its leadership envisions a system where every contribution is not only accounted for but also demonstrably linked to its intended purpose, thus reinforcing public confidence in the integrity of charitable initiatives.

        Share    

The NFT market is feeling the impact of the broader crypto slump, with sales volume decreasing by 4.7% to $94.7 million.

According to data from CryptoSlam, this is a continued downward trend from the previous week's $102.8 million. The drop extends beyond just sales volume, with NFT buyers plummeting by 77.9% to 128,244, and NFT sellers falling by 75.2% to 85,792. NFT transactions have also declined by 6.3% to 1,441,009.

The downward momentum coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) dropping to the $83,000 level. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) has lost 13.5% of its value in the last seven days and is hovering at the $1,500 level. 

The global crypto market cap is now $2.63 trillion.

The Ethereum blockchain remains the dominant player with $36.1 million in sales, up 41.3% from last week. However, this boost in Ethereum sales wasn't enough to offset declines across other chains.

Polygon (POL) is in second place with $17.4 million in sales volume and has shown a modest 4.3% increase. Mythos Chain follows in third with $14.1 million, up slightly by 2%.

Solana (SOL) continues to struggle as sales have dropped sharply by 33.4% to $6.5 million. Immutable rounds out the top five with $5.5 million in sales, up 15.4% from the previous week.

Wash trading patterns have changed, as Polygon now leads at $2.6 million. This is a notable 232.6% increase. Ethereum's wash trading also decreased by 9.2% to $2.5 million.

Regarding the top NFT collections, Courtyard on Polygon has maintained its top position with $15.6 million in sales and a 6.1% increase. CryptoPunks has elevated to second place with $9.1 million and a 168.3% surge.

DMarket is now in third place with $8.9 million, a 4.4% increase. A newcomer, f(x) wstETH position on Ethereum, has entered the rankings in fourth place with $5.8 million in sales.

Guild of Guardians Heroes completes the top five with $3.7 million in sales, up 29.4% from the previous week.

The week saw a high-value sale with CryptoPunks #3100 selling for 4,000 ETH ($6,042,922). Other notable high-value sales include:

This week, OpenSea asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to officially declare that NFTs are not “exchanges or brokers” under U.S. securities law. 

In a letter to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, OpenSea argued that NFTs usually have only one seller per token — so platforms like theirs don't function like traditional stock exchanges or brokers.

They emphasized that all NFT transactions happen on-chain via smart contracts, with OpenSea simply acting as a discovery tool—not an intermediary, custodian, or advice-giver. 

To avoid future confusion, OpenSea is asking the SEC to issue clear guidance, like a bulletin or interpretive release, to confirm NFT marketplaces aren't covered by exchange rules. 

This push follows OpenSea's brush with a Wells notice last year—though the SEC dropped the investigation in early 2025 after President Donald Trump told the agency to pause crypto enforcement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","NFT iGaming Metaverse: The Future of Crypto Casinos","https://whatstrending.com/nft-igaming-metaverse-the-future-of-crypto-casinos/","Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:45:15 GMT","

In a world where the lines between reality and virtuality continue to blur, one industry stands at the forefront of technological innovation: iGaming. As the popularity of online iGaming skyrockets, traditional casinos are increasingly being left in the dust by their digital counterparts.

And now, with the advent of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), the game is changing once again. Enter the realm of White Label Casinos, where virtual casino meets the Metaverse in a truly groundbreaking fusion of cutting-edge technology and high-stakes entertainment.

These White Label Casinos, powered by NFTs, offer players a unique and immersive gaming experience unlike anything they've ever seen. Imagine stepping into a virtual casino, complete with all the glitz and glamour of its real-world counterpart, but with a twist – every chip, every card, every spin of the wheel is tracked and authenticated through blockchain technology, ensuring fair play and security like never before.

Players can buy, sell, and trade NFTs representing rare in-game items and exclusive digital assets, adding a whole new layer of excitement and intrigue to the gaming experience. But the benefits of NFTs in iGaming don't stop there.

By choosing the perfect white label casino platform, operators can customize and brand their platforms with ease, creating a truly unique online destination for players to enjoy. And with the ability to integrate NFTs into loyalty programs, tournaments, and other promotional activities, the potential for growth and engagement is limitless.

So buckle up, dear reader, as we delve into the wild and wonderful world of White Label Casinos, where NFTs reign supreme and the possibilities are endless. Welcome to the future of iGaming – welcome to the Virtual Casino Metaverse.

By tokenizing in-game assets on blockchain platforms, players can securely own and authenticate items and skins, promoting transparency and trust in the gaming ecosystem. NFT technology allows for secure trading of rare and unique digital assets, giving players the chance to collect and trade valuable items between games. This not only enhances the gaming experience by letting players truly own their virtual possessions, but also opens up profit opportunities for developers and creators. Additionally, the concept of the metaverse expands NFT integration, creating immersive virtual worlds where players can participate in various activities, including virtual Casino. As the iGaming industry evolves, leveraging NFTs can revolutionize the gaming experience, giving players ownership and creating a more engaging and interactive environment.

NFTs let players truly own in-game assets. Each token is unique and cannot be copied, adding value to virtual items. By using blockchain technology, NFTs create a secure and transparent system for trading rare virtual goods, improving the gaming experience. This integration allows players to personalize their gaming experience with exclusive digital assets, enhancing engagement in online gaming worlds.

Moreover, NFT integration in iGaming opens up revenue opportunities through unique virtual asset creation and sales. Game developers can use this marketplace to make limited edition items, collectibles, or in-game accessories for purchase with NFTs. This approach builds exclusivity and community in the gaming community while introducing a new revenue model.

By staying updated with blockchain technology and NFTs, iGaming platforms can meet the preferences of modern gamers looking for unique experiences in virtual worlds.

Players may struggle to distinguish between the virtual world and reality, leading to excessive iGaming . Without face-to-face interactions, it's easier for people to ignore responsible gaming practices. Cybersecurity threats like hacking and data breaches are more common in online casino platforms, putting players' information and transactions at risk.

Regulatory compliance and jurisdictional challenges are other risks of virtual iGaming . Establishing consistent regulations across different regions can be complex, creating opportunities for illegal iGaming to thrive. Players may also struggle to resolve disputes or issues with online casino platforms due to the lack of standardized regulations. Industry stakeholders and regulators must work together to develop strong measures to address these risks and ensure the safety of virtual iGaming experiences.

As technology advances, players can expect more immersive gaming experiences in the future. The use of blockchain technology and NFTs will make transactions and ownership of in-game assets easier, creating new revenue streams for players and developers. Virtual reality casinos and metaverse iGaming environments are changing how people interact with online gaming, giving a glimpse into the future of iGaming.

The future of the iGaming industry also includes promising developments in regulatory frameworks and responsible iGaming practices. As virtual iGaming platforms become more popular, regulatory bodies will likely set guidelines to ensure fair play, consumer protection, and data security. The industry is moving towards promoting responsible gaming behaviors and implementing safeguards to prevent iGaming addiction.

By focusing on transparency and compliance, the iGaming industry is evolving to attract a wider audience and create a safe and enjoyable gaming environment for all players.

Governments around the world are enacting laws to protect players and regulate online casino platforms. Factors like data protection, age verification, responsible gaming practices, and cybersecurity are crucial in virtual iGaming regulation. It is essential to establish a legal framework to safeguard players' interests and maintain the integrity of online gaming platforms.

Regulatory authorities play a vital role in overseeing virtual iGaming operations to prevent fraud, money laundering, and underaged gambling. Implementing strict regulatory measures builds trust among players and ensures a safe gaming environment. By enforcing compliance with regulations and conducting audits, regulatory bodies can effectively monitor online casino platforms.

Collaboration between regulators, industry stakeholders, and technology providers is crucial for developing comprehensive regulatory frameworks. Effective regulation of virtual iGaming contributes to the sustainability of the iGaming industry and protects players from potential risks.

Players can collect rare NFTs and trade them with others to potentially earn real-world profits. This unique gaming approach combines entertainment with financial rewards, appealing to a diverse range of gamers interested in both aspects. Additionally, NFT iGaming introduces new gameplay mechanics and experiences.

Developers can incorporate exclusive in-game items, limited edition content, and personalized gaming experiences based on NFT integration. These opportunities enhance player engagement and immersion, creating a deeper connection between users and the games they enjoy. By utilizing NFT technology, the iGaming industry can develop interactive and rewarding gaming environments that meet the demand for innovation and player-driven experiences in the digital age.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

AUSTIN — On a Friday morning last spring, Mark Suman called out sick from his job as a senior engineering project manager at Apple and made his way downtown to a place called the Bitcoin Commons, a sort of clubhouse for enthusiasts of the world's largest cryptocurrency, situated a few blocks south of the Texas State Capitol.

At the time, Suman was, in his words, ""an active hobbyist,"" tinkering with the technology in his spare time. ""I actually played around with it a bit within Apple as well,"" he says. ""There's not a lot I can say, other than we were always exploring new technologies, and so I was playing around with some of the open-source bitcoin tools within Apple and doing some exploratory work.""

Suman was there for the annual 'Bitcoin Takeover' event. He had followed many of the speakers online and when he saw the gathering pop up on his feed, he took the day off to see it for himself.

""I was sitting in the crowd wanting to get into the space and really build something new and build something novel,"" Suman recalled.

What happened instead was the beginning of a professional pivot: he struck up a conversation with a developer after a talk at the Commons, and was introduced to other coders who were winding down a project called Mutiny. Within a few months, Suman handed in his notice at Apple and with the developers he'd met, pivoted into something bigger — co-founding Open Secret, a startup reimagining how user data is stored in the cloud. Instead of relying on centralized databases, the company encrypts data to each individual user — even after it's uploaded. So if there's a breach, there's nothing to steal, Suman explained. No honeypot.

The leap was not without stakes.

""There are plenty of sleepless nights,"" he said. ""I've got a family, I've got kids, I've got a kid off at university.""

He had spent years working on privacy infrastructure — tackling tough technical problems around user protection at scale — but saw a way to do it better with blockchain. ""Apple likes to talk a big game about privacy,"" he says. ""And having been there, I've seen very deep within a lot of their systems that they do care about privacy at every level.""

That vision — and the Commons — helped give him conviction. The builders there were all laser focused on creating something that mattered.

Bitcoin Commons sits on the second floor of the Littlefield Building at the corner of Congress Avenue and Sixth Street — where the broad boulevard to the Capitol collides with the noisy sprawl of Austin's nightlife district. It's an apt metaphor for the space itself.

By day, it serves as a clean, open-plan coworking hub for bitcoin operators and builders. At night, it transforms into a gathering place for rogue developers and off-the-record meetups. Events here draw a blend of venture capitalists, open-source contributors, off-grid energy technicians, and Lightning engineers — developers who build software to make bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. On some afternoons, once happy hour hits, the kitchen in the back converts into a bar.

""Bitcoin is the most important technological innovation in any of our lifetimes, and it needs its due,"" said Parker Lewis, one of the stewards of the Commons and the author of a new book on bitcoin called ""Gradually, Then Suddenly.""

""And so while bitcoin has no CEO and no marketing team, we here at the Bitcoin Commons and Bitcoiners all over the world help educate people about bitcoin, why it's important, what's being built, and present a vision for the future,"" continued Lewis.

""The vibe, it's always high signal,"" said Dan Lawrence, CEO of OBM, which manages energy use for industrial-scale mining farms. Lawrence said he was ""thankful"" that the U.S. government had become a little more pro-bitcoin under the new administration, but added, ""No matter what happens anywhere, everybody here is always going to bleed bitcoin.""

This year, the Commons feels different — not because bitcoiners have changed, but because the world around them has. The mood is bullish. Strategic. Triumphant, even.

Bitcoin's price mirrored this optimism, surging to an all-time high of nearly $110,000 in January, coinciding with Trump's inauguration. By early April, it had retraced to the low $70,000s before rebounding to nearly $85,000 as of Saturday morning — volatility that underscores the market's sensitivity to political developments and investor sentiment.

Just a year ago, the vibe in the Commons was cautious. Even bitcoin — the asset largely spared by securities law — felt the chill of an aggressive regulatory regime. Developers were being arrested around the world. Wallet providers were being pressured. Open-source projects landed on sanctions lists. The question then was, who would be next?

Then came the election. Trump's return to the White House brought with it a full-court press of pro-bitcoin policy moves. Within his first 100 days, he'd pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and three co-founders of the BitMEX crypto exchange, established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and appointed a ""crypto czar"" to oversee the federal government's digital asset efforts. Even skeptics found themselves nodding.

""I was in Nashville when Trump spoke,"" Suman recalled of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Tennessee, where Trump made his first major address to the crypto industry. ""I wasn't planning on going. But you know, when someone like that is in town, you go see it.""

Suman says he feels Trump has delivered on his promises to the crypto community for the most part. Still, he remains cautious. ""I am not one who embraces politicians,"" Suman said. ""I'm kind of apolitical as far as which side. So I only trust them until I see how it's actually playing out in our life. So far, I think it's going well, but it could really change.""

Kevin Hurley, CTO at Lightspark, says Washington's stance toward crypto appears to be shifting, with regulators like the SEC taking a less combative approach — moving away from lawsuits and toward clearer capital markets rules. ""Hopefully now we're actually going to have some clarity on what is and what isn't a security, what can actually be done,"" he said.

But even in a friendlier political climate, caution over government involvement remains a feature, not a bug, of the crypto community.

Joe Kelly, CEO of Unchained — a startup that helps clients store bitcoin securely by holding their own private keys — said it's smart to be careful what you wish for when it comes to the U.S. government owning a lot of bitcoin. ""That can go other ways,"" he said.

To date, the government's so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has underwhelmed some digital asset advocates, since it's limited to bitcoin previously seized in enforcement actions — not newly purchased assets or sovereign investment. Still, the administration has directed the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore budget-neutral ways to acquire more bitcoin.

Kelly acknowledges a shift in the regulatory atmosphere, but he's also wary of premature celebration, even with big market wins like the launch of exchange-traded funds that allow investors widespread access to bitcoin.

""If something like the ETF had launched too soon, I think it could have distracted from the people building on the actual technology itself,"" Kelly said. ""We've had the fortune that for most of Unchained's life there wasn't an ETF,"" he added of the firm's efforts to educate investors on how to store their crypto.

The shift has had ripple effects across the industry, including insurance.

Becca Rubenfeld, COO of Anchor Watch, says regulatory movement is opening the door for bitcoin to be treated like any other financial asset. Traditional insurers don't cover bitcoin directly — they insure the infrastructure around it. But if bitcoin becomes an admitted asset on insurance company balance sheets, that changes everything.

""Currently, the industry is extremely underserved,"" Rubenfeld told CNBC. ""But what Anchor Watch is doing is specifically insuring the asset itself. So we built a proprietary custody solution. And when customers use us for custody services, Lloyd's of London backed insurance is included in those services.""

The demand is growing. So is the pressure to build — and secure — the technical infrastructure that makes bitcoin work.

Mike Schmidt, executive director of Brink, which funds open-source bitcoin developers through a nonprofit structure, emphasized the importance of supporting the engineers maintaining bitcoin's underlying infrastructure. ""Bitcoin needs engineers,"" he said.

""We have a $2 trillion asset. We have strategic reserves of bitcoin being held by countries, and there's just this small group of engineers that are keeping this thing together at the code base,"" Schmidt said. ""There's only maybe 40 full-time engineers working on this. So we want to make sure that the engineering growth can keep pace with its broader adoption.""

Lisa Neigut started as a back-end engineer at Cash App, where she worked on their internal bitcoin product, before moving to Blockstream and spending six years as an open-source developer on the Lightning Network. These days, she runs Bitcoin++, one of the largest technical conference series in the space, with six events planned across six countries this year.

""Bitcoin++ is focused on bringing together bitcoin developers and builders to talk about what they're working on — the frontier of bitcoin,"" Neigut said. ""You can get an idea of what bitcoin is going to look like tomorrow.""

That sense of momentum resonates with filmmaker Alana Mediavilla, who spent five years at Google working on films about big data and cloud infrastructure. She screened her new documentary, Dirty Coin, a feature-length project looking at bitcoin's energy footprint and the people behind the infrastructure, at the Commons.

""I had put in my time in the cloud space,"" she says. ""I understood what data centers were, I understood where it was going, and I also understood how much energy it takes to run these huge facilities that right now are running the backbone of our society.""

Her goal wasn't to necessarily defend bitcoin mining but to broaden the conversation. ""I just want to get everybody's data center literacy up to a certain point where we can continue to have conversations about it, because it's not going away.""

She describes the crowd in Austin as a coming together of people ""very committed to their craft"" — and in her view, driven more by shared ideals than by profit-seeking.

""People think that it's like a get-rich-quick,"" she said. ""Maybe those were the old days for bitcoin. Now, if you want 100x you should look at altcoins and meme coins and other stuff, but you're probably not going to get that with bitcoin.""

""What brings them together is that they want to have better money, and they want to have a more fair world,"" she added. ""So the principles are solid. How we implement those principles — that's where the variety and spice of life comes in.""

A surge of new funding is also reshaping bitcoin's builder economy.

Venture investment in bitcoin-related startups soared in 2024 alongside the crypto market's rally. The number of pre-seed deals in the space climbed 50% last year, according to research from Trammell Venture Partners, an Austin-based VC firm focused on bitcoin-native startups. Across all early-stage funding rounds, nearly $1.2 billion has been invested in bitcoin companies since 2021.

The renewed interest comes after years of technical upgrades to the bitcoin protocol and growing confidence in its long-term resilience.

""Serious people no longer question whether bitcoin will remain 15 or 20 years into the future,"" said Christopher Calicott, managing director at Trammell. ""So the next question becomes: Is it possible to build what the founder is trying to achieve on bitcoin? Increasingly, the answer is yes.""

PitchBook projects that crypto venture funding will surpass $18 billion in 2025 — nearly doubling the annual average from the previous two-year cycle. Much of that capital is flowing into bitcoin infrastructure and applications — payments, privacy tools, custody solutions — rather than the speculative trading platforms of previous cycles.

Turning ideals — and venture dollars — into reality still requires real-world infrastructure. And that's where entrepreneurs like Steve Barbour, the founder of Canadian firm Upstream Data, come in. He's spent years building off-grid mining containers for remote oilfields, but this spring, he's expanding operations into Wyoming, a bet he attributes directly to the Trump administration's rollback of energy regulations and renewed push for domestic production.

Wyoming — home to both sprawling coal operations and some of the country's most permissive crypto laws — has emerged as a hub for bitcoin miners and the lawmakers who support them.

The administration's latest executive orders loosen environmental restrictions and encourage more fossil fuel development — a boon for oilfield miners like Barbour, even as critics warn it could come at a steep climate cost.

""I'm extremely optimistic and bullish on Trump's administration,"" Barbour said. ""The EPA finally came out with a new stance on all these things they've been doing to just destroy the energy sector in America, which has affected us very negatively. I'm seeing a lot of things going the right way now with the decisions the Trump administration is making, and clearly they're trying to attract investment in America and manufacturing.""

Zaprite's Lewis, one of the Commons' most vocal policy thinkers, agrees that things are moving in the right direction — particularly around the government's decision to establish a formal national bitcoin reserve.

While a crypto executive order is an important first step, ""codifying it with law will help drive further regulatory clarity that the U.S. is open for bitcoin,"" Lewis said. ""It will also be good for the country ... the biggest priority would be for the regulatory clarity piece, pushing Sen. Lummis' Bitcoin Act to codify and make permanent.""

Senator Lummis, a longtime advocate for the industry, is pushing legislation to codify bitcoin protections into federal law. Her proposed legislation outlines a plan for the U.S. to buy bitcoin with ""existing funds"" of the Treasury Department, which includes tax revenue. The idea, in part, is to position bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset — one that could appreciate over time and reduce reliance on debt. The senator has said that the ultimate goal is to reduce the federal deficit, as well as position bitcoin alongside gold and other hard assets as a way to strengthen the dollar over time.

Without the Bitcoin Act becoming law, Lewis warns that today's tailwinds could reverse with a single administration change.

But while Washington debates bitcoin's role in the future of the U.S. economy, Suman was already betting his own on it.

""Why did I leave this really cushy job at Apple, where I was getting paid a lot and had stock and that kind of stuff, to come here, where my future is uncertain?"" he said. ""It's the possibility of building something new that I think is really needed in the world. And I hope that it pans out. ... If it doesn't, and we go down in a glory of fire, at least I will have tried something that I really believe in.""

Even after he accepted the offer to join Mutiny — later pivoting into Open Secret — things didn't calm down. ""That was right when a prominent group of developers were arrested,"" he recalled. ""They were developing an app called Samurai, and they got arrested. I had accepted my offer with Mutiny, but I had not yet left Apple.""

The gamble wasn't just career-based. It was emotional. Existential.

""Knowing that people were being arrested and there was a lot of uncertainty, I still dove in,"" he said. ""The guys said, 'Listen, if you're worried, we can just call this off and you can stay at Apple,'"" Suman recalled. ""But I said, 'No, I really believe in what we're building. Let's make this thing scale.'""

 Tech executives and investors feared the effect of sweeping tariffs impacting tech products at multiple stages of the supply chain. 

United States President Donald Trump has exempted an array of tech products including, smartphones, chips, computers, and select electronics from tariffs, giving the tech industry a much-needed respite from trade pressures.

According to the US Customs and Border Protection, storage cards, modems, diodes, semiconductors, and other electronics were also excluded from the ongoing trade tariffs.

""Large-cap technology companies will ultimately come out ahead when this is all said and done,"" The Kobeissi letter wrote in an April 12 X post.

The tariff relief will take the pressure off of tech stocks, which were one of the biggest casualties of the trade war. Crypto markets are correlated with tech stocks and could also rally as risk appetite increases on positive trade war headlines.

Following news of the tariff exemptions, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) broke past $85,000 on April 12, a signal that crypto markets are already responding to the latest macroeconomic development.

President Trump walked back the sweeping tariff policies on April 9 by initiating a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering tariff rates to 10% for countries that did not respond with counter-tariffs on US goods.

Bitcoin surged by 9% and the S&P 500 surged by over 10% on the same day that Trump issued the tariff pause.

Macroeconomic trader Raoul Pal said the tariff policies were a negotiation tool to establish a US-China trade deal and characterized the US administration's trade rhetoric as ""posturing.""

Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser argued that exempting select tech products from import tariffs would not reduce bond yields or further the Trump administration's goal of lowering interest rates.

The yield on the 10-year US Treasury Bond shot up to a local high of approximately 4.5% on April 11 as bond investors reacted to the macroeconomic uncertainty of a protracted trade war.

""The concession just given to China for tech exports won't reverse the trend of rates going higher. Confidence in US bonds and the US Dollar has been eroding for years and won't stop now,"" Keiser wrote on April 12.

A fast-tracked temporary crypto regulatory framework could bolster innovation within the US crypto industry while permanent regulations are still in the works, says acting US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mark Uyeda.

“A time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term,” Uyeda said at the SEC's April 11 Crypto Task Force roundtable titled “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading.”

Relief measures may address immediate challenges

Uyeda said this might be the short-term answer as the SEC works toward a “long-term solution” at the roundtable with SEC members and crypto industry executives, including Uniswap Labs' Katherine Minarik, Cumberland DRW's Chelsea Pizzola and Coinbase's Gregory Tusar.

He flagged state-by-state regulation of crypto trading as a concern, warning it could lead to a “patchwork of state licensing regimes.” 

Uyeda said that a favorable federal regulatory framework would ease the burden for market participants wishing to offer tokenized securities and non-security crypto assets, allowing them to operate under a single SEC license instead of navigating “fifty different state licenses.”

He urged crypto market participants to share feedback on areas where “exemptive relief” could be appropriate.

Uyeda also reiterated the benefits of blockchain technology in financial markets during the roundtable discussion. 

“Blockchain technology offers the potential to execute and clear securities transactions in ways that may be more efficient and reliable than current processes,” Uyeda said.

Uyeda to fill chair position until Atkins is sworn in

“Blockchains can be used to manage and mobilize collateral in tokenized form to increase capital efficiency and liquidity,” he added.

Uyeda will continue serving as acting SEC chair until US President Donald Trump's nominee, Paul Atkins, is officially sworn in.

On April 10, the US Senate confirmed Atkins as chair of the SEC in a 52-44 vote largely along party lines. 

Uyeda has served as acting SEC chair since Jan. 20, succeeding former chair and crypto skeptic Gary Gensler. He's been widely seen within the industry as a pro-crypto advocate.

On March 18, Cointelegraph reported that Uyea said the SEC could change or scrap a rule proposed under the Biden administration that would tighten crypto custody standards for investment advisers.

“I have asked the SEC staff to work closely with the crypto task force to consider appropriate alternatives, including its withdrawal,” Uyeda said.

Invest-NL has acquired a golden share in the company. This step ensures that Dutch digital autonomy is maintained.

Published on April 12, 2025

I am Laio, the AI-powered news editor at IO+. Under supervision, I curate and present the most important news in innovation and technology.

Fox Crypto, a major player in cryptographic technology for the Dutch government, has been sold to the Swedish CR Group. Invest-NL has taken a priority share in a strategic move to safeguard national interests. This step ensures that Dutch digital autonomy is maintained, crucial in a world where cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important. It is intriguing that, despite foreign ownership, the Netherlands retains control over essential technology. This is substantiated by the VIFO law, which requires a security test for companies in strategic sectors. While the Minister of Defense emphasizes that this transaction was necessary for national security, it also illustrates the central role of the Netherlands in technological innovation. How this balance between autonomy and foreign influence develops will remain a topic of great importance for the future.

After the acquisition of Fox Crypto by the Swedish CR Group, the Dutch government immediately took action to protect its strategic interests. At the request of the Ministry of Defense, Invest-NL has acquired a priority share in the company. This share acts as a protective mechanism to ensure that Dutch technology and innovation in the field of cryptography remain safeguarded. In a letter to the Lower House, Minister Ruben Brekelmans emphasizes the importance of this by stating that national security and sovereignty must be paramount in times of increasing geopolitical tension. This step was taken per Article 4.1.e of the Invest-NL Authorization Act, which indicates that a shareholding is justified in economically essential cases.

Brekelmans: “In the current geopolitical context, it is important that we maintain and, where possible, strengthen our strategic capacities. Strong Dutch capacities are essential for digital strategic autonomy in high-assurance technology. I therefore see these as important steps in safeguarding national security interests.”

“By taking a priority share in the company, together with several other measures and agreements, we ensure that the Netherlands remains at the forefront of cryptography,” says Rinke Zonneveld on behalf of InvestNL.

The EU faces a significant increase in cyberattacks, raising concerns.

The sale of Fox Crypto took place within the framework of the National Crypto Strategy (NCS), which was drawn up to strengthen the digital autonomy of the Netherlands. The Security Assessment of Investments, Mergers and Acquisitions Act (Wet VIFO) plays a crucial role in this. This act, which will come into force in 2023, requires strategic acquisitions to be assessed for national security risks. Specifically, the VIFO Act focuses on technologies such as high assurance products, which are critical for digital resilience. This ensures that the sale of Fox Crypto to the Swedish CR Group has been extensively reviewed to ensure that the technology developed to protect state secrets does not fall into the wrong hands.

To further strengthen the scope of the VIFO Act, the Dutch government is considering expanding the scope of the law. New technologies such as biotechnology, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology will also be included in the list of sectors covered by the VIFO safety test. This is inspired by the desire to protect Dutch society and the economy from undesirable foreign influences and practices, such as cyber operations and industrial espionage, which have been on the rise in recent years. Minister Beljaarts of Economic Affairs emphasizes that these reforms are crucial for maintaining a resilient and technologically advanced Dutch economy.

Solar power is becoming increasingly important to our energy supply. At the same time, all those installations are susceptible to cyber-attack. Research shows that the potential impact is significant.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose over 1.5% to $84,900 Saturday, looking to break a three-month downtrend after the Trump administration issued new guidance on reciprocal tariffs, listing several exemptions like smartphones, computers, chips and other electronics. 

These exclusions, published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, list products from President Donald Trump's 125% China tariff and his baseline 10% global levy. 

""The US imports over $60 BILLION of smartphones per year. These exemptions cover some of the most crucial imports in another sign of the U.S. conceding in the trade war. After all, the bond market is forcing Trump to concede,"" The Kobeissi Letter said on X. 

The U.S. and China ratcheted up trade tensions this week, imposing import tariffs in excess of 100% over each other. Still, some sections of the financial market have priced in disinflation in the U.S., going against popular inflation fears and suggesting that the Fed might soon have a leeway to cut interest rates. 

The chart shows that BTC is looking to establish a foothold above the descending trendline, characterizing the steep sell-off from record highs above $109K. The so-called trendline breakout could entice more chart-driven buyers to the market.

Meanwhile, major alternative cryptocurrencies like ETH, XRP, and ADA surged by 6% on the day, indicating a trend of increased risk-taking in the broader crypto market. The cumulative market cap of the top two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, held steady above $200 billion, just shy of record highs.

This positive momentum in the crypto market, which opened for trading over the weekend, suggests the potential for price gains on Wall Street come Monday.

Late Friday, attorneys with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Binance filed a joint status report asking a federal judge to continue a 60-day pause in the case for another 60 days.



You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.

We heard about two more Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cases this week. The first, Binance and the SEC, was last paused in February, though late Friday attorneys asked for another extension to continue discussing matters. Separately, Nova Labs settled allegations with the regulator.

As we continue to watch the SEC develop its new views on digital asset issues, how it treats its active litigation remains a key signal.

On Friday, attorneys with the SEC and Binance (as well as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, Binance.US and other parties) filed a joint motion asking the federal judge overseeing the case to extend a pause originally set to expire Monday by another 60 days.



Originally, the SEC said it was requesting the pause to see how the agency's new crypto task force might address digital assets and the application of securities laws. Friday's filing echoed this argument, saying the task force's work ""may impact"" its claims in the ongoing litigation. The original pause was set to end on April 14.



The SEC also filed a motion for a consent judgement after apparently coming to a settlement agreement with Nova Labs, the company behind Helium. According to the proposal, Nova Labs would pay $200,000 but would not admit to or deny the allegations.



The SEC first sued Nova Labs in January 2025 — specifically, Jan. 17, 2025, three days before Donald Trump was sworn into office as the 47th U.S. President.

April—a month marked by extreme market volatility—saw intensifying U.S.-China tensions and a broad selloff in global markets that led to panic selling of almost all asset classes.

Amid the chaos, one of the most improbable winners emerged from the strange depth of the crypto market: Fartcoin (FART).

The Solana-based memecoin, has rallied nearly 90% in the past week and roughly 300% over the past month, leaving traditional assets — and much of the crypto market— far behind.

By comparison, bitcoin (BTC)—the largest and most established cryptocurrency—has been roughly flat over the past week and month, while riskier altcoins like ether (ETH), Solana (SOL) and XRP are in the red. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has slid around 2% over the past week and is down nearly 5% over the month as rising bond yields and geopolitical tensions weigh on risk assets.

It has even outperformed gold, which recently hit an all-time high driven by safe-haven demand, gaining 6.5% in a week and up 12% in a month.

“Fartcoin's absurd outperformance is the perfect metaphor for this market,"" said Kirill Kretov, trading automation expert at CoinPanel, in a message on Telegram. ""A joke wrapped in volatility, where escalating U.S.-China tariffs make 'rational' trading a fantasy.""

By design, memcoins are cryptocurrencies that occupy an extreme corner of the crypto market. Unlike more established digital currencies, they have no utility or scarcity. These tokens, like Fartcoin, are unapologetically speculative, driven largely by social media hype, online communities and the momentum of short-term traders.

Launched in October, Fartcoin quickly gained prominence as one of the tokens propagated by Truth Terminal, an autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agent created by Andy Ayrey, and became a viral hit amid the crypto-AI speculative wave driven by launchpad Pump.fun. Popularized with joke community slogans like ""hot air rises"" and ""billions must fart,"" the token's market cap swelled from zero to just shy of $2.5 billion by mid-January.

Then, it all came crashing down with the crypto market as Donald Trump's inauguration, and the TRUMP token launch marked the peak of speculative froth. FART, similarly to other small and risky cryptocurrencies, tumbled over 90% to a $200 million market value by March. But, since then, it bottomed out and has staged a staggering comeback, becoming one of the best tokens in the digital assets sector.

What makes fartcoin's rally dumbfounding is that it completely decouples from other speculative memecoins. Since Fartcoin has already quadrupled in price, other prominent meme tokens like dogecoin (DOGE), pepecoin (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF) and TRUMP languished near their lows.

""I have never seen such relative strength during macro uncertainty and no signs of animal spirits for altcoins,"" said pseudonymous crypto trader Smiley Capital, who has gained a substantial following for his blunt commentary. ""It takes a special kind of retardation paired with conviction to simply size up into an asset named Fartcoin whilst the global economy is imploding.""

The token's outperformance could also be an early signal of risk-on sentiment returning to markets—at least amid crypto traders—after past week's extreme fear, Smiley Capital speculated.

""It's also a barometer and frontrunner for broader risk assets,"" he pointed out. ""That's a statement most of you are not ready to hear yet, or even grasp.""

Whether the unpredictable and absurd nature of the new financial order is highlighted by Fartcoin's rise or simply another chapter in the memecoin market remains to be seen. 

But Fartcoin's stunning rally, outperforming most of the asset classes, serves as a reminder that virality often trumps fundamentals in the current market, regardless of how absurd it may sound.

The idea of ""safe haven"" assets—traditionally marked by gold and government bonds—amid market turmoil, is being tested like never before.

For decades, portfolio construction and risk management were simple: 60% equities, 40% bonds and when markets panicked, capital typically flowed into gold and government bonds. These assets were slow, steady, and predictable, making them an ideal safe haven for investors looking for protection against volatility. But in today's world of 24/7 markets, geopolitical instability, and rising distrust in sovereign systems, have turned that logic on its head, asking the question: does the definition of a safe haven need a refresh?

Enter the new kid in the block: bitcoin.

It is highly volatile, widely misunderstood, and often dismissed as a speculative asset by many corners of Wall Street and Main Street. Yet, it has staged an extraordinary run since the COVID-19 market lows.

It's up over 1,000% since the COVID-19 market crash in March 2020. During that same period, long-duration bonds—measured via iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT)—are down 50% from their 2020 highs. Even gold, the true and tried safe haven asset—up 90% over five years—looks less impressive when adjusted for monetary debasement, which saw, in 2020 alone, over 40% of the total USD money supply being printed.

Still, bitcoin's safe haven credential remains contested by investors.

In several recent risk-off events, it acted less like a hedge and more like a high-beta risk asset against the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF. 





The first three examples show bitcoin as a kind of leveraged tech trade. But the most recent tariff shock broke the pattern — bitcoin dropped less than the Nasdaq, showing relative strength in an otherwise weak macro environment spurred by President Trump's tariffs.

While these data points may not make a trend, this evolving behavior highlights a broader phenomenon: the global financial backdrop has changed.

“Non-sovereign stores of value, like bitcoin, should do well,"" said NYDIG Research in a note. ""Politically neutral assets should be exempt from the global machinations at play right now.”

Bitcoin is volatile, yes, but it is also globally liquid, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and immune to tariffs or central bank policy. In an era of geopolitical tension and financial repression, those attributes start to make the asset look more enduring than other safe havens.

Meanwhile, traditional safe havens aren't looking so safe. Gold's gains look less impressive when weighed against the scale of monetary expansion. Long-duration bonds aren't faring much better either as the 30-year treasury yield approaches 5%, making them painful for duration-heavy portfolios.

Since the sell-off began last Thursday, the Nasdaq has dropped nearly 10%, bitcoin is down 6%, TLT has fallen over 4%, and gold has slipped more than 3%. Meanwhile, the DXY index — which tracks the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies — remains relatively flat, while the all-important U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has surged nearly 8%.

On a risk-adjusted basis, bitcoin is holding its ground—performing no worse than traditional safe-haven assets like gold or TLT.

Looking at these four major crisis events, a pattern emerges: : each sell-off in bitcoin has marked a significant long-term bottom. During the COVID crash, BTC dropped to ~$4,000 — a level never seen again. In the March 2023 banking crisis, it briefly fell below $20,000 before resuming its climb. The August 2024 yen carry trade unwind brought it down to $49,000 — again, a level that hasn't returned. If history is any guide, wherever this current low takes us, it may well establish the next long-term floor.

So, is Bitcoin a safe haven?

If the old framing — low volatility and downside protection during a panic — still holds, then BTC falls short.

But in a financial world dominated by sovereign risk, inflation, and constant policy uncertainty, bitcoin starts to look more like an asset that investors might need to consider for durability, neutrality and liquidity.

In this evolving landscape, maybe bitcoin isn't failing the safe haven test. Maybe the old playbook of what safe haven is, needs to change.

 Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda encouraged crypto market participants to share “where exemptive relief may be appropriate.” 

A fast-tracked temporary crypto regulatory framework could bolster innovation within the US crypto industry while permanent regulations are still in the works, says acting US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mark Uyeda.

“A time-limited, conditional exemptive relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term,” Uyeda said at the SEC's April 11 Crypto Task Force roundtable titled “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading.”

Uyeda said this might be the short-term answer as the SEC works toward a “long-term solution” at the roundtable with SEC members and crypto industry executives, including Uniswap Labs' Katherine Minarik, Cumberland DRW's Chelsea Pizzola and Coinbase's Gregory Tusar.

He flagged state-by-state regulation of crypto trading as a concern, warning it could lead to a “patchwork of state licensing regimes.” 

Uyeda said that a favorable federal regulatory framework would ease the burden for market participants wishing to offer tokenized securities and non-security crypto assets, allowing them to operate under a single SEC license instead of navigating “fifty different state licenses.”

He urged crypto market participants to share feedback on areas where “exemptive relief” could be appropriate.

Uyeda also reiterated the benefits of blockchain technology in financial markets during the roundtable discussion.  

“Blockchain technology offers the potential to execute and clear securities transactions in ways that may be more efficient and reliable than current processes,” Uyeda said.

“Blockchains can be used to manage and mobilize collateral in tokenized form to increase capital efficiency and liquidity,” he added.

Uyeda will continue serving as acting SEC chair until US President Donald Trump's nominee, Paul Atkins, is officially sworn in.

On April 10, the US Senate confirmed Atkins as chair of the SEC in a 52-44 vote largely along party lines.

Uyeda has served as acting SEC chair since Jan. 20, succeeding former chair and crypto skeptic Gary Gensler. He's been widely seen within the industry as a pro-crypto advocate.

On March 18, Cointelegraph reported that Uyea said the SEC could change or scrap a rule proposed under the Biden administration that would tighten crypto custody standards for investment advisers.

“I have asked the SEC staff to work closely with the crypto task force to consider appropriate alternatives, including its withdrawal,” Uyeda said.

 Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao denied reports that he agreed to testify against Justin Sun, calling the WSJ story baseless and politically motivated. 

Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, former CEO of Binance, has denied claims that he agreed to provide evidence against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of a plea deal with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).

In an April 11 report, The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed sources alleging that CZ had agreed to testify against Sun under the terms of his settlement with US prosecutors.

“As part of Zhao's plea deal, he agreed to give evidence on Sun to prosecutors,” an “arrangement” that “hasn't previously been reported,” the WSJ report stated, citing sources familiar with the matter.

“WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn't,” Zhao wrote in an April 12 X post. “People who become gov witnesses don't go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me.”

CZ was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations. He walked free from federal prison on Sept. 27 as the wealthiest person to ever serve a US prison sentence, with a $60 billion net worth at the time.

In a separate April 11 post, CZ claimed multiple individuals had warned him about the Journal's intentions to publish what he described as a “hit piece.”

Sun said he was “not aware of the circulation rumors,” calling CZ his “mentor and close friend,” Cointelegraph reported on April 11.

CZ further speculated that the report could be linked to lobbying efforts against him and his former company. 

“I also heard some rumors about some players ‘lobbying' against us again in the US,” CZ said.

Cointelegraph has approached CZ for more details on the lobbying claims.

In November 2023, Zhao said that “FTX sought regulatory ‘crack down' on Binance to increase market share,” citing a Federal Newswire report.

Zhao's comments come over a month after crypto donations raised influence concerns among industry participants.

Crypto firms spent over $134 million on the 2024 US elections in “unchecked political spending,” which presents some critical challenges, Cointelegraph reported on March 10.

 Justin Sun cast doubt on the rumors, stating that he has “full trust” in the US Department of Justice and Changpeng “CZ” Zhao.

“I'm not aware of the circulating rumors. CZ is both my mentor and a close friend,” Sun said in an April 11 X post. 

“He has played a crucial role in supporting me during my entrepreneurial journey,” Sun added.

Sun's X post came just hours after speculation grew over an April 11 Wall Street Journal report, which alleged that Zhao agreed to provide evidence on Sun as part of his plea deal, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations.

The report added, “that arrangement hasn't previously been reported.”

Zhao hasn't publicly addressed the reports at the time of publication, but the day before, he warned his 10 million X followers that he had been told a “baseless hit piece” about him was being written.

Sun commended Zhao's integrity and said that the DOJ is one of T3 Financial Crime Unit's (T3 FCU) — which Tron co-founded along with Tether and TRM Labs — “closest and most trusted partners.” 

“To this day, his conduct and principles remain the highest standard I strive to follow as a founder,” Sun said of Zhao. Sun added:

Zhao walked free from a US federal prison on Sept. 27. With a reported net worth of approximately $60 billion at the time, Zhao is the wealthiest person ever to serve a prison sentence in the US.

Meanwhile, on Feb. 26, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Sun asked a federal court to pause the regulator's case against the crypto entrepreneur to allow for settlement talks.

In March 2023, the SEC sued Sun and three of his companies, the entity behind Tron, the Tron Foundation and the file-sharing platform backers the BitTorrent Foundation and its San Francisco-based parent firm, Rainberry Inc.

 The SEC and Binance have recently had “productive discussions” in their nearly two-year legal battle, a court filing says. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange Binance have asked a US federal judge for an additional two-month pause in their nearly two-year legal battle.

“Since the Court stayed this case, the Parties have been in productive discussions, including discussions concerning how the efforts of the crypto task force may impact the SEC's claims,” both parties said in an April 11 joint status report with the US District Court for the District of Columbia.

According to the filing, the SEC requested and Binance agreed to another 60-day extension as the regulator continues to seek permission to “approve any resolution or changes to the scope of this litigation.” 

“The Defendants agreed that continuing the stay is appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy,” the filing said.

The request comes not long after the SEC dropped a string of crypto-related lawsuits against crypto exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini, as well as Robinhood and Consenys.

At the end of the 60-day period, the SEC and Binance plan to submit another joint status report. This marks the second 60-day pause the SEC and Binance have requested this year, following a previous extension granted by the judge on Feb. 11.

The request in February came just days after crypto skeptic Gary Gensler stepped down as SEC chair on Jan. 20, with crypto-friendly SEC commissioner Mark Uyeda taking over as acting chair.

At the time, the SEC and Binance also cited the establishment of the SEC's Crypto Task Force as a reason for the pause.

Formed just a day after Gensler resigned on Jan. 21, the task force said it aims to “help the Commission draw clear regulatory lines, provide realistic paths to registration, craft sensible disclosure frameworks, and deploy enforcement resources judiciously.” 

The SEC's legal battle with Binance has dragged on for almost two years. It began in June 2023 when the agency filed a lawsuit against Binance, its US platform, and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao.

The US regulator pressed 13 charges against Binance, including unregistered offers and sales of the BNB and Binance USD tokens, the Simple Earn and BNB Vault products, and its staking program.

Here's how we might potentially detect technological signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.

The SETI Institute uses a worldwide network of large radio telescopes to seek signals that might hold patterns indicating intelligent communication. But the problem with this particular method to search for extraterrestrial intelligence is that the signal could be blocked. Electromagnetic waves, whether visible light or radio, could encounter planets, stars, or other cosmic objects that block the waves from reaching our instruments on Earth.

The solution could be to add a new way to search the skies for aliens, one scientist proposes. Harvard University's astrophysicist, Avi Loeb, who is joining New York-based physics think tank Applied Physics, along with astrophysicist Shaun D. B. Fell of Heidelberg University in Germany, thinks there's a novel way to find potential alien technosignatures.

Loeb and Fell, both experts on gravitational waves, will work with Applied Physics to develop practical technologies for detecting certain kinds of objects and signals from space. Gravitational waves are generated when distant black holes or neutron stars collide. Like ripples in a pond when a rock hits it, the gravitational disturbance starts large at the point of collision, but spreads outward in smaller and smaller ripples. 

The think tank's research, which includes looking for a warp drive solution that could allow interstellar travel, may be unconventional. However, it aims to transform theory into practical technologies. The team is now ramping up research on gravitational waves and how to better measure them—which could be  a pathway to learning more about the mysterious, undetectable dark matter that makes up 85 percent of our universe. The inclusion of Loeb and Fell will accelerate the pace and scope of research, says Applied Physics co-founder and CEO, Gianni Martire in a press release. 

Arguably one of the world's leading experts on black holes and spacetime structures, Loeb is also a controversial figure in his field because he wants to hunt for alien technosignatures. In 2018, he suggested that a mysterious asteroid-like interstellar object that had entered our solar system, named “Oumuamua,” had unique characteristics that could qualify it as a technological artifact of an alien civilization.  

A novel way to find aliens might be through gravitational wave detection, Loeb says. He is interested in laser interferometry, a technique used to measure gravitational waves. By the time they reach Earth, these distortions in spacetime are so diminished that we need a large, highly sensitive network of detectors working together to find them. 

Caltech and MIT's LIGO and NASA and the European Space Agency's LISA are such detectors, and Loeb's collaboration with Applied Physics involves using these instruments to better understand gravitational phenomena.

Metrics details

The rapid evolution of portable electronics and electric vehicles necessitates batteries with high energy density, robust cycling stability, and fast charging capabilities. High-voltage cathodes, like LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM-811), promise enhanced energy density but are hampered by poor stability and sluggish lithium-ion diffusion in conventional electrolytes. We introduce a metal-organic framework (MOF) liquid-infusion technique to fully integrate MOF liquid into the grain boundaries of NCM-811, creating a thoroughly coated cathode with a thin, rigid MOF Glass layer. The surface electrically non-conductive MOF Glass layer with 2.9 Å pore windows facilitating Li-ion pre-desolvation and enabling highly aggregative electrolyte formation inside the Glass channels, suppressing solvated Li-ion co-insertion and solvent decomposition. While the inner Glass layer composes of Li-ion conducting components and enhancing fast Li-ion diffusion. This functional structure effectively shields the cathode from particle cracking, CEI rupture, oxygen loss, and transition metal migration. As a result, Li | |Glass@NCM-811 cells demonstrate good rate capability and cycling stability even under high-charge rates and elevated voltages. Furthermore, we also achieve a 385 Wh kg-1 pouch-cell (19.579 g, for pouch-cell), showcasing the practical potential of this method. This straightforward and versatile strategy can be applied to other high-voltage cathodes like Li-rich manganese oxides and LiCoO2.

The proliferation of various electronic devices and electric vehicles (EVs) eagerly calls for batteries with high energy density, long cycle life, and excellent fast-charging performance1,2. Cathode materials with high specific capacities and high voltage are essential for constructing batteries with high energy density and long cycle life properties3,4,5. However, those high-voltage and high-capacity cathode materials usually suffered from poor stability and slow lithium-ion diffusion when coupled with electrolyte, which make it difficult to construct batteries with high energy density, long cycle life, and fast-charging properties6,7,8,9. Take LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2 (NCM) as an example: during electrochemical cycles, NCM cathodes undergo various detrimental processes, including significant phase transformations, extensive cracking along grain boundaries of secondary particles, continuous rupture of cathode electrolyte interphases (CEIs), and violent side reactions induced by constant electrolyte decomposition (accelerated by catalytic NCM cathode)10,11,12. Those annoying detrimental problems are closely related to the co-insertion of solvated Li-ion/solvent into the structure of cathodes, consequently lead to the generation of gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide etc.) and transition metals (TM) dissolution and migration13,14,15. It is important to note that the migration of TM to the anode and the production of gases can severely degrade the anode and pose significant safety concerns16,17,18. Even worse, these issues become more severe when electrolytes penetrate the interior of secondary cathode particles, accelerating particle cracks, CEI rupture, gases production, and transition metal dissolution/migration, ultimately leading to premature cell failure and potential safety hazards11,12,19,20.

Significant research efforts have been made to stabilize high-voltage cathodes, including heterogeneous element doping21,22, structural engineering23,24,25,26,27, electrolyte modification8,28,29,30,31, and surface coating32,33. Among these strategies, surface coating is considered the simplest yet most effective method for markedly improving the stability of high-voltage cathodes. By constructing highly stable and catalytically inert coating layer on cathode surfaces, those afore-mentioned detrimental issues induced by the co-insertion of solvated Li-ion/solvent can be effectively addressed34,35,36. However, several inherent defects significantly counteract the positive effects of surface coating strategies for high-voltage cathodes. First, achieving complete coating coverage is still challenging37. Most coatings remain only on the surface of secondary cathode particles, making it difficult to penetrate and coat the interiors and grain boundaries of primary particles38. Second, many coating processes are complex, time/energy-consuming, and conducted in solutions, which may adversely affect the stability of the cathode materials37. Additionally, the introduction of a common type of coating layer may impedes lithium-ion transport to some extent, which is detrimental to the rate performance of the cathode materials. Lastly, although most coatings can partially block direct contact between the electrolyte and cathode particles, they often have large gaps which typically larger than solvated lithium ions38. This limitation makes it difficult to fundamentally inhibit electrolyte penetration, thus failing to effectively prevent electrolyte decomposition and the co-intercalation of solvated lithium ions into the cathode materials32. Optimized coating strategies have been developed to address these issues, yet few can simultaneously resolve all the aforementioned limitations. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a simple but effective coating strategy to address those limitations simultaneously.

In this work, we present a straightforward metal-organic framework (MOF, Zn-P-dmbIm) liquid-infusion strategy for high-voltage cathodes like (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/NCM-811). The process involves heating MOF powder to 175 °C, transforming it into a flowable MOF liquid that thoroughly infuses into the inner primary cathode particles before rapid cooling to room temperature. This process ensures the MOF Glass thoroughly coats both the grain boundaries and the surfaces of the primary NCM-811 particles, achieving complete (100%) MOF Glass coverage (Glass@NCM-811). This strategy significantly outperforms conventional coating techniques by forming a unique double-layer structure: the surface electrically non-conductive MOF Glass layer with 2.9 Å pore windows facilitating Li-ion pre-desolvation and enabling highly aggregative electrolyte formation inside the Glass channels, suppressing solvated Li-ion co-insertion and solvent decomposition. The inner Glass layer consists of Li-ion conductive components, which significantly enhance fast Li-ion diffusion. This Glass coating shields the NCM-811 cathodes from particle cracks, CEI rupture, gas generation, and transition metal dissolution/migration while demonstrating fast Li-ion diffusion (Fig. 1a, b). Consequently, Li||Glass@NCM-811 cells demonstrate good rate capability and cycling stability, even under harsh conditions of high charge rates (5 C) and elevated voltages (4.6 V). The versatility of this MOF Glass coating strategy can also be extended to other high-voltage cathodes, such as Li-rich manganese oxides (LRMO) and LiCoO2 (LCO). The practical application of this strategy is evidenced by a 385 Wh kg−1 pouch-cell assembled with Glass@NCM-811, showcasing its effectiveness and potential for advancing high-energy-density batteries.

The TEM in (m) verified the uniform MOF Glass outer layer and the formation of inner layer. n In-depth etching XPS of the prepared Glass@NCM-811. XPS results confirmed that the inner layer was composed of components that accelerate Li-ion conduction.

In their previous studies, researchers demonstrated that coating electrode surfaces with porous materials featuring sub-nanochannels can facilitate the pre-desolvation of Li-ions39,40,41. This approach effectively suppresses electrolyte decomposition and prevents the co-intercalation of solvated Li-ions into electrode materials. Yet, these benefits were achieved only on electrode level as the porous materials were directly coated on the electrode surface, which means it cannot achieve real particle-level Li-ions pre-desolvation42. However, attempts to thoroughly mix cathodes with porous materials like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) face significant challenges. Due to the powdery nature of MOFs, achieving comprehensive and uniform coverage of the cathode particles is difficult. Furthermore, this method only coats the surface of secondary particles, leaving the inner primary particles uncoated, thus failing to ensure complete coverage38. Additionally, the introduction of a coating layer can often impede lithium-ion transport to some extent, which can negatively impact the rate performance of the cathode materials. Complex and time-consuming liquid phase methods, which involve water or other solvents to coat cathodes with MOFs, introduce further complications. These processes can adversely affect the stability of the cathodes due to the presence of additional solvents.

To achieve effective Li-ion pre-desolvation, the pore windows of porous materials should be smaller than the size of solvated Li-ions, which is approximately 7.0 Å42,43. Ideally, the porous coating material should also be capable of transforming into a flowing liquid state. This allows the liquid MOF to diffuse into the inner voids of the secondary cathode particles and infuse into the grain boundaries between the primary cathode particles, thus ensuring 100% MOF coverage. Taking into account the above two prerequisites, a unique MOF namely Zn-P-dmbIm comes into our consideration (Supplementary Fig. 1)44. Besides its narrow 3.4 Å pore window and the one-dimensional (1D) sub-nanochannels, the Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder can easily transform into liquid state (MOF liquid) upon heating under low temperature of 175 oC (Supplementary Fig. 2). The MOF liquid would transform into glass state (MOF Glass) after a rapid cooling process (Fig. 1c, the top panel). It worth noting that there are several differences between the Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder and the MOF Glass. Even both of them all possess 1D channels, the MOF Glass exhibits much narrower pore windows of about 2.9 Å (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1). On the other hand, unlike crystalline Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder with long-range ordered channels, MOF Glass possesses only short-range ordered channels, giving it an amorphous characteristic (Fig. 1c, the bottom panel, Supplementary Fig. 4). The MOF liquid demonstrates quite similar amorphous characteristic as that of the MOF Glass. These results inspired us to preparing MOF Glass infused high-voltage cathode using MOF liquid-infusion strategy. By melting the mixture of Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder and cathode material, the low-viscosity and flowable MOF liquid can easily diffuse into the inner voids of the secondary cathode particles and constantly infuse into the grain boundaries between the primary cathode particles (Supplementary Fig. 5). Before a rapid cooling process, MOF liquid can completely wet the cathode from inside to outside (100% MOF coverage), and finally obtain cathode coated with rigid and thin MOF Glass (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 6). This unique coating effect cannot be achieved through typical strategies, such as simply mixing MOF particles with cathode materials. For example, when the MOF Glass is physically mixed with the NCM-811 cathode without further low-temperature treatment, it fails to successfully coating the NCM-811 (Supplementary Fig. 7). This highlights the importance of the MOF liquid-infusion strategy with further low-temperature treatment for achieving even coverage. The seamless MOF Glass is expected to facilitate the particle-level Li-ions pre-desolvation (Fig. 1e, f, Supplementary Figs. 8-10). It was found that the thickness of the MOF Glass layer can be controlled by adjusting the amounts of MOF particles added. Obviously, NCM-811 materials with relatively lower MOF additions (0.25, 0.5 and 1 wt%) demonstrate a much thinner and less uniform MOF Glass coating (Supplementary Fig. 11, with parts of the NCM-811 particles left uncovered), while increasing the MOF additions (2, 5 and 10 wt%) leads to a thicker and much uniform MOF Glass layer (Fig. 1g, h, Supplementary Figs. 12-16). We find that a uniformly and thoroughly covered MOF Glass layer would effectively suppress direct contact between the electrolyte and cathode, thus significantly preventing particle cracks (Supplementary Fig. 17) and reducing transition metal dissolution and migration (defined as TM loss) (Supplementary Fig. 18). Notably, batteries utilizing NCM-811 cathodes coated with 5 wt% and 10 wt% MOF glass exhibited nearly the same TM loss as those with a 2 wt% MOF Glass coating. Additionally, NCM-811 cathodes with 2 wt%, 5 wt%, and 10 wt% MOF glass coatings all maintained good stability without significant cracking. These findings highlight the critical importance of a uniform and complete MOF Glass coating. However, increasing the thickness of the MOF Glass coating beyond 2 wt% does not lead to a further reduction in TM loss, likely because the cathodes are already effectively coated. We also find that Glass@NCM-811 cathode material with 2 wt% Glass coating demonstrates almost the same electrochemical performance as Glass@NCM-811 cathode material with 5 wt% and 10 wt% Glass coating (Supplementary Fig. 19). In general, a high mass loading of the MOF Glass coating on the NCM-811 cathode increases fabrication costs and reduces the energy density of batteries utilizing the Glass@NCM-811 cathode material. Therefore, based on these afore-mentioned results, we think that a 2 wt% MOF Glass coating is the optimal thickness, and finally selected 2 wt% MOF Glass coated NCM-811 (shorted as Glass@NCM-811) as the as our main sample. In this article, for consistency, unless specified otherwise, Glass@NCM-811 refers to this configuration thereafter (Fig. 1h, Supplementary Fig. 20 and 21). The MOF Glass coating did not noticeably reduce the electrical conductivity of the cathode material, nor did it contribute additional capacity to the batteries with MOF Glass-coated cathodes. (Supplementary Fig. 22). More importantly, the MOF liquid, heated to 175 °C, can quickly wet the electrodes in just several seconds (Fig. 1i, Supplementary Fig. 23 and 24) benefits from the low viscosity of the MOF liquid44. This rapid wetting highlights the high efficiency of MOF liquid for quick infiltration and complete coating towards cathode primary/secondary particles. The corresponding TEM images and the corresponding Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)/X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results verify the successful complete MOF Glass coating on NCM-811 (Fig. 1j–m, Supplementary Figs. 25-27). For the pristine bare NCM-811, only apparent layered structure can be clearly observed (Fig. 1j, k). For sharp contrast, a thin 15 nm Glass layer can be clearly found on the Glass@NCM-811 material (Fig. 1l). More importantly, we also find that a special inner region II within the MOF Glass layer (Fig. 1m, highlighted by the green rectangle line) can be clearly observed. Based on the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image, the inner region II that directly attached with the NCM-811 demonstrates slightly narrower layered structure than that of the bare NCM-811. This unique structure is further verified by in-depth etching XPS measurements (Fig. 1n, Supplementary Fig. 28). In the P 2p XPS spectrum collected after the first etching, despite a weak peak related to Zn 3 s, only a single peak corresponding to O-P-O (green curve, situated at about 133.3 eV) is observed45. This peak can be attributed to the P-O interactions within the MOF Glass (Fig. 1n). We also compare the XPS results collected after the first-time etching with that of the pristine MOF Glass and the surface of the Glass@NCM-811 cathode material without etching (Supplementary Fig. 29). The clear overlap of these three curves indicates that the outer layer (surface and after one-time etching) of the Glass@NCM-811 still belongs to the electrically non-conductive MOF Glass. As the etching progresses, two new peaks appear at about 130.9 and 134.7 eV, which can be assigned to Li-P and O-P-Li interactions, respectively (Fig. 1n). It has been reported that Li-P and O-P-Li components can accelerate Li-ion diffusion and enhance the rate performance of batteries46. Therefore, based on these results, we conclude that this MOF liquid-infusion strategy successfully constructs a unique double-layered Glass structure on the surface of the NCM-811, with the outer-layer consisting of electrically non-conductive porous MOF Glass with 2.9 Å pore windows and the inner-layer comprising Li-ion conducting components. It is believed that chemical reactions occurred during the MOF liquid phase at 175 oC and the MOF glass formation process (rapid cooling to 25 oC), leading to the formation of a Li-ion conductive layer containing Li-P and Li-P-O components.

To study the functions of this unique MOF Glass coating, further characterizations are conducted. In the XRD pattern, the intensity ratio between (003) and (104) peaks (I(003)/I(104)) of the Glass@NCM-811 is nearly the same as that of the bare NCM-811, which indicates the Glass coating does not severally damage the layered structure of NCM-811 (Fig. 2a)47. Both the bare NCM-811 and Glass@NCM-811 are coupled with metallic Li to evaluate their rate performances. Compared with the cell based on bare NCM-811 which demonstrates poor rate performance, the Li||Glass@NCM-811 battery exhibits much good rate performance from 0.1 C to as high as 5 C current rates. The biggest difference comes from the capacity obtained under 5 C, in where the Li||Glass@NCM-811 battery delivers about 165 mAh g−1 capacity, while the bare NCM-811//Li battery sustains only 80 mAh g−1 (Fig. 2b). This indicates that the MOF Glass constructs on NCM-811 surface can remarkably enhance the Li-ion transporting rate during battery discharge/charge processes. The state of charge (SoC) vs. time curves of bare Li||NCM-811 and Li||Glass@NCM-811 cells are also tested under constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) mode (see Experimental Section for detail). As shown in Fig. 2c, the Li||Glass@NCM-811 cell reaches 100% state of charge (SoC) in just 1080 seconds, much faster than the bare Li||NCM-811 cell, which takes 1400 seconds. Additionally, under CC mode, the Li||Glass@NCM-811 cell achieves a much higher SoC of 75%, compared to only 41% for the bare Li||NCM-811 cell. This is benefits from the remarkably low interfacial resistance of Li||Glass@NCM-811 cell38,46. Then, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements of two cells are measured after 100 cycles (same cells in Fig. 2b after rate performance test). Obviously, the bare Li||NCM-811 cell exhibits significantly higher battery polarization, with an average voltage loss approximately 3.5 times higher than that of the Li||Glass@NCM-811 cell (0.14 V vs. 0.04 V, Fig. 2d). The corresponding Li+ diffusion coefficient of the battery based on Glass@NCM-811 is one order of magnitude higher than that of the cell assembled with pristine NCM-811 cathode (Supplementary Fig. 30), demonstrates that the MOF Glass coating significantly enhances lithium diffusion kinetics. These results collectively verify the crucial role of the MOF Glass coating, particularly the inner-layer of the Glass, in promoting fast Li-ion diffusion in the NCM-811 cathode. The outer-layer of MOF Glass is also under further investigation by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. In order to facilitate our data collection, we increase the thickness of the MOF Glass layer (see Experimental Section for detail). Then, by etching away the surface MOF Glass layer (about 2 nm, see Experimental Section for detail), we detect the electrolyte information inside the MOF Glass. Compared with the FTIR result of typical electrolyte (1 M LiPF6-EC/DMC, the bottom panel in Fig. 2e), electrolyte signals detect from inside the surface MOF Glass demonstrate much stronger Li+-solvent interactions (Li-EC and Li-DMC, the top panel in Fig. 2e). This indicates that the electrolyte forms an aggregative configuration inside the MOF Glass41, highlighting the crucial role of MOF Glass in facilitating Li-ion pre-desolvation and accelerating Li-ion migration before reaching the NCM-811 cathode surface46. Raman data of electrolyte inside MOF Glass layer and LiPF6-EC/DMC electrolytes with different concentrations consists well with the FTIR result (Supplementary Fig. 31), which further verifies the effectiveness of MOF Glass in promoting pre-desolvation of Li-ions. Considering the average pore window of the MOF Glass and the sizes of solvent molecules and PF6−, we propose that the pre-desolvated Li-ions confined inside the MOF Glass channel maintain configuration as schematically illustrated in in Supplementary Fig. 32.

Inset: average voltage loss and its standard deviation over different GITT steps. e FTIR spectra of typical electrolyte (LiPF6-EC/DMC, the bottom panel) and electrolyte formed inside the Glass layer (the top panel). The aggregative electrolyte inside the Glass layer suggested the successfully pre-desolvation enabled by the sub-nanochannels of the Glass layer. f Comparison of activation energies during Li-ion desolvation and its migration across the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) for Li||NCM-811 and Li||Glass@NCM-811 cells. g Comparison of the kinetics of desolvation/pre-desolvation and Li-ion transport through the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) in Li||NCM-811 cell (the top panel) and Li||Glass@NCM-811 cell (the bottom panel). h Schematic illustration of solvated Li-ions penetrating through the typical CEI formed on cycled bare NCM-811 cathode (top panel) and Glass layer on cycled Glass@NCM-811 cathode (bottom panel).

EIS measurement is used to calculate the activation energy during Li-ion (pre) desolvation and its migration/transport across the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) (Supplementary Figs. 33 and 34). To simplify the calculation process, we combine the activation energies from both processes for a unified calculation. Clearly, the activation energy (Ea) of Li||Glass@NCM-811 cell is 45.7 kJ mol−1, which is much lower than 104.3 kJ mol−1 of bare Li||NCM-811 cell (Fig. 2f). The facile Li-ion pre-desolvation and fast Li-ion transport is further verified by data shown in Fig. 2g. Compared with the energy barrier (42.6 kJ mol−1) of Li-ion desolvation within bare NCM-811, the much lower energy barrier (19.3 kJ mol−1) during Li-ions pre-desolvation of the Glass@NCM-811 further verifies the facile Li-ion pre-desolvation inside the 2.9 Å pore windows of MOF Glass outer-layer. Additionally, the significantly lower energy barrier for Li-ion transport in Glass@NCM-811 (26.4 kJ mol−1 compared to 61.7 kJ mol−1 for bare NCM-811) indicates much faster Li-ion diffusion through the dual-layer structure of Glass on NCM-811 surface. We attribute the significantly reduced pre-desolvation and Li-ion transport activation energy of Li||Glass@NCM-811 to the narrow 2.9 Å pore windows of the MOF Glass outer layer, which facilitate facile Li-ion pre-desolvation and create an aggregated electrolyte with a low-solvent-coordination solvation structure46. Additionally, the inner-layer, containing Li-ion transport-accelerating components (Li-P and O-P-Li), promotes fast Li-ion transport. Based on those obtained results, we propose how Li-ions passing through the typical CEI (mainly solvent-derived organics) on bare NCM-811 and Glass layer of Glass@NCM-811 cathode (Fig. 2h).

The cycled bare NCM-811 and Glass@NCM-811 cathodes underwent further characterization to study the additional positive effects of the MOF Glass coating. After cycling, the bare NCM-811 cathodes show extensive side-reaction byproducts covering their surface (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 35). In sharp contrast, the cycled Glass@NCM-811 cathodes exhibit much smoother surfaces without various byproducts accumulation (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 36), indicating significantly suppressed electrolyte decomposition. Elemental mapping results corroborate the SEM images of the two cycled cathodes (Supplementary Figs. 37 and 38). Furthermore, apparent cracks are observed inside the cycled bare NCM-811 cathodes (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Figs. 39 and 40), whereas no obvious cracks were found inside the cycled Glass@NCM-811 cathodes (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Figs. 41 and 42). The TEM elemental mapping of the two cycled cathodes shows substantial differences, with disorganized and uneven distributions of elements, especially P and F, in the cycled bare NCM-811 cathodes, indicating severe byproduct accumulation from electrolyte solvent decompositions (Supplementary Fig. 43). In sharp contrast, the cycled Glass@NCM-811 cathode demonstrates uniform distributions of elements (Fig. 3e–j). The Glass coating remains intact even after various discharge/charge processes, further verifying the MOF Glass's role in protecting the NCM-811 cathode. Notably, the F element mapping is slightly smaller than the cycled Glass@NCM-811 cathode, and its shape corresponds well with the NCM-811 under the MOF Glass coating (Fig. 3j). Since the only source of F is the LiPF6 salt, we attribute this to the decomposition of the PF6 anion under the electrically non-conductive MOF Glass layer, further confirming the pre-desolvation of Li-ions through the MOF Glass sub-nanochannels. Additionally, the cycled Glass@NCM-811 demonstrates much higher I(003)/I(104) value than the cycled NCM-811 cathode, which suggest it does not experience serious structural degradation even after multiple electrochemical cycles (Fig. 3k). The differential capacity (dQ/dV) curves of two cells based on pristine NCM-811 and Glass@NCM-811 cathode are also recorded (Supplementary Fig. 44). For bare NCM-811 based cell, the H2/H3 (second hexagonal to third hexagonal) gradually disappear and the other redox peaks (hexagonal to monoclinic, H1/M; monoclinic to second hexagonal, M/H2) diminish, which was closely related to cracks apparition48. This indicates that mechanical stress generated cracks in the cathode along the grain boundaries, and the layered structure collapse over 100 cycles. Compared with that of the battery based on bare NCM-811, the cell assembled with Glass@NCM-811 cathode exhibits a reversible redox peak for the H2/H3 transition even after 100 cycles. This indicates the MOF Glass helping in protecting the cathode from structural volume changes, which again underscoring the significant role of MOF Glass in stabilizing the NCM-811 cathode. Most cathode materials are highly susceptible to degradation when exposed to water, with even minimal contact severely impacting their electrochemical performance. Remarkably, the Glass@NCM-811 cathode exhibits good water resistance, maintaining its performance even under such conditions (Supplementary Fig. 45). Specifically, the battery assembled with water-immersed Glass@NCM-811 cathode (after 7 days of immersion) exhibits almost the same electrochemical performance as a battery with a fresh Glass@NCM-811 cathode (Supplementary Fig. 46).

TEM studies of the two cycled cathodes reveal further insights. For the cycled bare NCM-811 cathode, thick and uneven cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers, varying from 30 to 60 nm and in some cases reaching up to 80 nm, are distinctly observed (yellow arrows highlighted in Fig. 3l and Supplementary Figs. 47, 48). More importantly, various cation-mixed rock-salt phases are observed after cycling (Fig. 3m, n and Supplementary Fig. 47e, 47f, highlighted with yellow circles), indicating serious cation mixing originating from surface oxygen loss followed by surface cation densification. In stark contrast, the layered structure of the cycled Glass@NCM-811 and the Glass layer is well preserved, with no obvious cation-mixed rock-salt phases detected (Fig. 3o–q and Supplementary Figs. 49, 50). This further confirms the MOF Glass coating's critical role in preventing cation mixing and stabilizing the cathode. In-depth etching FTIR measurement is used to investigate the surface information of cycled two cathodes. For the cycled bare NCM-811 cathode (Fig. 3r, the top panel), tremendous EC electrolyte solvent decomposition induced byproducts (carboxylics (C-O), alkyl carbonates (ROCO2Li) and carbonyls (C = O)) can be clearly found during the whole etching process. Interestingly, during the initial etching of the cycled Glass@NCM-811 cathode, only faint peaks corresponding to the PVDF binder and MOF Glass layer components (P-O, C-N, and N-H) are detected. Notably, there are almost no peaks related to the decomposition products of the EC solvent (Fig. 3r, the bottom panel). Those results together verify the significant role of non-conductive MOF Glass coating in suppressed cathode cracks, CEI growth, cation mixing and side-reactions.

In-situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (In-situ DEMS) measurements are employed to investigate gas generation in cells based on bare NCM-811 and Glass@NCM-811 cathodes. The bare Li||NCM-811 battery produces significant amounts of carbon dioxide and oxygen (CO2/O2) (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 51a, 51b), whereas the Li||Glass@NCM-811 battery generates only negligible amounts of gas during the electrochemical cycling process (Fig. 4c, d). The corresponding 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis results of cycled electrolytes collected from the two batteries suggest that the Li||Glass@NCM-811 cell exhibits greatly suppressed electrolyte decomposition than its counterpart (Supplementary Fig. 51c). These results suggest that the MOF liquid infusion coating strategy effectively lowers surface and grain boundary oxygen activity and suppresses electrolyte solvent oxidation. The complete MOF Glass coverage effectively prevents electrolyte penetration into the interior of the NCM-811 cathode, and the aggregative electrolyte formation inside the MOF Glass sub-nanochannels during Li-ion pre-desolvation together contributing to the suppression of electrolyte oxidation and gas generation. We also observe distinct differences in the morphologies of the cycled Li anodes collected from the two batteries. The cycled Li anode from the bare Li||NCM-811cell exhibits a porous layer consisting of mossy Li and unevenly distributed byproducts (Fig. 4e), whereas the Li anode from the Li||Glass@NCM-811 cell maintains a smooth surface without any dendrites and byproducts (Fig. 4f). This smooth, dendrite-free Li anode is likely due to the greatly suppressed transition metal dissolution/migration. Generally, the deposited TM would degrade the performance of the Li anode. To further support this, we assembled Li//Li symmetric cells using electrolytes with/without 400 ppm Ni(TFSI)2 salt (see Experimental Section for detail). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 52, the Li//Li symmetric cell with 400 ppm Ni(TFSI)2 salt added electrolyte short-circuited much faster than the cell without Ni(TFSI)2 salt addition, indicating that the deposited Ni-induced morphological instability would degrade the performance of the lithium-metal anode. Corresponding ICP results of bare Li||NCM-811 and Li||Glass@NCM-811 batteries are also recorded. As shown in Fig. 4g, the bare Li||NCM-811 battery (right panel) experiences more than 20 times higher TM loss than its Li||Glass@NCM-811 counterpart (left panel) after 200 and 500 cycles, respectively. Obviously, the Li anode collected from the bare Li||NCM-811 cell showed significantly higher TM deposits than the Li anode from the Li||Glass@NCM-811 battery (Fig. 4g, the gap between fully-dyed and semi-dyed rectangles). Additionally, we also evaluate the electrochemical performance and transition metal (TM) loss in a bare Li||NCM-811 battery with MOF Glass directly coated on the NCM-811 electrode, termed Glass-NCM-811 (Supplementary Fig. 53a-c). The Li||Glass-NCM-811 cell demonstrates significantly improved cycling stability and considerably reduced TM loss compared to the bare Li||NCM-811 battery (Supplementary Fig. 53d-f). Notably, the cycled Glass-NCM-811 cathode also exhibits much thinner and more uniform CEI layers across various cycles (Supplementary Fig. 54) compared to the bare NCM-811 cathodes (Fig. 3l–n, Supplementary Fig. 48), underscoring the benefits of electrode-level Glass coating. Nevertheless, despite these advantages, the TM loss of Li||Glass-NCM-811 cell is slightly higher and the electrochemical stability lower than that of the Glass@NCM-811//Li battery, emphasizing the superior performance provided by particle-level Glass coating (Supplementary Fig. 53d-f). The XPS of Li anodes from two batteries also demonstrate the same results. By using XPS measurement, we find the SEI of Li anode from Li||Glass@NCM-811 battery exhibits much weaker Ni element signals than the Li anode pairs with bare Li||NCM-811 battery (Fig. 4h). Based on those results we have obtained in Figs. 2–4, we conclude that the MOF liquid infusion strategy effectively suppresses cathode particle cracks, CEI rupture, gas generation, and TM loss. By implementing this perfect particle-level pre-desolvation method, both the stability of cathode and Li anode can be greatly enhanced (Fig. 4i).

By implementing the perfect particle-level pre-desolvation method, both the stability of cathode and Li anode can be greatly enhanced.

The cycling stability and energy density are evaluated in both coin-cell and pouch-cell configurations by pairing MOF Glass-coated high-voltage cathodes with Li anodes. When cycles at a 1 C rate under a 4.4 V cut-off charge voltage, the bare Li||NCM-811 coin-cell demonstrates rapid capacity decay (Fig. 5a, c) after only 400 cycles. In sharp contrast, the Li||Glass@NCM-811 coin-cell exhibits remarkably enhanced cycling performance, retaining 80% of its capacity (calculated from the fourth cycle) after a long 1000 cycles (Fig. 5b, c). This trend is even more apparent when the cells are cycled under an elevated 4.6 V cut-off charge voltage. The bare Li||NCM-811 coin-cell fails quickly after only 300 cycles, while the Li||Glass@NCM-811 coin-cell delivers a high specific capacity of 180 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles (Fig. 5d–f). It worth noting that the MOF Glass layer within Glass@NCM-811 remains intact without any apparent morphological changes, even after cycling at a high voltage of 4.6 V (Supplementary Fig. 55a). The XPS data of the cycled Glass@NCM-811 closely matches that of the uncycled sample, further indicating the good structural stability of the MOF Glass (Supplementary Fig. 55b, 55c). Two other typical high-voltage cathodes, Li-rich manganese (LRMO) and LiCoO2 (LCO), are also coated with MOF Glass and paired with Li anodes to evaluate their cycling stability. Similarly, the Glass@LRMO and Glass@LCO coin-cells demonstrated superior performance compared to cells without MOF Glass coating. It is widely acknowledged that LRMO cathodes tend to suffer from severe voltage attenuation, rapid capacity decay, and poor cycling stability during electrochemical cycling, especially under high cut-off voltage. This is evidenced by the poor cycling performance of the Li||LRMO coin-cell under a high 4.8 V cut-off voltage, which maintains a capacity of 158.3 mAh g−1 after 260 cycles (only 56% capacity retention, calculated from the 3rd cycle). Remarkably, the Li||Glass@LRMO coin-cell demonstrates good cycling performance (Fig. 5g), retaining a high capacity of 237.8 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles (82% capacity retention, calculated from the 3rd cycle). The same trend was observed for the Li||Glass@LCO coin-cell, which also showed much more stable cycling than the Li|| LCO coin-cell (Fig. 5h). The corresponding first galvanostatic curves of different coin cells demonstrated in Fig. 5a-h can also be found as shown in Supplementary Fig. 56. These results further underscore the universality and importance of using MOF Glass coating to improve the stability of high-voltage cathode materials.

Cycling performances and the corresponding discharge/charge curves of Li||Glass@NCM-811 cell (blue/green curves) and Li||NCM-811 cell (light grey curves) cycled under the range of (a-c) 2.7–4.4 V and (d–f) 2.8–4.6 V (defined 1 C = 220 mA/g for NCM-811 based batteries). g Cycling performance of Li||Glass@LRMO cell and Li||LRMO cell under 4.8 V cut-off voltage (defined 1 C = 280 mA/g for LRMO based batteries). h Cycling performance of Li||Glass@LCO cell and Li||LCO cell under 4.6 V cut-off voltage (defined 1 C = 220 mA/g for LCO based batteries). i 385 Wh kg−1-level Li||Glass@NCM-811 pouch-cell and cycling performance of pouch-cell based on bare Li||NCM-811. Inset: the digital photo of the Li||Glass@NCM-811 pouch-cell.

Inspired by these promising results, a 2.0 Ah-level pouch-cell consisting of Glass@NCM-811 and a Li anode was fabricated (Fig. 5i, inset). The Li||Glass@NCM-811 pouch-cell exhibits improved cycling stability, retaining 86.9% of its capacity (calculated from the 2nd cycle) after 300 cycles (Supplementary Fig. 57), compared to 37.6% capacity retention (calculated from the 2nd cycle) after 58 cycles for the bare Li||NCM-811 pouch-cell (grey curve in Fig. 5i, Supplementary Fig. 58). Based on the pouch-cell parameters (Supplementary Table 2), the output energy density of the Li||Glass@NCM-811 pouch-cell is calculated to be as high as 385.5 Wh kg−1 (calculates from the 2nd cycle, 19.579 g for the whole pouch-cell). These electrochemical performances achieved with this MOF liquid infusion strategy rank among the highest compared to other state-of-the-art coating strategies (Supplementary Tables 3-6). Noting that all these performances are achieved on a laboratory scale, we believe that the pouch-cell energy density and cycling stability can be further improved to over 400 Wh kg−1 by optimizing the pouch-cell parameters, especially electrolyte modification. In addition, the MOF liquid infusion strategy used to create MOF glass-coated cathodes in this work is fundamentally different from other studies employing MOF glasses. And the key novelty of our work lies in its unique structure and specialized functions (Supplementary Fig. 59, Supplementary Table 7)49,50,51,52. The MOF liquid infusion strategy for preparing highly stable high-voltage cathodes offers promising prospects for practical industrial battery production, thanks to its good electrochemical performance and its simple, cost-effective, and time-efficient synthesis process.

In summary, we introduce a straightforward and efficient metal-organic framework (MOF, Zn-P-dmbIm) liquid-infusion strategy that fully infuses MOF liquid into the grain boundaries of high-voltage cathodes like NCM-811, LRMO, and LCO, achieving complete MOF Glass coverage (e.g., Glass@NCM-811). The surface electrically non-conductive MOF Glass layer with 2.9 Å pore windows facilitating Li-ion pre-desolvation and enabling highly aggregative electrolyte formation inside the Glass channels, suppressing solvated Li-ion co-insertion and solvent decomposition. While the inner Glass layer attaches with cathode composes of Li-ion conducting components and enhancing fast Li-ion diffusion. This MOF Glass coating prevents cathode particle cracks, CEI rupture, gas generation, and transition metal migration, while promoting rapid Li-ion transport. Consequently, Li||Glass@NCM-811 cells exhibit superior electrochemical performance, with remarkable rate capability and cycling stability, even at high charge rates (5 C) and elevated voltages (4.6 V). Similarly, Li||Glass@LRMO and Li||Glass@LCO batteries demonstrate good cycling stability over 400 cycles at 4.8 V and 4.6 V, respectively. The practical viability of this strategy is underscored by successfully achieving a 385 Wh kg−1-level pouch cell using Glass@NCM-811.

Typically, Zn(OAc)2 ∙ 2H2O (439 mg, 2 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich), 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (584.8 mg, 4 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich), and phosphoric acid (420 μL, 6 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) were placed in a mortar and manually ground for 15 minutes. The powder was washed with dichloromethane three times and dried at 70 oC for 10 h. Then, the Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder was obtained.

The as-prepared Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder was heated under 175 oC under vacuum for 30 minutes before fast cooling to room temperature (25 oC). During this low temperature heating process, Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder transformed into MOF liquid and went rapid vitrification to form MOF Glass (Zn-P-dmbIm Glass). The as-prepared MOF Glass was then used for further physical/chemical measurements.

MOF Glass film was also prepared for diffusion test to verify its crack-free property. Typically, the as-prepared Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder was mechanically pressed into pellets with diameter of 15 mm under 2 MPa for 60 seconds, and the obtained pellets were heated under 175 oC under vacuum for 30 minutes to melt the Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder into MOF liquid and then MOF Glass. The self-standing film was obtained after rapid cooling to room temperature. The prepared MOF Glass film was then sandwiched between a home-made V-type device, with one side filled by LiTFSI-G3 (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solvated by triethylene glycol dimethyl ether(G3), Sigma-Aldrich, 2 mL) and the other side injected with LiTFSI-Pyr13TFSI (Aladdin Scientific Corp., 2 mL). Certain trace amount of electrolyte (40 µL per time) can be taken out for IR observation after aging to verify the crack-free property of the MOF Glass with sub-nano pore windows of 2.9 Å.

The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM-811) cathode was purchased from Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint-Stock Co., LTD. Li-rich manganese oxides (LRMO) and LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode was purchased from Dodochem Co,. Ltd. To prepare MOF Glass coated cathodes, the as-prepared Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder was mixed with cathode materials (including NCM-811, LRMO, LCO etc.). And the weight ratio between cathodes and Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder were varies from 2 wt% to 5 wt%, and 10 wt% in a mortal and manually ground for 10 minutes. The mixtures were then heated under 175 oC under vacuum for 30 minutes before fast cooling to room temperature (25 oC). Finally, the MOF Glass coated cathode materials were successfully obtained, and defined as Glass@NCM-811, Glass@LRMO, and Glass@LCO, respectively. Based on the results obtained, we found the 2 wt% MOF Glass coating demonstrated nearly the same performances as that of the 5 wt% and 10 wt% MOF Glass coating samples. Considering the advantages of cost and energy density, we finally selected the sample with 2 wt% coating as the main samples. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, the Glass@Cathode (Glass@NCM-811, Glass@LRMO, and Glass@LCO) in this article refers to cathodes with 2 wt% MOF Glass coating.

Generally, 1.0 g Glass@NCM-811, Glass@LRMO, and Glass@LCO powders were mixed with Carbon black (Dodochem Co,. Ltd.) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Aladdin Scientific Corp.) powder in a ratio of 8:1:1 and then directly stirring in 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 hours to get a viscous solution, respectively. For comparisons, uncoated cathodes (bare NCM-811, LRMO and LCO) were also fabricated following the same processes. MOF Glass electrode was prepared by mixing MOF Glass, Carbon black and PVDF in a ratio of 8:1:1. Carbon black electrode was prepared by mixing Carbon black and PVDF in a ratio of 9:1. The obtained slurry was then homogeneously coated onto Al foil current collector by a scraper. After tiny pressing procedure, the active materials-loaded Al foil was vacuum dried at 110 °C overnight. The mass loading of the cathodes used for coin-cells was about 7.0 mg/cm2 (corresponding to NCM-811, LRMO and LCO, electrode size: 12 mm in diameter), the mass loading of the Glass@NCM-811 cathode materials was about 31.8 mg/cm2 for pouch-cell fabrication (to improve the energy density of pouch-cell, the ratio between Glass@NCM-811, carbon black and PVDF was 9:0.5:0.5, corresponding to 28.0 mg/cm2 NCM-811). It is worth noting that for Li||Glass@NCM-811, Li||Glass@LRMO, and Li||Glass@LCO half-cell, thick unlimited lithium metal (400 µm Li) was used as anode, while for the Li||Glass@NCM-811 pouch-cell, thin limited lithium metal (negative to positive areal capacity equals to 3.89:1, N/P ratio ~ 3.9:1) was used as anode.

CR2032 coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, in which both the moisture and oxygen contents were controlled to be less than 1 ppm. Glass@NCM-811, Glass@LRMO, Glass@LCO, MOF Glass electrode and Carbon black electrode were employed as cathodes, Celgard 2500 (purchased from Neware) as separators (18 mm in diameter for coin-cells, 4.5 × 9.5 cm2 for pouch-cells), and lithium foils were employed as anodes. For comparisons, bare NCM-811, LRMO and LCO were also coupled with lithium metals to fabricate coin-cells. Typical carbonate electrolyte (1 mol/L LiFP6-EC/DMC, 60 µL, Dodochem Co,. Ltd.) was used for all those coin-cells. For Li||Glass@NCM-811 pouch-cell assembling, 2.6 g liquid typical electrolyte (corresponding to an low E/C ratio of 1.3 g Ah−1) was added. The low E/C ratio can be ascribed to the greatly suppressed electrolyte decomposition. The Li||Glass@NCM-811 coin-cells and bare Li||NCM-811 coin-cells were operated with a potential limit between: 2.7-4.4 V, 2.7-4.6 V, respectively (defined 1 C = 220 mA/g, for NCM-811 based battery). The Li||Glass@LRMO coin-cell and bare Li||LRMO coin-cell were operated with a potential limit between 2.0-4.8 V (defined 1 C = 280 mA/g, for LRMO based cells). The Li||Glass@LCO coin-cells and bare Li||LCO coin-cells were operated with a potential limit between 3.0-4.6 V (defined 1 C = 220 mA/g, for LCO based cells). The Li||Glass@NCM-811 pouch-cell was measured under a potential limit between: 2.7-4.4 V. It worth noting that the prepared Li||Glass@NCM-811 pouch-cell was measured under external pressure. Enclosure for applying stack pressure, pouch cells are uniaxially constrained in a steel enclosure with an adjustable wall which can be tightened to apply varying uniaxial pressures (the stack pressure was about 10 MPa). Glass@NCM-811 cathode material immersed in water after 7 days was also coupled with Li metal to fabricate Li||Glass@NCM-811 coin-cell following the afore-discussed process to evaluate the water stability of the Glass@NCM-811 cathode material. The bare Li||NCM-811 battery with MOF Glass directly coated on the cathode electrode (defined as Li||Glass-NCM-811) was also assembled and test for comparison. The state of charge (SoC) vs. time plots of cells were collected at a CC charging rate of 6 C, followed by CV charging with a 0.2 C cut-off current. Rates performances of both Li||Glass@NCM-811 coin-cell and bare Li||NCM-811 coin-cell were measured under 2.7-4.4 V for 100 cycles (from 0.1 C to 5 C). After the rate performance test, GITT measurements were then conducted after 100th cycle of rate performance cycling between 3.0 and 4.4 V (versus Li/Li+) with a titration step at 0.5 C of 8 min and a relaxation step of 1 h. Before each electrochemical characterization, the cells were kept on open circuit for 16 hours. All the potentials in this study were referenced to Li/Li+. The galvanostatic electrochemical measurements were carried out under potential control using the battery tester system HJ1001SD8 (Hokuto Denko) at room temperature (25 °C in a climatic chamber). For the EIS tests, the electrochemical experiments were carried out under the control of a potentiostat (Potentiostat/Galvanostat PGSTAT30, Autolab Co. Ltd., Netherlands). Nickel-containing electrolytes were prepared by dissolving 400 ppm Ni(TFSI)2 salt (Sigma-Aldrich) in the base electrolyte (1 M LiPF6-EC/DMC). Li||Li symmetric cells were assembled in the glove box with 60 µL of the prepared electrolyte for each cell. Galvanostatic cycling was performed on a symmetric Li||Li cell at a Li plating/stripping current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 with a cycling capacity of 1.0 mAh cm−2 (1 h for each step). It should be noted that in order to obtain more accurate results, at least 8-10 batteries (fabricated and measured following the same procedure) were tested in one electrochemical experiment, and the data finally reported in this study were selected from the average performance of these batteries.

The morphology of the as-prepared Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder, MOF Glass, bare NCM-811 cathode material, Glass@NCM-811 cathode material, and the corresponding cycled bare NCM-811 cathode material, Glass@NCM-811 cathode material, cycled Li anodes were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6380LV FE-SEM), focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM, TESCAN-AMBER) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, ARM300, JEOL). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Advanced diffractometer fitted with Cu-Kα X-rays (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation at a scan rate of 0.016 °/s to investigate the structure information of the as-prepared Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder, MOF Glass, bare NCM-811 cathode material, Glass@NCM-811 cathode material, and the corresponding cycled bare NCM-811 cathode material, Glass@NCM-811 cathode materials. For the pre-treatment procedures: The cycled cells were transferred into an Ar glove box once the electrochemical treatments were finished, and the electrodes were extracted from the cell and placed in a glass bottle. The electrodes were twice rinsed by dimethoxyethane (DME, Sigma Aldrich, 99%) to wash off the electrolyte salt and the residual solvent, and then evaporated in a vacuum chamber, connected to the glove box, for 12 hours. Note that, in order to restrain the exposure time to the ambient, samples (cycled electrodes) were tightly sealed into a glass bottle (fill with Ar gas), and transferred to the related chambers (SEM) as quickly as possible. Thus, we assumed the morphology and the component of electrode surface would not obviously change for such a short time exposure to the open air. FIB-SEM (TESCAN-AMBER) was also used to characterize the inside morphology of the cycled NCM-811 and cycled Glass@NCM-811 cathodes. HR-TEM (ARM300, JEOL) was conducted at 150 and 300 keV to collect scanning transmission electron microscopy images of Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder, MOF Glass, bare NCM-811 cathodes, Glass@NCM-811 cathodes, and the corresponding cycled bare NCM-811 cathodes, Glass@NCM-811 cathodes for the atomic and structural analysis. The corresponding SEM/TEM EDS mapping of the cycled cathodes were also recorded.

DSC of Zn-P-dmbIm powder was carried out on a thermal analyzer (NETZSCH, STA 409) from 30 to 300 °C at the rate of 5 °C min−1 under dry flow of Ar.

The pore size of Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder and the corresponding MOF Glass was estimated by PALS. The Zn-P-dmbIm MOF powder was pelleted into a cylinder with a radius of 1.5 cm and thickness of ~1 mm, and the MOF Glass film was larger than 1 × 1 cm2 square with a thickness of ~1 mm. The source of positrons was provided by 22Na. The PALS measurements were carried out at 25 oC and the experimental data were analyzed by a four-finite lifetime component using LT 9.0.

Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier-transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Characterization for Typical Electrolyte and Electrolyte Inside MOF Glass

ATR-FTIR measurements were carried out on a FT/IR-6200 spectrometer (JASCO Corp.) coupled with Platinum Diamond ATR, which consists of a diamond disc as an internal reflection element. The typical electrolyte (1 M LiPF6-EC/DMC) and cycled Glass@NCM-811 cathode with thick MOF Glass coating (weight ratio of MOF Glass and NCM-811 was about 1:1) were placed on the ATR crystal. Then the spectrum was recorded to detect the liquid electrolyte peaks of typical electrolyte. The washed cycled Glass@NCM-811 cathode was attached on the plate of O2 plasma etching instrument. By etching away the surface MOF Glass layer (etching for two times, about 5 nm), we detected the electrolyte information inside the MOF Glass by using the ATR-FTIR measurement.

Liquid electrolytes under different concentrations (0.5 M, 1.0 M and saturated LiPF6-EC/DMC electrolyte) were prepared for Raman measurement. The Raman spectra were recorded using a JASCO microscope spectrometer (NRS-1000DT). Electrolyte inside MOF Glass layer was also recorded following the same procedure as discussed in the ATR-FTIR test towards electrolyte inside MOF Glass layer.

For pretreatment, the cycled cells were transferred into an Ar glove box once the discharge finished, and the cathodes were extracted from the cell and twice rinsed by dimethoxyethane (DME, Sigma Aldrich, 99%) to wash off the electrolyte salt and the residual solvent, and then evaporated in a vacuum chamber, connected to the glove box, for ~15 min. The washed cycled cathodes were attached on the plate of O2 plasma etching instrument. And the FTIR spectra were collected after each etching process. As a result, 10 points were recorded. The cycled bare NCM-811 cathode and the cycled Glass@NCM-811 cathode were tested using the etching FTIR following the aforementioned experiment processes.

XPS measurement was performed using a VG scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometers with monochromic Al Kα Ka source (1486.6 eV) under high vacuum. Similarly, to prevent long-time exposure to air environment, the samples (after rinsing and dry) were tightly sealed into an Ar-filled bottle and then soon transferred into XPS chamber as quickly as possible. The XPS was equipped with etching with different depth to analysis the component distribution.

The NMR spectra were recorded using a spectrophotometer (500 MHz Ultra-ShieldTM, Bruker). Typically, 256/128 (1H/19F) times were accumulated for one spectrum. The electrodes and separators were extracted from the cycled cells without further pretreatment. 750 µL of D2O (99.9 atom % D, Sigma Aldrich) was used to extract the residual electrolyte and soluble parasitic products (mainly carboxylates and fluorides) from the electrodes and the separators, then the solution was transferred to septa-sealed NMR tube. To quantify the number of related components, 1 µL of benzene (C6H6, Sigma Aldrich, 99%) and 1 µL of fluorobenzene (C6H5F, Sigma Aldrich, 99%) were mixed and injected through the septa and employed as an internal standard. The method here was very similar as the ones introduced in our previous works.

ICP-OES (optical emission spectroscopy) results were recorded using Thermo Scientific iCAP 5600 and PerkinElmer Optima 4300 DV. Metal dissolutions from cycled batteries were quantitatively confirmed measuring the Mn, Co and Ni-ion concentrations both in the electrolyte solutions and on the lithium-metal anode. The cycled separators (infiltrated by cycled electrolyte solutions) and lithium electrodes were bathed in DME solvent for 4 hours aging. The separator was salvaged out then the DME solution and Li anode were mixed with a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid mixture (3:1 in volume ratio). The solution was heated in a microwave for 2 hours (150 oC).

In-situ DEMS analysis was conducted to monitor gases generated during the initial charge process. NCM-811 and Glass@NCM-811 cathodes (22 mm diameter, prepared as described in the Electrode Preparation section, ~8 mg/cm2 NCM-811 mass loading) were used with 1 mol/L LiPF6-EC/DMC electrolyte (150 µL per cell) and glass fiber separators (Whatman GF/D). The electrodes were assembled into Swagelok-type cells with metallic lithium as the counter and reference electrode. The Swagelok-type cells were connected to a mass spectrometer, continuously purged with argon, which carried evolved gases for MS analysis. In-situ DEMS cell operation was performed using a VSP electrochemical workstation (Biologic), with mass signals recorded as a function of time and cell voltage. Temporal resolution of ion current intensity was optimized by selectively scanning m/z 32 and 44 signals.

This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Jon Dale's love affair with birds began when he was about 10 and traded his BB gun for a pair of binoculars. Within a year, he'd counted 150 species flitting through the trees that circled his family's home in Harlingen, Texas. The town sits in the Rio Grande Valley, at the convergence of the Central and Mississippi flyways, and also hosts many native fliers, making it a birder's paradise. Dale delighted in spotting green jays, merlins, and Altamira orioles. But as he grew older and learned more about the region's biodiversity, he knew he should be seeing so many more species.

Treks to Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, which spans 2,088 acres near the border with Mexico, revealed an understory alive with even more birdsong, from the wo-woo-ooo of white-tipped doves to the CHA-CHA-LAC-A that gives that tropical chicken its common name. The preserve is one of the last remnants of the Tamaulipan thorn forest, a dense mosaic of at least 1,200 plants, including poky shrubs and trees like mesquite, acacia, hackberry, ebony, and brasil. They once covered more than 1 million acres on both sides of the Rio Grande, where ocelots, jaguars, and jaguarundis prowled amid 519 known varieties of birds and 316 kinds of butterflies. But the rich, alluvial soil that allowed such wonders to thrive drew developers, who arrived with the completion of a railroad in 1904. Before long, they began clearing land, building canals, and selling plots in the “Magic Valley” to farmers, including Dale's great-great grandfather. His own father drove one of the bulldozers that cleared some of the last coastal tracts in the 1950s.

Today, less than 10 percent of the forest that once blanketed the region still stands. Learning what had been lost inspired Dale to try bringing some of it back. He was just 15 when, in a bid to attract more avians, he began planting several hundred native seedlings beside his house to create a 2-acre thorn forest—a term he prefers over the more common thornscrub, which sounds to him like something “to get rid of.” He collected seeds from around the neighborhood and sought advice from the state wildlife agency, which began replanting thorn forest tracts in the 1950s to create habitat for game birds, as well as the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which joined the cause after it listed ocelots as endangered in 1982. (The agency has since restored 16,000 acres.) The project kept dirt under his nails for the better part of a decade. “I'd go out and turn the lights on and do it in the middle of the night,” he said. “When I'm into something, that's pretty much it.”

Epiphytes dangle from trees at the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few surviving tracts of original thorn forest. “It was coming to places like this that got my wheels turning,” said Jon Dale, director at American Forests. The refuge contains a wetland that draws birders from around the country.

Two decades later, he's still into it. He is a director at American Forests, which has toiled for 150 years to restore ecosystems nationwide. The nonprofit started working in the Rio Grande Valley in 1997 and took over the federal restoration effort last year. It also leads the Thornforest Conservation Partnership, a coalition of agencies and organizations hoping to restore at least 81,444 acres, the amount needed for the ocelot population to rebound. Although conservation remains the core mission, everyone involved understands, and promotes, the thorn forest's ability to boost community resilience to the ravages of a warming world.

Climate change will only bring more bouts of extreme weather to Texas, and the Valley—one of the state's poorest regions, but quickly urbanizing—is ill-equipped to deal with it. Dale, now 45, believes urban thorn forests, which can mature in just 10 years, provide climate benefits that will blossom for decades: providing shade, preserving water, reducing erosion, and soaking up stormwater. To prove it, American Forests is launching its first “community forest” in the flood-prone neighborhood of San Carlos, an effort it hopes to soon replicate across the Valley.

“People need more tools in the tool kit to actually mitigate climate change impact,” Dale said. “It's us saying, ‘This is going to be a tool.' It's been in front of us this whole time.”

Despite its name, the Rio Grande Valley is a 43,000-square-mile delta that stretches across four counties in southernmost Texas, and it already grapples with climatic challenges. Each summer brings a growing number of triple-digit days. Sea level rise and beach erosion claim a bit more coastline every year. Chronic drought slowly depletes the river, an essential source of irrigation and drinking water for nearly 1.4 million people. Flooding, long a problem, worsens as stormwater infrastructure lags behind frenzied development. Three bouts of catastrophic rain between 2018 and 2020 caused more than $1.3 billion in damage, with one storm dumping 15 inches in six hours and destroying some 1,200 homes. Floods pose a particular threat to low-income communities, called colonias, that dot unincorporated areas and lack adequate drainage and sewage systems.

San Carlos, in northern Hidalgo County, is home to 3,000 residents, 21 percent of whom live in poverty. Eight years ago, a community center and park opened, providing a much-needed gathering place for locals. While driving by the facility, which sits in front of a drainage basin, Dale had a thought: Why not also plant a small thorn forest—a shady place that would provide respite from the sun and promote environmental literacy while managing storm runoff?

Although the community lies beyond the acreage American Forests has eyed for restoration, Dale mentioned the idea to Ellie Torres, a county commissioner who represents the area. She deemed it “a no-brainer.” Since her election in 2018, Torres has worked to expand stormwater infrastructure. “We have to look for other creative ways [to address flooding] besides digging trenches and extending drainage systems,” she said.

A thorn forest's flood-fighting power lies in its roots, which loosen the soil so “it acts more like a sponge,” said Bradley Christoffersen, an ecologist at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Urban trees can reduce runoff by as much as 26 percent because their canopies intercept rainfall and their roots help absorb it, saving cities millions annually in stormwater mitigation and environmental impact costs. This effect varies from place to place, so American Forests hopes to enlist researchers to study the community forest's impact in San Carlos, where Torres joined more than 100 volunteers on a sunny morning in December 2022. By afternoon, they'd nestled 800 ebony, crucillo, and other seedlings into tilled earth. “We need that vegetation,” she said.

That sentiment has grown as cities across the Valley embrace green infrastructure. Although many swales and basins remain verdant with Bermuda grass, which is easier to maintain, there's a growing push to use native vegetation for runoff control. Brownsville, the region's largest city, is planting a “pocket prairie” of thorn forest species like brasil, colima, and Tamaulipan fiddlewood inside one drainage area. McAllen, about an hour to the west, has enlisted the help of a local thorn forest refuge to add six miniature woodlands to school playgrounds, libraries, and other urban locations. The biggest challenge to greater adoption of this approach is “a lack of plant distributors that carry the really cool native thornscrub species,” said Brownsville City Forester Hunter Lohse. “We're trying to get plant suppliers to move away from the high-maintenance tropical plants they've been selling for 50 years.”

American Forests doesn't have that problem. Two dedicated employees roam public lands hauling buckets, stepladders, and telescopic tree pruners to collect seeds, some of which weigh less than a small feather. They typically gather more than 100 pounds of them each year, and stash them in refrigerators or freezers at Marinoff Nursery, a government-owned, 15,000-square-foot facility in Alamo that the nonprofit runs.

That may sound like a lot of seed, but it's only sufficient to raise about 150,000 seedlings. Another 50,000 plants provided by contract growers allow them to reforest some 200 acres. At that rate, without additional funding and an expansion of its operations, it could take four centuries to achieve its goal of restoring nearly 82,000 acres throughout the Rio Grande Valley. “These fields are probably one generation, maximum, from turning into housing,” Dale said.

Funding is a serious challenge, though. In 2024, American Forests began a $10 million contract with the Fish & Wildlife Service to reforest 800 acres (including 200 the agency's job solicitation noted was lost to the construction of a section of border wall). That comes to $12,500 an acre, suggesting it could take more than $1 billion to restore just what the ocelots need.

Ebony saplings reach toward the sun at Marinoff Nursery in Alamo, Texas, and seeds stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags await planting.

Despite this, Dale says any restoration, no matter how small, is “worth the investment.” The nursery is currently growing 4,000 seedlings for four more community plots, each an acre or two in size. Small, yes, but they could mark the start of something much larger. “We have a vision to expand these efforts in the future,” Torres said.

For now, nursery workers just have to keep the plants alive. During a visit on a sunny afternoon in February, 130,000 seedlings, representing 37 species, peeked out from black milk crates, ready for transplant. All of them are naturally drought-resistant and raised with an eye toward the lives they'll lead. “We don't baby them or coddle them,” senior reforestation manager Marisol Kuri said. “We want to make sure they are acclimated enough so when we plant they can withstand the heat and lack of water.”

Despite this, on average, 20 percent of plants die, partly due to drought. It underscores the complexity of American Forest's undertaking: While thorn forest restoration can help mitigate climate change, it only works if the plants can stand up to the weather. The organization expects that in the future, species that require at least 20 inches of annual rainfall could perish (some, like the Montezuma cypress and cedar elm, are already dying). That doesn't necessarily doom an ecosystem, but it does create opportunities for guinea grass and other nonnative fauna to push out endemic plants. Removing them is a hassle, so it is best to avoid letting them take root. “If you don't do this right, it can blow up in your face,” Dale said.

Hoping to evade this fate with its restored thorn forests, American Forests has created a playbook of “climate-informed” planting. The six tips include shielding seedlings inside polycarbonate tubes, which ward against strong winds and hungry critters while mimicking the cooler conditions beneath tree canopies. They look a bit weird—a recent project at Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge features about 20,000 white cylinders lined up like tombstones—but seedling survival rates shot up as much as 90 percent once American Forests adopted the technique a decade ago.

Another strategy seems abundantly obvious: Select species that can endure future droughts. “If we're not [doing that], we're kind of shooting ourselves in the foot,” Dale said. Christoffersen, the University of Texas ecologist, and his students have surveyed restoration sites dating to the 1980s to see which plants thrived. The winners? Trees like Texas ebony and mesquite that have thorns to protect them from munching animals and long roots to tap moisture deep within the earth. Guayacan and snake eye, two species abundant in surviving patches of the original Tamaulipan thorn forest, didn't fare nearly as well when planted on degraded agricultural lands and would require careful management, as would wild lime and saffron plum.

Altering the thorn forest's composition by picking and choosing the heartiest plants would decrease overall diversity, but increase the odds of it reaching maturity and bringing its conservation and climate benefits to the region. A 40-acre planting at Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge on the Gulf Coast reveals how quickly this can happen. Five years ago, a tractor wove through the site cultivating sorghum, which gave way to 40,000 seedlings. Today, the biggest trees stand 10 feet tall, with thorns high enough to snag clothing.

Jon Dale peeks inside a plastic tube that shelters a native seedling at Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is one of the last places where ocelots breed, and restoration efforts aim to connect isolated thorn forests so the cats can travel between them.

Dale named some of the 40 or so species now thriving in the south Texas sun: eupatorium, yucca, purple sage, colima, vasey's adelia, load bush, catclaw acacias. The plants feed and shelter a staggering array of orioles, green jays, and other birds, whose whistles, caws, and tweets filled the air. “I've already heard 15 species since we walked in,” Dale said. He puckered his lips and, with the expertise born of a life spent birding, made a distinctive pish sound to draw them out. The brush was too thick to see them stir, but Dale seemed pleased as he surveyed it. “It's gone from being this very homogenous use of land … to life again.”

An hour to the west, visitors to San Carlos' community forest might struggle to imagine that transformation. The ebony, crucillo, and other species planted two and a half years ago still look scrappy, and a seesaw pattern of droughts and winter freezes helped claim more than 40 percent of the seedlings. Still, the humble thorn forest has garnered a lot of interest from young visitors. “I've been in the [community center] working with children and they ask, ‘What is that over there?'” said Mylen Arias, the director of community resilience at American Forests.

This little patch of the past does more than preserve the region's biological history or defend it from a warming world. It's an attempt to reverse what naturalist Robert Pyle calls an “extinction of experience.” Most people have never even heard of a thorn forest, let alone witnessed its wild beauty at Santa Ana. Dale and those working alongside him to revive what's been lost want others to know the value this ecosystem holds beyond saving ocelots or mitigating climate change. His grandfather was a preacher, and that influence is evident as he speaks of the “almost transcendental” feeling he gets simply being in nature. “I've talked to people, and it's like, ‘Do you know how this is going to enrich your life?'”

He often shows people photos of the backyard thorn forest he started 30 years ago, hoping to convey what's possible with just a bit of effort. Days after planting the first Turk's cap and scarlet sage, hummingbirds fluttered in to sip their nectar. Within a few years, the canopies of Texas ebony and mesquite trees unfurled, providing shade and nesting locations for birds, including the white-tipped doves and chachalacas he'd hoped to see. It wasn't easy to let go of it when his mother sold the house last year. “But you created it all,” she told Dale. “Mom,” he said, “I can do this somewhere else. That's the point.”

This week, as part of the process to develop a budget for fiscal-year 2026, the Trump White House shared the draft version of its budget request for NASA with the space agency.

This initial version of the administration's budget request calls for an approximately 20 percent overall cut to the agency's budget across the board, effectively $5 billion from an overall top line of about $25 billion. However, the majority of the cuts are concentrated within the agency's Science Mission Directorate, which oversees all planetary science, Earth science, astrophysics research, and more.

This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast.

According to the ""passback"" documents given to NASA officials on Thursday, the space agency's science programs would receive nearly a 50 percent cut in funding. After the agency received $7.5 billion for science in fiscal-year 2025, the Trump administration has proposed a science top-line budget of just $3.9 billion for the coming fiscal year.

Among the proposals were a two-thirds cut to astrophysics, (down to $487 million), a greater than two-thirds cut to heliophysics (down to $455 million), a greater than 50 percent cut to Earth science (down to $1.033 billion), and a 30 percent cut to Planetary science (down to $1.929 billion).

Although the budget would continue support for ongoing missions such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, it would kill the much-anticipated Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, an observatory seen as on par with those two world-class instruments that is already fully assembled and on budget for a launch in two years.

""Passback supports continued operation of the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes and assumes no funding is provided for other telescopes,"" the document states.

Other significant cuts include ending funding for Mars Sample Return as well as the DAVINCI mission to Venus. The budget cuts also appear intended to force the closure of Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland where the agency has 10,000 civil servants and contractors.

The cuts are in line with what Ars Technica exclusively reported last month, that the Trump administration was considering a massive 50-percent cut to NASA's science programs. Publicly, some officials downplayed these concerns. As recently as this week, NASA's acting administrator, Janet Petro, characterized this reporting as ""rumors from really not credible sources.""

However, science policy experts have been more alarmed, characterizing such cuts as an ""extinction level"" event for what is seen as the crown jewel of the space agency. Nearly all of NASA's most significant achievements over the past 25 years have been delivered by the science programs, including feats such as the Ingenuity helicopter flying on Mars, New Horizons swooping by Pluto, and Cassini's discovery of water plumes on Enceladus.

This passback document represents just the opening salvo of the process to establish a federal budget for fiscal-year 2026, which begins on October 1 of this year. The budget is produced by the White House Office of Management and Budget, which is overseen by Russell Vought, who has long made his anti-science budgeting priorities clear through his Center for Renewing America.

The Trump administration nominee to lead NASA, private astronaut Jared Isaacman, said during a confirmation hearing this week that he strongly supported NASA's science programs. It is unlikely that Isaacman was involved in drafting this document, as he has not yet been confirmed by the US Senate. Nominees, typically, are excluded from policy prior to confirmation.

After receiving passback documents, NASA usually has 72 hours to review the materials and then submit appeals and justification for changes. Any modifications are then incorporated into a final document that becomes the ""President's Budget Request"" for the next fiscal year. It is not clear when the Trump administration plans to release this budget request, a public document. It could happen within the next four to six weeks.

Following this, the White House will work with Congress to actually set the budget. The US House and Senate each have separate appropriations committees that consider (or not) the White House priorities in establishing a final budget that the president must then sign into law. Fierce opposition to some of these NASA cuts is likely in Congress.

""This massive cut to NASA Science will not stand,"" Representative George Whitesides, a California Democrat, told Ars. ""For weeks we have been raising the alarm about a rumored 50 percent cut to NASA's world-leading science efforts. Now we know it is true. I will work alongside my colleagues on the Science Committee to make clear how this would decimate American leadership in space and inflict great damage to NASA centers across the country.""

One concern, however, is that should the budgeting process be delayed—as is often the case with the federal budget—the White House could force agencies to make operational plans based on the president's budget request once the new fiscal year begins on October 1. Again this will depend on negotiations with Congress, but, using a process called impoundment, some Trump officials believe it may be possible to turn the budget request into an actual budget for all intents and purposes.

An iPad Instagram app might be on the horizon. According to The Information, a Meta employee claims the long-asked-for app is finally in development, fueled by Meta's desire to ramp up user activity on Instagram as a whole.

Right now, Instagram is available on the iPad, but it's the iPhone version and is designed for smaller, narrower displays—so it doesn't take up the full screen. Images and Reels maintain the same aspect ratio, resulting in an awkward experience.

But the terrible user interface hasn't been enough for Instagram chief Adam Mosseri to green-light a version designed for the iPad. Still, Mosseri hasn't been quiet on the topic—despite past pleas, he's taken to posting on X multiple times over the last few years to explain that there's not a big enough group to make an Instagram iPad app a priority. But as TikTok's future remains unclear, Mosseri might have changed his tune.

As the report outlines, Instagram is using the looming ban as an opportunity to drive more users to its app. Before the short-lived ban in January, Instagram released an update centered solely on enhancements to Reels—its short-form video feature—to steer users from TikTok to its app. The company extended the maximum length of videos, changed the profile grid to a rectangular format (specifically a 4:5 aspect ratio), and launched a new video app called Edits (similar to CapCut from TikTok's parent company, ByteDance).

Instagram hasn't confirmed the iPad app's development, and so we don't have a release window. The TikTok ban has been extended for another 75 days, so keep your eyes peeled on the App Store. —Brenda Stolyar

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

Motorola has given us a date for the launch of the next Razr: April 24. This folding flip phone follows on the success of the Razr and Razr+ from 2024, and while the teaser video shows us a silhouette of a phone that looks identical (in multiple colors), the words “AI” flash on the screen at the end. Motorola's Moto AI has been in beta since late 2024—it's an AI companion that can remember things about you, summarize notifications, and transcribe and summarize recordings. Maybe it'll finally come out of beta with the Razr 2025?

The Razr isn't the only phone Motorola announced this week. There's a new Moto G Stylus 2025, which retains the $399 price of its predecessor. It remains the only smartphone that comes with a stylus under $500, and Motorola is putting a little more emphasis on it this time around. You'll be able to turn basic sketches into AI-generated art, write down math problems and have them convert to text with the solution in tow, and you can even use it with Google's Circle to Search.

The Moto G Stylus is also IP68 water resistant now, is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset, and still features a headphone jack, OLED 120-Hz screen, and wireless charging. It launches on April 17 for $399.

Last year, the CMF Phone 1 blew me away with its stellar performance and design—it outperformed several phones that cost more money, all while looking far more stylish. CMF is Nothing's sub-brand that focuses on affordable tech, and we're about to get a successor to the Phone 1 at the end of the month.

A teaser was posted on Nothing's Community forum, with video glimpses of the CMF Phone 2 Pro. The focus seems to be on the phone's build, with Nothing stating, “Ultra-slim. Ultra-light. Ultra-sleek.” Nothing also highlighted a new finish that's textured. We'll be able to glean more details on April 28 at 9 am ET, where Nothing will also take the wraps off three new wireless earbuds: CMF Buds 2, Buds 2a, and Buds 2 Plus.

Got a Google Pixel 9 or Samsung Galaxy S25? If you're on Google's Gemini Advanced subscription, you now have a new perk: camera sharing with Gemini Live. Rolling out this week, this feature supposedly lets you have a free-flowing conversation with Gemini when it's in Gemini Live mode with your phone camera open. Gemini will be able to see everything you show it. That means you can ask it for a product's name by just pointing the camera at it, or ask for inspiration or ideas on how to redecorate your office.

This is powered by Google's Astra technology, which will soon be inside Google's smart glasses. If you don't want to use Gemini Live, you can also attach photos, files, and documents to the standard version of Gemini and ask questions about them. While the new live video function is rolling out to Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 users now, it'll be broadly available to all Gemini Advanced subscribers on Android devices later on.

If you like mountain biking but don't have the free time to get out and get as strong as you used to be, then it's time to get an electric mountain bike. It's been several years since Specialized updated its pedal-assist Levo line, so I'm excited to see the announcement of a full-power electric S-Works Levo 4 this week.

The new bike has a 720-watt S-Works motor with 111 Nm of torque, promising 27 percent more power than its predecessor, and the ability to haul you up much steeper, more technical climbs, with a huge 1,120-Wh onboard battery so that you don't find yourself stranded powerless in the middle of nowhere.

The bike also purports to offer much more refined power assist, so that you don't accidentally bike yourself into a tree on technical terrain, and there's even downtube storage inside the bike for easy access to the battery and an extra tube for your tires. It weighs about 52 pounds (23.6 kg), which, although not light, is comparable to its competitors like the Trek Slash. We're excited to take it out on some singletrack soon. —Adrienne So

If you've ever felt your portable speaker has let you down in either bass or vibes, Sony's new party speakers are promising to deliver both, with a trio of newcomers joining the ULT Power Sound series—tagline: “Maximum Bass. Ultimate Vibe.”

They are all quite different—starting with size. With its detachable shoulder strap and compact size, the ULT Field 3 is probably the kind of portable speaker you think of when you hear “portable speaker,” and promises a powerful sound from the two-way active driver design. It'll last 24 hours and is IP67 rated.

The ULT Field 5 is a bigger speaker that stands upright and has the ability to access two different kinds of bass boost for more low-end wobble. It has the addition of Sony's 360° Party Lights, and 25 hours of battery life, plus it's IP66 rated for outside play. Both the ULT Field 3 and Field 5 are additionally salt-water resistant, making them a safe option for beach parties.

The ULT Tower 9, on the other hand, is the kind of portable speaker I imagine you might own if you really disliked your neighbors. This enormous speaker is officially portable because it comes with wheels and a handle, but that is the beginning and end of its portability. Wheeling it much further than your garden feels unlikely, but it has karaoke and guitar inputs for turning the party up to 11 and more volume than most people will know what to do with. The speakers will cost $200, $320, and $900 respectively, and are available now. —Verity Burns

One thing that's a rarity in the world of portable music-making gear is proper software updates. That changes with Teenage Engineering's K.O. II sampler. The company, a purveyor of gorgeous music-making tools for creative nerds, has dropped a big software update for its sampler that offers owners and new buyers cool new features.

You can now resample things for remixing, chop sounds up, and side-chain your beats for more pump-y mixes, among even larger changes to the playback engine. Folks who want to make more use of playing stuff first and putting it together later will enjoy that you can now arrange tracks of up to 9,801 bars, and will enjoy that there is increased polyphony (the number of samples you can play at once) and better MIDI support for live performances with a laptop and DAW.

That's … a lot of changes for a $299 sampler and portable recorder that looks like a calculator from the 1980s. If TE supports its affordable products this well after launch, it makes us want to keep buying. —Parker Hall

I've always been a sweatpants and leggings girl. Maybe it's a hallmark of having worked from home for eight years and counting, or the burden I bear from being a millennial, but to me, blue jeans are an occassion pant. Even when I'm out in a skirt or dress, the second I get home, I'm putting on sweatpants.

My favorite pair has been the Vuori Performance Joggers, ever since I first tried them back in 2020 for a now-defunct buying guide. These sweatpants have been beloved across the internet since then and probably before it. Influencers, reviewers, and redditors sing their praises. I'm not saying anything new. These pants have 4.8 out of 5 stars based on over 46,000 customer reviews. But if you haven't heard the gospel, please do yourself the courtesy of listening to me proselytize for just one moment.

I know a ton of differently shaped people who love these sweatpants. I'm short and curvy, but friends and colleagues with different body types swear by these sweatpants. Be you tall or short, slim or thick, no matter your gender, your weight, or where you like to wear your loungewear, these'll work for you. They're like magic.

Some people might think sweatpants are basic. How hard can it be to get it right? So perhaps my love for the Vuori Performance Joggers is best illustrated with details about what they don't get wrong. I spoke with Sarah Carlson, vice president of design at Vuori, to lift the curtain a bit.

Let's start with the fabric. The Vuori's DreamKnit fabric is special. Carlson says it's made with advanced knitting techniques to promote a second-skin feel, and she says it is meant to “provide a buttery-soft feel while delivering the durability and functionality needed for active lifestyles.” I'll be the first to admit I'm skeptical of any marketing claims, but these sweatpants genuinely are so soft and stretchy.

DreamKnit is made with 89 percent recycled materials. It has four-way stretch, which keeps it flexible, and it's designed to keep you cool and dry. It's not too thin or too thick. If I wear these sweatpants in the fall, they keep me pretty warm. If I wear them in the summer, I don't get too hot. I can regulate my own body temperature. They're not aggressively lined or bulky or thick. They just work. In the winter, or on particularly windy days, they aren't the warmest, but that breathability is a feature and not a bug.

Carlson says, ""The initial concept for DreamKnit came from our desire to create a fabric that felt as good as it performed.” And it does! She adds that each iteration was wear-tested by athletes, yogis, and everyday users to get feedback on fit, feel, and functionality. Vuori also conducted lab tests to ”ensure the fabric could withstand repeated washing and activity without losing its shape or softness.”

The slash pockets are thoughtfully designed, too, with enough depth that I can stash my phone, wallet, and other essentials inside—and, most importantly, nothing falls out when I sit down or shift around. This is a surprisingly common issue I've found while testing sweatpants. What's the point in a pocket if things don't stay inside it? Again, the Performance Joggers have pockets that work as intended. And they don't stick out or show an obvious outline while I walk around—another added benefit that other sweatpants haven't managed to achieve. Carlson says that “fit is everything, and we spent countless hours perfecting the cut of the Performance Joggers. They're designed to be relaxed but not sloppy, with a tapered leg that flatters the body without restricting movement. The elastic waistband with an adjustable drawstring ensures a customizable, secure fit.”

Even the drawstring is well designed. It doesn't slip too easily out of its sleeve, and it's not too thick or obvious. It's soft on my skin. It's flat and therefore easy to tie, and it stays tied throughout the day. I can adjust the sweatpants to sit high on my natural waist or sling them low around my hips. The drawstring doesn't create an obvious outline or get twisted up over time. It simply works as intended.

And the length of the pants is just right. On my 5'1” frame, I don't find them to be too long or too short. But reviewers who are taller than me have said the same thing. Like I said—these are like magic. The actual inseam length is 25 inches. The sweatpants keep their shape throughout the day, and the cuff loosens imperceptibly if at all. The ankle cuff is tight enough to help the pants maintain their shape but not so tight that it pulls them down or restricts movement.

And finally, the silhouette. Vuori suggests ordering a size up if you want an oversized fit. I wear my usual size, and I find that the pants are tight and loose in all the right places. They hug my hips and butt, they nip in my waist, and they're a little tight toward the ankles. The shape is downright flattering, and I feel just as comfy wearing them with a gigantic fleece-lined hoodie while lounging as I do pairing them with a bodysuit and some cute sneakers while going out or over my shorts to the gym. I've worn these to chill on the couch during the holidays at my parents' house. I've worn these while hanging out around the campfire. I've worn these to my favorite bar. I've worn these on a date. They just work. If you conjure a pair of sweatpants in your head, they‘d probably be the Vuori Performance Joggers—whether or not you realize it yet.

I appreciate the wide variety of colors (14 at press time) and sizes (XXS to XXL in Regular or Long lengths). I appreciate the way these hold up over time, maintaining their softness and shape over nearly five years of wear. But mostly, I appreciate that they absolutely nail everything a pair of comfy pants should be. They're expensive, but to me, they're worth every penny.

Just because a security researcher can discover things about a program that its own developers missed, doesn't mean they've understood the entire picture. If you find one bug, you need to spend time making sure that it doesn't represent an entire class of bugs. Once the advisory is announced, that's blood in the water that will attract other predators. Only idiots and tourism companies chum the water before they expect more people to go into it.Back when PHP was objectively awful, I joined the pitchforks and torches mob based on the litany of CERT advisories against it. I had an argument with a coworker about whether PHP was irresponsible to use, and the very next day someone defaced the phpBB instance he maintained because of an unpatched injection attack. I pointedly did not comment because 1) smug and 2) the timing made me nervous of being accused of having been the perpetrator.But I did look at the patch that either just came out or that he missed, and was frustrated to find that the same pattern they fixed existed in two other functions.I really think that it says more about a community, not in what mistakes they make, but how they learn from those mistakes. And I'd like to say it seems like SAP didn't, but we all know what a beast that thing is. How many tens of millions of lines of code is that thing now? The chances that a person made a mistake and two people they've never met copied it are essentially 0.99 repeating.

When left a fortune 500 company 2 years ago, many SAP processes were running in background on UN*X with these arguments:-u USERID -p PWAs a developer I informed the admins a couple of times over the years, the response was ""wow, will check it out"".  But they ran into a mountain of red tape and gave up.  So nothing was ever done.But as a developer and support person, at least I had a way to fix things without  falling into the bureaucracy quicksand.  FWIW, I only had to do that twice over a 10 year period around Q/E.

I'll be honest, I've never been on the other side dealing with red tape. It'd probably drive me mad. But from the researcher/consultant side, it's definitely gotten easier to report vulnerabilities. Vendors now have security contacts, coordinated disclosure policies, and even bug bounty programs. Not all vendors, of course. But compared to 10 years ago, it's night and day.

If you're looking for a device that can seamlessly replace your computer for streaming Netflix, browsing Google, or using Microsoft 365, the Apple iPad has become the go-to choice for millions of users. The 10th-generation iPad is equipped with advanced features and it is now available at an incredible price point—its lowest ever.

Originally launched at $599 a few years ago, this premium tablet has seen previous discounts drop it to $459 during major shopping holidays like Black Friday. However, Amazon has now dropped the price even further and offers it for just $349 which is an absolute steal (30% down from its previous price, and 42% off its original price).

See at Amazon

This price drop is even more attractive given the ongoing rise in tariffs that have reached electronics across the board. Apple continues to offer incredible value with this discount and the 10th-generation iPad is more budget-friendly than ever. With that said, it's likely a good idea to act sooner rather than later—tariffs will probably impact future pricing and discounts like these won't be available for long.

The 10th-generation iPad is feature-packed to be a great option for private and professional use: It is equipped with the A14 Bionic chip which delivers great performance and smooth multitasking. Whether it is editing files on Office 365 or switching between apps while streaming videos, this chip makes everything smoothly. The 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display provides stunning graphics with vivid colors and clear detail which is perfect for watching movies or playing games.

The 256GB of storage allows you to have as many apps, photos, videos and files as you want without ever having to concern yourself with running out of space. This makes the iPad perfect for those who want a device that can serve as both an entertainment and productivity tool. Its high-speed Wi-Fi 6 connection also means you get quicker internet and more reliable connections—ideal for streaming or downloading bigger files.

With a 12MP rear and front camera setup, you can also capture quality images and videos or enjoy clear video calls with friends and business associates. Touch ID adds another layer of security while keeping access simple and quick. And with all-day battery life, you can rely on this tablet to keep up with your active lifestyle without your needing to search for a charger every now and then.

The current $349 price point is not only lower than Black Friday but also the all-time low for this model since it was first released in 2022. For a product that originally launched at $599, this offers a unique opportunity to acquire one of Apple's most powerful tablets for a fraction of its launch price.

What's the point of having a Netflix or an Amazon Prime Video subscription in 4K if your TV can't support that resolution? If you're looking to enjoy your favorite shows and movies in stunning Ultra HD at a reasonable price point, the LG C3 65-inch OLED TV is an absolute gem.

This high-end smart TV debuted in 2023 and it is currently selling at an all-time low price of $1,196 on Amazon which is a whopping 20% off its list price of $1,499.

See at Amazon

The LG C3 smart TV is crafted to provide a best-in-class viewing experience that competes with higher-priced alternatives. Its 10.9-inch OLED evo panel showcases stunning picture quality with self-emitting pixels that render perfect blacks, limitless contrast and rich colors. From the newest release on Disney+ to streaming a nature show on Netflix, every image leaps to life with incredible sharpness and depth. The TV also supports more elaborate HDR formats like Dolby Vision and HDR10 so you can reap the maximum benefit of your 4K content.

Powered by LG's α9 AI Processor Gen6, this LG TV uses advanced AI technology to upscale picture and sound in real-time. Whether it's sports viewing, gaming, or simply browsing through apps such as YouTube or Hulu, the processor provides very smooth performance and exceptional image processing. Brightness Booster Max technology is also added to the brightness of the screen which makes this screen ideal for both bright and dark rooms.

For gaming enthusiasts, the LG C3 is an absolute dream: It has a 120Hz refresh rate, ultra-low input lag and compatibility with features like VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) and ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode) to give you the ultimate best gaming experience. From quick shooters to open-world RPGs, every movement is smooth. And with its four HDMI 2.1 ports, it is also compatible with next-gen consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X.

The C3's intelligent features are no less impressive. Driven by LG's webOS platform, the C3 provides easy access to all of your go-to streaming services and apps. Thanks to built-in Alexa support, you can even navigate your TV with voice commands, while the Magic Remote in the box ensures navigation is a doddle. Wi-Fi 6 connectivity allows for fast and reliable streaming performance, even in homes where multiple devices are connected.

The reality that this Amazon deal has arrived at a moment when heightened tariffs are very likely going to drive up the cost of electronics in the following weeks (and months) makes the deal all the more exciting. Despite these challenges, Amazon has managed to reduce the price of this incredible LG OLED TV to its lowest ever, and it is a steal for anyone looking to upgrade their home entertainment. That being said, with the situation in the market as is, it's likely that the discount won't last long—so it's best to snag it before prices go back up again.

Having a power bank on hand is now essential if you spend most of your time on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Live streaming and videos can quickly drain your smartphone battery within hours which makes you miss out when you need your device the most.

For those who use their phones a lot, the INIU 10000mAh power bank is a must-have accessory—and now, it's even cheaper than it was on Black Friday. Originally priced at $24, this fast charger is available for $15, which is a 36% discount. Last year, the lowest price was $17.

See at Amazon

What's so amazing about this deal is that it comes at rising tariffs that are purported to impact the cost of electronics in the coming weeks. Despite this challenge, INIU continues to come up with great deals on their items, so it's the ideal time to obtain this power bank prior to the prices might increase.

The INIU charger performs very well and thoughtful design: It has a 10,000mAh capacity and it can charge most smartphones to full capacity several times. Whether you own an iPhone 16 or a Samsung Galaxy S25, this power bank will have your phones charged all day long. Its high-speed charging is 3A output compatible, so you can charge your phone up to 78% in just one hour which is much faster than regular chargers. In addition, its USB-C output and input guarantee compatibility across an enormous range of devices including tablets like the iPad and peripherals like AirPods and smartwatches.

Perhaps the most impressive thing about this power bank is just how thin it is: Despite its lofty-capacity power, it is light and portable enough to be pushed into your pocket or bag without consuming any additional space. That renders it ideal for use on-the-go, if you're just commuting, on a trip or simply using a day away. INIU charger also offers pass-through charging capability, with which you may charge your gadgets and the power bank simultaneously.

Besides its speed and portability, the INIU power bank boasts state-of-the-art safety functions that protect your devices and charger. Its TempGuard technology scans charging temperatures a massive 3 million times daily to prevent overheating or overcharging. This yields optimum performance and maintains your device's battery well-being in the long term—a function that comes in handy to anyone concerned with long-term electronics wear.

With tariffs on electronics (and Chinese imports) steadily rising, discounts like this will become increasingly rare. Experts predict that these price hikes will soon affect popular brands like Anker and INIU more significantly which makes it unlikely that such low prices will persist for long. If you've been looking at upgrading your portable charging solution or simply want a backup for emergencies, now is the time to act.

Minecraft is a viral smash hit, but the auteur-drive Mickey 17 very much was not—and now, the top executives at Warner Bros. Pictures are looking to franchise popularity to allow them to continue to balance out original swings. With strong pre-opening buzz for next week's Sinners, Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy hope Ryan Coogler's moody vampire movie will continue to drive ticket sales for their summer slate in the lead-up to James Gunn's Superman.

In an interview with Deadline, De Luca shared his excitement over the DC Studios release. “I love Superman. I think James Gunn has crushed it. It's got tons of his trademark heart and humor and the action is jaw dropping. It's the Superman I grew up with, so I get choked up when I watch it. I think it's so epic and visually arresting and emotional. The performances are great. It is a five-star movie to me, and I can't wait for the world to see it. Yeah, we're really excited about Superman, James crushed it.”

De Luca agreed its tone carries on the legacy of Richard Donner's Superman films. “I would say in spirit, it is closer to that, but it's also a big hunk of epic sci-fi. It has a little bit of what I loved about Guardians of the Galaxy, but it's true-blue Superman. The comic book sources that he uses for inspiration, All-Star Superman and the like, are in there, too. It is really a love letter to what has made Superman endure for almost a hundred years. He managed to get it all in there.”

The execs were also asked about Matt Reeves' long-awaited Batman sequel, but they couldn't give much of an update, noting that it's in the hands of the director and DC Studios at this point. “We're not in the weeds on the Batman stuff,” Abdy said. “It's really James [Gunn] and Peter Safran who run DC. We have a bit of other collaboration with Matt Reeves, but Peter and James know he is a writer-directing auteur in his own right, and that it will come when he's written his best Batman script and is ready.”

In 2021, when the Democrat-controlled Congress and the Biden administration were attempting to set up a new domestic terrorism program, human rights groups—ones that had typically fretted over the rightwing militia groups that the program was designed to combat—were the first to express dismay.  “We write to express our deep concern regarding proposed expansion of terrorism-related legal authority,” wrote 157 different signatories, in a letter to Congress. “We must meet the challenge of addressing white nationalist and far-right militia violence without causing further harm to communities already disproportionately impacted by the criminal-legal system.” Meanwhile, a swell of CIA and national security officials eagerly urged the government to create new legal authorities to treat Americans like terrorists.

Now, as Trump's second term gets underway, the new rightwing government appears to be using the legal and operational infrastructure set up during the Biden years to go after leftwing protesters. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein is out with a new article on the Trump administration's blossoming counterterrorism strategy, which, according to government insiders, is poised to target Americans who express discontent about the president or his wealthy allies.

“So-called Tesla terrorism and potential anti-Trump violence is driving new articulations of the threat,” a senior intelligence official told Klippenstein.

Indeed, in recent weeks, the Justice Department has pivoted federal law enforcement away from more traditional enemies and towards people who vandalize Tesla dealerships. Several people arrested and accused of having firebombed the cars will likely be charged with “domestic terrorism” charges, Attorney General Pam Bondi has said. Meanwhile, critics of Israel have also become a target for the government's roving eye.

As previously noted, the precedent for much of this was set by the previous administration. Under Biden, the government developed its first National Strategy to counter “domestic terrorism.” The strategy, which was designed with input from America's national security agencies, set up a broad variety of new programs to counter what it perceived as extremism in the homeland, including new task forces and liaisons with state and local law enforcement.

However, as Klippenstein points out, the full scale of the program is not publicly known. He points to a recently published  Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on America's counterterrorism strategy that notes “officials from DHS, DOJ, and State told us that the classified implementation plan includes some additional guidance for classified activities” and that “DHS and DOJ officials told us that they conduct additional activities to respond to the 2021 Strategy that are classified.” In other words: a secret program that spies on Americans and treats them like terrorists is not available for public consumption.

That secret program is now being helmed by the Trump administration, which has very different ideas about who and what poses a danger to this country than its predecessor. The administration is busy revising the strategy to better suit Trump's needs. Klippenstein writes:

…the rewrite of the National Strategy document is shaping up to comport with Trump's view of the country, the GAO hints and others say, rescinding the previous approach and altering the focus of counterterrorism actions over the next four years. That includes focusing more on Trump's political opponents and framing petty crimes taking place at day-to-day protests as terrorism.

Worse still, the head of America's counterterrorism strategy, Sebastian Gorka, is described as an Israel-loving gun nut who is fond of “secret operations” and “special operators.” Gorka is tasked with overseeing all of America's counterterrorism operations—both international and domestic.

Klippenstein quotes from a federal counterterrorism manual published in 2021 that lists various so-called “mobilization indicators.” These indicators, he writes, are considered “characteristics that could move people to carry out acts of extremist violence.” Under the government's domestic counterterrorism mandate, Americans who demonstrate such indicators could find themselves the subject of a suspected terrorism probe—even if they have never committed a crime. Klippenstein writes:

Ever had a heated argument expressing sympathy for Luigi Mangione or HAMAS? Or bought military-style tactical equipment? Or withdrawn from family? If so, you meet the government's criteria listed in its 2021 “Mobilization Indicators” booklet, a document intended to help local and state police to spot a terrorist. These criteria might strike you as creepy because, as the booklet itself concedes, “many of the mobilization indicators included in this booklet may also relate to constitutionally protected activities.”

In short, if you've ever been a super-vocal critic of the current administration or its allies, you could end up being a target of the government's national security state.

Lots of people—myself included—saw this coming. In 2021, when the Biden administration began pushing for a new domestic terrorism program, I thought it was a really, really bad idea. At the time, I wrote:

For all the wailing and gnashing of teeth the Democrats did about Trump's authoritarian style, it seems deeply ironic that they would kick off this new moment of party ascendance by pushing for such overwhelming new powers for the nation's security agencies. Such proposals seem destined to do little except further disfigure the already mutilated corpus of civil liberties that Americans used to take such pride in—but which they now ever more sleepily deride as outdated, impractical, and unsafe.

Now, here we are, some four years later, and a program that offers the government way too much power could easily be weaponized against peaceful political protesters. It's not a happy time, though perhaps Americans might learn something from it.

After a four-season run, it's game over for Mythic Quest.

Per Variety, the Apple TV+ series was canceled two weeks after its season finale in March. To reflect the show's official end, Apple's releasing an updated finale episode next week that'll feature a brand new conclusion. Even so, the news probably comes as a shock to those who watched it, since it's one of Apple TV+'s first shows ever, and could be considered a fixture of the streaming service.

“Endings are hard,” wrote executive producers David Hornsby, Megan Ganz, and Rob McElhenney. We're so proud of the show and the world we got to build—and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple's blessing we made one final update to our last episode—so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.”

 

 

A post shared by Megan Ganz (@meganganz)



Created by Ganz, McElhenney, and Charlie Day, Mythic Quest stars McElhenney as Ian Grimm, the creative director for the show's titular (and fictional) MMORPG. As the series starts, the game's on the cusp of getting a brand new expansion, and tracks Grimm's clash with other team leads to get the expansion out the door. Along with McElhenney, the core cast includes Hornsby, Ashly Burch, and Danny Pudi, among others. Each season was well-regarded, and the show got its own spinoff called Side Quest, which aired alongside the now-series finale and focused on Mythic Quest players, fans, and other developers at its studio.

In a eulogy on Instagram, Ganz called Mythic Quest “four seasons and seven years of working with the greatest group of people you ever met. We helped each other through a pandemic and took our hearts and made them art.” She extended her thanks to Hornsby for all those nights “in a ridiculous costume writing and rewriting with me,” and McElhenney “for sending me that email oh so many years ago. It was never easy, but it was always worth it.”

They do not care.

Multiple publicly traded Chinese companies have notified their investors that the recently imposed tariffs from the trade war do not concern them, reports the South China Morning Post, largely because US sanctions have already prevented them from selling into the US. China's high-tech industry has a number of world-class companies that develop products that are competitive far beyond Chinese borders. However, given the sanctions imposed against these entities in recent years, it is hard to find products from Huawei, Loongson, or Longsys outside of China.

Cambricon Technologies (an AI processor developer), Loongson (CPU designer), Leaguer Microelectronics (an IoT IC designer), Longsys Electronics (a maker of storage systems), and Maxscend Microelectronics (an RF chip developer) all said that they were not going to be impacted by massive tariffs imposed by the U.S. government in their filings for investors, according to SCMP. 

Based on the SCMP report, these companies will indeed not suffer from the punitive tariffs the U.S. has imposed on products from China: 

Hardware makers from China ship tons of hardware, including domestically developed chips and domestically developed systems on those chips. That industry has been aimed mostly internally so far though, so no financial impact on the aforementioned companies at this point. However, what about indirect impacts? That remains to be seen.

Installing the right version of Linux can breathe new life into an aging system.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Installing Linux is a great way to breathe life into that decade old laptop that is sitting doing nothing in the corner of the room. Linux is generally lighter than Windows (sure you can slim Windows down) and its open and free nature means that there are a myriad of distros on offer.

But herein lies the problem. Which distro do we try? The answer is subjective. What do you want to do? What is the spec of your machine? These questions dictate the path that you take with Linux. So with that in mind, we will take a look at six different Linux distros. Some are big names in the Linux world, and some are not-so-well known.

But the goal of this feature is to give you forward knowledge to try out these distros on your aging machines, with the view to getting them up and running once again. The best thing is that you can try out a Linux distro before committing to installation. All you need is a large enough USB stick and a copy of the distro as an ISO (disc image). Using a tool such as Rufus or Raspberry Pi Imager, the distro can be written to the USB stick and booted from your chosen machine.

So let's take a look at the six distros that we have personally tested.

The “Canonical” start of many Linux users



Reasons to Use

✅ Looks great

✅ Plenty of software choices

✅ Runs well on a range of hardware specs

Reasons to Avoid

❌ Snap is not for everyone

Ubuntu is the go-to Linux for many. Heck, I've been seriously using it since the first LTS (Long Term Support) in 2006. Ubuntu has become synonymous with those starting their Linux journey. It's easy to install and use, while being relatively light on system resources.

That said, to get the best from Ubuntu, your machine should not be older than 4-5 generations behind the current. I personally use Ubuntu 24.10 on a Lenovo X390 with an 8th Gen i5 and only 8GB of RAM, it runs pretty well but it is starting to show its age.

Ubuntu uses Gnome as its desktop environment. This means it has a similar, yet different approach to Microsoft Windows and macOS. All the usual user interface options are there.

Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer (WIMP) but it is packaged up into something a little bit different. For starters, the “start menu” is located on the left edge of the screen, but it can be placed anywhere you want.



Quick access to system settings, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth etc is via a neatly hidden menu in the top right. Windows can be snapped to the edges (similar to Windows 11) or the screen can be divided into quarters for when you need to quickly reference an app / browser window, or scan your playlist.



Under the hood, Ubuntu is essentially Debian Linux with a better user interface. Installing software via the Software Center is a breeze, but if you are more terminally inclined then you can install using the APT package manager or via Snaps. Snaps are Canonical's (the company behind Ubuntu) software packaging and deployment system. To get technical for a moment, they are self-contained applications that use a sandbox with just the right level of access to the underlying host system. APT integrates software directly into the host OS. There are battles fought on which is the best package format, but we'll leave those discussions to the forums.

Software choice is vast! From the big names like GIMP, Inkscape, Blender, LibreOffice, Google Chrome, Firefox etc to the little known apps that solve problems such as OpenShot (video editor), Ardour (open source digital audio workstation) and Parabolic (video downloader).



Ubuntu looks great, it uses Gnome for its user interface and it feels slick, responsive and very modern. But, you are not limited to just this, there are other versions of Ubuntu, called “re-spins” that offer different user interfaces (Window Managers) such as KDE (Kubuntu), Xfce (Xubuntu) and Mate (Ubuntu Mate). Some of these are more suited for older computers. Xfce for example, runs well on older hardware.

If you are just starting out with Linux, follow the herd and give Ubuntu a go.

Not just for the Raspberry Pi.



Reasons to Use

✅ Very low system requirements

✅ Looks and behaves like Raspberry Pi OS

✅ Easy to use

✅ Lots of software choices

Reasons to Avoid

❌ Long in the tooth

❌ Not as feature-rich as other Linux distributions

No, your eyes are not playing tricks, you can install Raspberry Pi OS on a non-Raspberry Pi device. Raspberry Pi Desktop is Debian Bullseeye with the Raspberry Pi desktop interface installed. The latest version is a little long in the tooth, being from 2022 and running Kernel 5.10 (we're up to 6.14 at the time of writing) but it works on even the oldest PC that I had laying around (a Lenovo X61 with just a dual core CPU).

It looks and feels just like Raspberry Pi OS on a Raspberry Pi, but it runs a little faster. The menu is in the top left, a settings menu is located in the top right corner, and we get the usual inspirational background image.

Software installation is via the graphical package manager, or you can drop into a terminal and use APT or .deb packages to install software.



The beauty of Raspberry Pi Desktop is that for those moving between the Raspberry Pi and a Linux computer, there is very little (if any) friction as the app choices and catalog are pretty similar between the two. Another benefit is that the OS is ready for coding in your choice of Python, MicroPython or CircuitPython via the excellent Thonny editor.

Raspberry Pi Desktop is a good bridge between the Raspberry Pi and resurrecting old laptops. It is a useful Linux distro for educational purposes, and for basic home tasks.

A great all-rounder



Reasons to Use

✅ Looks great

✅ Software management is easy

✅ Runs well on 8th Gen i5

Reasons to Avoid

❌ GNOME interface is not for everyone

❌ Debian users will need to learn dnf

We'll admit, it has been many years since we last used Fedora as a day to day OS, but Fedora 41, running GNOME has really caught our attention. Fedora workstation ran like a dream on our Lenovo X390. GNOME feels grown up and powerful, but if it isn't your thing then there are other versions (called Spins) that offer KDE Plasma, or Xfce. If you've got the horsepower, then GNOME or KDE is the way to go, but older machines can get the job done with Xfce.



Pressing the “Super” (Windows) key, we are presented with multiple desktops, and a selection of applications. On the row are nine dots, arranged into a square. Clicking on this will open the application drawer and we can see applications ready for use.

We can search for applications by typing their names, or we can scroll and click on our chosen application. Some applications are grouped into functional categories like “Utilities”. The GNOME way of creating user interfaces is very different to the traditional Start menu in the corner, but after a while you get used to pressing Super and then searching for an app, pressing Enter to run the application.



If you want to install more apps, then the Software tool handles application management via a simple graphical interface. Terminal users can use “dnf” to manage packages from the command line. Just like Manjaro, for those moving from a Debian based distro it will be a big change in how apps are managed from the terminal, but after a short while your muscle memory will kick in.

Fedora Workstation is a great Linux distro. Of all the distros that we used in this feature, Fedora Workstation was the big surprise. It felt fresh, professional and fun. You can get a lot of work done with the stable foundation of Fedora.

Featherweight fighter



Reasons to Use

✅ Lightweight for older PCs

✅ Looks great

✅ Easy to use

✅ All the modern features that we need

Reasons to Avoid

❌ Based on Debian, so packages are stable, but older.

MX Linux is the distro which brings life to that old netbook that you have lying around. But it is not just a capable distro for reviving older machines, it is also a damn good distro that just works.

Based on Debian “Bookworm” MX Linux comes Xfce, KDE and Fluxbox versions, with Xfce being the flagship product. If you need the version of MX Linux with the lowest impact on older systems, give Fluxbox a try, it is designed to revive devices that would otherwise become e-waste.



The distro is marketed as a middleweight distro, and that means it can be installed on a plethora of devices from weak Intel Atom machines to the latest generation of CPUs. But does this make it a weak choice? Far from it! It can be installed on 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs and the “ahs” (Advanced Hardware Support) supports Linux Kernel 6.6 and has newer graphics drivers.

MX Linux's Xfce desktop environment is light and fresh. It forges its own path with a “Start” menu in the bottom left, but the taskbar is on the left of the screen. This can be seen as a mixture of Ubuntu's left panel, and Linux Mint's more traditional Start menu location. The taskbar has all of the important system settings. Networking, Bluetooth, battery, volume and a handy clipboard manager.



Apps can be searched via the Start menu; they are also broken down into categories. You'll find all the usual open source and free software applications. Mozilla Firefox, VLC, Libre Office, Geany and many others are pre-installed. If you want more apps, then MX Package Installer is the GUI to manage your software. You can also do the same via a terminal using APT, after all it is Debian under the hood.

MX Linux is a fantastic distro to breathe life into an older machine. It is probably the best low-resource distro that still provides a fresh and modern experience.

The bridge between Linux and Windows



Reasons to Use

✅ Easy to install

✅ Looks great

✅ Choice of desktops

Reasons to Avoid

❌ Not bleeding edge, uses Ubuntu LTS

Linux Mint comes in a range of flavors such as Cinnamon, Xfce and Mate desktop environments, Cinnamon being the most popular version and so it is the version which sees primary development. No matter which version you choose, you are set for a great experience. It runs great, even on older hardware, but we would recommend the Xfce version for those running older hardware, as it isn't as taxing on hardware.



We downloaded and installed Linux Mint Cinnamon and it ran beautifully on our Lenovo X390. It felt like a great entryway from Windows to Linux. The “Start” menu is in the bottom left, settings in the bottom right corner. Accessing applications via the Start menu is a breeze, with commonly used applications within quick reach, and the rest are listed via categories.



Software installation is via the Software Manager application which can be searched for specific applications, or you can browse through the categories for that hidden gem. If you are more at home on the command line, then Linux Mint uses Debian's package manager, APT, to manage packages and applications.

Linux Mint is largely based upon Ubuntu (Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat in this case) but there is a pure Debian alternative (Bookworm at the time of writing) for those who prefer the Debian ethos.

The Cinnamon desktop environment is our favorite, and it feels slick and “grown up”. No wonder it is the primary version of Linux Mint. But, both Xfce and MATE are both viable alternatives.

Linux Mint is a great transitional distro. It has enough familiarity for Windows users, while gently introducing the world of Linux. Overall it is a great distro for many users, or many abilities. It installs quickly and works well on even elderly hardware.



Something a little bit different



Reasons to Use

✅ Low system impact

✅ Looks great

✅ Easy to use

Reasons to Avoid

❌ Difficult to migrate from Debian / RPM distros

Manjaro Linux is something a little bit different than the norm. Based on Arch Linux, Manjaro is fast, lightweight and powerful Linux that is at home on low powered machines and the fastest PCs.

We've used Manjaro on a Teclast F7 laptop with 6GB of LPDDR3 RAM and an Intel Celeron N3450 (Apollo Lake) quad-core CPU. Manjaro is for beginners and power users. It is simple to use, but it has plenty of performance to give us!



We tested the Xfce version of Manjaro 24.2.1 and it ran exceptionally well on our Lenovo X390. As with many other Linux distros that we have tested, the “Start” menu is in the bottom left corner, the settings (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth etc) are in the bottom right.

Opening a terminal, which on other distros sees a traditional window appear, we see a dropdown “visor” style terminal which disappears when out of focus. Opening the terminal again sees the same terminal appear, so we don't lose our last command.



The desktop looks sublime. The wallpaper and dark theme looks great. The Start menu has a search function, or we can scroll through categories. If the apps that we want aren't there, we can use add / remove software's GUI to search and install them.

Should you prefer the terminal then pacman, the Arch package manager is at your service and is a joy to use. Those coming from a Debian based system will soon pick up the pacman syntax to update, search and install new packages. Or just use the aforementioned GUI instead.

If Xfce isn't your thing, then you have the choice of KDE or GNOME. Community images bring Cinnamon, i3 and the tiling Sway window manager

Manjaro, and the underlying Arch install is powerful and fast, making it the smart choice for those who are well versed in Linux. But, Manjaro is just as easy to use as Ubuntu or Linux Mint. You just need to learn how it works. If you are fresh to Linux, then Manjaro's “quirks” will not apply as everything will be fresh and new.

We're die hard Debian distro lovers, but Manjaro captured our hearts with its ease of use and slick presentation, not to mention its performance. Give it a whirl on a spare PC!

Cooler Master supplies the X Silent Edge Platinum in a tough and large cardboard box with an extremely simple all-black theme. Inside, the PSU is well-protected by thick foam inserts and wrapped in a nylon cover to prevent any damage during shipping.



The included accessories are relatively minimal for a power supply of such a tier. Cooler Master provides the necessary mounting screws, an AC power cable, a few cable ties, and two cable straps. The bundle basically just covers the essentials.



The X Silent Edge Platinum features all-black, individually sleeved cables with black connectors, offering a clean and sophisticated look. The cables are notably soft and flexible, making cable routing easier. The 12V-2x6 PCIe cable includes a 90-degree connector, which Cooler Master claims enhances reliability due to its improved contact mechanism and thickness.

The Cooler Master X Silent Edge Platinum is a significantly larger power supply, measuring 180 mm in length. Its extended footprint means that compatibility with compact ATX cases should be carefully verified before installation. It is uniquely designed, with a chassis that is part heatsink, part vented enclosure, and its sheer size and weight make it stand out from typical ATX power supplies.



The unit features a satin black finish with chamfered edges for a refined aesthetic. The left side of the chassis houses the label displaying the power supply's electrical specifications and certifications, while the right side resembles a heatsink. A substantial portion of the unit's bottom, rear, and sides features ventilation cutouts to assist in passive cooling, while the top consists of a massive solid aluminum heatsink that acts as the main cooling mechanism for the unit's secondary inversion circuitry.

At the rear, the X Silent Edge includes the standard AC input socket and a standard power switch. The front panel hosts the modular cable connectors, with a subtle legend printed around them for guidance. There is also a USB port and cable, which can be used to monitor some of the unit's basic figures (temperature, power output) via Cooler Master's MasterCTLR software.

Unlike most power supplies that rely on active airflow, the Cooler Master X Silent Edge Platinum is designed for entirely passive operation, utilizing massive heatsink configurations and even heatpipe-assisted thermal dissipation. The internal layout is optimized for high thermal efficiency, with major heat-generating components connected to the aluminum chassis for effective passive cooling. The heatsinks of this unit are massive and even the transformer has one attached to it.



Cooler Master claims that this power supply is entirely developed in-house, and we could not recognize its OEM. The input filtering stage is robust, featuring four Y capacitors, two X capacitors, and two filtering inductors. Most of these components are directly integrated behind the AC receptacle.



The input rectification circuitry utilizes a bridgeless approach, with four MOSFETs replacing traditional rectifier bridges. The Active Power Factor Correction (APFC) stage employs two Infineon CoolSiC MOSFETs and a single diode for power factor correction, while an encased inductor and two EPCOS 560 µF capacitors handle passive energy storage. The capacitors are placed within a protective cocoon comprising thick heat shrink and resin, possibly to enhance thermal insulation.



The primary conversion stage employs a full-bridge LLC topology, consisting of four high-quality Infineon 60R070CFD7 MOSFETs. These MOSFETs are known for their efficiency and thermal performance, making them well-suited for a fanless power supply.

On the secondary side, the 12V rail is generated by two arrays of six MOSFETs located on the underside of the PCB. These MOSFETs are attached to a heatpipe-assisted cooling system, where a copper plate draws heat from the components and spreads it via four heatpipes to the chassis, which virtually is a massive aluminum heatsink. The 3.3V and 5V rails are generated by DC-to-DC converters mounted on a vertical daughterboard.



The X Silent Edge Platinum features a premium selection of capacitors. The secondary side consists almost entirely of solid-state polymer capacitors supplied by Nippon Chemi-Con, with only two small Rubycon electrolytic capacitors present.

For testing PSUs, we use high-precision electronic loads with a maximum power draw of 2700 Watts, a Rigol DS5042M 40 MHz oscilloscope, an Extech 380803 power analyzer, two high-precision UNI-T UT-325 digital thermometers, an Extech HD600 SPL meter, a self-designed hotbox, and various other bits and parts.

During cold testing, the Cooler Master X Silent Edge Platinum delivered an average nominal load efficiency of 90.8% at 115 VAC and 92.4% at 230 VAC, meeting the 80Plus Platinum certification requirements. At 115 VAC, the unit qualifies for CLEAResult Platinum certification, while at 230 VAC it narrowly misses the 94% efficiency threshold at 50% load. Notably, the unit peaks at 94.1% efficiency at 60% load, which highlights the weaknesses of the CLEAResult efficiency certifications. Cybenetics, whose certification is largely based on average efficiency, awarded the X Silent Edge Platinum a Platinum certification across all input voltages, as well as their best noise certification—a natural outcome of its completely fanless design. The thermal performance is consistently linear throughout the test range, with internal temperatures maintained within safe limits despite the absence of active cooling.

During hot testing, the Cooler Master X Silent Edge Platinum achieved an average nominal load efficiency of approximately 90.0% at 115 VAC and 91.5% at 230 VAC. This represents a modest decrease of roughly 0.8 to 0.9 percentage points compared to room temperature. Such a slight reduction under elevated ambient temperatures is expected from any typical PC power supply. The efficiency drop under heavy loads indicates some degree of thermal stress on the active components, but the effect is small, even though we are testing the unit above its rated temperature threshold for maximum power output. Internal temperatures are relatively high but do not reach dangerous levels. The unit's completely fanless operation guarantees absolute silence, even under adverse conditions, setting it in a different league from active cooling designs.

The Cooler Master X Silent Edge Platinum power supply demonstrated good electrical performance, with voltage regulation maintained at approximately 1.2% on the 12V rail, 1.6% on the 5V rail, and 1.8% on the 3.3V rail. Ripple suppression was commendable, with maximum ripple levels of 40 mV on the 12V rail and 20 mV on both the 5V and 3.3V rails. Although these figures are very good for a modern PC power supply, they do not stand out, which could spell trouble for the X Silent Edge, considering its highly premium character.

During our thorough assessment, we evaluate the essential protection features of every power supply unit we review, including Over Current Protection (OCP), Over Voltage Protection (OVP), Over Power Protection (OPP), and Short Circuit Protection (SCP). All protection mechanisms were activated and functioned correctly during testing.

The OCP thresholds were set at 120% for the 3.3V rail, 122% for the 5V rail, and 110% for the 12V rail, while the Over Power Protection (OPP) activated at 112% under hot conditions. These protection levels are very sharp and low for an ATX 3.1 unit, but we feel they are well-calibrated to ensure reliable operation in a fully fanless design.

The Cooler Master X Silent Edge Platinum 850W power supply represents a bold leap in high-end power supply design, marrying form with function through its innovative, fanless architecture. Externally, the unit's massive 180 mm length and substantial weight immediately signal its unique and premium nature. Cooler Master carefully designed this unit's exterior to be very appealing but not extravagant. Designed for enthusiasts who demand absolute silence in their systems, this power supply is targeted at users building high-performance rigs where noise reduction is as critical as power delivery.



Internally, the X Silent Edge Platinum is a showcase of advanced thermal engineering. Cooler Master's in-house development has resulted in a layout that leverages massive heatsink configurations and heatpipe-assisted thermal dissipation to manage heat without any active cooling and under virtually any environmental conditions. All major active components are top-quality Infineon MOSFETs, ensuring stable performance and top efficiency. Typically, such a design should reach Titanium efficiency levels, but the X Silent Edge is tuned towards sustaining its efficiency very high across the entire load spectrum. The use of premium polymer capacitors from Nippon Chemi-Con, supplemented by a minimal number of Rubycon electrolytic capacitors, further underscores the unit's dedication to long-term durability and high-end performance. This unit is covered by a 15-year long manufacturer's warranty – the longest we have ever seen to this date.



Performance-wise, the X Silent Edge Platinum does not disappoint. Cold testing at a 25°C ambient temperature revealed nominal load efficiencies of 90.8% at 115 VAC and 92.4% at 230 VAC, with efficiency peaking at an impressive 94.1% at 60% load. These results meet the 80Plus Platinum certification requirements at 115 VAC, while the unit narrowly misses the threshold at 230 VAC under specific load conditions. Under hotter conditions (~45°C ambient), the efficiency drop is very well within acceptable margins. The power quality of the unit is great but, unfortunately, it does not really stand out by today's standards, which we feel that it should be considering its price tag.



In summary, the Cooler Master X Silent Edge Platinum 850W is a notable achievement in silent power delivery, crafted for those who value both performance and absolute quiet operation. While its innovative passive cooling design and meticulous internal architecture justify its premium positioning, the extremely steep $550 price tag restricts its appeal to a niche high-end market. For users building ultra-quiet, high-performance systems, this power supply offers exceptional quality and reliability. However, budget-conscious buyers or those with space-constrained cases might find its cost and dimensions prohibitive. Overall, the unit stands as a testament to cutting-edge engineering, albeit with trade-offs that warrant very careful consideration.

RayNeo has been quickly iterating on its line of augmented reality glasses. While the company's glasses don't boast the rich feature set of competitors like Xreal, pricing tends to be more affordable for shoppers.

The company's latest glasses, the Air 3s, are another evolutionary upgrade that offer improved performance and vastly superior audio over prior generations while retaining the same affordability that has always been a draw for RayNeo.

Since I recently reviewed the RayNeo Air 2s, I initially thought there was a mix-up in the shipment sent to me because the Air 3s look the same from the outside. This is both good and bad – while the design is attractive, the use of cheap plastics still doesn't impart a substantial feel to the glasses.

The Air 3s includes a shaded, single-piece front lens. Unlike the Xreal One, this opaque lens doesn't feature electrochromic dimming. You also don't get a separate, physical light blocker in the box, so if the default dimming isn't enough to block ambient light from ruining your viewing experience, you're out of luck (unless you go for a homemade or third-party solution).

You'll also notice the familiar silver-colored, three-position arms sprouting from the primary frame. The left arm contains a volume rocker and a menu button, while the right arm has a brightness rocker and a USB-C port at the end for the included USB-C to USB-C cable. I will mention that RayNeo no longer sticks the ugly FCC label on the outside of the right arm.

The Air 3s continues to use Sony Micro-LED panels, as do most consumer AR glasses. However, RayNeo has made some tweaks thanks to the inclusion of its HueView screen technology, which aims to provide a richer palette of colors. As a result, the Air 3s comply with the IMAX Enhanced standard, covering 98 percent of DCI-P3 and 145 percent of sRGB and delivering a native contrast ratio of 200,000:1 (up from 100,000:1 on the Air 2s). Maximum brightness has also improved slightly, increasing from 600 nits to 650 nits.

Long-term wearing of AR glasses can cause fatigue (as I experienced acutely with the Air 2s), so RayNeo has implemented its 3,840 Hz DC+PWM “OptiCare” dimming system. OptiCare regulates color output and minimizes flickering that could cause eye discomfort.

RayNeo also turned their attention to the audio subsystem, which was a sore point during my time with the Airs 2s. This time, the company uses an in-house designed and turned four-speaker setup with a claimed 200 percent boost in acoustic performance.

The box includes two nose pads, one of which is already installed. RayNeo also provides a sample frame for prescription lenses, a carrying case, and a cleaning cloth. The company continues to include a hard carrying case, although it has received a slight redesign compared to the version included in the Air 2s. It has enough room for the glasses, the USB-C cable, and the cleaning cloth.

The Air 3s connects to supported devices (which support video-out over USB-C) with the included braided USB-C cable. The USB-C end that plugs into the right arm of the Air 3s has a slight downward bend, which prevents the cable from sticking straight out behind you.

There is broad support for most smartphones, tablets, PCs, and Macs on the market. I had no trouble using the Air 3s with a MacBook Pro (M3 Pro), Mac Mini (M4), iPhone 16 Pro, iPad Pro (M4), Lenovo Legion Go, and a Legion Go S. I attempted to use the glasses with the Asus ZenFone 10, but it was a no-go since the Android smartphone doesn't support video-out via its USB-C port.

The Air 3s simulates a 201-inch virtual display projected six meters in front of your face and has a 47-degree field of view (FoV), slightly up from 46 degrees on the Air 2s. However, the most significant change I noticed with the Air 3s was that I didn't experience the edge blurriness that marred my experience with the Air 2s.

The Air 2s were crisp towards the center of my field of vision, but became blurrier towards the periphery. This mismatch caused severe fatigue as my eyes attempted to lock on to on-screen text. I had no issues with the Air 3s, even after spending multiple hours using the glasses to write and edit articles.



As was the case with the Air 2s, I was able to thoroughly enjoy movies on the Air 3s. While it's perfectly feasible to use the glasses for productivity tasks in Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia 15.4, I feel they are more at home when used purely as a media consumption accessory.

For example, I enjoyed playing Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Forza Horizon 5 using the Air 3s with the Legion Go S. The former game was incredibly immersive with the “big screen” experience – playing it at night, with all the lights off in a room with nighttime also set in the game's time settings is a transformative experience.

I also enjoyed just lounging around and watching movies on the Air 3s. I watched Inception and Oppenheimer with the glasses, and even managed to watch a good portion of one of my childhood favorite movies: Innerspace.

The enjoyable media watching experience was enhanced by another significant upgrade over the Air 2s: the audio system. I harped on the mediocre speaker system on the Air 2s, which sounded horrible and had issues with distortion. More problematic was the incessant buzzing and rattling that I experienced. The Air 3s exhibits none of those ailments and actually has performance more closely aligned with the Xreal One Series.

I still would have liked a tad more bass, but there's not much else to complain about with the sound quality. RayNeo even includes a Whisper Mode 2.0, which cuts down on sound leakage from the speakers when playing multimedia content while wearing the Air 3s in public.

The previous generation RayNeo Air 2s was a big disappointment; however, the Air 3s have improved upon its predecessor in two significant ways: the speaker system and the optics. It's like night and day comparing the audio performance of the Air 3s with its predecessor. Audio sounds more precise, and there's none of the plastic buzzing that plagued the Air 2s. The blurriness I experienced around the edges of the viewing area on the Air 2s has also been addressed with the Air 3s.

Even better, the improvements don't come with a price hike compared to its predecessor. The Air 2s are currently available for $299 from Amazon, while the Air 3s will go on sale priced at $269, according to RayNeo. That's a screaming bargain in the AR glasses realm, and makes the Air 3s a must-buy if you're in the market.

New research recently published in Archives of Sexual Behavior suggests children's gender biases can be reflected in their facial emotional expressions.

Psychology professor Doug VanderLaan and his colleagues at the University of Toronto Mississauga, studied 296 children (148 boys and 148 girls) in Canada between the ages of four and nine years old while Wang Ivy Wong, Karen Kwan and their colleagues at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University studied 309 children (155 boys and 154 girls) in Hong Kong. All children watched four short stories that included five illustrations with pre-recorded audio narratives. The stories were presented in random order and showed peers who were in the same grade as the participant and displayed behaviours that either did or did not follow gender stereotypes. While viewing the stories, FaceReader software was used to code the intensities of participants' emotions, including angry, disgusted, happy, sad, scared, and surprised. 

The study found a small effect for one emotional expression (fear), but little to no difference in emotion with the other five. Participants displayed more scared emotion when viewing a boy who wasn't following societal gender stereotypes in the types of toys, activities, clothes, hairstyles, and friends he preferred. This fear was correlated with one of five verbal questions, in particular a question related to emotion perception, where children shared that they perceived the feminine-behaving boy as being less happy when compared with the boy who conformed with masculine gender stereotypes.""These results provide evidence that children's gender biases are reflected in their facial emotional expressions – specifically showing signs of being scared when it comes to boy peers whose behaviours don't follow gender stereotypes,"" said Doug VanderLaan, an associate professor with the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto Mississauga. ""Developmentally, children may learn to imitate such fear responses from those who are around them like their peers, family members, and media."" 

VanderLaan noted the finding is consistent with other studies highlighting that less positive characteristics are assigned to children whose behaviours don't follow gender stereotypes, especially when it comes to feminine-behaving boys. However, for this study in particular, examining facial emotional expressions provided unique insights into the emotional component of peer appraisals. Overall, the research contributes toward more complete understanding when it comes to children's gender biases while assessing their peers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Abortion rates remain stable in Ontario despite global spike","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250411/Abortion-rates-remain-stable-in-Ontario-despite-global-spike.aspx","Sat, 12 Apr 2025 01:29:00 GMT","

A new study finds that, unlike countries across the UK and Europe, abortion rates did not spike in Ontario, Canada from 2020-2022. 

Following decades-long declines in nearly all high-income settings, abortion rate trends reversed between 2020 and 2022 in many countries. For example, 2022 and 2023 saw the highest abortion rates on record in Scotland, England, and Wales. 

Researchers from the University of British Columbia and ICES found that, after accounting for changes in the abortion rate when the abortion medication mifepristone was introduced in 2017 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, abortion rates held fairly steady in Ontario through 2022. 

Canada was well-positioned to seamlessly continue abortion service delivery through the pandemic, with policies in place to support primary care and telemedicine abortion care since 2017.""

Dr. Laura Schummers, lead author and Assistant Professor of Health Outcomes, Collaboration for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at UBC

Long-standing abortion rate declines continued through 2016, and were steepest for those younger than 25 years, while rates for those aged 30 to 44 years remained stable. 

Rates then increased modestly between 2017 and 2020 when mifepristone became available, followed by a decline during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, the abortion rate returned to the pre-pandemic trend, continuing to increase gradually. 

The population-based cohort study examined all medication and procedural abortion provided to females (biological sex at birth) aged 15 to 44 years old from 2012 to 2022. Linked health data at ICES was used to examine patient use of primary care, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, same-day surgeries, and prescriptions from a pharmacy. 

This research found steady gains in the percentage of abortions provided by medication, accounting for more than 50% of abortions in Ontario by 2022. 

One limitation of the study is that ""pregnancy intention""-a person's self-reported desire or plan to become pregnant-is not available in health administrative data, which means underlying trends in managing unintended pregnancy may not have been captured. 

The study notes that sharp increases in the abortion rate from 2020 to 2023 reported in some settings might be due to declining use of the most effective contraception methods. ""If declining contraception use is due to misinformation or disinformation, like through social media, or concerns about cost-of-living, these may impact future rates in Canada"" said Schummers. ""On the other hand, if spiking rates elsewhere are due to decreased access to contraception or improved abortion access, Canada's unique policy and service environment mean we likely won't see similar trends in Canada."" 

Policies to improve access to contraception are rolling out across Canada, including universal free contraception through the 2024 federal pharmacare legislation. Over time, this may mean we see declining abortion rates. 

However, the researchers note that it remains to be seen whether sociocultural forces impacting increased abortion rates in some countries may lead to abrupt increases in Canada in future years.

Researchers at Moffitt Cancer Center have found that tapping into the body's own immune system and activating a type of immune cell known as B cells, could be the key to boosting the effectiveness of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, or TIL therapy. Results of their study were published in the Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer.

TIL therapy starts with doctor's removing tumors from the patient. These tumors are sent to a lab, where they are dissected to collect immune cells that have infiltrated the tumor, known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These TILs are then grown in large quantities and reinfused into the patient's body to seek out and attack cancer cells. While it's already FDA-approved for melanoma, new Moffitt research shows that a simple tweak in the lab could make it work even better for more patients. The key is a natural immune protein called CD40L.

We discovered that by adding CD40L to the immune cells in the lab, we could dramatically improve the number and quality of cancer-fighting T cells we're able to grow. It's like flipping a switch that helps these cells become stronger and healthier.""

Daniel Abate-Daga, Ph.D., scientific director of the Cell Therapies Core at Moffitt and lead author of the study

Results of the study showed that in more challenging specimens, TIL cultures grew successfully in 67% of samples when CD40L was used, compared to 33% without it. The approach also shaved up to one week off the manufacturing time, potentially getting the cellular immunotherapy to patients sooner. Finally, the enhanced cells were more ""stem-like,"" a trait linked to longer-lasting cancer fighting capabilities.

""TIL therapy is one of the most promising treatments we have for solid tumors,"" said Abate-Daga. ""This discovery could help more patients benefit and do so more quickly.""

Moffitt is currently leading a clinical trial to test this approach in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Researchers hope CD40L-enhanced TILs will become a next-generation standard in TIL therapy.

This study was funded by the National Cancer Institution (P30CA076292), the SuzyQ Melanoma Fund, Moffitt Cancer Center's Lung Cancer Center of Excellence and Donald A. Adam Skin Cancer and Melanoma Center of Excellence, the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation and the Mark Foundation ASPIRE program.

Trinity Rodman is back with the U.S. women's team for the first time since last summer's Paris Olympics.

Rodman had been nursing a back injury and was left out of both the U.S. team's January camp and the recent SheBelieves Cup tournament. She made her return to her club team, the Washington Spirit, last weekend in an National Women's Soccer League match.

U.S. coach Emma Hayes added her to a 24-player roster announced Tuesday in advance of a pair of friendly matches against Brazil next month.

Rodman was part of the U.S. team's “Triple Espresso” front line with Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson that helped lead the team to its fifth Olympic gold medal in Paris. 

Neither Swanson nor Wilson were on the latest squad. Swanson has been taking time off for personal reasons and did not start the season with the Chicago Stars. Wilson, formerly known by her maiden name Smith, is on maternity leave.

Hayes said she'd be cautious with Rodman's return.

“You can go from a position of a managed return to play to too much. So, I have to try and find the sweet spot in camp to reintegrate her back in the team but also to manage her, because she has a long season ahead,” Hayes said.

The roster includes 19 of the players that were included for the SheBelieves Cup. Hayes said she is still evaluating players with an eye on Women's World Cup qualification next year.

The matches against Brazil are set for April 5 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and April 8 at PayPal Park in San Jose, California. The United States defeated Brazil 1-0 on Swanson's goal for the gold medal in Paris.

Mia Fishel, who tore her ACL last year but recently returned to play for Chelsea, will be included in camp as a training player, along with Angel City goalkeeper Angelina Anderson.

Houston Dash defender Avery Patterson earned her first call-up to the team.

Naomi Girma, who was injured in her first game with Chelsea after a record-breaking transfer from the San Diego Wave, remained unavailable. Midfielder Rose Lavelle remains sidelined by offseason ankle surgery.

The roster with club affiliation:

Goalkeepers: Jane Campbell (Houston Dash), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United).

Defenders: Alana Cook (Kansas City Current), Tierna Davidson (Gotham FC), Crystal Dunn (Paris Saint-Germain), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC).

Midfielders: Korbin Albert (Paris Saint-Germain), Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns), Lindsey Heaps (Olympique Lyon), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current), Jaedyn Shaw (North Carolina Courage), Lily Yohannes (Ajax).

Forwards: Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current), Ashley Hatch (Washington Spirit), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash), Ally Sentnor (Utah Royals), Alyssa Thompson (Angel City).

...

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

""The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want,"" Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

""I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do,"" Adams said postgame. ""It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us.""

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino ""disappointed,"" again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

""I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic,"" Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: ""In football, anything can happen.""

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt ""shame"" after the two losses, and promising, again, that ""next time"" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

""I'm never concerned, man. It's football,"" he said. ""You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to.""","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","The complete USMNT 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup group schedule, draw","https://mlsmultiplex.com/the-complete-usmnt-2025-concacaf-gold-cup-group-schedule-draw-01jrk8syp2xe","Sat, 12 Apr 2025 06:05:57 GMT","

The U.S. men's national team now knows its group draw, schedule and travel itinerary for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. 

The USMNT already knew it would be drawn as the top seed in Group D after falling to fourth place in Concacaf's regional rankings following a disappointing Concacaf Nations League performance.

In Thursday's draw, they learned their full group assignment. Teams below are listed in order of seed:

In terms of FIFA World Rankings, the USMNT likely received the toughest draw of the four seeded teams because of the inclusion of Saudi Arabia as a guest nation. Although Saudi Arabia is the sixth-highest ranked team in World Rankings at 58th, they were drawn out of the fourth pot because they are not a Concacaf member.

On Friday, Concacaf announced the full schedule for group matches and the dates, times and locations of yet-to-be-determined knockout phase fixtures.

Because the USMNT is currently Concacaf's fourth-ranked side, and Mexico is first, Mexico was drawn into group A, meaning border rivals could potentially meet in the quarterfinals or semifinals. If that occurred, it would be their ninth all-time tournament final meeting and the first before the final since 1993.

Here's the full itinerary of guaranteed group matches and potential knockout phase dates:

USMNT vs. Trinidad and Tobago - 6 p.m. ET | 3 p.m. PTPayPal Park, San Jose, Calif.

USMNT vs. Saudi Arabia - 9:15 p.m. ET | 8:15 p.m. CTQ2 Stadium, Austin, Texas

USMNT vs. Haiti - 7 p.m. ET | 6 p.m. CTAT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas

The venue for each Quarterfinal match will be confirmed at the end of the group stage, and matchups will be determined by tournament regulations (QF1: 1D vs. 2A, QF2: 1A vs. 2D, QF3: 1C vs. 2B, and QF4: 1B vs. 2C). 

TBD vs. TBD - 7:15 p.m. ET | 4:15 p.m. PTTBD vs. TBD - 10:15 p.m. ET | 7:15 p.m. ETState Farm Stadium, Glendale, Ariz.

TBD vs. TBD - 4 p.m. ET | 3 p.m. CTTBD vs. TBD - 7 p.m. ET | 6 p.m. CTU.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis

Inter got a close-up look at the FIFA Club World Cup trophy ahead of the newly-formatted tournament at the end of the 2024-25 season, as Beppe Marotta, Javier Zannetti and the Nerazzurri senior management team hosted a special presentation event in San Siro on Saturday. 

Inter, along with Juventus, are the two Italian representatives heading to the United States for the 2025 Club World Cup: The first of a newly-formatted tournament that involves 32 teams and will take place every four years. 

The Nerazzurri will take on CF Monterrey of Mexico, Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds and River Plate of Argentina across the month of June. 

Ahead of the tournament, the Club World Cup trophy is on a tour around the world, and is currently in the city of Milan, and is currently in San Siro for an exclusive event hosted by Marotta and Zanetti, along with a number of FIFA delegates. 

 

 

A post shared by Inter (@inter)

“Being one of the only two teams representing Italy is a source of great pride for us, the result of the work of the last five years: we deserved this place,” Marotta said at the event. 

He continued: “The Club World Cup will be a unique experience in the middle of two different seasons, in a new format that will allow us to compete with the best teams in the world. 

“Inter is a great club and its history speaks for itself: we participate in every competition with maximum concentration and our desire is to do well and aim to win to bring the name of Inter higher and higher in Europe and the world.”

Francesco Pio Esposito could link up with Inter Milan's squad for the FIFA Club World Cup if they are to reach the knockout stages.

This according to today's print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews.

Inter Milan have confirmed that teenage striker Francesco Pio Esposito has signed a new contract.

The 19-year-old has committed his future to the Nerazzurri until the end of June 2030.

At the moment, striker Francesco Pio Esposito is on loan at Spezia.

The teenage striker has had a sensational season so far. He has scored fourteen goals for the Ligurian club, putting him joint second in the Serie B scoring charts.

Now, the question is what comes next for Pio Esposito.

Inter are reportedly ready to loan the teenage striker to a club in Serie A next season.

Pio Esposito is certainly a player who Inter see as part of their future plans. However, he's not quite ready for the first team squad just yet.

Therefore, a loan in the top flight seems the likeliest possibility.

On the other hand, reports the Gazzetta, there could be a big opportunity for Pio Esposito to get some experience with the Inter senior team this summer.

The Nerazzurri travel to the US for the Club World Cup in June.

Pio Esposito will not be there for the group stage of that competition. The 19-year-old has decided to prioritize the Under-21 Euros with Italy.

However, the Euros wrap up before the Club World Cup does. Therefore, if the timing allows for it, Pio Esposito could link up with the Inter squad should they make it out of their group.

FIFA, soccer's global governing body, on Thursday delivered fans a “first-of-its-kind offer” to the 2025 Club World Cup, which will debut in the United States this summer, with ticket packs that include “guaranteed” access to the 2026 men's World Cup — the grander international tournament that will also be held in the U.S. a year later.

Per the “Terms of Sale” document, here's how it works:

Buyers of a standard “pack,” which features tickets to two or three Club World Cup matches, “will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket to a FIFA World Cup 26 match in the United States (excluding the final),” FIFA said in a Thursday release.

In clause 4.2 of the Terms of Sale, is that FIFA can determine which 2026 World Cup match(es), and what type of ticket(s), the fan will have access to. Clause 2.4 also says: ""Tickets available to be included within Ticket Packages shall be subject to availability and available for purchase on a first-come first-served basis. By way of these Terms of Sale, FIFA Ticketing makes no guarantees as to the availability of Tickets and any indication on the availability of Tickets by FIFA Ticketing is for guidance purposes.""

First, fans mustn't resell those tickets, and must actually use them — meaning they or a family member or friend must go to the game. They will then be offered the chance to buy a 2026 World Cup ticket — match and seat specifics to be revealed later.

The second offering is the “Super Ticket Pack.” This package “features one ticket per match to 20 FIFA Club World Cup 2025 matches,” and then “a guaranteed option to buy one ticket” to the 2026 World Cup final, the most prestigious event in all of sports.

The buyer of a “super ticket pack” must “use all [20] tickets to attend all [20] matches,” and the matches must be on 20 different days. (There are only 22 distinct Club World Cup matchdays.)

Alternatively, per the terms, they could share the pack with “guests” — someone with whom they're “capable of demonstrating a pre-existing relationship.” Those guests could attend some of the 20 matches in their place. Among the fans and their guests, they'd get the right to buy one 2026 World Cup ticket.

Ticket prices for 2026 have not yet been announced, and tickets won't go on sale until the fall. FIFA has closely guarded all details.

Ticket prices for the 2025 Club World Cup, meanwhile, are roughly the same as they were when first released in December, both on Ticketmaster and within this “ticket pack” promotion via FIFA. “Category 1” seats — those in lower levels — cost anywhere from $100 to upward of $200, before taxes and fees, in the group stage; they cost $2,600, plus taxes and fees, for the final.

“Category 2” seats — typically those in a stadium's upper deck along the sideline — range from roughly $60 to $140 before taxes and fees in the group stage. Some cheaper tickets have been sold to supporters of the participating clubs.

However, the prices are far higher than those charged by the biggest European soccer clubs and have caused some consternation among fans. Bailey Brown, president of the Independent Supporters Council, a group representing soccer fans across the U.S. and Canada, told Yahoo Sports in December that she was worried that “many of the most passionate fans will be priced out of enjoying the sport.”

With two months of the opener, between Inter Miami and Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium in South Florida, many seats remain available.

In an effort to sell them, FIFA president Gianni Infantino has been holding promotional events alongside soccer dignitaries and celebrities.

Last month, he leveraged his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump to bring the Club World Cup trophy into the Oval Office, and leave it there on display. He used a media session alongside Trump to pump up the tournament and place it on par with the big World Cup.

Infantino's Instagram account is with filled posts promoting the Club World Cup. FIFA and its partners, in messages to everyone from soccer fans to NFL season ticket holders, have been marketing the event as “the most prestigious club soccer tournament in history.” They have been telling stakeholders that it will be “as big as the last [men's] World Cup,” according to multiple people who've heard FIFA's pitch.

After attempting to drum up interest, FIFA and Infantino ultimately struck a global broadcast deal with DAZN, which soon thereafter announced an equivalent investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.

And so, after years of uncertainty, the Club World Cup is happening. It will pay out $1 billion in appearance fees and prize money to the 32 participating clubs.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Nerazzurri President Beppe Marotta has no doubt that Inter Milan want to win the FIFA Club World Cup this summer.

Speaking at the Club World Cup trophy presentation, via FCInterNews, Marotta also declared that it is “not my chance” that Inter have been winning trophies in recent seasons.

Inter Milan will participate in the Club World Cup this summer.

It is a completely new format for the competition.

For one thing, FIFA have greatly expanded the number of teams competing. There will be 32 teams from the different confederations.

Inter are one of two teams from Serie A to have qualified for the Club World Cup. Juventus are the other.

Meanwhile, the Club World Cup will take place in the summer.

That means that, rather than happening midway through the European season as has been the case in the past, the Club World Cup will happen at the end of the campaign for European teams.

In the meantime, Inter have other aims. The Nerazzurri are still fighting to win the Serie A title, Coppa Italia, and Champions League.

But in just a couple months' time, Inter's focus will shift to the Club World Cup.

Inter Milan President Beppe Marotta called participation in the tournament “a source of pride.”

“It's a reward for the professionalism that the team has shown. And also those behind the scenes.”

“We're satisfied with it,” Marotta said. “But we also have a strong motivation to win it.”

“It will be an important event on a sporting level,” the Inter President said of the Club WOrld Cup.

“And certainly anachronistic, because it will be played between the two seasons.”

“We'll have to manage an unprecedented period of time,” Marotta said. “The staff and the club will have to find new levels of energy to deal with it on a psychological level.”

“Lifting this trophy would be a dream,” he added. “And sometimes dreams come true.”

The Nerazzurri President declared that “we have the absolute will to win.”

“Then, a lot will depend on motivation.”

“In Italy, we're not winning trophies by chance,” Marotta added. “But because we've earned them with work.”

“If you don't want to deal with some transportation issues, don't come to the game,"" Alex Lasry, CEO of the regional host committee for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, said Thursday during a panel at the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce's annual tourism conference after explaining that his family takes no chances with traffic, joking that his father left the 1996 World Series Game 6 in the eighth inning to dodge the traffic.

Lasry also explained that there will be “probably none or close to no” parking at MetLife Stadium during the tournament.

“The World Cup is a massive security perimeter and a huge security risk so I would imagine there will be very limited parking if any at MetLife,” Lasry said at the chamber's Lyndhurst headquarters.

Instead, the host committee is setting up park and rides around New Jersey, “where people can park somewhere nearby” and then be shuttled to the stadium, he said.

Lasry said people should “price in the fact that transportation is going to be a lot” and that while the host committee is still waiting for final approval of its mobility plan from FIFA, it is hoping to make transportation to and from MetLife Stadium as “efficient and easy as possible.”

Lasry said when it comes to train crowds, the host committee wanted to make sure the event is not overly annoying to daily commuters, so that people can “get to work and do what they need to do” while others can “get to the games while not putting too much of a stress on the transit system.”

But the transit system will — almost certainly — be pushed to its limits.

Some 80,000 fans will be traversing to MetLife and more than 16,000 other people, like FIFA staff, volunteers and contractors, are estimated to work the eight games at the stadium.

If parking is limited, the vast majority of those people will likely rely on NJ Transit, which has designed a system of trains and buses to move 20,000 people an hour. That is double what it was 11 years ago when MetLife hosted the Super Bowl and experienced an unexpected onslaught of 35,000 riders after the game. But the World Cup is the biggest sports spectacle in the world and soccer fans — whether they're going to the game or not — will want to be near the excitement.

Figuring out how to transport those fans safely and efficiently to the matches and fan fests around the region is the job of the region's host committee and transportation partners, including NJ Transit, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Amtrak and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

As Lasry put it, FIFA is responsible for what happens inside the stadiums and the host committees handle everything else, meaning they are the boots-on-the-ground planners for organizing the World Cup, which will be played in 16 cities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, with the final at MetLife.

With just about a year to go before the six-week tournament begins in June 2026, the New York-New Jersey host committee is waiting for final approval of its mobility plan from FIFA.

One major difference Lasry noted between the World Cup in 2026 and the 2014 Super Bowl debacle is that the final soccer match will likely be played in the afternoon to accommodate overseas viewership.

This, he said, should help spread out the crowds leaving the match instead of 80,000 people making a mad dash for trains, buses and shuttles.

“We will try to set up activations and things around the stadium to ensure that …. there's not just a massive rush of everyone trying to get on a train, everyone trying to get an Uber, everyone trying to get on a bus all at the same time,” Lasry said.

Ultimately, Lasry's message was this: Try not to “drive anywhere near the stadium on a match day because it's going to be a nightmare.”","{'href': 'https://www.northjersey.com', 'title': 'Bergen Record'}","soccer"

Home > International > AFC Chief Rejects CONMEBOL's 64-Team 2030 World Cup Proposal

World Cup expansion faces fierce opposition from Asian football chief.

Doha – Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa has strongly opposed South American football body CONMEBOL's proposal to expand the 2030 FIFA World Cup to 64 teams, warning such a move would lead to “chaos” in the tournament structure.

Speaking on the sidelines of the 35th AFC Congress in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, Sheikh Salman rejected the expansion plan put forward by CONMEBOL president Alejandro Dominguez earlier this week.

“Personally, I don't agree,” the Bahraini leader told AFP, insisting the 2030 edition had already settled on 48 teams “so the matter is settled.”

The AFC president warned that continually increasing the tournament size would create significant problems for the competition's structure and organization.

“If the issue remains open to change, then the door will not only be open to expanding the tournament to 64 teams, but someone might come along and demand raising the number to 132 teams,” said Sheikh Salman. “Where would we end up then? It would become chaos.”

The 2030 World Cup, set to commemorate the centenary of the tournament, is already planned as an unprecedented multi-continental event.

While Spain, Portugal and Morocco will host the majority of matches, three opening games will be staged in South America – in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay – recognizing Uruguay as the host of the inaugural 1930 World Cup.

The tournament will feature 48 teams, expanding from the 32-team format used in Qatar 2022. This expansion was already approved for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

CONMEBOL's Dominguez formally proposed the further expansion to 64 teams during the South American body's 80th Congress on Thursday, suggesting it as a one-time increase to celebrate the centennial.

“We are proposing, for the only time, to hold this centennial with 64 teams on three continents, simultaneously, so that all countries have the opportunity to experience a World Cup and so that no one on this planet is left out of this celebration,” Dominguez said.

The South American proposal would likely guarantee all 10 CONMEBOL member nations a place in the tournament. Venezuela is currently the only South American country that has never qualified for a World Cup.

If approved, the expansion would effectively double the tournament size to 128 matches, compared to the 64-game format used from 1998 through 2022.

While Sheikh Salman rejected changes for 2030, he did not dismiss potential format adjustments for future tournaments beyond the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia.

“If we want to discuss subsequent tournaments… that's a different matter,” he said.

The proposal has received a mixed response from football's governing bodies. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin previously dismissed it as a “bad idea,” while FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafstrom said the world governing body would “analyse” the suggestion.

“There are many things that need to be studied, and we will take our time, consult everyone,” Grafstrom said.

Critics argue that expanding to 64 teams would dilute the quality of play and devalue continental qualifying competitions, while supporters suggest it would give more nations the opportunity to participate in football's premier event.

The idea was initially raised at a FIFA Council meeting in March by Uruguay Football Federation chief Ignacio Alonso, before being formally proposed by CONMEBOL's Dominguez this week.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who participated in Thursday's CONMEBOL Congress via videoconference, has previously supported tournament expansions during his presidency, which began in 2016, seeking increased revenue for FIFA's 211 member federations and more opportunities for national teams to qualify.

The final decision on the tournament structure remains with FIFA, which will need to balance celebration of the World Cup's centenary with maintaining the tournament's competitive integrity and logistical feasibility.

South American football's governing body, which goes by the acronym CONMEBOL, has officially proposed to expand the 2030 FIFA World Cup to 64 teams.

A Uruguayan delegate first introduced the proposal in March during a FIFA council meeting. Conmebol president Alejandro Domínguez urged the world body on Thursday to add 16 teams to the existing 48-nation tournament so that the 2030 World Cup can be a ‘party' for all.

“We are convinced that the centennial celebration will be unique because 100 years are celebrated only once,” Domínguez said during his opening speech at the Conmebol Congress.

Days before, during the UEFA congress, the European football association's president Aleksander Ceferin called it a ‘bad idea', saying it ‘won't be good for the World Cup or the qualification process'. “I do not support it,” he told Serbia's Mozzart Sport.

Critics say expanding the World Cup to 64 teams will severely dilute the quality of the tournament. For instance, all 10 South American football federation members, including Venezuela who have never qualified for the World Cup, will likely earn direct spots without having to go through qualification.

The 2030 World Cup will already be the most sprawling edition, with matches spread across six nations on three continents. Celebrating the century of the first World Cup, held in Uruguay in 1930, the commemorative matches will be held in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay while Spain, Portugal and Morocco will jointly host the rest of the competition.

“That is why we are proposing, for the first time, to hold this anniversary with 64 teams, on three continents simultaneously,” added Domínguez. “This will allow all countries to have the opportunity to live the world experience and so nobody on the planet is left out of the party.”

The veteran centre-half has looked unusually vulnerable in recent weeks but he remains the most influential defender in the Premier League

Virgil van Dijk stopped to talk to reporters after Liverpool's Premier League loss at Fulham on Sunday afternoon. For the umpteenth time this season, quizzed about his future. On his occasion, he actually had an update.

""There is progress,"" Van Dijk said in response to a question about a possible contract extension. When asked if that meant he was saying beyond the end of the season, Van Dijk replied, ""I don't know, we'll see. Listen (laughs), these are internal discussions and we'll see.""

Van Dijk hadn't given away much, yet it still felt like a lot in the circumstances. Liverpool supporters have been kept completely in the dark throughout the club's ongoing contract talks with not only Van Dijk, but also Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold. So, the mere mention of the word ""progress"" came as a massive boost to an increasingly anxious fanbase - particularly as it came after a bitterly frustrating defeat.

However, the fact that Van Dijk had contributed to a dreadful defensive display at Craven Cottage prompted some pundits to question whether giving the 33-year-old a bumper new deal would really be a good idea. After all, Fulham wasn't the first time Van Dijk had looked vulnerable during Liverpool's first real wobble of the 2024-25 campaign...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The ATP Tour and WTA Tour schedules have marched into the clay season, having breezed through a busy hard-court spell.

Alex de Minaur is shining on clay, having just secured a double bagel win over Grigor Dimitrov at the Monte Carlo Masters.

The ATP Masters 1000 tournament is now into its latter stages, with the WTA now preparing for the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix.

Madrid is arriving shortly in the calendar, with the men's and women's stars then set to turn their focus to the French Open.

Casper Ruud has been tipped to win the French Open, with the Norwegian having impressed on clay throughout his career.

He did, however, suffer a shock loss to Alexei Popyrin in the round of 16 of the Monte Carlo Masters this week.

And that is a tournament that has really impressed former professional John Isner, who said on the Nothing Major Show: “Great tournament.

“It's one of the marquee events on the ATP Tour. We talked about being jealous of not having a tournament in Charleston.

“I think the WTA would love to have a tournament in Monte Carlo. A lot of tennis players on the men's and women's side live there for tax reasons as we know.

“The guys train there in the offseason before they go to Australia because the weather can be quite warm in December. They have this big tournament there right now. So huge event.”

The Monte Carlo Masters really kickstarts the ATP Masters 1000 clay season, representing one of three such events.

It is followed by the Madrid Open and the Rome Open, with the latter perhaps set to steal the limelight this season.

That is because it is very likely to represent the first tournament back for Jannik Sinner, who is currently serving a doping ban.

But fans and indeed the players still involved in the Monte Carlo Masters are fully focused on that event, with the action taking place amid a stunning backdrop.

And the tournament also boasts an iconic history in terms of its champions, with King of Clay Rafael Nadal fittingly boasting a record 11 titles.

And history will now be made in Monaco, with the Monte Carlo Country Club to welcome a new champion this year, with Carlos Alcaraz, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Alex de Minaur and Lorenzo Musetti having all now reached the semi-finals.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Organisers of the Monte-Carlo Masters have been forced to reschedule Sunday's final to avoid a washout. Rainy weather threatened to wreak havoc on the singles championship match, and the tournament has now moved the start time forward by three hours.

The Monte-Carlo Masters issued a statement after making the late decision on Friday evening. The doubles tie will now take place after the singles, with the tournament already guaranteed a first-time champion.

There were fears that the Monte-Carlo final could be heavily delayed and postponed to Monday when the forecast showed rain throughout Sunday afternoon.

But tournament bosses have tried to get ahead of the curve, making the drastic decision to reschedule the men's singles final to 12pm local time (11am BST) after it was initially slated to begin at 3pm local.

Organisers shared a statement on their social media accounts and official app on Friday once the quarter-finals had been completed, confirming they had consulted the ATP before changing the order of play.

“Due to the weather forecast for Sunday, in consultation with ATP officials, the tournament organisers have decided to schedule the singles final at 12pm on Court Rainier III in order to give the best opportunity to successfully complete this incredible 2025 edition,” it read.

“The doubles final is now scheduled to start after the singles final.”

The tournament is set to crown a new first-time champion, with Carlos Alcaraz, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Alex de Minaur, and Lorenzo Musetti through to the semis.

Last year's winner, Stefanos Tsitsipas, who also lifted the trophy in 2021 and 2022, was dumped out by Musetti in the last quarter-final on Friday.

Of the last four, only Davidovich Fokina has previously made it to the championship match in Monte-Carlo, finishing runner-up in 2022. Alcaraz is the only man who has any titles at Masters 1000 level.

With the singles semi-finals starting at 1pm local time on Saturday, players will have less than 24 hours to recover in time for the rescheduled winner-take-all contest.

The organisers' decision to rejig Sunday's line-up comes after rain severely delayed the latest Masters 1000 final at the Miami Open. Two weeks ago, Novak Djokovic and Jakub Mensik took to the court more than five hours later than planned after play was suspended.

Monte-Carlo Masters officials will be hoping they can complete the singles and doubles matches on Sunday, avoiding carrying over any play to Monday.

All four of the singles semi-finalists are set to compete in the ATP 500 in Barcelona next week, and will want to get straight to their next tournament without any delays.

Veteran player Reilly Opelka said the ATP chairman sent a player to threaten him financially over adding his name to a lawsuit that seeks to reshape tennis.

Last month, a group of tennis players sued the ATP and WTA in New York, London, and Brussels, accusing the tennis “cartel” of suppressing player wages, disregarding player health, and a wide range of antitrust violations.

That group, the Professional Tennis Players Association, recently alleged that the ATP is coercing players to rebuke the lawsuit. The PTPA's motion to gag the ATP from discussing the lawsuit with players was heard over an explosive three hours in a lower Manhattan federal courtroom Friday.

Veteran tennis player Reilly Opelka testified that ATP Tour chairman Andrea Gaudenzi sent an unnamed player to warn him that if he didn't take his name off the lawsuit, Opelka would lose his pension and be bogged down with millions of dollars in legal fees. 

Opelka called into the courtroom from Barcelona, where he's set to play in a tournament next week.

The ATP denies his allegation.  Board member Luben Pampoulov said Opelka's account was untrue, and the ATP participated in Friday's hearing while objecting that the story is “hearsay.” Judge Margaret Garnett overruled the tour's lawyers.

The PTPA filed the case on March 18, and the next day Pampoulov testified he asked players at the Miami Open to sign a statement disavowing the lawsuit; he says the ATP stopped circulating it when the gag motion was filed. The only player who Pampoulov named who signed it is Ben Shelton.

Opelka testified that he was on an exercise bike March 18 in the Miami Open locker room when a member of the Players Council got on to the one next to him. Nine players sit on the council; Opelka said he would not name the player because he feared ATP retribution. According to Opelka, the unnamed player aid Gaudenzi had instructed him at a Players Council meeting that day to warn Opelka he risked losing his pension and being burdened with legal fees. 

Opelka testified he had two other conversations with this player.

Pampoulov testified he was in the meeting room and denied Gaudenzi made the remarks. In fact, Gaudenzi ceded the stage and let ATP staff talk about the lawsuit, the board member said.

The ATP emphasized that few players have publicly supported the lawsuit, with tour lawyer Brad Ruskin calling it a “sophisticated PR campaign.” Vasek Pospisil, one of 12 tennis players who put their name on the suit, said that he spoke with 150 players who largely supported the litigation; he had earlier said that 300 players supported the suit. 

Pospisil, who appeared in the courtroom, said players feared retribution from the powerful tour.

Notably, PTPA co-founder Novak Djokovic did not put his name on the lawsuit, and in Miami last month said there were parts of it he did not support.  Asked about this, Pospisil admitted Djokovic's words were confusing. “I was surprised,” he said. “I don't know why he said that…it was not in line with our previous conversations.”

ATP lawyers also asked Pospisil about Carlos Alcaraz saying he had never been approached by the PTPA and knew nothing about the lawsuit until it was filed. Pospisil expressed regret, saying he passed over Alcaraz because of his youth. “I didn't want to distract him,” Pospisil said. Shortly after Alcaraz's comments, Pospisil texted him, and the Spaniard responded. “He replied enthusiastically and said he would love to know more about it,” Pospisil said.

The ATP's bylaws require members who sue the tour and lose to pay its legal fees.  According to locker room talk, the ATP is prepared to spend $50 million to $100 million defending the case, Pospisil said. The ATP's Pampoulov did not deny the bylaw, but was not asked about the number the PTPA's side cited several times Friday. 

There is clearly no love lost between the ATP and PTPA. ATP counsel Ruskin said the PTPA, which formed in 2020, had “self-anointed” itself representative of the players when in fact the players were in an equal partnership with tournaments in the ATP. The PTPA “undermines” the ATP, Ruskin said. 

Another ATP lawyer brought up Pospisil's 2021 on-court rant against Gaudenzi at the Miami Open. PTPA counsel Jim Quinn told Front Office Sports that the ATP has filed exhibits that includes dozens of images of PTPA members smashing rackets and the like.

The case is still in its very early stages, with initial reply from the defendants not due until May 20. Garnett, the judge, gave both sides a week to file new briefs on the motion to gag the ATP. She said she would rule shortly after.

Carlos Alcaraz and Lorenzo Musetti are set for an intriguing Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters final, which will take place Sunday at 12 p.m. local time.

The Spaniard leads Musetti 3-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The Italian won their first tour-level clash in a thrilling final at the ATP 500 in Hamburg in 2022, but Alcaraz has claimed their past three encounters.



Both players are aiming for their first Monte-Carlo trophy. Musetti, a first-time Masters 1000 finalist, would crack the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings should he triumph.

The championship match is starting three hours earlier than originally scheduled, due to a threat of heavy rain. Sunday's doubles final will take place after the singles final.

Stefanos Tsitsipas, the rising star of tennis, is about to make a strategic move that could shake the tennis world to its core. Rumors are swirling that Tsitsipas is on the brink of enlisting the expertise of none other than Novak Djokovic's former coach, Goran Ivanisevic, into his coaching team after the conclusion of Roland Garros.

Ivanisevic, known for his successful partnership with Djokovic that led to the Serbian player clinching nine out of his 24 Grand Slam titles, is now set to bring his wealth of experience and knowledge to guide the 26-year-old Tsitsipas. This potential collaboration has sent shockwaves through the tennis community, sparking high expectations for Tsitsipas under the mentorship of the seasoned 53-year-old coach.

Tsitsipas, who is currently competing in Monte Carlo, has been showcasing his talent and determination, aiming to secure his fourth tournament title. Having triumphed in the Dubai Open earlier this season, Tsitsipas is eager to continue his winning streak with the support of Ivanisevic by his side.

The Greek tennis sensation's decision to part ways with his father as his coach last year signified a new chapter in his career, paving the way for fresh opportunities and strategic partnerships. Tsitsipas' prowess on the court has been evident as he overcame challenges in Monte Carlo, setting up a thrilling quarterfinal showdown with Lorenzo Musetti.

Furthermore, Ivanisevic's insights into Djokovic's meticulous approach to the game shed light on the Serbian player's unparalleled skills and dedication. The coach's observations on Djokovic's ability to maintain a high level of play even after extended breaks underscore the unique talent and work ethic of the 22-time Grand Slam champion.

As Djokovic navigates through a season marked by ups and downs, including unexpected defeats and missed opportunities, the tennis world eagerly anticipates his next moves on the clay court. Despite facing setbacks in recent tournaments, Djokovic remains a formidable force in the tennis arena, with fans and analysts closely monitoring his performance leading up to the Madrid Open.

With Tsitsipas poised for a potential game-changing collaboration with Ivanisevic and Djokovic navigating the complexities of elite tennis competition, the sport is brimming with excitement and anticipation for the upcoming matches and tournaments. Stay tuned for more updates on the dynamic world of tennis as these top players continue to make headlines and push the boundaries of excellence on the court.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Reilly Opelka says there's an easy change that could transform tennis but Wimbledon would never allow, they 'would rather burn money'","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/reilly-opelka-says-theres-an-easy-change-that-could-transform-tennis-but-wimbledon-would-never-allow-they-would-rather-burn-money/","Sat, 12 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Reilly Opelka has just finished a busy hard-court spell on the ATP Tour, with last month's Miami Open his most recent tournament.

Opelka lost in the round of 32 to Tomas Machac, having previously lost his opener at Indian Wells to Roman Safiullin.

The American has been very vocal off the court alongside those displays on it, with Opelka reiterating his criticism of doubles players recently.

Taylor Fritz thinks Opelka is one of the best servers he has ever faced, with the latter having once reached 17th in the ATP Tour rankings.

The 27-year-old currently occupies 105th place, and has now shared his verdict on a key aspect of the current scene in men's tennis.

Discussing a change that he thinks could really transform tennis, Opelka said on the Nothing Major Show: “I would say the one clear fix is that we don't have a massive media rights deal.

“Of all the big sports we are the one that don't and it's because all the Grand Slams operate independently from one another.

“The easy answer which every single person would agree with is that if all the tournaments could aggregate as one and fall under one large entity we could do a massive media rights deal, just like other sports have.

“Then you can monetise off of that. We are the second most bet upon sport in the world. We would be able to sell this massive group deal to either Amazon or whoever would buy it, just like every other sport.

“That would change the structure of tennis. I think that would change a lot of things. The sport would evolve so much more.

“I think guys ranked 150 or 250 would be able to have a coach and a physio and the level would just start to increase.

“That is just never going to happen, as you know. Wimbledon would rather burn money than partner with the ATP.”

Returning this summer, Wimbledon is, of course, one of the most traditional tournaments not just in tennis but in global sports.

Predominantly white attire for players and court etiquette are among the rules that are strictly enforced at the All England Club.

Opelka may, however, one day have his wish granted by the powers that be at Wimbledon, who have shown in recent times that they are willing to sway from tradition.

For the first time in the 147-year history of the grass-court Grand Slam, line judges have been abolished, with human officials set to be replaced by artificial intelligence.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Emma Raducanu handed rankings chance that could lead to Wimbledon seeding","https://www.tennis365.com/news/emma-raducanu-ranking-seeding-wimbledon","Sat, 12 Apr 2025 13:35:54 GMT","

Emma Raducanu is preparing to kick-start her clay court campaign for 205 and she could have a new coach alongside her when she steps onto the red clay.

The 2021 US Open champion is scheduled to play at the Madrid Open later this month, with Mark Petchey rumoured to be weighing up an offer to take over as her coach.

Petchey worked briefly with Raducanu before her famous Grand Slam win in New York and he also stepped into her camp for the Miami Open, after she parted company with Vlado Platenik shortly before her opening match in the WTA 1000 tournament.

Petchey's influence certainly appeared to have a positive impact, with Raducanu playing her best tennis since her US Open win as she made it through to the quarter-finals in a run that included wins against top ten player Emma Navarro and recent WTA 1000 tournament winner Amanda Anisimova.

Now opportunity is about to knock for Raducanu, as she is entering a period of the season that gives her a huge chance to make a big rankings leap.

Emma Raducanu and Iga Swiatek decisions spark significant concern for historic competition

Emma Raducanu ‘made the right decision' after making a big schedule change

By the time she returns to action, Raducanu will have just 10 ranking point to defend over the rest of the clay court season.

If she plays at the Madrid Open and the Italian Open, that will offer her a chance to compete for 2,000 ranking points.

That same haul of points will be on offer at the French Open and any wins at Roland Garros will be extra points added to her current total as she failed to play at the second major of the year in 2024.

Raducanu would need to be in the top 32 of the WTA Rankings to be seeded for the French Open and she will not need to many wins on clay to make that happen.

A couple of victories in Madrid would propel her up towards the top 40 of the rankings and two more wins in Rome would take her close to that rankings goal.

If she could string together three wins in both events, she would be knocking on the door of a seeding for Roland Garros.

Raducanu's uncertainty on clay courts may make the ambition of being seeded for the French Open a little ambitious, but she could have a better chance of being among the seeds when she gets onto grass courts at Wimbledon.

Two or three wins at the French Open would give Raducanu a boost in her ranking and if she is among the top 32 seeds at the All England Club in July, she will be a threat to have a long run once again.

Raducanu has made it through to the last-16 at Wimbledon on two occasions and had a big chance to go further last year as she blew her chance to make it through to the quarter-finals with a disappointing defeat against Lulu Sun.

Raducanu struggled to kick on after that Wimbledon run last July, but the mood around her is very different after those sparkling wins in Miami.

If Petchey is added to Raducanu's team and she can steer clear of injuries over the next few weeks, there is every reason to believe a player who had been written off by too many of her critics could be a big contender on the WTA Tour in the second half of this year.

Emma Raducanu, the rising star of tennis, is gearing up for a monumental shift in her career trajectory as she embarks on her clay court campaign for 205. But that's not all – rumors are swirling about a potential coaching change that could catapult her to even greater heights.

The 2021 US Open champion is set to showcase her skills at the Madrid Open, with whispers suggesting that Mark Petchey might step in as her new coach. Petchey previously worked with Raducanu before her historic Grand Slam victory and made a cameo appearance in her camp during the Miami Open, where she delivered a stellar performance reaching the quarter-finals.

With just 10 ranking points to defend throughout the clay court season, Raducanu has a golden opportunity to ascend the rankings ladder. By participating in the Madrid Open and the Italian Open, she could potentially compete for a whopping 2,000 ranking points. The French Open also presents a chance for her to earn significant points and solidify her position in the top 32 of the WTA Rankings, securing a coveted seed for the prestigious tournament.

Although Raducanu's prowess on clay courts remains uncertain, her prospects on the grass courts of Wimbledon are undeniably promising. A strong showing at the French Open could pave the way for her to be among the top 32 seeds at Wimbledon, positioning her as a formidable force to be reckoned with in the upcoming season.

As speculations swirl and anticipation mounts, one thing is certain – Emma Raducanu is poised to shake up the WTA Tour and prove her critics wrong. With the right team and a clear path ahead, the young tennis sensation is on the brink of a breakthrough that could redefine her career and establish her as a major contender in the tennis world.

Stay tuned as Raducanu's journey unfolds, promising excitement, drama, and perhaps a few surprises along the way.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","US Open Mixed Doubles gets $1M boost and star power","https://tennishead.net/us-open-mixed-doubles-gets-1m-boost-and-star-power/","Sat, 12 Apr 2025 15:32:57 GMT","

Partnerships including Medvedev/Andreeva, De Minaur/Boulter, and Rublev/Muchová headline a bold new era for mixed doubles at the US Open this year. 

The 2025 US Open is turning heads with a dramatic revamp of its mixed doubles competition, featuring a $1 million prize for the winning pair, the richest purse in mixed doubles history. Played August 19–20 during qualifying week, the tournament will feature 16 teams and a condensed match format to encourage participation from top singles players. Confirmed pairings include Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev, Alex de Minaur and Katie Boulter, and Andrey Rublev and Karolína Muchova, giving the draw an immediate boost in star power and international intrigue.

In this new format, the first two rounds will be shortened: best-of-three sets to four games (no-ad scoring) with a 10-point match tiebreak in lieu of a third set. The final, however, will resemble more traditional play of sets to six games, still using no-ad scoring and a super tiebreak decider if needed. Matches will take place in Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong stadiums, offering a big stage for players and fans.

This change follows the success of 2024's “Mixed Madness” exhibition, where players like Coco Gauff and Nick Kyrgios helped ignite fan excitement around the format. The USTA hopes the $1M purse and pre-main draw schedule will ensure mixed doubles becomes a fan favorite, not a late-night afterthought. It also allows players with tight singles or doubles schedules to still participate without overloading their two-week commitments.

However, not everyone is on board. Reigning champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori have voiced concern over the format's entertainment-first approach, worried that it might marginalize doubles specialists. Others, like Ellen Perez and Jan Zielinski, have raised broader concerns about fairness and long-term implications for players who have built careers in the discipline.

Inside the Baseline…

Injecting energy into mixed doubles is long overdue, and the US Open's initiative to draw singles stars and raise the stakes is a bold step. With names like Medvedev, Boulter, and Muchova entering the draw, fan engagement will surely rise, but it's vital to ensure this evolution doesn't push out the doubles specialists who've carried the format for years. Mixed doubles deserves the spotlight, but not at the cost of its foundation.

In recent years, the intersection of traditional sporting events and emerging digital financial technologies has created new opportunities and partnerships across the athletic landscape. The prestigious tennis tournaments held in the United States, particularly the major championship in New York, have begun exploring the potential of blockchain-based currencies and technologies, marking a significant shift in how these historic sporting institutions approach financial innovation. The conversion rates from USD to BTC have become increasingly relevant conversation topics among tournament organizers as they consider the implications of accepting digital currencies for tickets, merchandise, and other purchases.

This evolution reflects broader trends across the sports industry, where digital assets have gradually moved from novel curiosities to legitimate business considerations. The tennis world, with its global audience and substantial commercial interests, represents fertile ground for these technologies to demonstrate their utility beyond speculative investment. Tournament organizers recognize the potential for blockchain applications to enhance operational efficiency while creating new revenue streams and fan engagement opportunities.

The adoption process has been methodical rather than revolutionary. Tournament organizers have approached these new technologies with appropriate caution, implementing them in controlled ways that complement rather than replace established financial systems. Initial forays have focused on areas like digital collectibles, enhanced fan experiences, and streamlined payment options for attendees and viewers.

For spectators attending major tennis events, the presence of digital currency options has begun changing how they experience tournaments. From purchasing merchandise to upgrading seats, these new payment rails offer alternatives to traditional transaction methods. The technology behind these currencies enables faster settlement times and potentially reduces fees associated with cross-border payments—a meaningful benefit for international sporting events that attract global audiences.

The tournament experience itself is evolving through blockchain applications beyond simple payment mechanisms. Digital collectibles celebrating memorable moments from matches offer fans new ways to connect with the sport's history and their favorite tournaments. Unlike physical memorabilia, these digital assets can contain embedded media, interactive elements, and verifiable authenticity—features particularly appealing to younger tennis enthusiasts who have grown up in a digital-first world.

Behind the scenes, tournament operations have also begun incorporating these technologies. Ticketing systems enhanced with blockchain verification help reduce counterfeiting while creating more transparent secondary markets. Digital tokens have been explored as vehicles for loyalty programs, rewarding regular attendees with benefits ranging from exclusive content to priority access for future events.

The professional players themselves have shown varying degrees of interest in these technological developments. Some have embraced digital currencies as personal investments or brand extension opportunities, while others maintain a more traditional approach to their financial affairs. The generation gap is sometimes apparent, with younger competitors generally demonstrating greater comfort in exploring these new financial territories.

Tournament sponsors have taken notice of this technological shift as well. Companies operating in the digital currency space have begun appearing alongside more traditional sponsors, reflecting their growing mainstream acceptance and desire to associate with premium sporting events. These new commercial relationships bring fresh capital into the sport while exposing traditional tennis audiences to emerging financial concepts.

Regulatory considerations remain an important factor in how extensively these technologies can be integrated into major sporting events. Tournament organizers must navigate complex and evolving regulatory frameworks that vary significantly across jurisdictions. This regulatory uncertainty has encouraged a measured approach to adoption, with organizations carefully assessing compliance requirements before implementing new initiatives.

The environmental considerations associated with certain digital currencies have also influenced implementation decisions. Tennis tournaments, particularly those with established environmental commitments, have generally favored technologies with lower energy requirements. This preference aligns with broader sustainability goals that many sporting events have adopted in response to climate concerns.

Educational initiatives have emerged alongside these commercial developments. Some tournaments have introduced informational resources to help attendees understand the basics of digital currencies and blockchain technology. These efforts recognize that many tennis fans may be encountering these concepts for the first time within the context of their favorite sport.

Looking forward, the relationship between major tennis tournaments and digital financial technologies appears poised for continued development. The complementary needs of these sporting events—seeking innovation and new revenue streams—and blockchain applications looking for mainstream use cases suggest further integration is likely. However, this evolution will likely maintain its measured pace, with each new implementation carefully assessed for its practical benefits and alignment with tournament traditions.

The global nature of tennis, with its international player base and worldwide audience, makes it particularly well-suited for technologies designed to operate across borders. As digital currencies continue maturing beyond their initial speculative phase, their utility for international sporting events may become increasingly apparent.

While skeptics remain, pointing to the volatility and technical complexity of many blockchain systems, proponents see significant untapped potential. They envision futures where these technologies could fundamentally transform aspects of how tennis tournaments operate, from prize money distribution to broadcasting rights management.

As major tennis tournaments continue their careful exploration of digital financial technologies, we're witnessing the early stages of what could become a significant transformation in how these sporting events operate and engage with fans. The integration of blockchain-based solutions offers promising opportunities to enhance tournament experiences, streamline operations, and create new forms of connection between the sport and its global audience.

What remains clear is that major tennis tournaments are approaching this technological frontier thoughtfully, balancing innovation with their responsibilities as stewards of a beloved sport. While the full impact of these technologies on tennis may take years to materialize fully, the initial steps taken by tournament organizers suggest a recognition that digital currencies and blockchain applications will play an increasingly important role in the future of this storied sport.

As fans return to the stands of major tournaments each year, they participate in a sporting tradition that honors its rich history while embracing technological innovations that may reshape how we experience, interact with, and support the game for generations to come.

Oscar Piastri made it a clean sweep of fastest times in all three practice sessions for McLaren ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix this weekend, besting team mate Lando Norris by 0.668s.

The Australian went fastest at the Bahrain International Circuit during Free Practice 3, posting a 1m 31.646s after using Pirelli's soft compound tyre approaching inside the final 10 minutes.

His session best was more than a second slower than what he managed in the cooler, more representative conditions of FP2 on Friday evening, and which Qualifying will be held later on Saturday.

Norris, who topped FP1, could only finish second after the current Drivers' Championship leader ran wide at Turn 11 on his new set of soft tyres before setting his personal best at the second time of asking.

Best of the rest was Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, 0.834s behind Piastri's benchmark, while George Russell was more than a second in arrears in fourth having suffered a small, harmless spin exiting Turn 10. Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli was less than one tenth further back as Pierre Gasly continued his impressive practice performance for Alpine to complete the top six.

AS IT HAPPENED: Follow the action from Qualifying for the Bahrain GP as Piastri takes pole

HIGHLIGHTS: Catch the FP3 action from Bahrain as Piastri completes McLaren's practice clean sweep

Oscar Piastri set the pace during the third and final practice session for the Bahrain Grand Prix, the Australian leading the way by a stunning margin of more than half a second from Lando Norris while Charles Leclerc took third.

Amid another day of hot and sunny conditions in Sakhir – with air temperatures reaching 33 degrees Celsius – the drivers returned to action at 1530 local time for a last opportunity to fine-tune their cars and prepare for Qualifying, which will take place later on Saturday.

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Are McLaren really on 'another planet' in the Bahrain desert?

It was a quiet start when the green light was displayed, with just Ollie Bearman initially taking to the track for Haas on the hard tyre while the likes of Norris and Max Verstappen were seen chatting to members of their respective teams in the pit lane.

Bearman and team mate Esteban Ocon were soon joined on the circuit by the Ferraris of Lewis Hamilton and Leclerc, both sporting the soft compound. And with Bearman reporting that the difference in grip from the day and night sessions was “crazy”, it appeared that the tricky conditions experienced in Friday's FP1 were again at play.

Practice 3 results

While most of the pack opted for the soft or hard tyre for their opening runs, Alpine bucked the trend by choosing the medium. But it was Piastri who had set the pace on a soft-shod run by the halfway point of the session, the McLaren man going quickest on a lap of 1m 33.324s to put him four-tenths clear of team mate Norris with Fernando Alonso third for Aston Martin.

Verstappen, meanwhile, aborted his flying run after going wide and returned to the pits for some set-up changes to his Red Bull, while George Russell joined the action with 30 minutes left on the clock, the Briton having seemingly been content to wait for slightly cooler conditions to arrive.

HIGHLIGHTS: Relive the action from FP2 in Bahrain as Piastri sets the pace from Norris

There was trouble for Nico Hulkenberg as the German was forced to stop his Kick Sauber at Turn 8 after going into anti-stall, triggering the yellow flags before a brief Virtual Safety Car was called. As the green flags were thrown and the action picked up, Verstappen moved up to second despite another slightly wide moment out on track.

An unusual problem hit Leclerc as one of the Monegasque's wing mirrors was seen flying off his Ferrari. Liam Lawson, meanwhile, was unhappy at being overtaken by Russell, the Racing Bulls driver telling his engineer that the move was “so annoying”.

Speaking of Russell, the Briton brought out the yellow flags for a moment following a spin at Turn 10 before going on to declare that the conditions offered the “least amount of grip” he had ever experienced in an F1 car.

As the clock ticked down, attentions turned to flying runs and a flurry of quick times saw the order on the timesheets rapidly evolve. When this had shaken out, Piastri had set an impressive benchmark of 1m 31.646s – and while others tried to challenge, team mate Norris was still 0.668s back as the closest rival in second.

Leclerc took the accolade of being the only other car within a second of Piastri in third, with Russell and Kimi Antonelli further off for Mercedes in fourth and fifth respectively. Pierre Gasly was an eye-catching sixth for Alpine, while Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar, Verstappen, Williams' Carlos Sainz and Hamilton completed the top 10.

Josep Maria Marti made a final lap pass to take an incredible Sprint Race victory for Campos Racing, fighting through from 11th on the grid.

The Red Bull Junior Team driver battled with several drivers in the middle phase of the race, but a Safety Car closed the pack up for an unpredictable and enthralling final few minutes.

Three different drivers led at various points in the last five laps, but it was a dive into Turn 1 by Martí on Joshua Duerksen that proved to be the race-winning move, earning him his first win of 2025.

Richard Verschoor made a last lap overtake of his own as Duerksen ran slightly wide at Turn 11, opening the door for the MP Motorsport driver to claim second just a few corners from the chequered flag. The AIX Racing driver had to settle for third position in the end after leading the early laps comfortably.

Having led at the Safety Car restart, Dino Beganovic came across the line in fourth position for Hitech TGR, narrowly ahead of a resurgent Oliver Goethe, who made it two MPs in the top five with his own stellar performance.

The Red Bull junior pitted for fresh Soft tyres at the final Safety Car, rejoining 15th for the restart. He climbed through the order to earn an unlikely top five, a three-wide pass at Turn 12 the stand-out moment of his charge.

 Billie Joe Armstrong already came out for The Go-Go's, while Troye Sivan is slated to join Charli xcx on stage later this weekend, sources say. 



		By Nicole Fell, Ethan Millman

	As is the yearly tradition, hoards of music lovers traveled from near and far this weekend to the 2025 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the desert in Indio California, the unofficial kick off to the year's festival season. 


	As one of the biggest music festivals on in the country, Coachella draws viral performances each year as artists often bring out special guests to their sets to help them meet the moment. 2025 will be no exception, and we'll be compiling all those performances here. So far, The Go-Go's have already brought out Billie Joe Armstrong, Benson Boone sang “Bohemian Rhapsody” with Queen's Brian May on guitar, and Three 6 Mafia brought out Project Pat, Travis Barker, Machine Gun Kelly and Wiz Khalifa.


	Many more collaborations are expected throughout the weekend. Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that Troye Sivan will join his Sweat Tour co-headliner Charli xcx during her Saturday night set, while Maren Morris is expected to come out for Zedd's set.


	Lady Gaga, Travis Scott, Green Day and Post Malone are among the headliners of the weekend. Missy Elliott, Tyla, Lisa, GloRilla, Lola Young, Ed Sheeran, Weezer, T-Pain, Eli Brown, The Original Misfits, Jimmy Eat World, Rawayana, Clairo, Zedd, Megan Thee Stallion, Shaboozey, Jennie, Enhypen, Ty Dolla $ign, Muni Long and beabadoobee are also on the lineup for the two-weekend festival.


	Below is a list of some of the weekend's biggest surprise guests, and some of what's to come. Be sure to check back for more throughout the weekend. 


	Billie Joe Armstrong joined The Go-Go's during their Friday evening set at the Outdoor Theatre stage to perform “Head Over Heels.” Armstrong teased a potential collaboration earlier Friday before confirming he'd be joining the legendary band just before their set started.

	Project Pat, Travis Barker, Machine Gun Kelly and Wiz Khalifa joined Three 6 Mafia's Friday evening set. The hip hop group had promised a few surprises, and Barker's appearance was previously teased before the set.


	The “Beautiful Things” singer Benson Boone brought out legendary guitarist Brian May to perform  Queen's iconic song, “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which included a nod to the late Freddie Mercury. 


	“Gonna treasure this moment on the plane with Benson Boone – a truly golden 22-year-old prodigy,” May posted on his Instagram earlier Friday. “I'm proud and happy to say we are now officially pals.”


	Sources tell THR that Troye Sivan is planning to join Charli xcx's Saturday night Coachella stage set. The move wouldn't too unexpected as the pair recently went on their co-headlining Sweat arena tour last year.


	Maren Morris is expected to join Zedd's Sunday night set, a source tells THR. The pair have collaborated together in the past on the hit song, “The Middle,” and they performed at Coachella together back in 2019 as well.

The ‘Saturday Night Live' star shared the ultimatum his parents gave him as a teenager in a preview for NBC's 'Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist.'


							By 

	Nicole Fell



Saturday Night Live star Bowen Yang is opening up about the “painful and detrimental” experience of going to conversion therapy.


In a preview for NBC's Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist, Yang and the Sunday Today host discussed how The Wedding Banquet actor was put into gay conversion therapy by his parents when he was a teenager. “I ‘came out' in a sense that my parents just sort of stumbled upon something, and they were like ‘Oh, we didn't realize this is what we were dealing with,'” Yang told Willie Geist in the video preview.

	Yang said his parents didn't know how to handle the situation. “I give them a lot of grace for that because they just had no context for it,” he said.

	The comedian and actor explained that he was given an ultimatum by his parents that if he went to  conversion therapy, he could then go to New York University and live with his older sister. “Those poor people did not realize that that's one of the gayest schools in the country,” Yang joked, adding that the only way he could leave Denver was if he went to conversion therapy. 


	“I kind of played along, and I kind of just humored them and myself into seeing what it was,” the Las Culturistas podcast host said. Wang said at the time he didn't realize how painful the situation would be, but that he's had a large amount of healing since then.


	Yang has opened about his experience multiple times in the past. The podcaster recently spoke about it with his co-host Matt Rogers and guest Lady Gaga after explaining how important the latter's music was in his own queer identity journey. “I think I had come out of the closet again when ‘Born This Way' came out because I went to conversion therapy, obviously did not work out,” he said on the podcast. 


	Yang's full Sunday Sitdown episode is expected to air on April 13.

On 'Real Time,' the host said he learned ""a crazy person doesn't live in the White House,"" however, ""a person who plays a crazy person on TV a lot lives there, which I know is f***ed up. It's just not as f***ed up as I thought it was.""


							By

Associate Editor


Bill Maher said “you can hate” him for his new perspective on President Donald Trump following their meeting at the White House, but that he's “not a liar.” 


	On the latest episode of HBO's Real Time, the host and longtime foe of the president took some time to recall his recent visit with Trump and Kid Rock. Following his trip, Maher came to the conclusion that Trump was actually “gracious and measured,” and not like the “person who plays a crazy person on TV.”




	“Let me first say that to all the people who treated this like it was some kind of summit meeting, you're ridiculous. Like I was gonna sign a treaty or something. I have no power,” Maher began. “I'm a fucking comedian and he's the most powerful leader in the world. I'm not the leader of anything, except maybe a contingent of centrist-minded people who think there's got to be a better way of running this country than hating each other every minute.”

	The comedian then noted that he had his staff “collect and print out this list of almost 60 different insulting epithets that the president has said about me,” so that Trump could sign it, which he did “with good humor.”


	The host said he's going to “report exactly what happened” during his White House visit with the president and that “you decide what you think about it, and if that's not enough pure Trump hate for you, I don't give a fuck.”


	After noting that the president gave him several MAGA hats, he continued, “The guy I met is not the person who the night before the dinner shit tweeted a bunch of nasty crap about how he thought this was a bad idea and what a deranged asshole I was. I read it and thought, ‘Oh, what a lovely way to welcome someone to your house.' But when I got there, that guy wasn't living there.”


	As an example, a seemingly surprised Maher said that Trump laughs. “I've never seen him laugh in public, but he does, including at himself, and it's not fake. Believe me, as a comedian of 40 years, I know a fake laugh when I hear it,” he said.


	The host also recalled “walking through an amazing tour of the whole house, and I don't remember exactly what we were talking about, but it must have been something with the 2020 election because I know he used the word lost, and I distinctly remember saying, ‘Wow, I never thought I'd hear you say that.' He didn't get mad. He's much more self-aware than he lets on in public.”

	











	“I've had so many conversations with prominent people who are much less connected, people who don't look you in the eye, people who don't really listen because they just want to get to their next thing, people whose responses to things you say just doesn't track,” Maher continued. “None of that was him. And he mostly steered the conversation to, ‘What do you think about this?' I know your mind is blown, so is mine.”


	The comedian added, “There were so many moments when I hit him with a joke or contradicted something and no problem.”


	Maher said at one point he even corrected the president when “he tweeted the night before that I was critical of all things Trump.”


	“Not true. Check the tapes,” the host explained. “Moving Israel's embassy to Jerusalem, loved it. The border did need to be controlled. I'm glad the cops are getting their morale back. DEI had gone too far. Biological men shouldn't be playing women's sports. Europe should pay for their defense, and of course, it makes sense that Arab countries should take in Arab refugees like the millions of Syrians who wound up in Germany when Saudi Arabia took none.”


	Maher noted how he “never felt I had to walk on eggshells around” Trump during his visit, adding, “Honestly, I voted for [Bill] Clinton and [Barack] Obama, but I would never feel comfortable talking to them the way I was able to talk with Donald Trump. That's just how it went down, make of it what you will.”


	He said the “most surreal part of the whole night” was when he got back home and turned on 60 Minutes from the night before. “There's Trump in one of their stories, standing at a podium in a room that looked to me like one of the rooms we'd just been in, and he's ranting, ‘Disgusting. You're a terrible person,' and I'm like, ‘Who's that guy? What happened to Glinda the Good Witch? And why can't we get the guy I met to be the public guy?'”

	











	Maher emphasized that he was “just reporting exactly what I saw over 2.5 hours” and learned “a crazy person doesn't live in the White House.” However, he said, “A person who plays a crazy person on TV a lot lives there, which I know is fucked up. It's just not as fucked up as I thought it was.”


	The comedian noted he's still going to be “critical about a lot of what he's doing,” but that his perspective on Trump did change post-visit.


	“You can hate me for it, but I'm not a liar,” Maher said. “Trump was gracious and measured and why he isn't that in other settings, I don't know and I can't answer, and it's not my place to answer. I'm just telling you what I saw and I wasn't high.”


	He added, “So MAGA fans, don't worry, your boy gave me nothing, just hats and a very generous amount of time and a willingness to listen, accept me as a possible friend, even though I'm not MAGA, which was the point of the dinner.”

The superstar headlined the festival's first night, leaning heavily on Mayhem material and leaving fans with much to dissect.


													By
												

	Lyndsey Havens



	Almost a decade ago, in 2017, Lady Gaga headlined Coachella — but not on purpose. The superstar stepped in to replace Beyoncé, who had then just revealed her pregnancy to the public. Beyoncé returned to headline the festival in 2018 but tonight, on the first night of Coachella 2025, it was Gaga's turn. And this time, everything was intentional.


	On Friday (April 11), Gaga celebrated “Mayhem In the Desert” — as her own on-site merchandise pop-up teased — with a spellbinding and ominous set. Titled “The Art Of Personal Chaos,” the two-hour show may have been disguised as a concert, but what took place was nothing short of a carefully crafted commentary on fame and performance — and the toll of keeping both up.Or, as two Gagas from different eras said on screens bookending the stage, staring at one another but speaking to the masses: “This is the manifesto of mayhem.” 

	











	It's a fitting concept for a headlining show that follows an album of the same name; Gaga's Mayhem arrived in March and debuted atop the Billboard 200. And for an artist like Lady Gaga, it's a concept that is rich in inspiration. It seems she was so inspired, in fact, that the only way to clearly organize and present her ideas was through five distinct acts, including an anticipated finale — but all seamlessly woven together thanks to stunning and challenging choreography from Parris Goebel. And, of course, Gaga's catalog. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Her set naturally leaned heavy on new material, especially since her Coachella gigs across the festival's two weekends unofficially kick-off her upcoming The Mayhem Ball tour. But the way in which Gaga reimagined or perhaps recontextualized some of her older hits made them feel impressively fresh and forced fans to reexamine the idea of fame – all the while spotlighting Gaga's genius. 


	Fame is a concept that has long fascinated the artist — hell, she named her debut album The Fame. And it featured breakout hit “Paparazzi.” It doesn't get more on-the-nose than that. While Mayhem dives back into the familiar subject, it does so in an unfamiliar fashion by bringing a gritty and industrial edge to Gaga's electro-pop. 


	That sonic universe came to life on Coachella's main stage, with an expansive set design that depicted an opera house — though it looked just as much like a medieval castle hosting a demonic rave (feeding into another of Gaga's taglines for the weekend: “Dance or die”). 


	The entire performance felt like a living, breathing entity — in large part because Gaga wore a headset, which captured each and every controlled breath she took. But also because of the storyline, which across its five acts revisited various Lady Gagas of the past — all of whom, as the show proved, are still very much alive in Gaga despite being dormant. Or, in the case of this performance, despite being left for dead.

	











	In Act 1: Velvet and Vice, fans are greeted by present-day Gaga wearing a black bob. And yet, she opens with “Bloody Mary,” a song off 2011's Born This Way. The rest of the act continued to balance old and new, sandwiching “Judas” between Mayhem tracks “Abracadabra” and “Garden of Eden” before ending with The Fame standout “Poker Face.” For the lattermost's performance, Gaga simulated a high-stakes chess game — one that felt reminiscent of the infamous Wizard's Chess scene from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Only here, Gaga is playing against herself — and it's present-day Gaga who prevails. 


	After declaring, “off with her head,” to a fallen blonde Gaga of decades past, her vision for this show snaps into focus as the acts that follow examine the darker sides of fame. In Act 2: And She Fell Into a Gothic Dream, the slain blonde Gaga is seen buried among skeletons — only she's very much alive. Both she and the corpses next to her slowly come alive — including another past Gaga, this one from 2009 wearing a red lace bodysuit reminiscent of the one she wore to the Video Music Awards that year. 


Act 2 fittingly opens with “Perfect Celebrity,” which is followed by “Disease” and a stunning, stripped-back rendition of “Paparazzi” that serves as the emotional arch of the entire set — sensing the theme? “Sometimes I feel like I went into a dream when I was 20 years old… and I didn't know if I wanted to wake up, because what if you weren't there?” Gaga asked of her fans, still as her blonde self.


	Her question begged another: Is fame the byproduct of a co-dependent relationship between artist and fan?

	











	Enter Act 3: The Beautiful Nightmare That Knows Her Name. Accompanied by Mayhem collaborator Gesaffelstein, Gaga ripped into “Killah” and “Zombieboy,” tossing in a condensed “Die With a Smile” (her chart-topping collaboration with Bruno Mars) before returning to more recent releases with “How Bad Do U Want Me.” In Act 4: To Wake Her Is To Lose Her, Gaga returns to her new form, black bob and all.


	Before performing the lively “Born This Way” — which felt like it could be the finale, complete with a firework display — Gaga told the crowd: “You are who you choose to be, you always will be.” And as Gaga showed all night long, each and every version of herself got here where she stands today — they are all her. And they always will be. But that doesn't mean she chooses them any more.


	As a parting gift, for a set that prioritzed new music and storytelling over the hits, Gaga performed the soaring “Shallow” alone at the piano, positioned at the end of the stage's runway. As she surveyed the packed field, she mused, “As far as I can see, there's people everywhere….I hope one day I'll just vanish right into you.” She then performed “Vanish Into You” while walking alongside fans pressed against the barricades, stopping to hold hands and even sing into their faces as she made her way back to the stage. And true to her word, she soon after disappeared. 


	Minutes passed and the stage lights remained dim – but on. As some attendees started to peel off, the majority remained firmly planted, trusting Mother Monster wouldn't leave them like that. Sure enough, after five minutes it was time for the final act: Finale: Eternal Aria Of the Monster Heart. 


	“We are monsters – and monsters never die,” said Gaga, before ending with an extended version of “Bad Romance.” And after the last two hours of such high-value, intentional performance art, the song took on new meaning. “I want your love,” sang Gaga, as she had so many times before. Only tonight, it felt like a direct plea to her fans. “You know that I want you, you know that I need you,” she continued.

	











	And while at times fame, and all that comes with it, may feel like Gaga is stuck in a bad love story, tonight she made it her own. Tonight, she delivered a poignant and entertaining take on what it means to be a superstar — and did so while further solidifying her own role as one of the biggest.

	Congratulations are in order — and overdue — for Mick Jagger and his longtime parter Melanie Hamrick, who are engaged.


	Hamrick confirmed the news to Paris Match, revealing that the Rolling Stones frontman has been her fiancé for “two or three years.” On the topic of marriage, she shared, “Maybe one day we'll marry, maybe not. We are so happy in our current life that I would be too afraid to change anything.” 


	Jagger and Hamrick, a former ballerina and choreographer at American Ballet Theatre, have been together since 2014. She says their love was a slow burn, as Jagger was still dating the late model L'Wren Scott when they met in Japan, where the Stones and the American Ballet Theatre were both touring at the time. “We didn't even exchange phone numbers,” she recalled. “At the time, I wasn't in a relationship, but he was.”

While many music stocks rebounded after the U.S. Treasury paused tariffs for 90 days, only Live Nation has posted a gain over the last two chaotic weeks.

	Glenn Peoples



Led by Spotify and Live Nation, music stocks surged on Wednesday (April 9) after the U.S. Treasury placed a 90-day pause on most tariffs and recaptured some of the losses from the chaotic previous week. 


	A week after losing $12 billion in market value, Spotify was one of the top-performing music stocks of the week, gaining 8.0% and offsetting most of the previous week's 10.3% decline. A 9.8% gain on Wednesday helped improve the streaming company's two-week loss to 3.1%. 


	The 20-company Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) gained 4.6% to 2,362.78 on Wednesday's 90-day tariff pause. That welcome news recaptured only a fraction of the previous week's losses, however, and music stocks were hurt by a weakened U.S. dollar and growing fears the U.S. could slip into a recession. After losing 8.2% in the previous week, the index's two-week loss stands at 4.0%. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	U.S. markets rebounded after a miserable week. The Nasdaq rose 7.3% to 16,724.46, bringing its two-week loss to 3.5%. The S&P 500 rose 5.7% to 5,363.36, giving it a two-week decline of 3.9%. 


	Many markets outside of the U.S. were down, however. In the U.K., the FTSE 100 dropped 1.1%, giving it a two-week loss of 8.0%. South Korea's KOSPI composite index was down 1.3%, adding to the previous week's 3.6% decline. China's SSE Composite Index dipped 3.1% a week after falling 0.3%. 


	Music streamer LiveOne was the week's biggest gainer after jumping 18.0% to $0.72. The company's preliminary results for fiscal 2025 released on Monday (April 7) showed the music streaming company had revenue of more than $112 million, while subscribers and ad-supported listeners surpassed 1.45 million. Even after the large increase, LiveOne shares have fallen 47.4% year to date. 


	Live Nation, which jumped 7.2% to $129.52 this week, is the only music company to post a gain over the past two weeks. The concert promoter's share price dropped 3.4% the previous week but, with the help of a 10.9% jump on Wednesday, recovered well enough for a two-week gain of 3.6%. 


	Record labels and publishers finished the week in the middle of the pack. Warner Music Group fell 1.5% to $29.03, bringing its two-week decline to 8.0%. Universal Music Group was down 1.6%, giving it a two-week decline of 10.7%. Reservoir Media rose 0.7% to $7.10, giving it a two-week deficit of just 2.1%. 


	Sphere Entertainment Co. is one of the worst-performing music stocks over the past two weeks with an 18.5% decline. The company's shares finished the week up 1.3%, barely offsetting the previous week's 19.5% decline. A spike on Wednesday was partially offset by declines of 4.3% and 7.7% on Tuesday (April 8) and Thursday (April 10), respectively. 


	Most radio companies, which are heavily exposed to slowed advertising spending during recessions, had another down week. Cumulus Media dropped 22.5% to $0.31, bringing its two-week loss to 34.0%. iHeartMedia fell 4.2%, which took its two-week decline to 29.9%. Townsquare Media was down 4.9% this week and 13.6% over the past two weeks. Satellite broadcaster SiriusXM, which was upgraded by Seaport to buy from neutral, gained 2.6% this week, narrowing its two-week loss to 12.0%. 


	The two Chinese music streaming companies on the BGMI fared poorly despite the recoveries by Spotify, LiveOne and Deezer, which gained 2.3%. Tencent Music Entertainment fell 5.5% to $12.24 but was likely helped by Nomura initiating coverage this week with a buy rating and a $17.20 price target. Cloud Music shares dropped 5.7% to 141.50 HKD ($18.24). 


	K-pop companies, which bucked the downward trend the previous week, posted declines as well. SM Entertainment fell 8.2%, HYBE dropped 8.1%, JYP Entertainment sank 5.8% and YG Entertainment dipped 4.1%.

Prince Harry has expressed his belief that his police protection was withdrawn in an attempt to trap him, and stop him departing the UK with his wife Meghan Markle in 2020.


	Harry's taxpayer-funded security was withdrawn as part of arrangements following his decision to exit royal life five years ago, and make a new life with his wife in the US.


	Harry previously took the unprecedented step of suing the UK government over this decision, but it was upheld. This week has seen him back in a London courtroom to hear his lawyers appealing that decision.

	It was recorded in court that Harry viewed the decision as a means of trying to force the couple to stay within the UK, rather than coming and going from their new home in the US.

And he told The Telegraph newspaper that his “worst fears had been confirmed” by evidence he'd heard in court, many details of which have not been made public due to security concerns.


	He added that he was “exhausted and overwhelmed” by the legal process that has gone on now for several years.


	This week's appeal is the latest legal move by Harry, whose trips from his home in California to the UK have frequently involved court dates – whether over his security arrangements or various lawsuits against British newspapers. On leaving court this week, Harry said: “This one always mattered the most.”


	Harry's decision to sue the UK government is reported to be at the heart of the rift with his father, King Charles. The pair did not meet up in London this week – Charles was only in the city briefly to attend an appointment for his continuing cancer treatment, before travelling to Italy for an official visit, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of his wedding to Queen Camilla.

	Although Bill Maher swears he “didn't go MAGA” during his visit to the White House, he seems to have a new favorite dinner host.


	On Friday's episode of Real Time, the comedian shared his “book report on my visit to the White House,” after their mutual friend Kid Rock previously extended the invitation out of their shared belief “that there's gotta be something better than hurling insults from 3,000 miles away.”


	“Lemme first say to all of the people who treated this like it was some kind of summit meeting, you're ridiculous… like I was gonna sign a treaty or something,” he said. “I have no power, I'm a f—ing comedian, and he's the most powerful leader in the world. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“I'm not the leader of anything, except maybe a contingent of centrist-minded people who think there's got to be a better way to run this country than hating each other every minute,” added Maher.


	Maher said he “never felt I had to walk on eggshells around him,” adding: “And honestly, I voted for Clinton and Obama, but I would never feel comfortable talking to them the way I was able to talk to Donald Trump. That's just how it went down, make of it what you will.”


	“I'm just reporting exactly what I saw over two and a half hours,” he noted. “I went into the mine, and that's what's down there. A crazy person doesn't live in the White House. A person who plays a crazy person on TV a lot lives there, which I know is f—ed up. It's just not as f—ed up as I thought it was.”


	In addition to challenging him on topics like Iran, Gaza, the Syrian refugee crisis and his proposed third term, Maher said he heard Trump admit he lost the 2020 election.


	“I don't remember exactly what we were talking about but it must have been something about the 2020 election, because I know he used the word ‘lost,'” he recalled. “And I distinctly remember saying, ‘Wow, I never thought I'd hear you say that.' He didn't get mad. He's much more self-aware than he lets on in public.”


	Maher clarified he still doesn't “have a good feeling” about the Trump administration “and will be critical about a lot of what he's doing … But I also think he now understands that I have a job to do.”


	He praised Trump for giving him a “generous amount of time, and a willingness to listen and accept me as a possible friend even though I'm not MAGA, which was the point of the dinner.”

	











	“Trump was gracious and measured, and why he isn't that in other settings, I don't know and I can't answer and it's not my place to answer,” added Maher. “I'm just telling you what I saw, and I wasn't high.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Apple TV+‘s Mythic Quest has come to an end. The streamer has opted not to renew the gaming workplace comedy series for a fifth season. The decision comes days after the Season 4 finale dropped March 26.


	Since it had not been conceived as a series finale, the Season 4 finale will now get a new ending to give fans closure. The updated episode will be made available next week.


	“Endings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, Mythic Quest is coming to a close. We're so proud of the show and the world we got to build — and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it,” series creators/executive producers Megan Ganz, David Hornsby and Rob McElhenney said in a statement Friday. “To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple's blessing we made one final update to our last episode — so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.”

	











	The news is not entirely surprising. The well-reviewed comedy, which got off to a buzzy starts in 2020, had a quiet Season 4 run.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The latest season brings stars McElhenney, Charlotte Nicdao, Hornsby, Danny Pudi, Ashly Burch, Imani Hakim, Jessie Ennis and Naomi Ekperigin back together under the same fluorescent office lights. The reunited team at Mythic Quest confronts new challenges amongst a changing video game landscape as stars rise, egos clash, relationships bloom and everyone tries to have a little more work-life balance.


Mythic Quest, whose cast early on included F. Murray Abraham, was produced by Lionsgate, 3 Arts Entertainment and Ubisoft. It was executive produced by McElhenney and Charlie Day under their RCG banner, Michael Rotenberg and Nicholas Frenkel on behalf of 3 Arts, and Boykin, Austin Dill and Gérard Guillemot for Ubisoft Film & Television. Hornsby and Ganz also executive produce.


	The series spawned offshoot Side Quest, which explores the lives of employees, player and fans who are impacted by the game in an anthology format. The four-episode series stars McElhenney, Anna Konkle, Derek Waters, William Stanford Davis, Bria Samoné Henderson, Rome Flynn, Leonard Robinson, Gary Kraus, Annamarie Kasper, Esai Morales, Shalita Grant and more.

	











	The news of Mythic Quest‘s cancellation was first reported by Variety.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


	The Writers Guild of America West on Friday publicly announced disciplinary action against six members for alleged unauthorized work during the union's 2023 strike, as well as one additional member for an alleged violation of the guild's constitution.


	Four of those disciplined, which the WGAW named in a memo to members today, are appealing the decision.


	Julie Bush, Tim Doyle, Edward Drake and Roma Roth are all pushing back against the union board's disciplinary rulings, which were determined via hearings before five-member trial juries. Bush, Drake and Roth are accused of writing during the strike.

	











	Bush, whose credited as a consulting producer on Manhunt, has been suspended from the guild until next year and has been barred for life from holding non-elected guild office after being found guilty of violating Working Rule 8 and writing for a non-signatory company during the strike. Drake was expelled for allegedly writing during the strike and “failing to cooperate” with the Strike Rules Compliance Committee. Roth, an executive producer of Sullivan's Crossing and Virgin River, has also been expelled for writing for a non-signatory company during the strike. 




			Watch on Deadline		







Last Man Standing showrunner Doyle's discipline is in regards to a Facebook post that the union called “racist and offensive depiction of a lynching.” Deadline previously reported on this matter, when Doyle was censured last year.


	In a statement to Deadline, Drake called the board's decision to publicly announce the group's discipline “an alarming pattern of overreach and public shaming.”


	“After reading the appeal documents for the other writers, it's disturbing to see that the WGAW Board in each of the four cases being appealed disregarded their own investigators, SRCC and/or Trial Committee recommendations to push for harsher, and public, punishments,” the statement continued. “Why have governance systems, like investigators and committees, in place to protect members if their findings and recommendations can just be ignored by the Board?”


	Edward added that “hyphenate members face different challenges than their peers,” saying that the accusations are in regard to script changes he made in his capacity as a director, not as a writer. 

	











	“The Board punished me for being transparent, denied my right to due process and a fair trial, and pressured me to ‘name names' while refusing to provide protection from legal retaliation. When I withheld, the Board branded me a scab. That's not justice — it's coercion,” he added.


	Bush, in a statement of her own, said the WGA should have handled this matter at the guild's in-person, annual meeting, per the guild constitution. Instead, she argued, the board “unilaterally voted to do whatever they want.”


	“Loudly demanding members be punished for violating our Constitution while simultaneously ignoring and violating that same Constitution's requirement the Board face the membership and explain themselves is not a good look,” she added.


	Deadline has reached out to Roth for comment. Representatives for Doyle could not be reached.


	Under guild rules, disciplined members are offered the opportunity to appeal the board's decision to the membership at large. Members in good standing will vote to decide whether to uphold the disciplinary action or adopt “an alternative action proposed by the appellant,” as the guild states.


	WGAW members will be able to vote on the four appeals online from 10 a.m. PT on May 6 until 2 p.m. PT on May 9.

SPOILER ALERT: This post contains details about the Yellowjackets, Season 3 finale episode “Full Circle“


	After an eventful Season 3 finale, Yellowjackets fans no doubt have plenty of questions. Did Natalie reach help? Where did Jeff and Callie go? Does Shauna have a soul? 


	Leading up to this week's episode “Full Circle,” co-creators Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson spoke with Deadline about the “spiritual symmetry” of the finale, which reveals the identities of “Pit Girl” and “Antler Queen” after they were teased in the 2021 Karyn Kusama-helmed pilot.


	“In terms of bringing it full circle, there is always something exciting and maybe sort of daunting, because the entirety of — a large portion at least, in terms of narrative weight of the finale, is sort of starting where we began,” said Nickerson, who directed the episode. “The show's obviously not over, but to sort of like land back at the beginning in a way that sort of like closes the loop, but also it kind of opens a door to a path moving ahead, was really fun and really challenging.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In the '90s timeline, a series of events conspired between two opposing factions of the stranded titular soccer team, which led to them carrying out another hunt. Although some of the girls attempted to rig the drawing, Teen Shauna (Sophie Nélisse) throws a wrench in their plan, which ends up making Mari (Alexa Barajas) their prey. The scene soon overlaps with the event of the pilot opening scene, revealing Mari as the doomed “Pit Girl” and Shauna as the “Antler Queen” that presides over the cannibalistic feast of her body.


	Meanwhile, in the present, Adult Lottie's (Simone Kessell) killer is exposed after Misty (Christina Ricci) does some citizen-detecting and finds out Shauna's daughter Callie (Sarah Desjardins) committed the killing out of fear.


	“I think it asks sort of a philosophical question about Callie, and for Callie, in terms of who is she with respect to her mother,” explained Lyle. “I don't wanna say too much about this, but I don't think Callie is her mother, I think Callie is her own person, and that's something that we think is really interesting to explore.”


	With the discovery, Jeff (Warren Kole) and Callie take off to get some space from Shauna (Melanie Lynskey), who is left in the ruins of her own existential crisis.

	











	“I think she's both grieving and finally allowing herself to recognize who she is,” said Lyle, adding: “I think there is both a grief to that and also a letting go. I think that it's liberating for her in a certain way.” 


	As the two timelines begin to merge, Teen Nat's (Sophie Thatcher) call home in the eleventh hour provides hope for a potential rescue, and with it, a return to '90s civilization and an era-appropriate toxic media landscape.


	“Just to clarify, not to say that we're gonna get there very soon,” noted Nickerson. “But we've always said that we do think that there is a portion of the story that wants to be told upon their return, we just don't know when we're gonna get there.”


	Read on for Lyle and Nickerson's recap of the Season 3 finale, which is now available to stream on Paramount+ with Showtime before airing Sunday at 8 p.m. ET on Showtime.


DEADLINE: One thing that was exciting about the finale was that Pit Girl is revealed finally. Can you tell me about bringing that story full circle? Was Mari always the one you wanted to be Pit Girl? 


BART NICKERSON: In terms of bringing it full circle, there is always something exciting and maybe sort of daunting, because the entirety of — a large portion at least, in terms of narrative weight of the finale, is sort of starting where we began. The show's obviously not over, but to sort of like land back at the beginning in a way that sort of like closes the loop, but also it kind of opens a door to a path moving ahead, was really fun and really challenging. Because a lot of it is sort of held in the aesthetics of the finale, so just getting footage that was shot six or seven years ago to match, in a very different place and time, and with different people, was very exciting but very challenging. 


DEADLINE: Also the fact that Callie killed Lottie, that's another big bombshell from this episode. Can you tell me what that means for her character and her relationship with her mom? 


ASHLEY LYLE: That certainly doesn't mean great things for her character, which is sort of a broken record message of this show, something good for our characters. But I think it asks sort of a philosophical question about Callie, and for Callie, in terms of who is she with respect to her mother. We have Misty saying earlier on in the season, “apple, tree, I'm afraid to say,” and I think that that is the question for Callie moving forward. How much is she like her mother, and is it nature versus nurture to some extent? I think that's what she's going to be asking herself moving forward, is who am I, what kind of person am I? And I think that we've seen Shauna's true colors this season. I don't wanna say too much about this, but I don't think Callie is her mother, I think Callie is her own person, and that's something that we think is really interesting to explore. 


DEADLINE: Shauna has really become kind of the villain this season, and in the finale, she has this big breakdown. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going through her mind in that moment? 


NICKERSON: I think that a lot of what's going through her mind is what has been maybe going through her mind and her spirit on the periphery a very long time, just in that way that I think that there are kind of aspects of ourselves that we push to the back for a variety of reasons, for both good and bad. The story of Shauna is very much to take what is in the background and make it foreground, and so I think that there is kind of an energetic release that can almost feel like a coming home to yourself, even when some of the aspects are kind of negative. So, I think drinking from the fire hose of emotions of a fuller experience of yourself is kind of what's going through her mind, if that makes sense. 

	











LYLE: I think she's both grieving and finally allowing herself to recognize who she is. In the beginning of the season, we felt it was very important—it was very funny to see fan reactions and they're like, “oh, it's a slow build,” which we always get every season—but to see Shauna take a moment and go, “I can be a good mother, I can be a good wife. I'm gonna make smoothies for my husband. I'm going to tutor Callie. I'm going to commit to the role that I've chosen for myself.” In the final scenes in the final episode of this [season], she is coming to the very clear realization that that is not who she is, and I think there is both a grief to that and also a letting go. I think that it's liberating for her in a certain way. 


DEADLINE: You mentioned last time we talked that Hannah, of the trio, is the most prepared going into this, having been a teen girl herself. And I really saw that shine through in the end where she's been playing Shauna the whole time and she helps Nat call for help. Can you tell me about her arc this season and how it lends to the team possibly getting home? 


NICKERSON: I think that her arc is just one of her own survival and going through maybe a non-linear compressed version of what a lot of the other girls have kind of been going through, which is namely having to find some parts kind of herself that are able to do some things that she wouldn't normally be able to do/get to do back at home, in order to preserve her own life. So, her contribution to them potentially getting home is a huge one, but also an incredibly dangerous one. And it is a question for the fourth season of, is this gambit gonna work? And a big part of the gambit, in its technical definition is that you give up something in order to hopefully gain something, and so, what she will have lost and will it be worth it, will be something that we're excited to explore in Season 4. 


DEADLINE: I'm so curious if they're gonna end up getting back to civilization, just with Nat getting the signal at the end. Part of me is excited to see more of like the '90s style and just get back to the '90s pop culture and all that. 


LYLE: I think that that is something that will be very fun for us. We realized very early on, making the show, as we were even shooting the pilot, we were like, “Oh, this is our one chance for now, for a very long time, to actually dig into the '90s.” And we like to have little pops here and there, even in episode two of Season 1 when they're using the Sea Breeze toner as an antiseptic. But once they're there, the '90s is more in them and and how they're reacting to the world and their references and all of that, but I think it will be very fun in the future to actually be in the '90s and get to play around. That's our time, man. We're '90s kids. 


DEADLINE: Yeah, I loved that line when Hannah gets there and Van's asking, “Do Scully and Mulder hook up?” 


NICKERSON: Just to clarify, not to say that we're gonna get there very soon but we've always said that we do think that there is a portion of the story that wants to be told upon their return, we just don't know when we're gonna get there. 


DEADLINE: Yeah, and Liv Hewson was saying that they're very excited to explore the media reaction to the these young women. The media is still such a volatile place, but in the '90s, it was awful. 


LYLE: Oh my God, Hard Copy? [laughs] We've always had this sort of dream version of the quick Hard Copy montage of like, “the return of the Yellowjackets,” and obviously, the media would be very interested in covering that story, and at the same time, obviously our girls are very interested in the media not covering that story. 

	











DEADLINE: I'm also excited to see what comes from Melissa now that we have established Hilary Swank's side of it, as well as Jenna Burgess' side. Another thing that Van brought up was the potential of what happened between their characters before Melissa ultimately kills Van. I think that's an interesting thing I'm excited to see more of. 


NICKERSON: There's still a lot of dynamic kind of unfolding in the past kind of and the present. Just to go back to the question about returning to the pilot, we see sort of a closing kind of of a loop, but a pretty wild up path ahead. So, we're not really close to the final version of either timelines' character or the character dynamics. There's gonna be a lot of shifting and changing still to come. 


LYLE: They're not out of the woods yet, both literally and proverbially. 


DEADLINE: Is there anything else that you can tell me about Season 3 or looking ahead to Season 4? 


LYLE: We're just very hopeful and excited to keep telling the story of these characters, and I just love that final moment with Natalie on the cliff. It was very exciting to shoot. We actually had to take a helicopter up there, and so it was a very small crew, it was Bart and Sophie Thatcher and just a skeleton crew up on the top of a damn mountain, that was very real. So, it was really fun. 


DEADLINE: And Bart, can you tell me about like directing the finale?


NICKERSON: It was very fun, very challenging. I feel like it was also just, emotionally to get to revisit the pilot so many years later, and getting to direct that, just had a sort of a spiritual symmetry that I really enjoyed. And then just getting to explore a slightly different facet and that kind of relationship to the show has just been a joy and kind of a dream come true, and definitely something I hope will be a part of my journey and practice in the future.

Jelly Roll‘s acting debut on “Fire Country” was deeply personal for the singer. The “American Idol” artist-in-residence shared why he connected with the role in such a meaningful way.

A post shared by Fire Country (@firecountrycbs)

Jelly Roll dipped his toe into the acting pool with a role in “Fire Country” season 3 episode 17, titled “Fire and Ice.”

In a video posted on the “Fire Country” Instagram on April 10, Jelly Roll gave some insight into his character, Noah.

“First day ever acting, I like it a lot,” Jelly Roll said of his big debut. “What's up, y'all, it's your boy Jason ‘Jelly Roll' DeFord, but today I am known as Noah.”

He continued, “I'm playing a guy who's a second chance man, who's been in and out of prison, but lost his mother due to dementia. So my form of rehabilitation for myself and to give back as a man of service was I came to work at the local nursing home.”

“I really found myself in this guy,” Jelly Roll explained. “When I came home from my last time being incarcerated, where I was so determined to change who I was as a human. If music didn't work, I have a feeling that I wouldn't have been far fetched from being Noah working somewhere at some place, just trying to help people.”

He noted, “What I do and what Max [Thieriot, co-creator and star of ‘Fire Country'] does is the same thing. I think we're both storytellers.”

Thieriot explained, “The moment we first kind of met and started talking about this and it felt so right because what you are doing, what you're putting out there, and the message that you're spreading is, obviously, making a huge impact on a lot of people.”

Jelly Roll expressed his gratitude for the show, telling the actor, “Thank you for building an entire show around second chance humans. I mean, I think it's the heartbeat of America and I think that's why this show has been such a success.”

He added, “And I'm just honored to be able to bring my style of storytelling to it.”

In an April 4 interview with Us Weekly, Thieriot shared the interesting way that Jelly Roll got the part — a conversation in the bathroom at the CMT Music Awards kicked things off.

“I said, ‘Thank you for letting us have some of your songs on the show.' And he's like, ‘Dude, how do I get on the show? I've been petitioning online and talking to my people and you got to get me on that show,'” the actor recalled. 

Thieriot noted, “He said ‘Fire Country' is what he really represents … He called me the next day and it showed how sincere he was.”

They developed a character for Jelly Roll and, of course, the singer was on board. “It tells some of the story about second chances and what he really represents,” Thieriot said. “But [it] also feels different from who he is and how people see him day to day as a country singer.”

HGTV star Tarek El Moussa is sharing how is dynamic with his ex-wife Christina Haack has improved. 

While speaking to Us Weekly in April 2025, Tarek El Moussa, who shares his older children Brayden, 9,  and Taylor, 14, with Haack, said filming the series, “The Flip Off,” alongside his ex-wife bettered their relationship. The HGTV series, which premiered in January 2025, featured Tarek El Moussa and his wife, Heather Rae El Moussa, competing against Haack to see who could make a better profit when flipping a house. Haack's estranged husband, Josh Hall, was originally her partner until he left the series following their July 2024 split. 

Tarek El Moussa said filming the series “was more fun than [he] thought it was going to be.” 

“It was better for our family. It was better for our relationship. It brought everybody closer and, in the end, it did such amazing things for our family. I wouldn't change a thing,” said Tarek El Moussa to the publication. 

He also said that he and Haack were able to positively communicate with each other during the production of the show. 

“The show gave me and Christina an opportunity to apologize for things we did to each other. It gave Christina and Heather an opportunity to bond even closer. I mean, we're going to dinners now. So, honestly, it's just about working together, spending time together and creating some really fun TV together,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview.

Tarek El Moussa spoke about filming with Haack for “The Flip Off” during a January 2025 Us Weekly interview, alongside his wife. He said he was not worried about working with his ex-wife again because they have “been in a really good place” for “the last couple of years.” 

“It took us almost 10 years to get there, so going back into shooting together, it's a lot more of an intimate relationship. There were some reservations. But as the show has gone on, we've realized it's just business,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview. 

He also said that he and Haack did argue while filming the HGTV series. According to Tarek El Moussa, he took issue with Haack “because she always wants to get her way.” 

“She doesn't want to have rules,” said Tarek El Moussa to Us Weekly.

Heather Rae El Moussa also shared that he and Haack's dynamic is similar to how siblings fight.

During a November 2024 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Haack said Hall took issue with her dynamic with Tarek El Moussa while filming “The Flip Off.” 

According to Haack, Hall viewed her relationship with her ex-husband as flirty. She said, however, that she views Tarek El Moussa like a sibling.

It's been two years since actors Stephen Huszar and Katie Cassidy met and fell in love on the set of the Hallmark Channel's movie “A Royal Christmas Crush,” filmed in Ottawa in March 2023. So, are the love birds still together? 

Both actors have confirmed in recent weeks that their romance is still going strong, with Cassidy calling Huszar her “forever and always” in a social media post on March 31, 2025. Fans were thrilled by the update, hoping the real-life Hallmark couple have found their happily ever after. 

Huszar, who stars in “The Jane Mysteries” with Jodie Sweetin, told Us Weekly in June 2023 that how and why he and Cassidy fell for each other on the set of “A Royal Christmas Crush” was “sort of hard to explain.” 

“I just think the more we got to know each other, we realized we're basically the same person, just in different skin,” he said. “Which was odd. I've never met someone that's so similar in ways that I am. It's been quite a journey.”

On April 8, he posted a photo of them together at the red carpet premiere of “The Handsmaid's Tale” final season and gushed, “Everyday I am so incredibly grateful to be by your side @katiecassidy.. and playing dress-up when everything seems to match is just icing on the cake! I love you so much and I'm so proud of you!❤️”

Fans and friends have loved seeing the couple's recent updates, flooding their comment sections with praise, including one who wrote on Huszar's post, “The two of you are absolutely beautiful together. Congratulations Katie . And Stephen you bring us so much joy with all your movies so very happy for you. Both 🙌❤️”

A post shared by KATIE CASSIDY (@katiecassidy)

Although Cassidy called Huszar “my forever and always” and he has called her “the love of my life,” the couple has not confirmed an engagement or wedding plans. 

But in June 2024, Huszar told EntertainmentNOW that he was definitely open to walking down the aisle one day with Cassidy. 

“I am open to a lot of things,” he smiled. “Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah. Certainly, certainly that's in the cards. Absolutely.”

The couple lives together and travels extensively when not working on their own projects. His thriller “Fatal Exposure” is currently streaming on Tubi, and “The Jane Mysteries: Inheritance Lost” re-airs on Hallmark Mystery on April 11 (it's also available to stream on Hallmark+). Cassidy, meanwhile, is busy filming the psychological thriller “Nanny Cam,” directed by “Jersey Shore” alum Jenni “JWoww” Farley.

HGTV has packed its April 2025 schedule with new shows, from kicking off the sixth season of “Rock the Block” to debuting the new series “Castle Impossible.” 

On April 4, the network added one more surprise to the schedule: a new season of “Vacation House Rules” with real estate investor and contractor Scott McGillivray and his designer, Debra Salmoni — music to the ears of fans in the U.S. who have wondered whether the Canadian-based show would air again on HGTV. 

Season 6 of “Vacation House Rules” is already scheduled to premiere on Canada's new Home Network on April 7. For U.S. fans, HGTV now says it will debut on April 26. 

A post shared by HGTV (@hgtv)

Fans were thrilled to see the news of Scott McGillivray's return on HGTV's social media accounts, given that there hadn't been any status updates on the shows since it last aired in the spring of 2024. Thousands liked and commented on the post. 

“I absolutely love Scott's show & any show he is on or hosts,” one person wrote on Facebook. “He so knowledgeable & so genuine. He's a wonderful host, am so happy he's back!!!!! ❤️❤️”

Another wrote, “I enjoy Scott and Debra so much! They have a great chemistry. Glad to see them back!”

On Instagram, one fan gushed, “😊😊This is GREAT news! LOVE, LOVE his show!” while numerous others called it “the best show ever 😍.”

A post shared by Scott McGillivray (@scott_mcgillivray)

In “Vacation House Rules,” McGillivray renovates vacation homes alongside designer and friend Debra Salmoni. Together, the duo transform spaces in ways that will help their clients create new revenue streams by renting out the getaways. Filmed in Ontario, the series typically premieres in Canada weeks before making its way to U.S. airwaves.

McGillivray, who is married with two daughters, first appeared on HGTV Canada on “Income Property” in 2009. He's also helmed the Canadian series “Moving the McGillivrays,” “Buyers Bootcamp,” and “Renovation Resort Showdown” with his longtime friend and fellow HGTV star Bryan Baeumler. In 2024, he pitched in on HGTV's “100 Day Hotel Challenge” with Brian and Mika Kleinschmidt. 

On April 3, McGillivray told CTV that he's grateful for every chance he gets to keep doing what he loves.

“I like fixing things, that's what I love to do,” he told the outlet. “So, fortunately for me, I get to get up every day find something wrong and try to fix it, whether it's a real estate challenge or a renovation challenge or a design challenge. You know, I've been kind of blessed to be able to share that with everybody throughout the shows for so many years.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Bravo Announces First Ever ‘Below Deck' & ‘Real Housewives' Crossover","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/below-deck-real-housewives-crossover/","Sat, 12 Apr 2025 15:37:21 GMT","

It's a “Below Deck” and “Real Housewives” fans' dream come true. 

On April 11, Bravo revealed in an Instagram post, “ALL CREW, ALL CREW… Little Girl! Below Deck Down Under Season 4 just started filming with a first-ever Real Housewives crossover charter featuring the full cast of #RHOSLC.” 

“Captain Jason has enlisted the help of some familiar faces for the upcoming season … Daisy as Chief Stew and Chef Ben!”

The post featured a picture of Mary Cosby and Angie Katsenevas from “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” Captain Jason Chambers and Daisy Kelliher of “Below Deck Down Under,” and chef Ben Robinson of “Below Deck.”

Bravo producer Andy Cohen replied, “[We] have waited too long for this.” 

Elena Dubaich of “Below Deck Mediterranean” wrote, “Aaaahhh EPIC does not even begin to cover this!!! HOOOOOWWW ARE WE MEANT TO WAIT A YEAR.”

A post shared by Chef Ben Robinson (@benstogram)

Robinson was a mainstay of “Below Deck” since season 1 until he departed after his fourth year on the show. 

He then made an appearance on “Below Deck Mediterranean” season 4 to replace chef Mila Kolomeitseva after she failed to meet the boat's culinary expectations.

Since then, Robinson has been absent from the franchise, and he told the Mirror in 2020 just how hard working as a yacht chef was. “When I got off the first season, I said that felt like a year. I got three hours sleep a night. I didn't get a break, I just worked all the time,” he said.

The chef continued, “I would be cooking for guests until 6 a.m. after a night out, then another guest would want breakfast at 7 a.m. My position is isolated. I just had no outlet, and you were on camera all the time. It's nuts. Six weeks is a long time to be watched. It's like you're mentally in jail. It's tough, you've got to be really hardcore.”

A post shared by Chef Ben Robinson (@benstogram)

On March 20, Robinson hinted at his upcoming season of “Below Deck Down Under” and “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” crossover with a cryptic Instagram post featuring a Rubik's cube.

“Everything is solvable… #cheers #life #chef #seeyousoon #,” he wrote. Fans immediately caught on, and one replied, “You're back on Below Deck for a new season.”

Another wrote, “So looking forward to this!!”

One fan posted on X after the announcement, “Omg…I am dying to see Chef Ben again!! I think it'll be awesome to see him and Daisy work together. I want it now!!!!!”

When Iam Tongi won “American Idol” in 2023, he was just a high school student and still reeling from losing his dad, who'd died months before his heart-wrenching “Idol” audition. Although winning the competition was a thrill, Tongi struggled to feel truly happy about all the “blessings” happening in his life, he wrote in a vulnerable social media post on April 10, 2025. 

“When I won American Idol in 2023 my life changed forever,” Tongi captioned a video of highlights from the last two years. “So many amazing things were happening so quickly….I was in the studio recording music, traveling to places most dream about, performing for huge audiences and living a life only a few get to experience.” 

“But I still felt a sadness and an emptiness I could not escape,” Tongi continued. “I still had a lot of pain from losing my dad and that made it so hard to appreciate all the blessings God was giving me.”

Tongi, now 20, revealed that he eventually recognized he needed to take a “step back” and make some important changes, from taking better care of his health to allowing himself to grieve, he said. The resulting personal and creative growth now have Tongi pumped about his future, including new music. 

A post shared by Iam Tongi (@wtongi)

In his April 10 post, Tongi shared that less than a year before, “God made some changes in my life that allowed me to see things differently from a personal and emotional perspective. I woke up and realized it was time for me to take charge of my life and make the changes I had to make to be the best version of myself I could be.”

The result of working out daily with help from a trainer, Tongi wrote, “has been a blessing but also one of the toughest things I've ever done,” adding that “getting stronger physically has helped me get stronger mentally and emotionally and also musically.” 

“I decided to take a step back to reassess my life and my career,” Tongi continued. “I decided to prioritize myself. I started writing my own songs and telling my own stories and surrounding myself with positivity and people who genuinely cared about me and my well being.” 

Now thrilled about the direction his life and music are going, including the release of his latest single “Sunshine” on April 25, Tongi wrote, “I have so much to be grateful for and so much to share with you over the coming months.” 

A post shared by Iam Tongi (@wtongi)

Fans rallied around Tongi, with more than 24,000 liking his candid post and hundreds praising his honesty in the comment section, including someone who wrote, “SO proud of you Iam!! it takes so much strength to wake up and choose yourself every single day! can't wait to hear all the new music 💖🤙🏼”

Over the video of recent highlights, including footage from his workouts and attending “Idol” runner-up Megan Danielle's wedding in March, Tongi wrote, “POV: You've been working for an entire year and it's finally all coming together.”

Of the new song he's releasing, Tongi shared, “It's a simple message about chasing the light and celebrating the gift of each day. If it brings a smile to your face or makes your day a little bit brighter, then I've done what I set out to do.”

In addition to releasing “Sunshine,” Tongi is also scheduled to perform at CMA Fest from June 5 through 8, and then make his Grand Ole Opry debut on June 11 — a dream come true for him.

In a video about the Opry invitation, he shared, “My dad introduced me to country music when I was young and I grew up listening to artists like Kenny Rogers. So the fact that I get to perform on the Opry stage is a dream come true. Thank you to the Grand Ole Opry for inviting me to make my @opry debut on June 11!”

While finishing “Civil War,” sound designer Glenn Freemantle and supervising sound editor Ben Barker were informed by director Alex Garland that his next film — “Warfare” — based on a real-life mission in Iraq, would be even smaller and contain no music. They were all in. But little did Freemantle and Barker realize what a subjective and immersive sound experience they were in for.

The passion project of Iraq vet Ray Mendoza, who served as military advisor on “Civil War,” “Warfare” recounts the enemy surveillance mission that Mendoza was on as a young Navy SEAL communications officer that turned into an Al Qaeda ambush in Ramadi, Iraq, in 2006. Writing and directing with Garland, Mendoza took a uniquely forensic approach to the harrowing 24-hour ordeal, relying on the collective memories of everyone involved to achieve visceral authenticity.

“We just knew it was an absolute, brilliant opportunity for us,” Freemantle told IndieWire. “Everything was going to be realistic and in real-time. We really looked forward to going down to the set. It was a great atmosphere. It was complete military mode all day, every day, even during breaks. So you knew how it was gonna be.”

Filmed north of London in a studio set recreation of the apartment building where the platoon was deployed, “Warfare” was shot chronologically with the camera running in blocks of 12-minute takes. The platoon was taken by surprise by Al Qaeda operatives next door. The soldiers were first hit by a grenade hurled through a sniper hole in the wall, and then an IED exploded outside the building, gravely injuring medic and sniper Elliott Miller (Cosmo Jarvis), to whom the movie is dedicated, and leading petty officer Joe Hildebrand, renamed Sam (Joseph Quinn). From there, the platoon has to hold on for reinforcements to help them evacuate from the building.

Freemantle and Barker had many conversations with Mendoza about the sounds of the gunfire “Everything was real and the knowledge we got from Ray was unbelievable about how their perception of sound was, their perception of the bullets,” Barker told IndieWire.

“Like the snap that you hear was really important,” Freemantle added. “Because they hear the snap before they hear the bang.  Ray was very specific about the sound of the snap, which was the bullet passing overhead, and that was his sound memory.”

 










“And Ray's team are reacting to that snap sound,” added Barker. “And you'll hear it quite a lot during the film. And whenever there's a snap, they would then turn and fire and fire and fire. And that would be the key. So whenever there's a volume of fire from the U.S. troops, that's when they were moving. It was always short, sharp taps of the weapon.

At Mendoza's request, they provided realistic sound effects that were piped in through the PA system during the shoot to enhance the realism for the actors. “On the first few takes [Mendoza and Garland] didn't let them know that the shots or bangs or explosions were going to happen,” Barker said.

Freemantle and Barker went to Czechoslovakia to shoot live rounds of ammo, piecing together every separate element within the gunshot. They shot live ammo through metal doors and through walls. “Everything was how it should be and the sounds of the airplanes coming above and firing,” said Freemantle. “We actually had previous recordings of the correct jets, so we were lucky to use those sounds again. But from Ray's memory was the sound of the sonic boom. That's when you really feel the impact of that noise. And Ray said, ‘I think that sound is slightly a bit too early.' From his perception of where they were, it was right down to those sort of details.”

 










It all began with the surprise of the IED explosion in the apartment.  This was the concussive blast that set the warfare in motion. Each soldier responded differently like they were in their own individual fog of war.

“Again, Ray gave us such knowledge: a grenade had a certain crack sound or a bigger boom sound for the IED,” Freemantle said. “So we got good insight into how that sounded. And then we started to build up different layers to do that. So it was getting that really tight sound on the IED impact, the metal, and the phosphorus. And the weight, how the sound wave would hit them, and the air pressure as well, not only in that moment, but it was also when the guns fired.

“The perception of how they heard these things was quite interesting,” Freemantle continued. “So doing it from the perspective of not just seeing into the film but how each one perceived things as it was happening, was part of a massive thing.”

In terms of the mix (particularly for Dolby Atmos and IMAX), it was a special immersion in which every sound was created with precision and accuracy. In fact, there's one scene where Mendoza is overwhelmed by the radios coming on all at once while they're under attack. “They're on the left, then right, left, right, left, right,” Freemantle said. “Basically, it's from inside his ears and it's driving him insane.

 










“You can say there's no music, but that moment does a musical thing,” Freemantle continued. “It carries you with those radios flying around and everything to that moment of silence again. That took a long time to get to that point. And a lot of work beforehand to get those radios to work.”

8.6

 Best New Reissue

Genre:

Experimental

Label:

Ideologic Organ

Reviewed:

April 12, 2025

The first and only time that Kali Malone sat down for a lesson on the pipe organ, she managed about five minutes at the console before begging her teacher to take her inside the belly of the beast. That desire is borne out in her music: Listening to her expansive, slowly moving compositions, which bristle with dazzling arrays of layered waveforms, you feel like you are not just inside the organ—pressed against its pipes, vibrations coursing through your body, air whisking over your skin—but enveloped in the sound itself. The simplest interval might throb like an outboard engine, every new chord triggering wave after rippling wave of beating effects, vibrations as pronounced as the ridges and grooves of corrugated metal. Malone once said that drone composer Éliane Radigue “tunes the listener's attention to a place somewhere between committed focus and surrendered consciousness,” and the same goes for her own music. Malone's patient, cycling melodies suggest spiritual contemplation, yet their immense physicality is monolithic, monumental, mind-emptying.

Originally released in 2019, The Sacrificial Code was Malone's breakout album, following a run of records—drone meditations for electric guitars, electronics, strings, gongs, and wind instruments—that the American-born musician recorded after moving to Stockholm, where she studied alternative tuning systems and threw herself into the city's experimental music scene. The Sacrificial Code soon established a cult following, perhaps in part because its dissociative repetitions felt particularly suited to the mood of enforced stasis that landed like an anvil in March 2020.

The album paved the way for a series of acclaimed works that would demonstrate the full range of Malone's talents: Living Torch, a multi-channel piece for bass clarinet, trombone, and ARP 2500 synthesizer; Does Spring Hide Its Joy, a three-hour drone epic recorded during the doldrums of lockdown with cellist Lucy Railton and Sunn O))) guitarist Stephen O'Malley; and last year's All Life Long, a suite of interwoven pieces for pipe organ, brass ensemble, and chamber choir. That material, which Malone and her players have performed extensively over the past couple of years, represents her most compositionally ambitious work to date. But a new reissue of The Sacrificial Code offers the chance to revisit a pivotal moment in Malone's artistic development, when ideas that might seem principally formalist—about early-modern musical forms and arcane tuning systems—came together in an album charged with unusually powerful emotional resonance. In its bracing purity and focused intent, it remains a high-water mark in her catalog.

The first thing we hear, on the opening “Spectacle of Ritual,” is a major triad whose thick, guttural tones shudder with rapid-fire movements—an unusual interference pattern that seems to grow more pronounced across the full minute that she holds the otherwise unchanging chord. The organ Malone used for the album's first three pieces was tuned in Kirnberger III temperament, an 18th-century tuning system developed by a student of Johann Sebastian Bach, but you don't need to know anything about its particulars to recognize its fundamental strangeness. (A suggestion offered by one expert succinctly sums up its peculiarities: “Make all the fifths around the circle between C and E equally narrow and rough.”) Unlike equal temperament, designed to sound balanced and natural—to contemporary Western ears, anyway—in any key or register, the tuning systems that Malone favors are full of quirks and compromises that make harmonies shift unpredictably, as though rolling over rutted ground. Broad expanses of tone waver like highway mirages; chords slosh like bailing buckets. In contrast to the immaculate symmetry we might expect from the churchly instrument, Malone's organs sound fleshly and fallible.

Most of the pieces on The Sacrificial Code are based on the canon, a Renaissance contrapuntal form in which a single melody is mirrored across multiple voices, sometimes at different speeds. But in Malone's hands, the underlying architecture is rarely obvious; the music's structural elements are submerged in the muck of clashing frequencies. The stately pace and unpredictable course yield maze-like repetitions; winding your way through the chord changes, you're never quite sure if you have previously turned a particular corner. In “Sacrificial Code,” slowly spiraling sequences pursue an M.C. Escher-like ascent; in “Litanic Cloth Wrung,” the shifting chords have the geometric feel of quilt blocks.

The overarching impression is one of steady, ceaseless motion—and never-ending reinvention, as tones collide and recombine. With every change of a note, the beating patterns shift—sometimes faster, sometimes slower, and sometimes moving in waves, like op-art moiré. The internal complexity of all those innumerable permutations creates an unusual emotional effect: Rather than conventional tension and release, Malone's canons create a landscape where everything is in flux. One set of tones might resolve while another simultaneously sparks new friction. The most reassuring consonance is shadowed by the possibility that everything might fall apart at any moment.

The pieces' cyclical nature makes them feel like they could go on forever; rarely do they reach anything like a climax or a resolution. Instead, they mostly just wind down, part by part, ending in a long chord that Malone holds as long as she likes, luxuriating in the rumbling. In a few cases, she plays the same piece on different occasions on different organs, in different ways, contributing to the impression that these are less discrete compositions than eternal patterns channeled from the ether. “Sacrificial Code” reappears twice: in a sumptuously drawn-out 13-minute version, brighter and cleaner in tone and more than twice the length of the original, and then, in a bonus track exclusive to the reissue, in a version recorded in 2023 on the Malmö Konstmuseum's 16th-century meantone organ, one of the oldest functioning organs in the world. Just four minutes long, “Sacrificial Code III” sounds wholly distinct from its predecessors: Where the original trudges wearily, dutifully forward, and “Sacrificial Code II” moves with courtly elegance, the new version is clear and wild as a mountain stream, air hissing through the flues with every attack.

One other repeat performance appears on The Sacrificial Code: “Fifth Worship II,” which reprises a piece from Malone's more sketchlike 2018 album Organ Dirges 2016-2017. It's one of the album's highlights—and most surprising tracks. Rather than churning in place, it maps out something like a path of ascension over its nearly eight-minute run. Malone begins deep in the lower register, summoning doom metal's low-end gravity. Slowly and almost imperceptibly she moves up the scale, from ashen craters to sunlit peaks, Sunn O))) to Arvo Pärt. Finally, having reached the sparkling zenith, she switches off the motor that pumps life through the organ. For the next minute, the final tones of the piece drift slowly downward—trembling, keening, souring in tone, like dejected birds. Compared to the overwhelming physicality of what has come before, it feels like everything is dissolving into air.

	Gothic gargoyles appeared, lights dimmed, and the crowd chanted the prima donna's name at the desert operahouse. It was Friday night at Coachella and Lady Gaga was about to tell the story of Mayhem — and give the performance of a lifetime.


	Over two hours and four acts, Gaga brought to life the inner battle between two sides of herself: lightness (an angelic, innocent Gaga monster with blonde hair) and darkness (the shadowier “lady in red” she sings about in “Abracadabra”).


	In the first act of her headlining Coachella set, she took the stage while wearing a massive, three-story dress and performed “Bloody Mary,” embracing the new life given to the Born This Way favorite on TikTok. Then came “Abracadabra,” where she channeled a Victorian-era opera singer in a dark parallel universe. Fittingly, next came “Judas,” which saw Gaga deliver the original choreography from the uproar-provoking video.


	“How you feeling tonight… welcome to my house of mayhem,” Gaga said, addressing the crowd for the first time after a “Scheiße” interlude and “Garden of Eden.”

	She ended the first act with a direct face-off between her evil and good sides to the beat of “Poker Face” from her mid-crowd B stage — seemingly killing off Gaga of Light. But fear not: By the second act, she had risen, literally crawling out of a pile of dirt in a corseted white dress, surrounded by dancers in skull masks, who moved to “Perfect Celebrity.” It seemed to be a poignant, yet clear acknowledgement that the only way stars reach perfection is once they've left us.


	“I love you so much. I wanted to make a romantic gesture to you this year amid these times of mayhem. I decided to build you an opera house in the desert,” Gaga told the audience in a touching speech before “Alejandro.” “For all the love and all the joy and all the strength you've given me my whole life. Sometimes I feel like it went into a dream when I was like 20 years old and I've been in a dream ever since then. I didn't know if I wanted to wake up… what if you weren't there?”

	For the third act, Gesaffelstein took the stage adding his futuristic allure to a performance set centuries before. He DJed during “Killah,” which Gaga performed in a silver and royal blue leotard reminiscent of her first “Just Dance” performances. (She told Rolling Stone she was most excited to play that song live.)

	











	On “Zombieboy,” it felt like Gaga was channeling a Wednesday Addams-esque narrative, twirling alongside skeletons with her dancers. By the end, some of the provocative moves with the rattling bone piles will likely fuel criticism from the usual close-minded detractors.


	Throughout the performance, Gaga gently sprinkled in the must-dos that might not have fit her concert storyline, like a shortened “Die with a Smile” and tear-jerking performance of “Shallow” that brought out human Gaga.


	“You are who you choose to be. You always will be and thank you for teaching me something,” she said to the crowd before blowing a kiss to one special person in the audience: her fiancé Michael Polansky. “Babe I love you,” she said. “And thank you for bringing me my man,” she said to the crowd.


	Most touching of all was Lady Gaga high-fiving and embracing her little monsters who just wanted to receive Mother's blessing. She took her time celebrating her fans while singing “Vanish into You,” dedicating the track to those in the crowd who survived 100-degree desert hell to see her. Ask anyone: It was worth it.

	For the grand finale, Gaga took the stage as a feathered angel, revived from the afterlife, all while “Bad Romance” began to play and colorful fireworks exploded in the background. “We are monsters, and monsters never die,” read a message onscreen. Gaga's Mayhem didn't end in tragedy: Both light and dark will always exist within Gaga. It's up to her who she'll embrace.


	Gaga's storytelling — creative-directed with Parris Goebel — was transformative, and a spectacle that cemented her status as a once-in-a-lifetime pop icon.

Donald Trump and his White House have moved to deport green-card holders for espousing pro-Palestinian views, shipped hundreds of migrants to a notorious Salvadoran mega-prison without due process (in defiance of a judge's order), and are now publicly musing about sending United States citizens to prison in El Salvador.   


	Trump said last weekend he would “love” to send American criminals there — and would even be “honored” to, depending on “what the law says.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed this week that the president has discussed this idea privately, too, adding he would only do this “if it's legal.” El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, has for months been offering to hold U.S. citizens in his country's prison system, which he has turned into “a judicial black hole” rife with “systematic torture,” as one human rights advocate recently told Rolling Stone.


	Legal experts agree that sending American citizens to prison in El Salvador would be flagrantly illegal under both U.S. and international law — and that the idea itself is shockingly authoritarian, with few parallels in our nation's history. 

	











	The Trump administration is indeed discussing this idea behind the scenes, two sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Rolling Stone. In their most serious form, these conversations have revolved around attempting to denaturalize American citizens and deport them to other countries, including El Salvador. 


	“You can't deport U.S. citizens. There's no emergency exception, there's no special wartime authority, there's no secret clause. You just can't deport citizens,” says Steve Vladeck, a legal commentator and law professor at Georgetown. “Whatever grounds they try to come up with for denaturalization or expatriation, the one thing that is absolutely undeniable is that people are entitled to individualized processes, before that process can be effectuated.”

	In the United States, the grounds to strip a naturalized individual of their citizenship encompass serious material offenses. They include: committing treason or terrorism, enlisting in a foreign military engaged in opposition to the United States, or lying in applications for citizenship or as part of the naturalization process. 

	











	Experts say any effort from the Trump administration to denaturalize citizens is unlikely to succeed in court. “Denaturalization is not an easy process,” says Sirine Shebaya, executive director of the National Immigration Project. “To the extent that there is Supreme Court precedent on it … nobody has been inclined to give expansive powers to strip people of their citizenship without any kind of due process. So that is a place where it feels a little bit more like an aspirational effort or something that's more about sowing fear in communities, and making people feel insecure, and making people from certain parts of the world feel like they're not welcome here.”


	Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor at Cornell University, tells Rolling Stone he worries Trump could try to deport citizens anyway, court precedent be damned, given how the administration seems to be “attacking on all fronts and worrying later whether their actions are legal. So unfortunately, it would not surprise me if we saw at least one plane load of incarcerated U.S. citizens being shipped off to El Salvador.”


	Shortly after stepping back into office, Trump personally directed at least one lawyer working in his administration to look into deporting American citizens via denaturalization processes, telling aides that it is a “good idea” for certain cases, according to one of the sources, who is a Trump appointee. In one of his many Day One executive orders, Trump instructed his administration to move on cases described in a federal statute regarding “revocation of naturalization.”

	Several of Trump's most important advisers, including White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, continue to internally advocate for mass-denaturalization initiatives that they believe were squandered in Trump's first stint in the Oval Office.


	For instance, the sources add, Trump administration officials have discussed possibly denaturalizing and deporting activists and other individuals whom they label as having committed so-called “fraud” on their applications for citizenship by subsequently supporting what Team Trump decides are “pro-terrorist” causes or groups — similar to the specious arguments they've made to justify stripping pro-Palestine student activists of their green cards or visas. 


	According to these sources, Trump administration attorneys and some senior appointees have also discussed potential legal justifications and technicalities they can exploit for denaturalizing citizens who are accused or convicted of certain crimes, especially if the Justice Department or other offices deems their offenses to be gang-related. 

	











	The administration has already tried to justify deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act — the notorious 1798 law used to justify the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II — by claiming the men had ties to gangs. As CBS News' 60 Minutes has reported, the vast majority of the men who were sent to El Salvador “have no apparent criminal convictions or even criminal charges.” Some of the allegations appear to have been based entirely on the migrants' completely anodyne tattoos and apparel. 


	In recent weeks, largely due to the president's influence, some of the discussions among Trump officials and administration lawyers have touched on the idea of potentially sending some of these denaturalization targets to brutal facilities in El Salvador, the sources add. 


	“It's not like we would send everybody there — but depending on the case, it can be an option,” says one of the people familiar with the matter, adding that “this is a standard process of exploring legal options, as all administrations do one way or another.”


	What's to stop the administration from using the same pretext they used to send people to El Salvador — and claiming “that these U.S. citizens are the worst offenders?” asks Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center. “They could start engaging in the same kind of pretextual deportation of people, for whom the offenses at the end of the day might have something to do with what you say, how you live your life, what tattoos you have on your body.” 


	She adds that “this is all about this administration testing the bounds of the law and trying to consolidate their power by advancing unconstitutional laws and policies, starting with immigrants.”


	There are some influential figures in Trump's orbit — a number of whom the president himself listens to and solicits advice from — who want him to use the hammer of state and executive power to do something big and truly unprecedented. 


Mike Davis, a close Trump ally and a fixture among the MAGA legal elite, tells Rolling Stone, “I have advocated very publicly that if you are a current Hamas supporter and you were naturalized within the last 10 years, the Justice Department should move forward with denaturalization proceedings to get them the hell out of our country. Denaturalization has been on the books for a very long time. If you lie on your citizenship application, denaturalization is a consequence.”

	











	When asked if there is any precedent in the last several decades for this kind of crackdown effort, he replies: “I hope this is groundbreaking. I hope Trump and his team are trail blazers on this. Hamas supporters can go to hell and in the meantime they need to get the hell out of our country.”


	Though he declined to get into his private conversations with Trump or his administration officials, Davis says: “The president and his team appreciate both my private and public recommendations.”


	It would not be Trump's first attempt to carry out a broad denaturalization policy. In February of 2020, the first Trump administration authorized the creation of a “Denaturalization Section” under the Civil Division of the Department of Justice aimed at — according to a DOJ press release — bringing “justice to terrorists, war criminals, sex offenders, and other fraudsters who illegally obtained naturalization.” 


	The program was not shuttered by the Biden administration — which instead deprioritized it to the point of obscurity — but its structure and priorities reflect the current playbook that Trump officials are using to justify their disregard for civil rights law in their immigration agenda. The Trump administration's assertions that the hundreds of migrants it dumped in El Salvador's prison system were hardened criminals affiliated with transnational gangs and terrorist groups were shaky to begin with, and have continued to crumble in the weeks since their deportations. 


	Clashes with federal courts — and now the Supreme Court — are teeing up a battle of wills between the presidency and the judiciary. 


	After a judge ruled that the Trump administration needed to secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a man they said they erroneously sent to El Salvador despite a protection-from-removal order barring him from being sent there — the Justice Department took the matter to the Supreme Court. 


	The conservative-dominated court ruled unanimously, 9-0, that the Trump administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's release in El Salvador and return to the United States. The justices told the Justice Department to “be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken” to bring back Abrego Garcia. (The justices did take issue with the lower court's demand that the Trump administration additionally “effectuate” Abrego Garcia's return, calling that wording “unclear.”)

	











	“You had the Supreme Court unanimously reaffirming that [the] federal courts have the power to look into cases like Abrego Garcia's,” Vladeck says of the decision. Despite the ruling, the Trump administration is now, as Vladeck puts it, “trying to drive a Mack truck through a five inch wide remand.” 


	On Friday, Trump's Justice Department refused to comply with the lower court's demand that it provide an update on its efforts to bring Abrego Garcia back to America. The administration complained in a court filing Friday that it had been afforded an “insufficient amount of time” to review the Supreme Court's order, and additionally argued the lower court “has not yet clarified what it means to ‘facilitate'” Abrego Garcia's release.


	Leavitt, the White House press secretary, was separately asked Friday if the administration would time Abrego Garcia's return to a high-profile visit by Bukele, the Salvadoran president, to the White House on Monday. Leavitt countered that “the Supreme Court made their ruling last night very clear that it's the administration's responsibility to facilitate the return, not to effectuate the return.” 


	Trump, for his part, suggested Friday evening on Air Force One that he would follow the Supreme Court's ruling to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. “If the Supreme Court said bring somebody back, I would do that,” Trump said. “I respect the Supreme Court.”


	To this point, his administration has not yet followed the high court's order to “facilitate” return of a man whom, by the government's own admission, it wrongfully deported and imprisoned in a foreign gulag. 


	“The problem that we've seen over the last week is a series of Supreme Court rulings that have gone out of their way to not endorse what Trump is doing, but also created these procedural artifices that have in some respects thwarted what the lower courts are doing,” Vladeck explains. “At this point, what is it going to take for a majority of the Supreme Court to treat the government's behavior with the kind of contempt that the government is treating the lower courts?”

	“Maybe that's the Supreme Court's end game here is to exhaust every other possibility before provoking a direct confrontation [with the president],” Vladeck adds. “But I think two things should be said about that. One, that's a dangerous game unto itself; and two, in the interim, real people suffer.” 


	On a related note, Politico reported Friday evening that former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince and other government contractors are urging the Trump administration to hire them to transport tens of thousands of immigrants in U.S. custody to prison in El Salvador — and that this idea will likely be discussed when Trump and Bukele meet on Monday. Plenty more suffering could be on the way.

	A day after the Supreme Court ordered that President Donald Trump's administration return an innocent Maryland man wrongfully deported to a notorious El Salvadoran mega-prison, the president said that he would respect the high court's decision.


	“If the Supreme Court said bring somebody back I would do that. I respect the Supreme Court,” Trump told reporters on Friday. He added, “I have great respect for the Supreme Court.” Despite the president's remarks, his administration has yet to provide information regarding Kilmar Abrego Garcia's location and any details they have taken towards ensuring his release.


	The conservative-controlled court's ruling was unanimous on Thursday, with all nine justices backing a lower-court order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador. The ruling sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who ordered the government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's release and return to the U.S.


	However, the justices separately stated that the district court's order to “effectuate” Abrego Garcia's release may have been a step too far. Trump's Justice Department issued a statement attempting to cast the decision as a win for its position, writing: “As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs. By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.”

	When speaking to reporters, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to seize on this distinction. “The Supreme Court made their ruling last night very clear that it's the administration's responsibility to facilitate the return, not to effectuate the return,” said Leavitt.


	Earlier this month, Trump's Department of Homeland Security admitted that it had wrongfully deported Abrego Garcia to the El Salvadoran prison due to an “administrative error.” Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from removal to El Salvador, making it illegal to send him there. Xinis last week ordered the administration return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., but the Trump administration appealed the ruling, arguing that they did not have the authority to bring back Abrego Garcia since he is in the custody of El Salvador.

	Following the Supreme Court's ruling, in an order on Thursday, Judge Xinis said the government must “take all available steps to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States as soon as possible.” The judge gave the Justice Department until 9:30 a.m. ET on Friday, and then 11:30 a.m., to detail where Abrego Garcia is located and what steps have been taken to bring him back. 


	Despite the judge's demand, the Trump administration did not provide even “basic” details to Kilmar Abrego Garcia's whereabouts, and Xinis denounced the government's lack of information as “extremely troubling.”

	“I'm asking a very simple question. Where is he?” Xinis asked Justice Department lawyers at Friday's court hearing, Politico reported.

	In 1972, ABC aired an exposé on the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island, New York, which had been accused of abusing and neglecting its intellectually challenged wards. A young, hungry investigative reporter named Geraldo Rivera took a camera crew inside the institution, and gave the country a firsthand look at the appalling conditions the underage patients were forced to endure. Thousands upon thousands of viewers reacted with shock, anger and demands for Willowbrook to close its doors forever. Two of them, sitting in a cluttered apartment in Greenwich Village, decided to put on two benefit concerts to help these children out.


	The resulting double-shot of Madison Square Garden shows that took place August 30th, 1972 — organized by and featuring recent NYC émigrés John Lennon and Yoko Ono — have become legendary for being the last full live shows that the former Beatle would perform. When ABC broadcast the concert, however, the reaction was mixed; Live in New York City, the 1986 album and video release of the event, did little to burnish its reputation. But Sean Lennon had long wanted to remaster the recordings, knowing that these shows played a huge part in the legacy of his parents. It was also a pivot point in Lennon and Ono's relationship to both the city they now called home and the political radicalization they'd experienced since moving to downtown New York the previous year. The concert deserved a second chance. And the context leading up to that night in the summer of '72 deserved a much deeper look.

	











	Named after the benefit shows, One to One: John & Yoko focuses on the couple's first few years in NYC, when they moved into a small, one-bedroom apartment at 105 Bank Street, befriended activists such as Jerry Ruben and John Sinclair, spent a lot of time watching TV, and begin figuring out how to live a post-Beatles life. (It opens in a special IMAX run this weekend, before going wide on April 18th.) Directed by Oscar-winner Kevin Macdonald — who's also made docs on Bob Marley and Whitney Houston — it utilizes a huge amount of their home movies, personal phone recordings (which a justifiably paranoid Lennon taped because he believed he was being surveilled by the FBI) and a lot of largely unseen archival footage. Macdonald also painstakingly recreated the couple's Greenwich Village flat, down to the debris strewn out on the floor. If you've ever wanted to hang out in a bohemian crash pad in the early '70s, or listen in on Lennon arguing with manager Allen Klein about an Attica benefit or the couple's assistant May Pang negotiate with a fly wrangler for Yoko's art exhibits, you'll feel like you've gone to Plastic Ono Heaven.

	Yet the idea, the director says, was not to simply add to the already overflowing Beatles Nonfiction Industrial Complex so much as shed light as what he believes is one of the most crucial, transformative periods of John and Yoko's life together. “Why not try to give someone a look back that's more experiential,” he said, “and let them see what life was like for this couple, in this city, at this time?”


	Over the course of two conversations — one at the Sundance Film Festival in January, where One to One played in the fest's “Spotlight” section, and one in Los Angeles in February — Macdonald opened up about why he was initially reluctant to make the movie, how they managed to reconstruct Lennon and Ono's apartment, the idea that this project is as much about the present as it is the past, and why it helped him see both of these iconic figures in a whole new light. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity.


You were approached by Mercury Studios with the idea of just doing a concert film, right?I was actually approached by Peter Worsley, who's the producer who had spent a long time getting the rights to use the concert. Mercury were already attached at that time.Were they in the process of remastering the audio at that point?Basically, the order of things is that Sean Lennon wanted to remaster the audio [of the “One to One” concert], which was terribly recorded. I don't know if you've seen any of clips of what was originally broadcast; there are a few on YouTube from the videotape release of the show they did in 1986. It was never given a proper re-release or whatever, because the quality wasn't great and I think the family felt like it wasn't a fair representation of John. So only in the last few years did they think that, with the current technology and the incredible advances in digital remixing, that they could isolate the different tracks sufficiently enough to do a proper remix of it. My understanding is that he was in the process of remixing the show, and Peter and Mercury said, “Oh, we should make a film to put this in its context.”So like a concert film with benefits?Something like that. When they came to me, they asked: Do you want to do a film about this concert? And I looked at the original footage, and thought, No, this looks and sounds terrible. It wasn't until they took me to where it was being remixed, and I heard what they were able to do with it, that I was like, Wow. Okay. There's something here.

	I was nervous about making another John Lennon or Beatles film, to be honest. I was 13 when Lennon died, and I grew up obsessed with him. Admittedly, there was part of me that thought, “Oh, it's my childhood dream, to make a film about John Lennon.” But how do you do something different? There's just been so much said and done. And then I thought, why not try to give the audience something that isn't just, “Here are the facts, laid out in front of you. Here are more of the people you've seen a million times, if you're a Lennon fan, talking about these things. Enjoy!” Why not try to give someone a look back that's bit more experiential, and let them see what life was like for this couple, in this city, at this time?


The 18 months that you're concentrating on is really fertile ground, because no one has really dug into that period this intensely before, have they?It happens to be very fertile if you're taking the approach that we've taken, yeah. When you look at the home movies, the photos, the shards of their shared life that are left behind in the attic — this is the period you want to do it in. Because they had their own cameras. They had their own film crews who often went with them when they were out at protests, or they're doing the exhibitions. They recorded their phone calls. So this is probably the only period in his life, I think, where there's enough material that you could pull this approach off.It fills in the gaps of the traditional narrative, which always felt like: “John and Yoko came to New York. There was a lost weekend. He came back. And then they moved into Dakota, John started baking bread…”“And then he was murdered.” Which leaves a lot of vital stuff out! That's what I found so interesting. The more you dig into this period, the more you understand just how transformative this period was for both of them, but especially for John. This is when he's going from being the guy who was a Beatle and is being hounded to death, and whose wife's is being unfairly blamed for breaking up this band, to being the peacenik John Lennon of the 1970s. This is when he's trying to figure out: Who am I? How do I reinvent myself? How should I use my power? How should I be relating to Yoko, and women and feminism in general? And because we had access to this great material, it feels intimate in a way that's unique. I don't think the world's biggest Beatles fans will learn loads of new stuff. I just want them to feel like they've hung out with John and Yoko.

	











How much about this period of John and Yoko's life did you know going in, or was this a pretty steep learning curve?It was a steep learning curve because, finally, because… I was a big fan, but, for instance, I did not know about Kyoko [Ono Cox, Yoko's daughter]. How is it possible that I've read so many books on Lennon, and I did not know this? I've been amazed how many real big, nerdy fans didn't seem to know about her and the struggle John and Yoko went through in relation to her, either. It's such a defining thing in their lives. It's one of the main reasons they've really come to America — to look for her. They know that she's been kidnapped by Yoko's ex-husband. They're sending out private detectives. And most importantly, it makes you understand Yoko a lot better. This is a woman who's actually mourning for the loss of her child, and who, in that beautiful song at the end —The “Age 39” song … [“Looking Over From My Hotel Window,” from Ono's 1973 album Approximately Infinite Universe]— She's s talking about being heartbroken by losing a child, and she's asking the question, “Am I a bad mother? Was it right that she was taken away from me?” And that makes me care for Yoko and see her in a light that I hadn't considered before, you know?


In the film, the moment where you highlight that song comes right after you've shown Lennon performing “Mother.” It's almost like the two songs are in conversation with each other.Well, I think you could argue that the theme of this film — or one of the themes, in my opinion — is about children and unhappy childhoods. Lennon has always talked about the fact that his mother was killed had left him with a chip on shoulder, and it's probably the thing that drove him to be who he is. Not to mention the difficult character that we know he could be! And Yoko is searching for the child she's lost. So when they both see the Willowbrook footage, and they see those children in pain, that's why I think that they have this huge outpouring of empathy for them.


I think Yoko specifically says, when they're asked why they're doing this benefit concert for Willowbrook, “As a mother…”Yes! And that's why it seemed appropriate to end it with Sean's birth at the end. Because it's kind of like, it's this moment of completion, in a way. They are ready to devote this energy to being a family. I also find the Willowbrook story is just so incredible. I think some people know about the news report that exposed the conditions there, and Lennon fans know about the concert, but I don't know that the connection between the two is well-known.

	











I'm just curious, because Lennon's “Lost Weekend” has become such a massive part of his history, and feels like a key part of John & Yoko's story as a couple, why there's no mention of it at all here, even though you end on their reconciliation and Sean's birth?Well, to be honest, it's less about not wanting to get into that split and more about the structure of the film. Which was: They move into that apartment, they move out of that apartment. I deliberately felt like, I'm not going to bring in stuff from earlier and I'm not going to bring in stuff from later. This is their life in New York; I'm not going to do an extra chapter on him in Los Angeles. I was restricting myself formally. I'm not interviewing anyone. Other than the montages that represent what John and Yoko were watching on TV during that period, I'm not bringing in outside material. It was really, what does this archive tell us about their lives during this concentrated period?


	It was also about the recordings and footage I was working with as well. If I had had phone calls of her yelling at him and whatever, I would have put it in. If I had had great material on the Lost Weekend from John and Yoko's perspective, I probably would have extended the period covered in the film a little bit. I don't think the estate would have minded, to be honest — trust me, I've had my battles with musical estates before over material. But they were extremely generous and very hands-off overall. It was really down to, John and Yoko move into the into 105 Bank Street in October 1971, they move out in April 1973, and that's the movie. The only thing I have from after that period is them arriving at the Dakota, it's half-empty and he's playing the piano, and that's the end of the movie. I felt like you needed one small moment of their continuing life in New York after that tumultuous period of them arriving and finding their footing.


Did the estate have veto power on stuff?They gave me access to everything they had, so if there was something controversial they had been sitting on and there was some sort of idea that they could say “No” to stuff later, I wasn't aware of it. When I told Sean my original idea, his immediate response was: “My mother would love this idea! Go ahead and do it.” As someone who's a musician himself and a creative person, he loved the fact that it was playful and creative and not just a document of a performance, or reducing things to “John was this, Yoko was that.” But he did say something interesting to me. After I showed him a cut, he said “This is the only film I've seen that captures who my mother really was.” So that felt good to hear.


Let's talk about recreating the Bank Street apartment, and how you convinced your wife [production designer Tatiana Macdonald] to come out of retirement to do it?[Laughs] She'd retired about three years prior to us starting the documentary, and originally, I mentioned this idea to recreate the Bank Street apartment with as much fidelity as we could, and she thought, well, that doesn't sound like it would be that bad. You know, a couple working on a movie about a couple: “It'd be nice to work together.” And by the end of it, she was very much like, “Yeah, I remember why I retired now.” She said it was the hardest thing she's ever had to do.

	











I'm impressed that you're still married.I am, too. [Laughs] The thing is, when you're making a movie about a fictional pop star of the 1970s, you can decorate that star's apartment however you want, so long as it's period accurate. But we got a list of all the books and records and everything that was in their place, because the archive was so well-catalogued. And the actual apartment they lived in was just about to be demolished, plus the insurance rates of getting things over to where we'd built the apartment to exact specifications in England was prohibitively expensive. So we had to rely on a lot of problem-solving. For example, we had that quilt on their bed remade by hand — the real one still exists, but to get it shipped over from the United Sates was going to cost too much. We managed to get the guitars from collectors in the U.K. We had to go to Poland to find the exact amp Lennon had at the time. We couldn't find the exact TV they had, so we had to rebuild one from various components.


But you had the real blueprint of the apartment and photographs to work from?Yes, except there actually aren't a lot of photographs of the apartment itself — I mean, we probably had every one in existence, but there aren't that many. From what we had, however, we were able to recreate every bit of clutter, from the newspapers stuffed into the end of the bed to everything that's lying around on the floor. It was a pretty messy place, and I'm awe of the way my wife made you think you were walking into this messy apartment that had been preserved for the last 50 years.


There's also a big emphasis on what John and Yoko were watching on TV during that time frame.I just thought, Okay, this is going to be about their experience of America through television. John famously about his love for TV, and how they spent so much of those early years in that apartment taking in this view of America through the lens of TV. Keep in mind that in Britain, you had three channels, and everything switched off at midnight every night. Also, there was virtually no programming on in the afternoon. Then suddenly you're in a country like this fucking crazy proliferation of 120 channels. My grandparents are American, so I spent a good deal of time in the United States as a kid. And I just would spend my time in front of their television going click click, click, and looking at all the different things that were on. I thought with him being British, John obviously felt that same thing. There are lots of photographs of them meeting people in that apartment, everyone's sitting on that big bed, and the TV is on in the background. So I thought, let's make that place the center of the film. What's ironic is that television is partially responsible for them becoming more politicized, as they're seeing what America is up against, but —— It's also responsible for Lennon becoming extremely disillusioned about the idea of a rock star trying to change the world, which you emphasize by putting coverage of Nixon's election win in 1972 into the movie.Exactly! The fact that the newscaster is emphasizing not just that Nixon took the popular vote, he had something like 53% of the youth vote — that gutted Lennon, I think. And it's so weird how so much of what he's going through in the film resonates so much with the political situation right now. Isn't it so weird?

	











You read a lot about George Wallace's presidential campaign, but you kind of forget about just how populist his speeches were. And when the footage of them comes up in One to One and you hear them now…They sound very familiar, don't they. This is this sort of history on some sort of rinse and repeat cycle. What's struck me is that, as we were taking this film around on the festival circuit, a lot of young audiences, a lot of viewers in their teens and early 20s, have really responded to the film. There were post-screening Q&As where they said to me, this feels like this is about our world. There was a lot of that, as well: My God, I didn't know celebrities could be so politically engaged, and actually be on the front line and be at marches, and so on.


The entire idea of the connection between celebrity engagement and activism  — using fame for “good” — is a huge part of the film, right? Yes. It's a big part of Lennon's “second act,” I guess you'd call it.


After spending years sifting through this material and thinking about Lennon's political radicalization, do you feel like the relationship between Lennon and Jerry Ruben was totally transactional, or do you feel that's too simplistic?That's now kind of the accepted understanding of their relationship, though, isn't it? That Ruben was using Lennon, and Lennon's using him. But Lennon is also quite naïve about so much of what's happening. I think you really hear that on the recordings of his phone calls with Allen Klein. They become quite hilarious after a while. But I think that John — throughout his life, but particularly in this period — is trying to figure out who he is and what do you once you've been a Beatle? You know, you're 31 years old and one of the most famous people in the world. What the hell do you do next? How do you use that? Where do you go from there?


	I think he comes to this conclusion that political radicals are the new rock stars, and he's trying to figure out if Jerry is actually somebody who can teach him about political activism. I think the enthusiasm with which he embraces Ruben and brings him into the band, and when they're gonna do this whole idea of going on that “Free the People” tour. When he becomes part of the effort to free John Sinclair, he gets a taste of, Oh, maybe we actually can change the world. Then he becomes disillusioned politically, and rejects Jerry over the idea of political violence being some sort of end game.“But if you talk about destruction, then don't you know that you can count me out.”[Laughs] It's right there in the song! We actually toyed with adding “Revolution” into the film at one point, possibly as an end track. I don't want to say it felt a little too on the nose, but….Good call.When you have access to the full catalogue of Lennon's music, it's tempting to put a lot of songs in. There's a very kid-in-a-candy-store feeling that comes over you. I think the only Beatles track we use is “Come Together,” which makes a lot more sense. And I think in the version we use, he not talking about the Beatles coming together but about everyone coming together to make things work. Getting back to  the disillusionment factor… yeah, I think John felt that the movement was a failure. And then he eventually figures out that hey, I can do something about making the world a better place — which is, you know, raise money for these kids.

	











The “One to One” show did a lot to help raise both money and awareness for the institution, correct? Even if Lennon never performed a full solo concert again, he felt like this was both a personal and professional success?Yeah, it was a success in terms of raising money for the cause. But the reaction threw him a little bit, I think. When the reviews came back after ABC had broadcasted the show, the sort of general feeling was: Why does this look so bad? Why does this sound so muddy? And why the hell isn't he playing all the Beatles' tunes?! Those were the measures it was being judged on at the time. Which is insane, because you watch the footage now, and you see that he's so fucking good onstage up there, and so charismatic and entertaining, you really do think, “Why the hell didn't he do this more?”


Did you ever come up with an answer for that?Lennon himself said that he was suffering from stage fright during the show, which is partially why I think he never really did a full concert again. But I also think that when he saw the reviews tearing it apart, he thought, I'm not going to put myself through this if they can't appreciate what I'm trying to say up there. I will say that this was the one instance in which I seriously considered breaking the rule about not bringing in something from outside of the estate. If I'd found a TV interview where John had discussed his feelings about the show, I would have loved to have used that. We could only find written reviews from the New York Times and such, and I didn't just want to cut to a static headline.


Speaking of which: Can you talk a little bit about the way you visualized the phone calls, with that combination of the recordings and text on the screen?The idea was always that the more textures we have in the film, the better. And I thought that it's quite nice to take a break from the sort of the mayhem of all the archival stuff. So obviously, the conventional way to do it would be, you'd play those recordings over a clip of period footage, right? But I thought that actually, you want an audience to concentrate on what's being said and not be distracted. So we kept it simple. Plus there's enough wit and fun in all that back and forth that the conversations do engage you on their own. Not to mention that you're eavesdropping on these monumental figures. It's kind of like, Oh, I'm getting to hear Lennon talk to Allen Klein about organizing a tour or listen in on Yoko's assistant speaking to a gallery owner about one of her upcoming shows. This is kind of fascinating.


You learn so much about flies.Honestly, there were so many fucking calls about the flies. It went on and on. I've just got a tiny proportion of them in there. It's sort of shaggy dog story, isn't it? But it totally makes narrative sense.

Go on.Well, again, everyone had this idea of who Yoko was or is. But first and foremost, she's a real artist, who was very well-known in that world before she met John. And she's the sort of dedicated artist that is totally fixated on something like, “I have this idea, I want to have flies calling over a naked woman,” for whatever reason. What did that mean? I don't know what it meant. But then why should it mean anything? It's installation art, isn't it?! And to hear them debating the logistics of keeping these flies alive is hilarious, but it's also insightful. This is part of being a conceptual artist.

	











	I should say, it took a while to clean up the recordings — they were old, the quality wasn't great and because everyone was talking so fast, it made it impossible to hear things clearly. But like I said earlier, it's amazing what technology can do nowadays, and once we started going through them… I mean, it's a gold mine. To hear Yoko talking about what she went through in London, and the way she was treated, it's like, Well, of course they had to get out of London. Of course they had to come to a place where people weren't going fixate on them in that way. And that was New York City. That was they actually felt like they could be at home.

	Eric and Lyle Menendez appeared by video in a California courtroom Friday and scored a legal victory when a judge said their resentencing hearing will move forward as planned next week, despite fierce opposition from Los Angeles County's recently elected district attorney, Nathan Hochman.


	At a lengthy court hearing in Van Nuys, Judge Michael Jesic ruled that Hochman's decision last month to pull back on his predecessor's support for resentencing lacked a sufficient basis. After Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian argued that the brothers were still “hunkered down in their bunker of deception,” the judge said it wasn't enough to revoke the court's jurisdiction over the mater.


	“There's no new information. You presented all this argument [but] none of this is really new. They've stuck with their story since the beginning. None of this shocked me,” Judge Jesic said. “My decision is to deny the motion to withdraw. We're going to move forward.”

	











	Erik and Lyle did not address the court and looked straight ahead with serious expressions during most of the hearing. They were seated next to each other in front of a white cinderblock wall wearing matching blue shirts. When they heard the resentencing hearing would move ahead, Lyle nodded in the affirmative and Erik appeared to smile.


	The judge made his ruling shortly after watching a defense video in which Diane VanderMolen, one of the brothers' cousins, recalled staying at the Menendez home one summer when she was 16. She said an 8-year-old Lyle came into her room and said he was afraid to sleep alone because his father would come in and touch his genitals. VanderMolen also testified about the incident during the brothers' first trial. She was seated in the courtroom Friday along with more than a dozen other relatives supporting Erik and Lyle's release.


	“Wow, that really got me. I didn't know they were going to play that. I got really emotional,” VanderMolen told Rolling Stone after the hearing. “I'm so overjoyed with the judge's decision. This really is all about rehabilitation. I cannot imagine two better examples of people who deserve release. The programs for other inmates and the counseling they've done, it's amazing.”

	Hochman's predecessor, George Gascón, set the stage for possible resentencing and release when he made the bombshell announcement last October that he believed the brothers had paid their “debt” to society and should be given new sentences of 50 years to life. Erik and Lyle previously were sentenced to life without parole for killing parents José and Kitty Menendez inside the family's Beverly Hills mansion. If granted the sentence previously sought by Gascón, the brothers would be eligible for immediate parole.

	











	During the full-day hearing on Friday, Balian argued that Gascón's administration sought resentencing as a political stunt last October when he was 30 points down in the polls during his reelection bid against Hochman. Mark Geragos, the brothers' lead defense lawyer, countered that Hochman was the one playing politics. He claimed that once Hochman was sworn into office last December, he quickly “banished” the two deputy district attorneys who authored Gascón's resentencing motion and appointed Kathleen Cady — the private attorney who represented the brothers' lone relative opposed to resentencing — as head of the DA's Department of Victim Services. Geragos said Hochman then tried to pass the buck by holding a press conference where he essentially sent a “message” to California Gov. Gavin Newsom to “take this off my plate. I'm going to be the Nineties-ass Neanderthal.” (Newsom is weighing a separate clemency request from the brothers and has scheduled parole board hearings for June 13. Judge Jesic's ruling Friday does not affect the clemency effort.)

	Geragos called Balian's two hours of argument Friday a “dog and pony show” from a “DA elected as a throwback to the Nineties.” The tense hearing reached a boiling point shortly after Balian flashed a photo on the courtroom screen showing José and Kitty's dead bodies inside the den where they were killed. José was seated lifeless on a couch with his knee blown off. Kitty was on the floor beside him, covered in blood.


	“I think it's outrageous, with the victims' family populating this courtroom, that he flashed up a photo of the crime scene without any warning. He has no consideration whatsoever for the victims. I object on their behalf. They're being retraumatized by the DA for political purposes,” Geragos stood up and protested.


	“They're horrible photos, and I apologize,” Balian said. But he didn't back down. “These two caused it,” he said, referring to Erik and Lyle. He called the photo “important” evidence of the brothers' “carnage.”


	When the photo appeared on the screen, Sylvia Bolock, a niece of José Menendez, shut her eyes tight. Other relatives looked aghast. The courtroom was packed, with actor Cooper Koch, who played Erik in Ryan Murphy's 2024 Netflix series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, seated in the back row.


	For most of his presentation, with Hochman watching from the courtroom gallery, Balian argued the brothers aren't rehabilitated because they've yet to take full accountability for “the severity and depravity of their conduct.” He said regret was not the same as “responsibility.”

	











	“Have they expressed regret? Absolutely. It can't be easy to look down the barrel of a shotgun at your parents and pull the trigger. I'm sure they regret that,” Balian said. “I'm sure Lyle regrets re-loading and pressing the barrel into his mom's cheek. He pressed it into her flesh and released a hail of buckshot through her face.” Balian accused the brothers of still trying to “minimize” what they did. He claimed they've never owned up to writing “scripts” for witnesses to lie on their behalf. He pointed out that Lyle's ex-girlfriend testified that she refused to go along with his request that she accuse José of drugging and raping her. “They have not changed in the way they need to change,” Balian argued.


	But defense lawyer Alexandra Kazarian played yet another video that was a montage of Erik and Lyle speaking with news reporters after their convictions. In one clip, Erik said, “what we did was awful.” In another clip, Lyle said he had tremendous remorse.


	“It's just not true they have no insight or remorse,” Kazarian argued. She said the prosecution “has made up” the narrative they won't take responsibility. Geragos, meanwhile, said the whole point of California's resentencing law is to offer “hope” and a “carrot” to people incarcerated for crimes, so they have incentive to do the “hard work” to rehabilitate and not become every warden's worst nightmare. He said Erik and Lyle have become “remarkable human beings” behind bars, working on programs to teach meditation to other inmates, train guide dogs, paint murals, and create green spaces.


	Judge Jesic said the resentencing hearing set for next Thursday and Friday will give both prosecutors and the defense a chance to present their “phenomenal” arguments about whether the brothers deserve resentencing. He said his ruling Friday was not on the merits of the resentencing effort, just a reflection of his view the court should let the matter proceed.


	“Justice won over politics,” Geragos told reporters after the hearing. He was surrounded by Menendez family members who traded information about the flights they had to catch to get back home. Many have attended multiple hearings or meetings with prosecutors since October.


	At a hearing and in Jesic's courtroom last November, Kitty's 92-year-old sister Joan Andersen VanderMolen testified that she believes the brothers were molested by their father. “No child should have to endure what Erik and Lyle lived through at the hands of their father. It breaks my heart that my sister Kitty knew what was happening and did nothing about it, that we knew of,” she said under questioning by Geragos. “They never knew if tonight would be the night when they would be raped. … It's time for them to come home. No child should have to live day by day [wondering] if that night, their dad would come and rape them.”

	











	José's older sister, Teresita Baralt, 85, also testified in November. She said she loved her “baby brother” and that Kitty was her “best friend.” Still, through tears, she said “it's time for [her nephews] to come home.”


	“We miss those that are gone, tremendously, but we miss the kids too,” Baralt said on the witness stand in the Van Nuys courtroom. “I would like some leniency to have them back. Thirty-five years, it's a long time [to be in prison]. I think they have been rehabilitated. They have done a lot of good things. They went to college. They could have done a lot of bad things [while incarcerated]. They didn't.”  


	Baralt said Lyle lived with her family when he attended Princeton and that Erik was only three months older than her youngest daughter. She said visiting the brothers while they're housed at a California prison in San Diego is very difficult for her. “I would like to be able to see them and hug them, not in the jail. I want them to come home so I can hug them and see them. They were raised with [my four daughters]. It's been difficult,” she said.


	Lyle, 57, and Erik, 54, were young men at the time of the murders — 21 and 18, respectively. Gascón said he considered their ages at the time, as well as their good behavior behind bars, when he recommended re-sentencing.


	The brothers were convicted of firing more than a dozen shotgun shells at their parents inside the den of their mansion, including a blast to the back of their dad's head and the one to their mom's face. An initial televised trial ended with two hung juries — one for each brother. The brothers claimed during the first trial they were sexually abused by their entertainment-executive father and feared for their lives before opening fire because they'd had a heated confrontation with both parents that night regarding the family's alleged incest secret. “I thought my dad was going to come up to my room and have sex, and I thought they were going to kill us,” Erik testified at the first trial. Prosecutors told jurors the brothers were lying and had conspired to kill their parents with shotguns purchased two days earlier in San Diego using false identification. They said the brothers were greedy and wanted access to their parents' considerable wealth through early inheritance.


	At a second trial, the judge declined to allow cameras and ruled the brothers would share a single jury. He also limited the number of defense witnesses who could testify about the alleged abuse. On March 20, 1996, the jury on the second trial convicted Lyle and Erik of the first-degree murders of both parents with the special circumstance of lying in wait. It also found them guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. After a subsequent penalty phase, the jury spared the brothers the death penalty.

	











	After the convictions, journalist Robert Rand obtained a letter that Erik allegedly wrote to his cousin, Andy Cano, eight months before the murders, when he was 17. In the letter excerpted in a subsequent habeas petition, Erik described being abused by his father and how fearful he was. “It's still happening Andy but it's worse for me now,” Erik wrote. “I never know when it's going to happen and it's driving me crazy. Every night I stay up thinking he might come in. … He's warned me a 100 times about telling anyone.” (Andy Cano is now deceased.)

	In his 2023 Peacock docuseries, Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed, Rand also detailed new allegations from Roy Rossello, a former member of the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo. In the documentary, Rossello claimed that José had sexually abused him, too.


	Speaking in court Friday, Geragos said he planned to call Rossello as a witness next week.

	As Your Friends & Neighbors debuted on Friday, Olivia Munn opened up about her starring role alongside Jon Hamm and Amanda Peet, while also sharing her experience fighting and recovering from cancer. 


	When speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Munn recalled nearly stepping away from acting all-together before landing the role on the Apple TV+ series. “I called my agents and my manager and said, ‘I'm done being in front of the camera — don't put me up for anything,'” recalled Munn, who had considered transitioning into editing, producing, or writing after feeling unfulfilled in her acting career.


	However, Munn was intrigued by the idea of taking part in a sharp commentary of America's uber-wealthy. “There's a carelessness with which they live their life,” Munn told The Times. “They feel impervious to the world and it's so fascinating to watch these people crumble.” She called her newly single character Sam — who is going through a bitter divorce and is Andrew Cooper's (played by Hamm) friends-with-benefits — a “survivor,” explaining that she'll  “do anything to maintain her place and take care of her children.” 

	











	Show creator Jonathan Tropper told The Times that Munn will joining Season Two of Your Friends & Neighbors. “We had originally planned for that character as a one-season character,” he shared, “but after working with her for a little while, I think we had consensus across the board, we wanted her.”

	Munn also discussed overcoming her insecurities while filming sex scenes with Hamm after going public about her cancer diagnoses and receiving treatment. “I was really nervous about doing any sex scenes because I have a lot of scars,” she said. “Scars that can be seen in clothing and scars that you wouldn't know unless I was completely nude.”


	However, Munn said the scenes were key to portraying the relationship between the two characters, and wanted to show that her character “wants something so much more from him than he's willing to give and their only connection is through sex.” She added, “I wanted the sex scenes to feel like sex scenes — I wanted them to feel visceral and intense and not hold back at all.”


	While working with an intimacy coordinator, Munn filmed the scenes and said, “I did feel insecure, but each time I did it, I felt better.”

	Munn, who is now cancer-free, said, “I'm so grateful for my body because it got me through this.”

Tucked away in the Pennines lies the quaint market town of Todmorden, once a thriving hub of the cotton industry during the Industrial Revolution.

Fast forward to modern times, and it's not the echoes of its bustling past that are causing a stir but rather its newfound reputation as a centre for unexplained UFO phenomena.

It all began back in 1980 with a rather macabre incident: the body of coalminer Zigmund Adamski from Tingley turned up on a Todmorden coal pile seven days after he vanished, bearing unexplained burns on his head, shoulder, and neck, leaving the cause of these injuries shrouded in mystery.

The extraterrestrial whispers started when Police Constable Alan Godfrey commented that Adamski seemed to have been ""frightened to death.""

Confronted with speculation about alien abduction, Godfrey responded to press queries saying, ""I am open-minded. I can't rule it out.""

Just half a year on from the Adamski conundrum, Godfrey himself encountered the inexplicable. While investigating reports of stray cattle on a Todmorden estate, the now ex-officer witnessed an enigmatic bright light in the skies, which he likened to a ""rotating diamond-shaped object."", reports the Express.

Attempting to call for assistance was futile; his radio refused to function. Suddenly, the object disappeared, and Godfrey realized he was standing 30 yards from where he had been moments before, sporting a torn boot and a peculiar, itchy red mark on his foot.

He also had a half-hour memory gap. Later, under hypnosis, he alleged that he briefly woke up in a room where he was being medically examined by what seemed to be extraterrestrials - though he conceded in 2018 that this was likely a dream.

Following his UFO encounter and assertions of potential alien abduction of Adamski, Godfrey says he was introduced to a man who professed to be ""from the ministry"" and made him pledge under the Official Secrets Act not to disclose what he had witnessed.

Godfrey then alleges to have encountered this man several more times until he finally confronted him in a pub, telling him to ""clear off.""

He never saw the man again but later expressed his belief that this enigmatic individual had been an MI5 Agent.

In the years following these events, Godfrey claims he was compelled to resign from the police force. He has since penned a self-published book detailing his alien encounters.

However, UFO sightings in the area have persisted, and 40 years after Godfrey's account of the ""spinning diamond"", local resident Vicky Dinsdale asserts that she too spotted this UFO just a few months after the former police officer.

(NewsNation) — Newly released video shows ‘tic tac' UFOs that U.S. sailors observed in February 2023 coming from the water off the southern California coast. Ben Hansen, host of “UFO Witness” on Discovery+, tells “Banfield” that UFO activity has long been observed in the area, which features a deep-sea channel.

A new 2023 Navy-recorded video shows a sleek, wingless object darting over the California coast—eerily similar to past military sightings.

Representative pic

Oval, white, and featureless—the “Tic-Tac” UFO glides with no visible propulsion, rewriting our idea of how flight is supposed to work.

Representative pic

The object's motion defies known physics—hovering, shifting, accelerating. Experts say no known aircraft could mimic these moves.

Representative pic

Captured aboard a Navy ship, the footage adds credibility to claims that UAPs are monitored regularly by trained military observers.

Documentary filmmaker Jeremy Corbell, a key voice in UAP disclosure, emphasizes this sighting's strange and urgent significance.

This video follows a string of declassified clips released by the Pentagon—an official pivot toward transparency and public awareness.

Lawmakers are paying attention. UAP hearings are now routine, with military officials breaking decades of silence under oath.

Gone are the tinfoil hats—credible sightings like these are shifting public perception and pushing policy toward serious investigation.

Are they drones, foreign tech, or something else entirely? With every new video, the UAP mystery deepens—and answers feel closer.

Liam Coen was one of the top head coaching candidates on the market this year after an impressive year as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offensive coordinator. The Jaguars showed strong interest in Coen during their search for a head coach, setting up an interview with him on Wednesday.

He turned down that opportunity and was set to sign a lucrative three-year deal with the Bucs to make him the highest-paid coordinator in the NFL, but he never put pen to paper.

That's when the Jaguars pulled the “break glass in case of emergency” card and fired GM Trent Baalke, making one last push to hire Coen as their head coach. Fast-forward to Thursday and they've landed their guy.

According to reports, Coen is expected to be hired as the Jaguars' next head coach. It was a bizarre turn of events, particularly considering the Buccaneers were unable to reach Coen on Thursday after he left to take the interview with the Jaguars.

Furthermore, his contract with the Buccaneers was reportedly contingent on him not taking a second interview with Jacksonville – but he never signed it, so he never breached the contract.

Coen had two different stints with the Rams. He was the assistant wide receivers coach from 2018-2019 before being promoted to assistant quarterbacks coach in 2020. He then left for Kentucky in 2021, returned to the Rams as Sean McVay's offensive coordinator in 2022, went back to Kentucky in 2023 and then landed with the Buccaneers in 2024.

So, yeah, he's made a few stops in the last five years.

BEING a city well known for its often turbulent history, Carlisle has more than its fair share of supposedly haunted locations.

But a group of ghost hunters are offering the public a chance to join them to explore an as-yet uninvestigated Grade-II Listed building in Carlisle for signs of paranormal activity.

Paranormal Investigations Crew, led by Carlisle-based Sarah Simmons, has organised a ticketed ghost hunt event at Currock Community Centre on Lediard Avenue on Saturday, May 10.

Ticketholders will be able to join Sarah and the team for five and a half hours from 7.30pm until 1am to explore the imposing building.

Members of the team, including Sarah, will attempt to contact spirits using psychic abilities, as well as various gadgets used by ghost hunters around the globe to detect presences from the afterlife.

Tickets are £30 per person, with no under-18s allowed.

Built in 1842, Currock Community Centre is a Victorian Grade-II-Listed building.

On October 6, 1934, it was handed over to be run as a community centre, one of the first in England and the first of its kind in Carlisle.

The site was originally known as ""Cuddick,"" an early name for Currock, appearing on Greenwoods Map of Cumberland from 1823, and was occupied by William Carruthers and his wife Sarah according to the census.

It was bought in 1932 by Carlisle corporation and the house was due to be demolished to build new housing estates, however the stables were partially demolished and the house left, as a committee ran by volunteers convinced Carlisle corporation to use the building as a community centre.

The building was not accessible by road until the late 1930s, until which time, visitors would often have to wade through thick mud to reach it.

For a short period this building also served as the YHA hostel for Carlisle.

A settlement dating back around 3,400 years has been discovered near the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Archaeologists in Egypt have uncovered the remains of a ""major"" 3,400-year-old town dating to the New Kingdom that was possibly built by King Tutankhamun's father and later added to by Ramesses II, a new study finds.

The settlement was found at the site of Kom el-Nugus in northern Egypt, about 27 miles (43 kilometers) west of Alexandria on a rocky ridge between the Mediterranean Sea and Lake Mariout. Previously, Egyptologists thought the site was not inhabited until later times, when the Greeks founded their own settlement and necropolis there around 332 B.C., during Egypt's Hellenistic period.

Researchers found the older ancient Egyptian settlement while they were studying the Greek one. An unexpected discovery of mudbrick dating to the New Kingdom (circa 1550 to 1070 B.C.) revealed the earliest known Egyptian settlement north of Lake Mariout, according to the study, which was published Jan. 23 in the journal Antiquity.

It's not clear exactly how large the settlement was, ""but the quality of the remains, their planned organization around a street, could suggest a fairly large-scale occupation,"" study author Sylvain Dhennin, an archaeologist with the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), told Live Science in an email. The street was designed to drain surface water and protect buildings from water erosion.

""There was a temple, built by King Ramses II, as well as private funerary chapels, which mention military personnel,"" said Dhennin, who is leading excavations at the site. ""If the settlement was indeed military in nature, it's possible that there was also a fortified wall and administrative buildings.""

One particularly interesting find is a stamp on part of an amphora jar that has the name of Merytaton (also spelled Meritaten) on it. Merytaton was the daughter of the pharaoh Akhenaten (reign 1349 to 1336 B.C.) and his wife Nefertiti. Akhenaten unleashed a religious revolution that tried to focus Egypt's religion around the worship of Aten, the sun disk. His son, King Tutankhamun (ruled circa 1336 to 1327 B.C.), later brought back Egypt's traditional polytheistic religion.

""The presence of this stamp probably indicates the production of wine belonging to a royal estate"" that dates back to the time of Merytaton, Dhennin said. ""The vineyards on the margins of Egypt were probably protected by the military and formed part of a pioneering front to occupy this region towards the desert,"" he said, noting that it's possible that this settlement was founded during the reign of Akhenaten.

Roger Forshaw, an honorary lecturer at the KNH Centre for Biomedical Egyptology at the University of Manchester who was not involved with the research, praised the team's work and noted that the ""the presence of a temple underscores its strategic and cultural importance.""

Forshaw also noted the sophisticated design of the street. ""This street was ingeniously designed with a water-collecting system to drain surface water and protect the fragile mudbrick walls,"" Forshaw said.

Excavations at the site are ongoing, and Dhennin said they may help reveal how large the settlement was and when exactly it was founded. Another question is what Egyptians called the settlement in ancient times.

Iran and the United States will hold more negotiations next week over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.

American officials offered no immediate comment on the talks. However, Iran's state-run broadcaster revealed that U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi ""briefly spoke"" together — the first time the two nations have done that since the Obama administration.

Tehran likely speeded out its public announcement ahead of a possible Trump post on a social media. But declaring that the two sides spoke face-to-face — even if briefly — suggests the negotiations went well even to Iranian state TV, which long has been controlled by hard-liners. Araghchi announced the next round would take place Saturday, April 19.

This first round of talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local. The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location in the outskirts of Muscat, Oman's capital, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff returned to Muscat before disappearing into traffic around a neighborhood that is home to the U.S. Embassy.

The stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.

Associated Press journalists saw a convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff leave the Omani Foreign Ministry on Saturday afternoon and then speed off into the outskirts of Muscat. The convoy went into a compound and a few minutes later, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the ""indirect talks"" had begun.

Afterward, Araghchi described the meeting as constructive to Iranian state TV, with four rounds of messages exchanged during the indirect portion.

""Neither we nor the other side are interested in fruitless negotiations — so-called 'talks for the sake of talks,' wasting time, or drawn-out, exhausting negotiations,"" he said. ""Both sides, including the Americans, have said that their goal is also to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time. However, that will certainly not be an easy task.""

That the two men spoke face-to-face satisfied a demand of the Americans. Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being ""direct.""

""I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,"" Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. ""That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.""

He added: ""Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponization of your nuclear capability.""

Araghchi, however, sought to downplay the encounter as ""a brief initial conversation, greetings and polite exchanges"" — likely to avoid drawing the anger of hard-liners in Iran.

Badr al-Busaidi, Oman's foreign minister who shuttled between the two sides, said the countries have a ""shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.""

""I would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement, which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability,"" al-Busaidi wrote on X. ""We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal.""

While the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran's beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran's stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%.

One thing it won't do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution — ""you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution"" — unworkable.
