                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Autonomous robotics startup Cartken, known for its four-wheeled robots that deliver food on college campuses and through Tokyo's bustling streets, has found a new area of focus: industrials. Cartken co-founder and CEO Christian Bersch told TechCrunch that applying its delivery robots to industrial settings was always in the back of his mind as they built the startup. When companies started reaching out about using their robots in factories and labs, Cartken took a closer look. “What we found is that actually there's a real big need in industrial and onsite use cases,” said Bersch, who co-founded the startup along with other former Google engineers behind the Bookbot project. In 2023, the startup landed its first big industrial customer, German manufacturing company ZF Lifetec. Initially, ZF Lifetec used its existing delivery robots, called the Cartken Courier, which can hold 44 pounds and resembles an Igloo cooler on wheels. At the time, Cartken was still pressing ahead on its delivery sidewalk business, including locking in partnerships with Uber Eats and GrubHub for its last-mile delivery operations across U.S. college campuses and in Japan. But that early success with ZF, encouraged the startup founders, which includes Jake Stelman, Jonas Witt and Anjali Naik, to expand its business model. Switching Cartken's robots from food delivery to an industrial setting, wasn't much of a challenge, Bersch said. This means the robots can travel between indoor and outdoor settings. “We have a navigation stack that is parameterizable for different robot sizes,” Bersch said. Melco Mobility Solutions, a company under the Mitsubishi umbrella, just announced that it will be buying nearly 100 Cartken Hauler robots for use in Japanese industrial facilities. “All these companies typically have people moving stuff from one building to another, whether it's being by hand, on a cart ,or a small forklift, and that is really what we're targeting.” Cartken will still continue its food and consumer last-mile delivery business, but it won't be expanding it, Bersch said, adding they still do a lot of testing for new capabilities on these existing last-mile delivery routes.

AMD has finally caught up to Nvidia's latest DLSS technologies with its recent FSR 4 update. For years, the Green Team have dominated upscaling, delivering near-native quality while boosting frame rates. Nvidia took the AI route from the start, training its neural networks on massive datasets, so each iteration improved automatically, even without manual intervention. FSR, by contrast, relied on traditional techniques — until this year, when FSR 4 finally made the jump to an AI-driven approach as well. One such app is OptiScaler — previously known as CyberXeSS — and it works to replace upscalers in a game with a different one that might be better in certain scenarios. For instance, if the game supports FSR 2 and was never updated beyond that, OptiScaler can take that FSR 2 input and convert it to DLSS, XeSS, or upconvert it to a newer version of FSR. And now, it supports FSR 4... as long as the game isn't running on Vulkan API or needs an anti-cheat. Apart from replacing upscalers, OptiScaler can also, by extension, replace frame-gen tech and even handle anti-lag features like Nvidia Reflex. Firstly, it's not a simple toggle that you can enable in some GUI. You have to manually tweak files for every single game, and then further mess around with some settings in order to get the best experience possible. In contrast, over 125 games have DLSS 4 (with frame gen) as of May 2025, alone. With OptiScaler, you can now take that number way higher on the AMD side. Of course, you need an RX 9000-series card in order to even get FSR 4 as only those GPUs have the necessary hardware (AI accelerators) for it. As long as you meet those prerequisites, and you're comfortable configuring a few options yourself — moving around DLLs and such — FSR 4 can be all yours, ever before AMD seems to start caring about it on a serious level. If the community with barely any resources can do it, a billion-dollar corporation should certainly be able to as well. For now, though, this is our best bet, without spending money on alternatives like Lossless Scaling. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thingiverse is cracking down on gun-related models using a new automated system. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. As much as we love 3D printing, there's no denying the dangerous potential that comes with something like a modern 3D printer. According to ABC, Thingiverse is now implementing a new strategy to stop users from uploading things like gun-related files before they're openly distributed on the platform. This effort comes in response to an investigation handled by the New York Police Department (NYPD). The NYPD came across hundreds of weapon-related files on Thingiverse that could be downloaded by users and presumably 3D printed. Thingiverse is one of the largest websites for downloading 3D printable model files. ABC argues its rapid growth and subsequent jump in scale made it harder for the team to regulate these types of files. Thingiverse is now responding with a new "automated technology" designed to block the upload of dangerous files, like guns and gun-related components, before they're published. They do, however, want to make the process of finding ghost gun files as hard as possible and have decided to address one of the biggest sources for 3D printable CAD files in their efforts to help make that happen. Bragg requested Bambu Lab consider implementing an AI-driven system that checks CAD files against a model trained on gun blueprints to automatically detect gun-shaped parts. We don't recommend 3D printing any weapons, and already tried 3D printing a gun for ourselves if you want to see how that turned out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The new console continues to balance on-the-go handheld gaming with big-screen TV play, remains backward compatible with most Switch games, and adds more retro games to its digital library with the arrival of classic GameCube games. That variety makes for several ways to play. From the upgraded Joy-Con 2 grips that introduce point-and-click mouse controls alongside the familiar motion tracking features, to the dedicated Switch 2 Pro Controller for players who want a more traditional joypad to hand, there's already no shortage of controller options for Switch 2—but what's the best? Want to play retro titles in the most authentic way possible? Read our Best Switch 2 Accessories guide for more. Sure, you get a pair of these miniature marvels with the Switch 2 itself, but given that the new console remains as heavily focused on multiplayer as the original, you may want some extras. While you're more likely to pick up Joy-Con 2s in pairs, Nintendo does sell them individually, useful for replacements. They're larger—an approximate 14 percent increase in size—making them more comfortable for larger hands, and their buttons are slightly bigger to match. When using one Joy-Con 2 as a single controller, the integrated SL and SR shoulder buttons are more prominent, while the gyroscopic motion detection and “HD Rumble 2” haptic motors are improved. Thumbsticks on both Joy-Con 2s feel smoother, although there's still no use of Hall effect or tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) to eliminate drift risk. Don't throw out your original Switch Joy-Cons just yet, though, especially if you plan on keeping older games around. While the Switch 2's backwards compatibility is near-universal, there are a handful of titles that won't work with the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Thankfully, classic Joy-Cons will easily pair wirelessly with the new console, allowing you to keep playing the likes of Ring Fit Adventure, WarioWare: Move It!, and several Nintendo Labo kits well into the future. If you've gotten rid of your original Switch but want to keep some OG controllers around, pick up a separate charging dock, like PowerA's Joy-Con Charging Stand, which can keep up to four grips juiced up and ready to go. Don't forget that these controllers were also notorious for stick drift, and while Nintendo hasn't assuaged concerns with the newer Joy-Con 2 controllers, it has specifically said that they've been redesigned from the ground up for better long-term durability. However, this is crammed with clever adjustments and design tweaks that make it feel substantially different from its predecessor. Chiefly, it feels smaller in the hand thanks to slimmed-down grips that sit at a slightly tighter angle. It only weighs 11 grams less than its predecessor—235 versus 246—but seems much lighter. Subtler but still impactful tweaks include larger face buttons, and smoother, more responsive thumbsticks—although these still don't use Hall effect or TMR technology, meaning drift remains a risk. It feels great to hold, though, thanks to an almost seamless design, a choice that has the benefit of leaving few ridges or component joins where hand sweat can accumulate after long play sessions. These inputs can be customized on a per-game basis—simply hold down the Home button, and they can be remapped on the fly. These upgrades come at a literal cost, but this is one of the best ways to play on Switch 2. This third-party offering from peripheral maker PowerA offers one big upgrade over Nintendo's controllers: Hall effect technology. Not only does that remove any risk of dreaded drifting on its thumbsticks, but it makes for better, more reliable performance, as the sensors can far more accurately track the degree of movement applied to the sticks. It also features a 3.5-mm audio jack, but goes one better with onboard audio controls, allowing you to adjust headset volume, mute your microphone, and switch between three equalizer modes—standard, bass boost, and immersive (though overall audio quality will depend on your headset). It's a wired-only controller and must be connected to the Switch 2 dock, and although it comes with a 3-meter (10-foot) cable, that still limits range. It also lacks HD rumble or motion control features, and there's no NFC reader built in, meaning it can't read Amiibo figures. Still, for the performance boost thanks to that elusive Hall effect, this is a strong alternative to the Pro Controller—especially at this price. The launch of Switch 2 brings with it a selection of retro GameCube games for subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online service. As it did for the NES, SNES, N64, and even Sega Genesis/Mega Drive when games from those platforms joined the library, Nintendo has released a perfect recreation of the original controller, allowing you to play those classic games as authentically as possible. For anyone who was gaming when the GameCube was first around, it's slightly surreal to now have a perfect recreation of the original controller that's wireless but not the bulkier WaveBird model. It's no bad thing, though, and decades-old muscle memory will soon kick in. Younger players might find the unusually-shaped controller odd at first, with its tiny nub of a C-Stick and its chunky, rounded shoulder triggers, but after a few laps of F-Zero GX, you soon realize how perfectly tailored the controller was for its games. That helps make this GameCube pad broadly compatible with some modern Switch and Switch 2 games, though not a perfect match—the Start button here mimics the Switch 2's plus (+) button, there's nothing to replicate the minus (-) button, and it lacks newer features such as clickable thumbsticks. However, availability is a problem for this controller. It's only available directly from Nintendo's online store, can only be purchased if you have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription, and is limited to one unit per account in the US, but two per account in the UK. While that will do in a pinch if you want to play games sitting on the couch, with the console docked to your TV, the official Nintendo Charging Grip offers a few noteworthy upgrades. As with that pad, they can be customized on a per-game basis, but in my tests, it doesn't seem to remember settings between play sessions. Being able to quickly attach and detach the Joy-Con 2s is also great for any games that switch between various control modes. In terms of design and ergonomics, it has some weaknesses, though. A translucent shell is an odd decision given nothing else about Switch 2 takes that approach, while the front of the grips—where the base of your thumbs rest—is flat rather than rounded, with an edge that can dig in after a while. Not strictly controllers in their own right, these shells allow you to slot in a single Joy-Con 2, turning them into miniature steering wheels. Sold in pairs, these are laser-focused on racing game fans—realistically, Mario Kart World, but sci-fi racer Fast Fusion will make good use of them too, and make the motion controls feel that bit more intuitive. That makes them comfortable enough for older players, but likely to be most appealing to younger players who will enjoy properly “driving” around with these. They're undeniably a gimmicky purchase, and there's a paucity of games where you're likely to get much use from them, but the Joy-Con 2 Wheels are a nice addition to any living room racing tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla opened the doors to its first showroom in India this week, and among the first visitors was Vishal Gondal — a longtime Tesla and Elon Musk loyalist who pre-booked a Model 3 in April 2016, just hours after reservations went live. But despite showing up on day one, Gondal says he has no plans to buy a Tesla now. “I felt a little bit underwhelmed,” said Gondal, founder and CEO of fitness-tech startup GOQii, after visiting the maiden Tesla showroom in Mumbai's Bandra-Kurla Complex. Over the better part of a decade, Gondal held out hope for Tesla's debut in India. But his excitement soured when he had to chase the company for a refund in 2023 — sending multiple emails just to get his $1,000 reservation fee. “Trying to get the money back was a problem,” he told TechCrunch. Gondal is among the earliest backers of Tesla in India — someone who pre-booked a vehicle long before there were any guarantees. But nine years on, it seems many of those early believers are not celebrating the launch and have instead made up their mind not to go with Tesla, at least on its debut. And some, like Gondal, even waited and tried hard for years to get the refund, while some got it in May, just a couple of months before Tesla's formal debut. I mean, our government and processes and red carpet are hard, but it's hilarious that even Starlink has gotten approval in a shorter period,” said Varun Krishnan, who runs tech blog FoneArena from Chennai and is also one of Tesla's early backers in India. The video received comments from dozens of people who had also reserved the Model 3 in India and were waiting for a refund, he said. “Those people really went out of their way, and even though let's say it's not a big amount, it was saying that we support Tesla.” Some others, like Kawaljit Singh Bedi, said they have no regrets about supporting Tesla, although they received the refund just before the launch this year. Nevertheless, they are also not looking to buy a Tesla soon. “After all these years I have waited, I'm in no hurry to buy it now and become the first one to have it, because what's the point? “People like Vishal or Vijay, they are taken with a lot of authority. So, if they are buying something, there would be 100 people going by their word.” Sharma, founder and CEO of Indian fintech giant Paytm, echoed comments from other early backers, telling TechCrunch that he would not go with Tesla and would rather wait for a larger portfolio of cars. “There are so many other options with price-value math more suited for India.” The years-long delay in Tesla's launch — along with not being invited to the showroom opening — has left some of the brand's earliest Indian loyalists feeling let down, said Arun Bhatt, founder of Tesla Club India, who also pre-booked a Model 3 in 2016 “You paid something and you ardently waited for 10 years, and then out of the blue, they just tell you, we'll cancel it and we'll refund, then what happens — 10 years having waited for something, will we be given preferential treatment?” he questioned. Bhatt started the club with another Tesla enthusiast and Delhi University student, Nikhil Chaudhary, in 2019 as an informal group for people having an interest in the EV carmaker. The company announced that it would establish eight charging stations, equally distributed across Delhi and Mumbai, before starting its deliveries in Q3. Additionally, there are no announcements regarding how Tesla plans to handle after-sales service of its cars in India. I'm more worried about practical things than just the Tesla brand tag, which I fell in love with 10 years ago,” said Krishnan of FoneArena. “There is no real excitement to own the first car, knowing that there is no Supercharger network also,” Bedi of Frammer AI said. Kunal Khattar, an EV-focused investor in India and founder of VC firm AdvantEdge Founders, echoed Krishnan's sentiment, saying Tesla has lost “a little bit of its shine” due to several factors — including Musk's political involvement, his alignment with Trump, and the public fallout that followed. “People used to think Tesla is saving the world, it's saving the climate, and this and that, it's no longer there,” he said. Tesla has launched the Model Y in India, starting at ₹59,89,000 (approximately $68,000). In India, the premium segment, which starts from ₹35,00,000 (approximately $40,700) and goes up to ₹1,00,00,000 (approximately $116,200), comprises just 1% of the total car sales in India, roughly 50,000 vehicles. However, in that 1%, electric cars have almost a 10% share so far, per Puneet Gupta, director, S&P Global Mobility. “With Tesla coming in, and if Tesla really starts manufacturing in India, maybe two years down the line, there is no doubt about it that it will make a strong case for all these OEMs [original equipment manufacturers], including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi, to make a vehicle for our Indian customer for the first time,” he said. “The problem is that India has never been able to convince these OEMs that they can really make an India-centric product, and it will have sufficient volumes.” But it was “almost negligible” in 2016, when Tesla initially announced its entry. This was also the reason why people showed a lot of interest in Tesla back then. “These days, everyone can get a beautiful, amazing, super powerful electric vehicle in India. So, Tesla is not something ‘wow' worthy, except for 5-10 minutes, people should ask to just take a look inside it,” Bhawani of PhoneRadar said. India's automobile giant Tata Motors has dominated the country's electric car market in recent years, though others — including China's MG Motor, which recently signed a joint venture with Indian conglomerate JSW Group — are starting to gain ground. “People will at least put EVs in their consideration set. I don't think so … Will Tesla increase the sales of other EV brands? Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

Microsoft has reportedly added a new feature to the latest Windows Insider build that lets you play its output across multiple devices or speakers. X (formerly Twitter) user phantomofearth shared screenshots that showed a new ‘Shared audio' button in the Quick Settings panel beside the ‘Project' button (that's already widely available on Windows 11 devices). When clicked, it reveals a selection of audio devices connected to your computer. At the moment, Windows does not support a native way of outputting audio to multiple different devices. A workaround involving the built-in Stereo Mix feature often does not work and can result in unwanted audio feedback. There are some third-party apps you can download, like OBS, Voicemeeter, or Audio Router, but they can get complicated and a bit too difficult for most people who simply want to share their audio experience. Unfortunately, this new feature remains undocumented by Microsoft — even in the latest Windows Insider Blog — meaning it's not yet an official or confirmed feature that is on the way to the wider Windows user base. We also don't know if it works with just physically connected speakers, or if it's also compatible with multiple Bluetooth devices. Nevertheless, we hope that this makes it through Beta testing and into mainstream release, as it's a great feature for laptops and gaming handhelds. If you want to get your hands on this feature (and several more that Microsoft experiments with) in advance, you need to sign up for Windows Insider and join the Canary Channel. However, these are often the most unstable builds of Windows that haven't been thoroughly tested yet (remember, you're the one doing the testing), so you might run into unexpected issues if you have these updates turned on. It's also not a guarantee that you'll get the ‘Shared audio' feature or any other features you might find other Insiders people have, especially as Microsoft may push updates to different devices randomly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Artificial intelligence is now more pervasive than ever in the apps and gadgets we use day to day, and that of course extends to smartphones: Google Gemini on Pixels and other Android handsets, Apple Intelligence (currently still rolling out) on iPhones, and Galaxy AI on Samsung smartphones. These tools can help you refine text, generate images, and summarize documents, among other tricks, and you don't have to go far through your apps to find an AI feature ready and willing to help you with something. With Samsung Galaxy AI, you have the option to disable the AI features you don't want to use, or switch off artificial intelligence altogether. There are generative AI editing tools for your photos, and generative AI writing options for your emails and messages. If you're not happy with the way a block of text reads or the way a picture is looking, you can deploy some Galaxy AI magic and make changes with a few well-chosen prompts. Galaxy AI is only ever a few taps away. Samsung says that all Galaxy AI data is securely encrypted and protected from prying eyes, though of course no security protection can ever be guaranteed to be fully 100 percent effective all of the time. You can find the full Samsung privacy policy online. On Galaxy smartphones, you've got the option to turn off some or all of these features. You get a full list of what the AI can do on Samsung phones, and it might be more comprehensive than you realized: everything from transcribing voice recordings to giving you personalized insights into your fitness data. Tap on any of these Galaxy AI features to make changes. You also get descriptions for how your data is managed. Open Galaxy AI from Settings on a Samsung Galaxy S25 phone, and you'll see a Process data only on device toggle switch at the bottom of the AI feature list. These phones have Snapdragon 8 Elite chipsets inside them, with powerful enough AI processing capabilities to take care of some jobs without transferring data to and from the cloud. That's some jobs, not all jobs; you'll see that some of the features are no longer available when you flick the toggle switch for on-device processing. Samsung doesn't provide a definitive list of which features can work without the cloud, but automatic summaries and generative AI editing are among those mentioned as needing internet access. On-device processing is more private, but limits some features. There are also a few Process data only on device toggle switches available inside the Galaxy AI feature menus—there's one for Writing assist, for example. Overall, there's a good amount of control here, letting you strike your preferred balance between Galaxy AI features, software bloat, and data privacy.

Those doing the printing want to keep the manufacturing source a secret, while forensic investigators like Kirk Garrison from the San Bernardino Sheriff's department are looking to find any sort of "fingerprints" left behind by nefarious manufacturers. An interview with Garrison shared by 404 Media suggests he may have found a way to link 3D printed objects, like ghost gun components, to specific printers. In the interview, Garrison explained how he recently began looking for ways that forensics investigators might be able to identify printers by any traces left behind in the objects they print. So far, he's had success in identifying key signatures, also known as toolmarks, found consistently from specific 3D printers. If you're not familiar with the term toolmark, it refers to a type of mark found on an object that's left by the maker and or one of the tools used in its manufacturing process. Using this, he was able to find matching characteristics in other objects, suggesting they were printed by the same printer and possibly even the same batch. However, it can help narrow down information during investigations. There are also many factors like extruder size, nozzle temperature and bed type that can impact the look of the final object. It's also hard to determine when an object was printed using a different printer or if it was printed from the same one but in a different location on the print bed. This type of forensic study is brand new and unexplored. Whether or not it turns into a useful foray has to be seen, but Garisson is for sure one of the brilliant minds asking questions and leading the way.

Amazon has barely had time to catch its breath with Prime Day, and already it is launching Back to School deals with a new wave of discounts. Right now, Amazon is featuring the Anker 2-Pack 20W fast USB-C charger at its lowest price ever: Normally $19, with a coupon applied at checkout, this set drops to only $12 which is a savings of over 32%. For less than the cost of a single charger from many brands, you're getting two high-quality blocks plus two 5-foot USB-C cables. These wall charger blocks give you a maximum of 20W fast charging power each, and that's precisely what you require for the latest iPhone models (like the iPhone 16, 16 Pro Max, and more) and really any other more recent Apple device. The blocks are also universal for a wide selection of other devices including the iPad Pro, AirPods, Android phones, tablets, and even some small laptops. You can charge two devices at once without slowing down which is perfect if you're working with a phone and a wireless earbud case for instance. Having both ports available to use simultaneously enables you to have your tech ready for the needs of all day, and it makes life a little bit easier where power outlets are limited. Safety is of the highest concern with this Anker pack: Each charger has Anker's MultiProtect safe system which safeguards your devices using advanced temperature control, overcurrent protection, and short-circuit prevention. At $12 for a pair of chargers and cables, it's hard to find something better or more useful in your daily tech setup before the new term begins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once a home computing giant across the US and Europe, the company was undone by mismanagement and misfires. The carcass was picked clean and the pieces resold so many times that it was hard to keep track, but with each new owner came the inevitable—an attempt to make a fast buck by slapping the famous C= logo on any old junk. So when retro gaming YouTuber Christian “Perifractic” Simpson announced he wanted to buy what remained of Commodore and give it a new life, questions were asked. Chief among them: does the world still even need Commodore? Commodore as a brand initially focused on typewriters and calculators, but its glory days arrived with the rise of home micros, causing a swift rebirth as Commodore International Computing. While the CPU was sluggish, powerful graphics and a surprisingly capable sound chip (which remains revered today) spurred creativity on both sides of the Atlantic. It's this legacy Simpson aims to revive. Initially, he sought a licensing deal with the Commodore brand owners, imagining “official” boards and replacement components as part of an inclusive, community-friendly conglomerate. These plans snowballed during discussions, and Simpson found himself securing an agreement to buy Commodore outright for a “low seven-figure” sum. Commodore's 1990s dismemberment means the current iteration owns a number of trademarks, but essential parts of the ecosystem remain scattered. It's for these reasons Simpson finds himself walking multiple tightropes. He must avoid alienating enthusiasts that kept the Commodore flame alive, and not imply that only his new Commodore confers legitimacy. He must collaborate closely with owners of other key puzzle pieces and license the Commodore brand fairly to interested third parties. And to recoup that seven-figure sum, the new Commodore must sell enough new hardware, which means moving beyond a dwindling core fanbase. But the company also wants to be seen as an innovator with an eye on the future, and this results in a kind of branding whiplash. Fittingly, this iteration's debut product, the Commodore 64 Ultimate, embodies such tensions. All models bridge authenticity and modernity by supporting original C64 peripherals and current connectivity, including 1080p HDMI output so you needn't hunt down a CRT TV. Inside, it's all FPGAS—field programmable gate arrays—which ultimately mean simulation rather than the less-accurate emulation found in Chinese retro handhelds and cheap plug-and-play TV devices. Some critics nonetheless grumble that even this “new” machine is past and present in another way, effectively being an amalgamation of existing products, from the keycaps to the having the Ultimate64 board at its core. However, Ultimate64 creator Gideon Zweijtzer has publicly disagreed that Simpson is merely assembling other people's hard work and slapping on a logo. He believes the Commodore 64 Ultimate was a “joint effort between parties to create a cohesive package” and credits Simpson as someone with reach who can “bring people together.” That reach will be essential because noble efforts, sentiment, and saying the right thing won't bring sustainability. Even pent-up demand for a new Commodore 64—at the time of writing, over 4000 units have been sold, amounting to $1.5 million in revenue—is a one-off trick that can't be repeated. Outside the hardcore enthusiasts, fans tend to rapidly move beyond rose-tinted, wide-eyed nostalgia; the retro devices they've bought then gather dust. Few remain on sale for long because the market is finite and fickle. A large slice of the annual retro gaming market—estimated to be around $2.5 billion, though no one has a great handle on the numbers—comes from software rather than hardware. The issue for Commodore here is that it never released any notable games of its own, so it can't mimic Atari's ability to remake the Atari 2600 with modern connectivity while also reimagining 1980s classics like Pong and Missile Command. The alternate mainstream option would be an attempt to reestablish Commodore's reputation as a brand that offers computing for the masses, not the classes, ringing in Simpson's desire for a “simpler, distraction-free computing experience.” But what would that mean in practice? But an entirely new platform would be a colossally risky endeavor. Without hit games and obvious mainstream appeal, how does Commodore survive, let alone thrive? Is it even possible for this 1980s cultural icon to move beyond people who were there at the time and break out of its bubble? Simpson envisions a “single, joined-up family of Commodore machines,” and that could be enough. Commodore would become a community-focused brand, presiding over a modest ecosystem, acting as a benevolent curator that elevates quality projects, brings just enough polish and legitimacy to help the scene flourish, and simply refuses to let the legacy fade. Although investors who've pumped in cash might see things differently. A much worse scenario would be a repeat of the past: panic over income, leading to the brand again being stamped on unremarkable products, or the mismanagement and misfires that alienate partners and fans. There's also the very real possibility that Commodore might just discover the harsh reality of being a very niche, small player in an industry of giants. Any one of those could deal a final, fatal blow to the brand from which it would never recover, taking down swathes of the community with it. Even so, the odds of success feel slim, whether that means sparking a new wave of computing optimism or returning the brand to cultural relevance. But for a while at least, fans can remain optimistic this might finally be the play that truly brings Commodore back to life.

There's a pretty obvious journey visible in those specs from 1984 when computers were under powered with RAM rounding to zero through the 00's when XML was the hot idea to today when MSFT wants everyone on the cloud for life. Unlike say an IDE or generic text editor where developers are excited to work on and dogfood the product via self-hosting, word processors are kind of boring and require separate testing/QA.It's not "artificial", it's just complex.MSFT has the deep pockets to fund that development and testing/QA. MSFT has the deep pockets to fund that development and testing/QA. As for complexity, an illustration-- while using M365 I recently was confounded by a stretch of text that had background highlighting that was neither highlight markup, not paragraph or style formatting. I've been a sophisticated user of M365 for decades and never encountered such a thing, nor have a clear idea of why anyone would use text-level background formatting in preference of the more obvious choices. With that kind of complexity and obscurity in the actual product, it's inevitable the file format would be convoluted and complex. or MS might find itself accidentally toasting themselfa lot of places (including very important MS Office customers) insist in a open document format for various reasonsif MS convinces people that LibreOffice and similar is toast because they can't afford keeping steep with the format in question because it's too expensive they also might end up convincing this customers that it's also too expensive to _them_, and try to find way to switch away from MS Office a lot of places (including very important MS Office customers) insist in a open document format for various reasonsif MS convinces people that LibreOffice and similar is toast because they can't afford keeping steep with the format in question because it's too expensive they also might end up convincing this customers that it's also too expensive to _them_, and try to find way to switch away from MS Office if MS convinces people that LibreOffice and similar is toast because they can't afford keeping steep with the format in question because it's too expensive they also might end up convincing this customers that it's also too expensive to _them_, and try to find way to switch away from MS Office</p>
