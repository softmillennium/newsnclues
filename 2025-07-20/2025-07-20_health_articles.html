                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study whose results appear in The Journal of Nutrition, however, may help reestablish their good reputation. They also showed that those eating eggs had a reduced buildup of the toxic proteins associated with Alzheimer's. Then, a few decades ago, scientists found that high levels of cholesterol in the blood were a risk factor for heart disease, so high-cholesterol eggs were pushed to the naughty corner. Thanks to this new understanding, and a healthy dose of research funding from the Egg Nutrition Center, eggs were edged slowly back into play. Still, they are likely much healthier than many of the low-fat, highly processed snacks that have replaced eggs in modern kitchens. Today, most nutritionists and associated experts have a relatively neutral view of eggs. In general, the advice is that they can form a part of a healthy, well-balanced diet, but at the same time, eating multiple eggs per day could be unhealthy. Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, and despite decades of research, there is no cure, and treatments that can slow the disease are severely lacking. For that reason, understanding the lifestyle factors associated with increased risk is essential. Previous research has shown that choline is important for cognitive function. Choline has many important functions; for instance, it is a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, plays a pivotal role in cell membranes, and has neuroprotective powers. Although our body can synthesise choline, it cannot synthesize enough to meet all the body's needs, so some must be taken in with our diet. Aside from choline, eggs contain essential omega-3 fatty acids, which support brain health as we age. The recent study included data from 1,024 older adults with an average age of 81.4. During this time, a little over one-quarter of them developed Alzheimer's disease. After analysis, the scientists found that individuals who consumed at least one egg per week had a 47% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's during follow-up compared with those eating one egg per month or fewer. Medical News Today spoke to Christopher U. Missling, PhD, president and CEO of Anavex Life Sciences, who was not involved in the study. “About 39–40% of the protective effect was explained by higher dietary choline intake. Egg yolks also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have known neuroprotective properties. The combination of choline and omega-3s may be particularly beneficial for brain health.” Overall, the scientists conclude that, “once replicated in other prospective cohorts and confirmed by clinical trials, these findings may have important public health implications for reducing the population's risk of [Alzheimer's].” If the results are replicated, this could be a very useful, low-cost intervention. MNT also spokle with Maddie Gallivan, RD, a registered dietitian who was likewise not involved in the recent study. “Eggs are often a go-to food for older adults, as they're soft in texture, which can be helpful for those with dentures, quick to prepare, and packed with key nutrients,” Gallivan explained. “So it's great to see a study focussing on how they may support cognitive health in later life.” For instance, they only had a relatively short follow-up — just 6.7 years. He also reminded us that “dietary intake was assessed through self-reported food frequency questionnaires, which are subject to recall bias and inaccuracies.” So, participants may not have accurately reported or remembered their egg consumption. A varied, nutrient-dense diet rich in whole foods is key to supporting brain health and reducing dementia risk.” They may reduce your dementia risk, but if not, they will certainly provide you with a good dose of protein and a healthy range of micronutrients. This podcast episode examines two studies that assess the impact type 2 diabetes has on brain health and explores three lifestyle interventions that… Increasingly, researchers are looking to develop blood tests that could help make Alzheimer's diagnosis faster, more accurate, and less invasive.
