                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subaru Telescope has made an exciting discovery: a small body beyond Pluto, with implications for the formation, evolution, and current structure of the outer Solar System. After that, follow-up observations in July 2024 with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and a search for unrecognized sightings of the object in old data from other observatories allowed astronomers to track the object's orbit over 19 years. Due to its peculiar distant orbit, 2023 KQ14 has been classified as a "sednoid," making it only the fourth known example of this rare type of object. Although its current orbit differs from those of the other sednoids, the simulations suggest that their orbits were remarkably similar around 4.2 billion years ago. This discovery also places new constraints on the hypothetical Planet Nine. If Planet Nine exists, its orbit must lie farther out than typically predicted. It is possible that a planet once existed in the Solar System but was later ejected, causing the unusual orbits we see today." Regarding the significance of this discovery, Dr. Fumi Yoshida states, "2023 KQ14 was found in a region far away where Neptune's gravity has little influence. The presence of objects with elongated orbits and large perihelion distances in this area implies that something extraordinary occurred during the ancient era when 2023 KQ14 formed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international team of astronomers has uncovered new evidence to explain how pulsing remnants of exploded stars interact with surrounding matter deep in the cosmos, using observations from NASA's IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer) and other telescopes. Scientists based in the U.S., Italy, and Spain, set their sights on a mysterious cosmic duo called PSR J1023+0038, or J1023 for short. This neutron star is also a pulsar, emitting powerful twin beams of light from its opposing magnetic poles as it rotates, spinning like a lighthouse beacon. The J1023 system is rare and valuable to study because the pulsar transitions clearly between its active state, in which it feeds off its companion star, and a more dormant state, when it emits detectable pulsations as radio waves. "Transitional millisecond pulsars are cosmic laboratories, helping us understand how neutron stars evolve in binary systems," said researcher Maria Cristina Baglio of the Italian National Institute of Astrophysics (INAF) Brera Observatory in Merate, Italy, and lead author of a paper in The Astrophysical Journal Letters illustrating the new findings. Polarization is a measure of how organized light waves are. They looked at X-ray polarization with IXPE, the only telescope capable of making this measurement in space, and comparing it with optical polarization from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile. NASA's NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) and Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory provided valuable observations of the system in high-energy light. Other telescopes contributing data included the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in Magdalena, New Mexico. "IXPE has observed many isolated pulsars and found that the pulsar wind powers the X-rays," said NASA Marshall astrophysicist Philip Kaaret, principal investigator for IXPE at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Insights from these observations could help refine theoretical models describing how pulsar winds generate radiation - and bring researchers one step closer, Baglio and Coti Zelati agreed, to fully understanding the physical mechanisms at work in these extraordinary cosmic systems. IXPE, which continues to provide unprecedented data enabling groundbreaking discoveries about celestial objects across the universe, is a joint NASA and Italian Space Agency mission with partners and science collaborators in 12 countries. IXPE is led by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But in their most recent on-screen appearance—and no offense to Harrison Ford's iconic professor—they were the site of a very real discovery. Discovery Channel's popular show “Expedition Unknown” was on site to document the discovery of 12 human skeletons and artifacts dating back at least 2,000 years, which had all been long hidden beneath the famed Khazneh (or “Treasury”) in Petra. It's a find that, were he real, Indiana Jones would certainly be proud of. Even in front of one of the most famous buildings in the world … there are still huge discoveries to be made.” Creasman, executive director of the American Center of Research, employed ground-penetrating radar to first see if it was possibile that additional tombs were located at the site. “It really was this awesome moment,” Gates said, “of history imitating art.” It is a striking mausoleum carved into the sandstone cliffs that has long attracted tourists aplenty, but dating this iconic monument has proven difficult because of the lack of finds within the tombs. “We were hopeful to find anything that might tell us more about the ancient people and place,” Creasman said. For instance, Gates believes that the individuals buried in the newly discovered tomb show must have been of very high status because of the prime real estate used for the burial place.“Human remains,” Creasman continued, “can be a really valuable tool in that regard. The burials in this tomb are articulated, so the bones haven't been rummaged around and moved, so that's exceedingly rare.” “I think learning who they are,” Gates said, “is really going to help unlock part of the story of the Treasury.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities gives new insight into a material that could make computer memory faster and more energy-efficient. The study was recently published in Advanced Materials, a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Researchers are looking for alternatives and complements to existing memory solutions that can perform at high levels with low energy consumption to increase the functionality of everyday technology. In this new research, the team demonstrated a more efficient way to control magnetization in tiny electronic devices using a material called Ni₄W-a combination of nickel and tungsten. The team found that this low-symmetry material produces powerful spin-orbit torque (SOT) -- a key mechanism for manipulating magnetism in next-generation memory and logic technologies. "Ni₄W reduces power usage for writing data, potentially cutting energy use in electronics significantly," said Jian-Ping Wang, a senior author on the paper and a Distinguished McKnight Professor and Robert F. Hartmann Chair in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. We observed high SOT efficiency with multi-direction in Ni₄W both on its own and when layered with tungsten, pointing to its strong potential for use in low-power, high-speed spintronic devices." Ni₄W is made from common metals and can be manufactured using standard industrial processes. The low-cost material makes it very attractive to industry partners and soon could be implemented into technology we use everyday like smart watches, phones, and more. The next steps are to grow these materials into a device that is even smaller from their previous work. In addition to Wang, Yang and Lee, the ECE team included Paul Palmberg Professor Tony Low, another senior author on the paper, Yu-Chia Chen, Qi Jia, Brahmudutta Dixit, Duarte Sousa, Yihong Fan, Yu-Han Huang, Deyuan Lyu and Onri Jay Benally. This work was supported by SMART (Spintronic Materials for Advanced InforRmation Technologies), a world-leading research center that brings together experts from across the nation to develop technologies for spin-based computing and memory systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This creates a new, larger interference pattern with completely different physical properties. Moiré superlattices have become central to modern condensed matter and photonic research. "Unlike conventional methods that rely on mechanical stacking and twisting of two-dimensional materials, our platform leverages a bottom-up assembly process," explains Laura Na Liu. It is based on self-organization: The DNA strands join together without external intervention, solely through molecular interactions. The Stuttgart research team is taking advantage of this special feature. We then allow the entire architecture to self-assemble with nanometer precision." The seed acts as a structural blueprint, directing the hierarchical growth of 2D DNA lattices into precisely twisted bilayers or trilayers, all achieved within a single solution-phase assembly step. While moiré superlattices have been widely explored at the atomic (angstrom) and photonic (submicron) scales, the intermediate nanometer regime, where both molecular programmability and material functionality converge, has remained largely inaccessible. The Stuttgart researchers have closed this gap with their current study. Using this hybrid strategy, the researchers constructed micrometer-scale superlattices with unit cell dimensions as small as 2.2 nanometers, featuring tunable twist angles and various lattice symmetries, including square, kagome, and honeycomb. "These superlattices reveal well-defined moiré patterns under transmission electron microscopy, with observed twist angles closely matching those encoded in the DNA origami seed," notes co-author Prof. Peter A. van Aken from the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research. The study also introduces a new growth process for moiré superlattices. The process is initiated by spatially defined capture strands on the DNA seed that act as molecular 'hooks' to precisely bind SSTs and direct their interlayer alignment. This enables the controlled formation of twisted bilayers or trilayers with accurately aligned SST sublattices. Broad implications across molecular engineering, nanophotonics, spintronics, and materials science When chemically transformed into rigid frameworks, these lattices could be repurposed as phononic crystals or mechanical metamaterials with tunable vibrational responses. Their spatial gradient design also opens avenues for transformation optics and gradient-index photonic devices, where moiré periodicity could steer light or sound along controlled trajectories. "This is not about mimicking quantum materials," says Laura Na Liu.
