            A boy survived the sinking of a tourist boat in Vietnam which killed dozens of people by sheltering in an air pocket of the overturned vessel, it has emerged.
    


            The 10-year-old had been traveling with his family in Vietnam's famed Ha Long Bay when the vessel they were sailing on became caught in a sudden storm. Trapped in the boat as it capsized, the boy found refuge in an underwater air pocket, where he stayed and waited for help.
    


            He was eventually found by rescue teams relatively unharmed, although he was suffering from mental distress. He was warmed up and transferred to a nearby hospital, local outlet VietnamNet reported.
    


            “Everything happened so fast,” the boy said. “I tried to get out, and then the soldiers rescued me.”
    


            Search and rescue efforts are continuing for missing passengers and crew after sightseeing ship the Wonder Sea capsized in a squall on Saturday but have been hampered by bad weather.
    


            At least 37 people are confirmed dead from the sinking, state media reported, revising down an earlier toll but warning that it could still rise further. Vietnam News said there were 53 passengers and crew on board and 10 people had been rescued.
    


            Another survivor, a 36-year-old Vietnamese man, described escaping the overturned boat by dumping his life jacket and swimming through an underwater window.
    


            Fire extinguisher salesman Dang Anh Tuan described the moment the vessel suddenly capsized during bad weather, leaving little time for those on board to react.
    


            “It rained for about 15 minutes, and then the boat started to shake vigorously, tables and chairs were jostled around and seconds later the boat overturned,” Tuan told the Associated Press.
    


            He said that the boat quickly filled with water and he lost all orientation.
    


            “I tried to breathe. But more water came in. I took a deep breath, got rid of my life vest and dove down. I saw a streak of light and followed it to swim out, escaping the boat, and then I climbed on the overturned boat to look for help,” he said.
    


            Tuan, along with several others who had been on board, clung onto the overturned boat and waited for another two hours in pouring rain until emergency crews arrived.
    


            He'd been holidaying in Vietnam's popular tourist bay with 11 university friends. Only three of their group survived.
    


            VN Express reported that the Wonder Sea was caught in a storm around 1.30 p.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), which caused it to capsize.
    


            Most of the passengers were from the Vietnamese capital Hanoi and traveling as families, according to VN Express, which reported the eldest passenger as 53 years old and the youngest as just 3. Over 20 children were on board, VNExpress said.
    


            The capsize reportedly happened near the Dau Go Cave – one of the largest in the bay.
    


            Halong Bay is a popular tourist hotspot and a UNESCO world heritage site comprising about 1,600 limestone islands and islets.

The Czech Republic has amended its criminal code to outlaw the promotion of communism, placing it on par with Nazi ideology. The legislation was signed on Thursday by President Petr Pavel, himself a former Communist Party member.

The amendment introduces prison terms of one to five years for anyone who “establishes, supports or promotes Nazi, communist, or other movements which demonstrably aim to suppress human rights and freedoms or incite racial, ethnic, national, religious, or class-based hatred.”

The change follows calls from the Czech government-funded Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, with co-author Michael Rataj claiming that it is “illogical and unfair” to treat the two ideologies differently.

“Part of Czech society still perceives Nazism as the crime of a foreign, German nation, while communism is frequently excused as ‘our own' ideology just because it took root in this country,” Rataj said.

The Czech Republic, once part of communist Czechoslovakia and a Soviet-aligned Eastern Bloc member, became independent in 1993 after the 1989 Velvet Revolution. Its current president, Petr Pavel, referred to his past membership in the Communist Party as a mistake.

The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) has strongly opposed the change, calling it politically motivated. The party is part of the Stacilo alliance and currently polls at around 5%, which could allow it to return to parliament in the October 2025 elections.

“This is yet another failed attempt to push KSCM outside the law and intimidate critics of the current regime,” the party said in a statement.

Prague has removed or altered hundreds of Soviet-era monuments, with another wave of removals following the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. Several countries in Eastern Europe – including Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania – have joined Kiev's decommunization drive in recent years, passing various laws that effectively equate communism with Nazism, moves that Moscow describes as politically driven attempts to rewrite history.

Russia has argued that these measures distort the truth about World War II, during which the Soviet Union lost 27 million lives fighting to liberate Europe from the Nazis. In July 2021, President Vladimir Putin signed a law prohibiting “publicly equating the USSR with Nazi Germany” and banning the “denial of the decisive role of the Soviet people in the victory over fascism.”

Ukraine should consider striking Russian airfields and weapons factories deep inside the country to alleviate pressure on the front, a senior German general has suggested.

Speaking during a Bundeswehr podcast on Saturday, Major General Christian Freuding, who oversees Germany's military assistance to Ukraine, gave Kiev advice on weakening Russia's offensive power.

“You can also indirectly affect the offensive potential of Russian strike forces before they are deployed,” Freuding said. “Use long-range air warfare assets to strike aircraft and airfields before they are used. Also, target weapons production facilities.”

Freuding also lamented that despite Western sanctions, Russia has increased its production of drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic systems. “We must reconsider whether our economic measures have been sufficient and where we can apply further pressure, particularly to limit Russian production capabilities,” he said.

The general also pointed to the limitations of US-made Patriot air defense missiles against waves of Russian drones. “It [a drone] costs around €30,000-50,000 ($34,000–58,000) depending on the model. It's wasteful to shoot it down with a Patriot missile costing over €5 million. We need countermeasures that cost €2,000–€4,000, especially as Russia aims to further increase its production capacity,” he explained.

Last year, the administration of former US President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use American long-range weapons to strike inside Russia, though with significant restrictions on range and target selection. Media reports at the time indicated that Kiev was not allowed to hit major Russian airfields.

Meanwhile, Freuding confirmed earlier this month that Ukraine would receive the first batch of long-range missiles financed by Berlin before the end of July. Germany, however, has been reluctant to send Taurus long-range missiles due to escalation concerns.

Earlier this month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that Germany was becoming “dangerous again,” after German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Bundeswehr troops must be prepared to “kill” Russian soldiers if necessary. Moscow also accused the German leadership of supporting “confrontation” and pursuing an “aggressive mobilization of Europe against Russia.”

Puerto Rico has enacted a new law banning sex change surgery and hormone therapy for individuals under 21, setting a higher age limit than any similar legislation across the US. This aligns with the gender-related policies pursued by the federal government.

Signed on Wednesday, the law introduces harsh penalties, including up to 15 years in prison and fines of up to $50,000, for those found guilty of performing surgery or providing hormone replacement therapy to minors and young adults. It also mandates the revocation of all licenses and permits of medical personnel involved. The law also prohibits the use of public funds for these treatments.

“Minors, having not yet reached the necessary emotional, cognitive, and physical maturity, are particularly vulnerable to making decisions that can have irreversible consequences,” the legislation, set to take effect in October, states.

Puerto Rico's LGBTQ+ Federation has condemned the measure as discriminatory and dangerous, warning it will further isolate trans youth and potentially drive them to seek unregulated or unsafe alternatives. Director Justin Jesus Santiago has vowed to challenge the law's constitutionality in court, arguing it contradicts Puerto Rico's constitution.

US President Donald Trump made gender-related issues a central theme of his campaign last year. Since taking office, he has issued executive orders asserting the government policy that “there are only two genders – male and female.”

These orders roll back protections for transgender rights, as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. They end federal support for medical procedures related to sex change for minors, eliminate “radical gender ideology” from the US Armed Forces, and bar trans women from competing in women's sports.

Trump's approach has drawn criticism from civil rights and LGBTQ advocacy groups. Several directives have faced legal challenges, with federal judges blocking some orders.

Puerto Rico's law stands out among dozens of similar measures passed in around half of the states. While most laws apply to individuals under 18, Puerto Rico raises the age limit to 21, making it the strictest legislation currently in effect in any US jurisdiction.

VLADIVOSTOK, July 20. /TASS/. A 6.4 magnitude earthquake was recorded 166 kilometers away from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.

This has been a fifth earthquake in a row in this region, the Telegram channel of the Kamchatka branch of the Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences has said.

""A 6.4 magnitude earthquake has occurred 166 kilometers away from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky,"" the scientists said, adding that information is being processed and clarified.

Earlier, a tsunami warning was declared in the city and water in the local lake was noticeably rising. The press service of the Russian Emergencies Ministry's head directorate for the region told TASS that specialists will begin inspecting buildings soon.

BERLIN, July 20. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump's decision to continue military aid to Ukraine, in many aspects, came as a result of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's efforts, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told Bild in an interview.

""The entire Europe is on Ukraine's side. The United States is also ready to continue support. This is, to a significant extent, a result of the German chancellor's initiative,"" he said. ""Friedrich Merz played a significant role in this, because he made it clear from the very outset that he defends Ukraine.""

""Friedrich Merz phoned Donald Trump and said there is a need for the United States now. We can only be glad that the chancellor has established a pragmatic relationship with the US president, and that the voice of Germany is heard in Washington again,"" Wadephul said.

On July 14, Trump said that Washington will continue transferring weapons and military equipment to Kiev if Europe pays for the supplies. NATO will coordinate the process. According to the head of the White House, the deliveries will include 17 Patriot systems.

CHISINAU, July 20. /TASS/. Moldova spoiled relations with Moscow under pressure from the West, which supports the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity, Russian Ambassador to Chisinau Oleg Ozerov told TASS in an interview.

""It seems to me that the current policy, which is now being implemented by Moldova's ruling party, comes as a result of pressure exerted by European Union countries - first of all, by Brussels - on the Moldovan government. They claim this will guarantee prosperity. But if we look at the statistics, it is quite the opposite,"" the diplomat said.

""The entire complex of measures undertaken by the Moldovan government under the pressure from Brussels and NATO countries, as we think, has seriously harmed our bilateral relations,"" he added.

Relations between the two states began to deteriorate in 2021, when pro-European forces assumed power in Moldova. Following the 2023 decision to expel 45 Russian diplomats, Moldova has significantly restricted consular services, as well as cultural, educational, and business ties with Russia. These measures have primarily affected Moldovan citizens. The measures have been harshly criticized by the country's opposition.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Ballot heaps pressure on Shigeru Ishiba's minority government after it lost control of lower house in October 

Japan's shaky ruling coalition is likely to lose control of the upper house, exit polls showed after Sunday's election, potentially heralding political turmoil as a tariff deadline with the US looms.

While the ballot does not directly determine whether prime minister Shigeru Ishiba's minority government falls, it heaps pressure on the embattled leader, who also lost control of the more powerful lower house in October.

Ishiba's Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and coalition partner Komeito need 50 seats to secure the 248-seat upper chamber in an election where half the seats are up for grabs.

They are forecast to hold 32 to 51 seats, the exit poll by public broadcaster NHK showed. Other broadcasters forecast the ruling coalition would return 41 to 43 seats. If the coalition drops below 46 seats it would mark its worst result since it was formed in 1999.

That comes on top of its worst showing in 15 years in October's lower house election, a vote that has left Ishiba's administration vulnerable to no-confidence motions and calls from within his own party for leadership change.

Speaking to NHK two hours after polls closed, Ishiba, 68, said he “solemnly” accepted the “harsh result”.

Asked whether he intended to stay on as prime minister and party leader, he said: “That's right.”

He later told TV Tokyo: “We are engaged in extremely critical tariff negotiations with the United States … we must never ruin these negotiations. It is only natural to devote our complete dedication and energy to realising our national interests.”

Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, faces a deadline of 1 August to strike a trade deal with the US or face punishing tariffs in its largest export market.

The main opposition Constitutional Democratic party is projected to win 18 to 30 seats, from 22 held previously, NHK's exit poll showed.

The far-right Sanseito party, birthed on YouTube a few years ago, has been the surprise package with its “Japanese first” campaign and warnings about a “silent invasion” of foreigners. It is forecast to win 10 to 15 seats in the chamber, up from one held previously, yet it holds only three seats in the lower house.

Opposition parties advocating for tax cuts and welfare spending have struck a chord with voters, the exit polls showed, as rising consumer prices – particularly a jump in the cost of rice – have sowed frustration at the government's response.

“The LDP was largely playing defence in this election, being on the wrong side of a key voter issue,” said David Boling, a director at the consulting firm Eurasia Group.

“Polls show that most households want a cut to the consumption tax to address inflation, something that the LDP opposes. Opposition parties seized on it and hammered that message home.”

The LDP has been urging for fiscal restraint, with one eye on a very jittery government bond market, as investors worry about Japan's ability to refinance the world's largest debt pile.

Sanseito, which first emerged during the Covid pandemic spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations and a cabal of global elites, has dragged once fringe political rhetoric into the mainstream and gained wider support among frustrated voters.

It remains to be seen whether the party can follow the path of other far-right parties with which it has drawn comparisons, such as Germany's AfD and Reform UK.

“I am attending graduate school but there are no Japanese around me. All of them are foreigners,” said Yu Nagai, a 25-year-old student who voted for Sanseito earlier on Sunday.

“When I look at the way compensation and money are spent on foreigners, I think that Japanese people are a bit disrespected,” he said after casting his ballot at a polling station in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward.

In Japan, which has the world's oldest population, foreign-born residents hit a record of about 3.8 million last year.

That is still just 3% of the total population, a much smaller fraction than in the US and Europe, but comes amid a tourism boom that has made foreigners far more visible across the country.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Groups say having access to funds cut off raises fears of wider attempt to silence voices speaking out about Gaza

At least two grassroots pro-Palestine organisations in the UK have had their bank accounts frozen, raising fears about a wider attempt to silence voices speaking out about Gaza.

Greater Manchester Friends for Palestine (GMFP) and Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), which both organise peaceful protests and vigils, have had access to their funds cut off indefinitely by Virgin Money and Unity Trust bank respectively. The Guardian understands a local PSC branch in England has also had its bank account frozen but was unable to confirm it directly.

Coming amid the banning of Palestine Action earlier this month and the arrest of more than 100 people for showing support for the group, and the threatened arrest of a peaceful protester for having a Palestine flag and “Free Gaza” sign, it has amplified concerns about a crackdown on critics of Israel.

Owen Cooper, co-treasurer of GMFP, said the group, which lists bike-riding among its activities, has been marching peacefully for more than a year and a half without incident or criminal activity but Virgin Money refused to say why its account had been frozen.

“If it's purely the fact that we have Palestine on the bank account name, I think it's a very worrying sign,” said Cooper. “It would be not only hugely worrying but hugely disappointing to think that a country that values freedom of speech, that is a liberal democracy can be acting like this and that ordinary, decent people with a conscience are being regarded as extremists.

“What could the bank be thinking that we've done? Certainly nothing that the police believe is a crime.”

He said the freeze meant that GMFP could not send money to Gaza and the West Bank to help those in need. “They're actually preventing aid and support going into Gaza, and it's going in for food and medical supplies,” said Cooper. “We don't have access to F-35 jets or 500lb bombs that we're funding.”

Unity Trust bank says its aim is to be “the bank of choice for all socially minded organisations in the UK”, including charities and trades unions.

But Mick Napier, from Scottish PSC's finance committee, said it had acted disgracefully. He said Scottish PSC was told the reason for its account being frozen last month was that it had a button on its website to donate to Palestine Action before the group was banned on 5 July. But the button was removed when Palestine Action was proscribed and yet the account had not been restored, said Napier.

“It's shocking,” he said. “It's absolutely disgraceful that a campaign like ours [has been treated like this]. We've been operating for 25 years. Palestine Action we supported until they were proscribed. It came out the blue [the freezing of the account], and we were very disappointed. We think it's very bad practice.

“We can't get into our cash at all. We've had to use other means, very inconvenient means to pay bills and generally operate, it's been extremely burdensome.”

The Guardian asked both banks for the reasons for the accounts being frozen and if there had been any external influence. Both said they were unable to comment on individual customer accounts.

A Virgin Money spokesperson added that there were “a variety of reasons why we may decide, or be required, to suspend or close an account in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations”.

A Unity Trust bank spokesperson said it was “a politically neutral organisation. Our mission and values underpin our commitment to operating with integrity”.
 They added: “Unity has a diverse customer base that represents a broad range of communities.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russia aims to be able to launch 2,000 drones towards Ukraine simultaneously, German Major General Christian Freuding said in an interview published on July 19.

The staggering figure described by Freuding, who heads the Ukraine task force at the German Defense Ministry, comes as Russia continues to expand its drone production. 

Ukrainian Foreign Intelligence Service (SZRU) told Politico in June that the Kremlin plans to produce 2 million first-person-view (FPV) drones and 30,000 long-range and decoy drones in 2025, marking a critical expansion of Moscow's drone warfare program.

Between Sept. 13, 2022, and Aug. 30, 2023, Russian forces fired nearly 2,000 Shaheds into Ukraine, according to Airwars, a London-based conflict monitoring organization. That number has surged in 2025 — in June alone, Moscow launched a record 5,337 Shahed-type drones.

Freuding's comments come as Russia has continued to ramp up its Iranian-designed Shahed drone attacks on Ukrainian cities in recent weeks, including strikes on Ukraine's far-western regions. On July 9, Russia launched a record 728 Shahed-type drones and decoys across the country.

Robert ""Magyar"" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces warned on July 4 that Russian Shahed drone strikes could escalate to 1,000 per day. 

Amid the increased risk of intensified Russian attacks, Freuding told the Bundeswehr podcast Nachgefragt, that Ukraine can indirectly counter anticipated drones attacks by targeting production sites with long-range missiles.

Ukraine regularly strikes military production facilities on Russian territory, but has called upon Western allies to supply more long-range weaponry for added capabilities.

Freuding announced earlier this month that Ukraine will begin receiving hundreds of domestically produced long-range weapon systems by the end of July under a German-financed agreement. The announcement came ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's agreement with NATO to supply additional weapons to Ukraine.

Amid Russia's attacks on Ukrainian cities, Ukraine's military appears to have intensified its own efforts in targeting Russia's capital. Ukraine's military has targeted Moscow for four straight nights, with fires breaking out in Moscow Oblast on July 20 amid the attacks.

In an effort to counter Russia's increasing drone production, Ukraine has also increased production of its own drones Ukraine's, using them heavily in attacks on various Russian regions as well as on the front line. 

Then-Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at a June 26 press briefing that Kyiv currently has the capacity to produce 4 million drones a year. President Volodymyr Zelensky also said that Kyiv has the capacity 8 million drones annually, but lacks the international financial backing to reach that potential.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a railway in Russia's Tula Oblast, causing ""serious disruptions"" to Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on July 20.

Operatives with the group destroyed a relay cabinet on a railway near the town of Medvedky, west of the city of Tula, Atesh said. Russian troops reportedly use the railroad to transport military personnel and supplies to troops on the Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts fronts.

The sabotage operation disrupted Russian supply lines and led to delays in the delivery of ammunition, weapons, and dual-use components from Tula-based factories.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.

The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks on Russian territory and in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. Partisans reported similar attacks on railroads in occupied Luhansk Oblast and in Russia's Smolensk Oblast in March.

Tula Oblast, located about 250 kilometers northeast of Sumy Oblast, is a regular target of Ukrainian drone strikes. The region is home to several military industrial manufacturing facilities that power Russia's war machine along Ukraine's front line.

Azerbaijan is preparing to submit documents to international courts over the crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines aircraft, President Ilham Aliyev said on July 19, according to local outlet Minval.

An Embraer 190AR plane operated by Azarbaijan Airlines crashed in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, after coming under fire over Grozny, Chechnya. Thirty-eight people were killed.

Azerbaijani authorities laid blame on Russia, with an investigation pointing to a Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system mistakenly targeting the plane amid a reported Ukrainian drone attack.

Aliyev said that despite seven months having passed since the incident, Azerbaijan has yet to receive a clear response from the Russian authorities. 

Moscow continues to reply to formal inquiries from the Azerbaijani Prosecutor General by saying that the investigation is still ongoing, the Minval reported.

""We understand that this may take time. In the Malaysian airline Boeing case, it took more than ten years. We are ready to wait ten years, but justice must be done,"" Aliyev said.

Earlier this July, the European Court of Human Rights found Russia responsible for the downing of Flight MH17, a Malaysian airliner shot down by Russian-controlled forces over Ukraine in July 2014.

Flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport en-route to Kuala Lumpur International Airport on July 17, 2014. Three hours into the flight, Boeing 777 was shot down by Russian militants using a Buk surface-to-air missile over Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast. All 283 passengers and 15 crew members on board, among them 196 Dutch citizens, were killed.

The crash of the Azerbaijani aircraft led to a public clash between Azerbaijan and Russia, otherwise close politically and economically. Previously, Aliyev accused Moscow of suppressing evidence and criticized his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for not openly admitting guilt.

Putin offered condolences for the incident, but stopped short of admitting Russian responsibility.



""The main thing for us is to achieve our goals. Our goals are clear,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian-state media reporter on July 20.

In a cosmic first, astronomers have spotted the earliest signs of rocky planet formation around a young star. The discovery offers a rare vision of how Earth-like worlds may begin.

Astronomers have spotted the earliest known signs of rocky planet formation around a young, sun-like star for the first time.

The discovery offers an unprecedented glimpse into what may have happened at the dawn of our own solar system.

Using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory's ALMA array in Chile, researchers peered into the gas disk surrounding the infant star HOPS-315, about 1,370 light-years away.

The star is just 100,000 to 200,000 years old — a newborn in cosmic terms — and is thought to be on its way to becoming a yellow dwarf like our sun.

""We've captured a direct glimpse of the hot region where rocky planets like Earth are born around young protostars,"" said lead researcher Melissa McClure of Leiden Observatory. ""For the first time, we can conclusively say that the first steps of planet formation are happening right now.""

""Our study shows that it could be a common process during the earliest stage of planet formation,"" McClure said.

The observations, published in the science journal Nature, show a glowing, lightning bug-like system against the dark void — a cosmic nursery where planets may one day emerge.

While it's impossible to say how many planets HOPS-315 might produce, its massive gas disk could support as many as eight — just like our solar system — though that process may take a million years or more.

Thanks to a tilt in the star's disk and a helpful gap in its outer region, the telescopes were able to detect signs of silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing.

These are the very building blocks believed to have formed Earth and other rocky planets in our solar system over 4.5 billion years ago.

The action is happening in a region similar to where our solar system's asteroid belt sits — between Mars and Jupiter. These early-stage solids had never been directly observed in such young systems before, leaving scientists unsure whether Earth's origin story was a rare case.

Fred Ciesla of the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the study, called it a long-awaited breakthrough.

""This is one of the things we've been waiting for,"" he said. ""There's a rich opportunity here.""

Astronomers hope similar discoveries will reveal how common planet formation is — and whether Earth-like worlds are a universal phenomenon or a rare cosmic fluke.

""Are there Earth-like planets out there,"" asked co-author Merel van't Hoff of Purdue University, ""or are we so special that we might not expect it to occur very often?""

Despite being offered billions in subsidies, steel giant ArcelorMittal has suspended plans to transition to green steel production in Germany. Is this an isolated case — or a warning sign for the entire industry?

Steel is the backbone of German industry — but it's also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly 7% of Germany's CO2 emissions.

As Germany has pledged to become carbon-neutral by 2045 — five years earlier than the rest of the European Union — the steel industry must cut up to 55 million metric tons of CO₂ annually, which is roughly 30% of all industrial emissions, according to the German Steel Federation lobby group.

In order to make German steel production significantly more sustainable, the previous government comprising the Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business FDP had embarked on policies encouraging the use of hydrogen with huge state subsidies.

Green hydrogen produced with renewable energy is planned to replace coal in the industry.

One of the steelmakers who had initially applied for government subsidies was Luxembourg-based steel conglomerate ArcelorMittal, under a corporate plan that intended to make the company's two German steel works carbon-neutral by 2050.

The German government supported the plan, offering €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) in subsidies to facilitate the transition to hydrogen-based steelmaking.

But in June, ArcelorMittal announced it was halting the decarbonization plans at its sites in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, and that it would hand back the subsidy grant.

""There has been slower than expected progress on all aspects of the energy transition, including green hydrogen not yet being a viable fuel source and natural gas-based DRI production not being competitive as an interim solution,"" ArcelorMittal Europe said in a statement.

The company's Europe CEO Geert Van Poelvoorde added that the European steel market is currently under ""unprecedented pressure, with weak demand and high levels of imports.""

The pullout of ArcelorMittal from the German green steel plan highlights the risk for companies to fully embark on a green transition course.

The €1.3 billion in German state money were primarily intended to cover the massive upfront costs of building new production facilities. But that's only part of the problem.

Using green hydrogen in steel production — produced by the electrolysis of water, using renewable electricity mainly from wind and sun —  is still more expensive than grey hydrogen based on natural gas or coking coal.

Yet, green steel must ultimately compete on global markets with cheaper, conventionally produced steel. And while changes in global coal prices affect all steelmakers equally, says Stefan Lechtenböhmer, switching to hydrogen-based production means ""entering a completely different market.""

""Hydrogen is produced locally, and long-distance transport is still very difficult today,"" the professor at the University of Kassel in Germany told DW, adding that green hydrogen requires large amounts of electricity, meaning that local power prices directly impact its cost.

But the issue isn't just cost; supply is also a major challenge. German steelmakers will need a reliable and sufficient supply of green hydrogen, a portion of which is supposed to be produced domestically.

According to Germany's National Hydrogen Strategy, the country aims to build up 10 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyzer capacity by 2030 to produce green hydrogen.

But that target appears to be wishful thinking, because as of February 2024, Germany had just 0.066 GW of installed electrolyzer capacity, data from the government's Energy Transition Monitoring Report shows.

""It's almost impossible to meet the 2030 target now,"" Martin Wietschel, energy expert at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, told German ARD public television recently.

Energy experts agree that most of the hydrogen Germany needs will have to be imported from other countries, which is why the government has revised its strategy, now assuming that between 50% and 70% of the projected 2030 demand will have to be sourced from abroad.

Berlin is now working to make sure that both foreign production capacity and extensive transport infrastructure will be in place by then.

At the European Union level, a range of hydrogen infrastructure projects are in the pipeline to be completed by 2030 — including repurposing natural gas pipelines to carry hydrogen and constructing entirely new ones.

Here, too, progress is hampered by setbacks. Several pipeline projects, for example, have been canceled or delayed, including a North Sea pipeline to Germany planned by Norway's Equinor, and a pipeline from Denmark.

At the same time, shipping hydrogen across oceans is also not yet viable on a large scale. Hydrogen must be liquefied for ship transportation in a process that requires cooling it to minus 253 degrees Celsius (minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit).

Alternatively, it can be converted into ammonia for transport, but that would lead to energy losses of around 50%, says Lechtenböhmer.

As a result, transportation costs would cancel out the cost advantages of wind- or sun-rich countries like Namibia, Chile, or Australia, the expert added, which were touted as promising green hydrogen partners for Germany.

Given the soaring costs and sluggish investments on both the supply and demand sides, a study by the Institute of Energy Economics (EWI) at the University of Cologne, Germany, doubts the EU's and Germany's 2030 goals for green steel are still achievable.

But despite the challenges, ArcelorMittal is not abandoning green steel altogether — it's just shifting production to countries with more predictable and affordable electricity supplies.

In May, the company announced that it will build its first new electric arc furnaces (EAFs) in Dunkirk, France, — one of the countries that are ""able to provide visibility and certainty on low-cost electricity.""

The current electricity prices in Germany, the statement added, are high when compared internationally and with European neighbors. 

By contrast, German steelmakers Thyssenkrupp and Salzgitter AG say they remain committed to Germany as the location for producing green steel.

Following ArcelorMittal's pullback, both companies, however, called for faster infrastructure development and better safeguards for competitive energy prices.

Unlike ArcelorMittal, which owns steelworks all over the world, the two companies' operations are solely based in Germany, lacking the flexibility to relocate production abroad.

Public procurement could help them, particularly as the current government plans to spend massively on revamping German infrastructure under a multi-billion-euro investment plan.

That money could also be used to support green steel production, Lechtenböhmer argues, but the government must be ""willing to pay higher prices for green steel.""

In the long run, steel prices in Europe — whether conventional or green — are likely to rise due to a new EU emissions trading system coming into force in 2027.

At the moment, says Lechtenböhmer, most industrial companies have received their emissions allowances for free. But the EU's new scheme will introduce a carbon market that will likely boost prices for coal-based steel compared with green steel.

A study by the Boston Consulting Group projects that conventional steel will no longer be economically viable in Europe after 2030.

Follow:


            The Trump administration is preparing for a historic infusion of cash into the president's sweeping mass deportation campaign that is expected to supercharge immigration enforcement nationwide — and likely place additional pressure on the already-overwhelmed federal agency at the center of it all.
    


            Since receiving its mass deportation edict after President Donald Trump took office in January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has fielded criticism from people inside the administration who think they aren't doing enough, lawmakers and advocates who think they are doing too much, and an incensed public that in some cases is taking drastic action to impede immigration enforcement.
    


            Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have repeatedly touted the work of ICE and the agents on the ground making immigration arrests. “These are strong people — tough people — that love our country,” Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. “If they weren't tough, they wouldn't survive.”
    


            While the public messaging from the president and DHS leadership has been positive, the reality for officers is far more complicated, involving tense calls with the White House daily and working around the clock amid public backlash.
    


            ICE, a Homeland Security official told CNN, “keeps getting kicked in the teeth.”
    


            Now, ICE is set to receive $75 billion in funding from the president's sweeping agenda bill for detention expansion and enforcement and removal operations, including hiring new agents. It's an unprecedented amount of cash for an agency that's historically been underfunded, and Trump administration officials are preparing to make the most of it.
    


            “We're going to come harder and faster, and we're going to take these criminals down with even more strength than we ever have before,” Noem said this month, describing how the infusion of cash will bolster her agency's immigration-enforcement apparatus.
    


            ICE is charged with arresting and detaining immigrants in the United States. For years, current and former officials say, it has struggled with limited federal funds and personnel.
    


            In multiple interagency discussions, senior Trump administration officials have been drafting plans to hire thousands more agents and drastically expand immigrant detention. White House border czar Tom Homan told CNN he's been in regular calls with ICE and US Customs and Border Protection to check on progress with contracts, though he's largely recused himself from the process given previous work, and he's in discussions over how to bring on thousands more officers and bolster the academy where they're trained.
    


            But top of mind is bringing online thousands more detention beds to keep pace with arrests.
    


            “I think we'll have 100,000 beds by the end of the year. That's a priority,” Homan said. ICE was previously funded for around 41,000 beds. Homan said some of the new beds would be in permanent buildings, and others in temporary structures like tents.
    


            The cash comes at a critical time for ICE, which was maxed out on detention space and was grappling with fewer than 200 available beds on a daily basis, according to Homan. Around 57,000 people are currently in ICE custody, according to federal data obtained by CNN.
    


            The increase in detention has been fueled by an uptick in arrests. But numbers have still not met the goal of 3,000 daily arrests set by Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's immigration policy; instead, fluctuating between 1,000 and 2,000 arrests a day, the data shows. Deportations also continue to lag, not yet outpacing the Obama administration, which was able to quickly remove recent border crossers.
    


            The pressure to pivot to immigration enforcement has also extended to components of DHS that have not typically been responsible for arresting immigrants in the interior, including the Homeland Security Investigations arm, which focuses on a wide range of criminal activity, including human trafficking and cybercrime, among other threats to national security.
    


            Homan recognized the tension among federal agencies over the prioritization of immigration enforcement and within the ICE workforce over the daily arrest quotas.
    


            “It depends on who you talk to. The quotas are very doable. But I've heard that other agencies want to get back to their mission whenever we bring more people on board, hire more immigration people,” he said. “Some people like quotas, some don't, but we all work within the framework provided by the administration.”
    


            When Trump signed his agenda bill into law, it set up ICE to be the most well-funded police force in the federal government over the next four years.
    


            “They have now the blank check to do all these things,” a former Homeland Security official told CNN.
    


            ICE alone is set to receive nearly $75 billion through 2029, including about $45 billion that is being set aside specifically to increase capacity at immigration detention centers. The other nearly $30 billion is going toward enforcement and removal — a cash windfall that will be directed toward the front-line ICE operations that involve arresting immigrants and transporting them to detention centers.
    


            The agency has long been criticized for some of its practices, but that has intensified this year along with the new arrest quotas, souring the mood among agents tasked with executing the president's controversial immigration agenda.
    


            “There's a lot of brain drain going on,” a former Homeland Security official told CNN. “Every single day they have people out on the field, holidays, weekends be damned. They're expected to have people every day.”
    


            The administration plans to make a big push toward recruiting, bringing people back who have retired, hiring from other law enforcement agencies, and increasing the capability of the academy where agents train more quickly. Messages have already gone out to retired ICE officers, asking that they return and offering financial incentives such as bonuses.
    


            “You served the United States of America with distinction and honor,” reads an email addressed to former ICE officials from Deputy Director Madison Sheahan and obtained by CNN. “Now, your country calls upon you to serve once more.”
    


            The administration is trying to determine how many classes it can put through the ICE academy at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers in Georgia by the end of the year. Hiring and training is typically a monthslong process.
    


            “As we continue hiring, we'll have classes ready to go. We'll have people in place ready to attend classes. Recruiting, hiring, No. 1, get the academies as quickly as can, and throw those people we've hired through the academy,” Homan said. “It's really important they have a larger footprint.”
    


            Tens of billions of additional dollars will flow into other aspects of Trump's immigration agenda. More than $46 billion will be funneled toward the construction and maintenance of border barriers, helping Trump to fulfill a promise he made when he mounted his first presidential campaign a decade ago.
    


            “There are all kinds of plans when we have more money,” the Homeland Security official said. “It's honestly more boots on the ground to do enforcement. It's going to be more detention space.”
    


            As ICE detentions rise, the Trump administration has put in place a series of policies that have drastically curtailed opportunities for migrants to be released and paved the way for people to be swiftly deported to countries that are not their own.
    


            While the administration has said it's going after the “worst of the worst,” federal data reveals that the majority of immigrants taken into custody don't have serious criminal convictions. The White House and Department of Homeland Security maintain that those being targeted for arrest are public safety and national security threats.
    


            That's contributed to growing alarm among immigrant advocates and attorneys, especially on the heels of new guidance that will largely prevent people who are brought into ICE custody from being released.
    


In a recent memo, the acting director of ICE told agents that immigrants who arrived in the US illegally going back decades were no longer eligible for a bond hearing while they fight their deportations in immigration court.
    


            In other words, those previously allowed to remain out on bond as their case made its way through the immigration system, which can take years, now could be taken into custody and spend months in detention.
    


            “The Trump administration is doing a complete end-run around our court system with DHS now telling immigration judges what powers they have and what they don't have — most recently with the July 8 DHS memo that strips judges of the power they've exercised for decades to decide whether a person should be detained,” said Gregory Chen, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
    


            Legal orientation programs in detention facilities have also largely been dismantled after the federal government cut funding for those programs, leaving immigrants in detention with little to no resources to navigate the arduous immigration system in the moments before they're deported.
    


            “It's a coin toss now. It used to be if you had no criminal history, you had some ties, you had connections here, more often or not you had bond and that's because we lacked the bed space to keep people detained,” another former Homeland Security official told CNN.
    


            Now that there's more bed space, the official added, “there's no reason for ICE to want to get people released.”
    


            ICE has made a visible push to deploy officers nationwide and carry out sweeps in places that have generally been off-limits, like courthouses.
    


            The agency has also stepped up raids on farms and places where day laborers congregate, like Home Depot parking lots. Those tactics have fueled tension among Republicans, some of whom have expressed concern over enforcement actions on industries where immigrants remain a vital source of labor.
    


            “We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have — maybe not,” Trump said during a June news conference, acknowledging that tension.
    


            Democratic elected officials have also criticized the agency's tactics as heavy-handed and reminiscent of some of the darkest moments in modern history.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has described ICE under Trump as a “modern-day Gestapo.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the agency's immigration sweeps in her city last month — the catalyst for days of protests — left her “deeply angered.” California Sen. Alex Padilla said the administration's push for higher arrest and deportation numbers is making the agency and its employees “more aggressive, more cruel [and] more extreme.”
    


            “Any violence against law enforcement is unacceptable,” Padilla said on CNN earlier this month. “Do I think heated rhetoric is part of what's causing this response? Sadly, yes, and we've seen this administration escalate and escalate and escalate.”
    


            Last month, Padilla was forced to the ground and briefly handcuffed after interrupting Noem during a press conference amid tensions in Los Angeles over the administration's crackdown.
    


            In New Jersey, Rep. LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, has been indicted on charges of assaulting and impeding law enforcement stemming from a clash outside of a Newark detention facility that also led to the arrest of the city's mayor, Ras Baraka. Baraka's charges were later dropped; McIver, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to face trial in November.
    


            The third prong of pressure has come from citizens who, in some cases, are adopting increasingly militant postures to oppose ICE and the administration's enforcement actions.
    


            In some instances, which have been widely publicized by the administration, people have pelted federal law enforcement or their vehicles with rocks, bricks and other solid objects.
    


            In at least three incidents, federal immigration law enforcement has been met with gunfire: On July 4, an officer was shot during an alleged attack on an ICE detention facility in Texas. Days later, a gunman was killed after opening fire on a Customs and Border Protection facility in Texas, injuring one officer.
    


            And on July 10, federal officers conducting enforcement on a marijuana farm in California were met with gunfire, though nobody was injured.
    


            These incidents have incensed Trump. “I am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself,” he said in a July 11 social media post, “just like they protect the Public.”

            In broad daylight, in this typically quiet, suburban neighborhood of Greece's capital, he was shot multiple times at close range, according to police. Jeziorski died where he fell, police said, his body riddled with gunshot wounds seen in grim photographs taken in the immediate aftermath.
    


            As eyewitnesses rushed to his aid, the masked gunman fled.
    


            The alleged perpetrator, arrested 12 days later for premeditated murder: His ex-wife's new partner. The motive, he told police – to prevent Jeziorski from taking away her children.
    


            “I did it all for (her) and our children so that we could have a normal life without problems,” he said, according to a transcript of a statement he made to police in the aftermath of his arrest.

            One of the most remarkable aspects of the case is that the statements made to police by the alleged perpetrators have been widely leaked to Greek media, including a CNN affiliate, CNN Greece. The statements, verified as authentic by a senior police source speaking to CNN, offer an insight into how the alleged murder plot was put together, why it was undertaken, and provide clues as to who may have known what, and when.  But there are key questions unresolved, too – not least the role, if any, of Jeziorski's ex-wife.
    


            According to Greek police, she is facing moral accomplice charges, which she denies, according to her lawyer, who spoke to CNN. Like all the suspects in this case, her identity is known to CNN but cannot be published due to Greek legal restrictions.
    


            The alleged perpetrator's confession, and other conflicting accounts from three alleged accomplices that were also leaked to the press, sets up what is likely to be a lengthy and high-profile trial.
    


            Meanwhile, the killing and the aftermath have shocked the friends and family of the victim, who say Jeziorski was a kind and introverted academic who loved his children.
    


            Jeziorski, 43, who went by the nickname Przemek or “PJ,” was an economist and tenured professor of marketing at the University of California Berkeley's Haas School of Business. He was born in Poland and moved to the United States in 2004 to study economics and math at the University of Arizona, and he went on to obtain his PhD from Stanford.
    


            “He was one of the sharpest people I've ever met,” said Robert Kowalski, the victim's friend from Stanford. “He was a great guy, a genius in many regards.”
    


UC Berkeley said in a statement that Jeziorski “had a passion for teaching” and during his 13 years at the California university, he taught data analytics skills to more than 1,500 graduate and PhD students. His research work centered on emerging markets, which took him around the world for field research, and Berkeley described him as “a leading expert in quantitative marketing, industrial organization, and the economics of digital markets.”
    


            The dean of UC Berkeley's business school, Jenny Chatman, said she was “heartbroken” by the death of Jeziorski, who she described as a “beloved member of our marketing faculty.”
    


            Jeziorski met his ex-wife – a Greek national – in San Francisco in 2013, and they got married the following year, according to Kowalski. The couple's twins were born shortly after.
    


            In 2015, the couple co-founded a start-up called Keybee, a short-term rental property management platform.
    


            It's unclear what led to their relationship falling apart, but Kowalski told CNN the couple broke up around 2020 after moving to Greece during the Covid pandemic.
    


            Their children are dual US and Polish citizens, according to a statement from the victim's brother. The children had applied for Greek citizenship and were awaiting a decision on that, according to the ex-wife's lawyer.
    


            Jeziorski filed for divorce in June 2021, according to California court records.
    


            It appears to be one element in a years-long custody battle for the children, who ultimately lived with their mother in Greece, with a provision that their father, Jeziorski, could take the children for one month every summer.
    


            According to Kowalski, Jeziorski asked during the custody battle that his children attend an American school in Greece, so that they could be able to attend high school or college in the US one day.
    


            But his ex-wife was afraid of losing the kids much sooner, according to the statement to police from the principal suspect, her boyfriend.
    


            “We were afraid that he (Jeziorski) would end up taking the kids completely. That would completely finish off (my girlfriend), who was overly fond of them. This summer Przemek wanted to take the children and take them to America. But (my girlfriend) did not agree and so she went back to court with Przemek,” the suspect said, according to the testimony transcript.
    


            On July 3, a custody judgement ruled that Jeziorski was indeed allowed to take the children for a month.
    


            “A month and a half ago I made the decision to end this torment we were experiencing once and for all,” the suspect told police, adding that it was a “good opportunity” given that Jeziorski was in Athens to attend the custody hearing.
    


            The statement details how the suspect says he bought a pistol more than a month ago and asked a friend, who is from Bulgaria, to help him “find Przemek and scare him so that he wouldn't take our children away from us.”
    


            He said it all began in Nafplio, a coastal city about two hours from Athens, “so that it would appear that I was there” and his cell phone would “leave traces.”
    


            The suspect said that that he, his friend and two others – a man and a teenager from Albania – he paid drove to Athens and waited on the same street as the ex-wife's house, where the suspect said he knew Jeziorski was coming that afternoon to pick up the kids. “I approached him and shot him a few times, but I don't remember how many times,” he said.
    


            According to the statement, the men had rented a gray Porsche Cayenne as a getaway car, but the murder suspect told police that his accomplices left him at the scene after they saw him shoot the victim.
    


            Police said Jeziorski died at the scene, where seven bullet casings were found after a masked gunman shot him in the neck and chest.
    


            The three unnamed men who allegedly helped, two Albanian nationals and a Bulgarian national, are facing accomplice charges, police announced Thursday. The suspected accomplices – one of whom is a minor – have confessed to their peripheral involvement in the killing, a Greek police source told CNN on Thursday. CNN has been unable to reach attorneys for those men.
    


            “My client has confessed his actions but as you can see from the simplicity of some of the things that took place this was not an organized plan. His accomplices only knew about a plan to scare him (the victim) so he would stay away from the children,” the main suspect's lawyer, Ermis Papoutsis, told CNN. “(The ex-wife), his partner, knew nothing about any of this.”
    


            “My client had come to me in the past to seek advice. He had said his partner's ex-husband had serious alcoholism issues and that he and the mother were worried about allowing access to the kids. He wanted to see if there was something he could legally do about limiting access,” the lawyer added. “Now he is completely devastated after what happened. We will ask for a psychiatric examination because he has had some issues in the past.”
    


            Jeziorski's friends have denied the allegations that he abused alcohol.
    


            On Friday, CNN Greece obtained the police testimony of the alleged accomplice from Bulgaria, which contradicts the account of the alleged gunman. In this account, the alleged accomplice claims the victim's ex-wife had “organized the whole thing.”
    


            He described his friend, the perpetrator, obtaining a gun and then asking “me to find some people to take him to Athens the next day to scare and threaten the Pole so that he would ‘back down' on custody of the children.”
    


            “In fact, from what he told me, (the ex-wife) made him do it because she didn't want to give the children to the Pole,” the accomplice said in the testimony,” adding that the perpetrator offered him thousands of euros after he “did something we hadn't agreed on.”
    


            As for the ex-wife – beyond the statement of her lawyer, denying all knowledge, there is no further information about her testimony. For reasons that unclear, nothing from her statements to police have made their way to the Greek media.
    


            These inconsistencies – and other unanswered questions – will all be dealt with at the trial.
    


            Meanwhile, the victim's family are dealing with the aftermath of an unimaginable tragedy. The victim's brother said in a statement that “our family is heartbroken,” but grateful to Greek police and security professionals who made the arrests.
    


            “Przemek's ten-year-old children, who are US and Polish citizens, are now under care in accordance with Greek child custody procedures,” the victim's brother Łukasz Jeziorski said in a statement. “Our primary concern is their safety and wellbeing, and helping them reconnect with their family to minimize the trauma they have already endured.”
    


            Jeziorski's family started an online fundraiser to repatriate his remains to his native Poland and pay for legal representation in Greece.
    


            A US State Department spokesperson told CNN the agency is providing consular assistance to the family.
    


            On Monday, the five people charged will appear in person in court for their plea, according to Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, the lawyer representing the victim's family. The court will determine whether the suspects will be remanded in custody pending the trial. A trial date will be set at a later stage, Dimitrakopoulos told CNN.
    


            “The victim's mother and brother will take sole custody of the children,” Dimitrakopoulos told Greek media on Friday. The lawyer said that “we've talked to the prosecutor for minors so that the victim's mom and brother can get full custody of the kids and live with them in Poland, where they are now.”
    


            “They have the opportunity to raise them in a loving environment, in a completely protective environment,” Dimitrakopoulos said, adding that “if the mother is acquitted, because we respect the presumption of innocence, then she has the right to request sole custody of her children.”

            A baby arrives in America from a home in turmoil. A family in Kansas raises him. And he struggles to balance two identities.
    


            Comic books, TV shows and films have repeatedly recounted these details from Superman's backstory over the past 87 years. But the director of the latest big-screen adaptation drew backlash recently when he stated something that's been said many times before: Superman is an immigrant.
    


            “I mean, Superman is the story of America,” director James Gunn told The Times of London. “An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”
    


            Coming as the Trump administration steps up its immigration crackdowns, the comments quickly sparked criticism from right-wing media personalities. A Fox News banner blasted the new movie as “Superwoke” as pundits offered their takes.
    


            “We don't go to the movie theater to be lectured to and to have somebody throw their ideology on to us,” said former Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway.
    


            Dean Cain, an actor who starred for years on TV in “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman” and is now a conservative commentator, told TMZ he didn't like Gunn's comments and speculated that the director's decision to invoke immigration while promoting the film could be a costly mistake.
    


            So far, it hasn't been. The movie, released by CNN's parent company Warner Brothers Discovery, finished No. 1 on its opening weekend with $122 million in domestic ticket sales and continues to draw large audiences.
    


            And longtime fans and historians of the comic books note that Gunn's comments weren't superimposing a new storyline on the beloved hero.
    


            “The idea of Superman being an immigrant, or maybe a refugee, has been part of the character's mythos since the very beginning. It's not something he invented or tried to shoehorn in,” says Danny Fingeroth, author of “Superman on the Couch: What Comic Book Heroes Really Tell Us About Ourselves and Our Society.”
    


            The first Superman story, published in 1938, stated he was sent to Earth from Krypton, a fictional doomed planet.
    


            “It makes him not an immigrant of choice. It makes him an immigrant of necessity…a refugee,” Fingeroth says. “He's someone who comes to Earth and to America, to then blend in and become as American as mom, the flag and apple pie.”
    


            And, Fingeroth says, there are a lot of good reasons why these details are such a key part of Superman's story.
    


            Take the comic's creators, for example.
    


            Artist Joe Shuster and writer Jerry Siegel were both the children of Jewish immigrants who'd fled rising antisemitism in Europe.
    


            “Just given their backgrounds and their sympathies, I think it's always been important that Superman comes from somewhere else,” Fingeroth says.
    


            The Cleveland-based duo wrote Superman's story as World War II loomed. The first page of his story describes him as “champion of the oppressed.”
    


            “The clouds of fascism are rolling through Europe. There's echoes of it here in America … and Superman's early adventure are fighting for the little guy, fighting for abused women, fighting for exploited mine workers, fighting against corrupt politicians,” Fingeroth says.
    


            Even before America was fighting Nazis in World War II, Superman was fighting them on comic book pages, he says.
    


            Through it all, “Superman is the immigrant embodying the best of American qualities, even though he's from somewhere else.”
    


            It's a connection historians and immigrant rights advocates have made, too.
    


            More than a decade ago, comic book historian Craig This organized a panel at Wright State University highlighting the immigrant backgrounds of Superman and Wonder Woman. The idea resonated with the college students he was teaching at the time, he says.
    


            “People were coming to this large public research university, maybe thinking that they were an outsider, and then said, ‘Oh, wow, look, I can see these individuals as role models. I want to try and fit in. But really, it's going to be my differences that make me survive and be successful, not just here on a college campus, but also here in the United States.'”
    


            In 2013, the organizations Define American and the Harry Potter Alliance launched a social media campaign inviting people to share selfies and their family's immigration stories with the hashtag #SupermanIsAnImmigrant.
    


            Last week that campaign's creators pushed back against critics who've been accusing Gunn of politicizing his take on Superman.
    


            “You can't politicize the truth,” Define American founder Jose Antonio Vargas and narrative strategist Andrew Slack wrote in The Hollywood Reporter. “Superman has been an ‘illegal alien' for 87 years.”
    


            A one-time undocumented immigrant himself, Vargas says today he sees an even more important message in the superhero's story.
    


            “I think for the first time, because of this movie, because of what's happening in the country … I have people who have never talked to me about immigration talking to me about immigration,” he says. “So we have people's attention. Now I think the question is, what are they going to do?”
    


            Of course, Superman's origin is just one part of his story. And in the initial comic, it was also a convenient plot device, Fingeroth says, allowing the authors to explain his powers.
    


            In some versions, Fingeroth says, “Superman's immigrant status is not mentioned.” The hero could be from Metropolis or Kansas or anywhere, “depending on the era, depending on the creators.”
    


            Each version of Superman comes with its own plot twists. In the new film, for example, the backstory of the superhero's parents takes an unexpected turn.
    


            Superman sometimes changes with the times. And sometimes different audiences perceive him differently.
    


            Many superheroes are outsiders. And one common thread that gives them such staying power is that people from many different walks of life connect with the characters, says Fingeroth, a longtime editor of Spiderman comics.
    


            “Their mythos and storylines and origins speak to various aspects of the human condition, and that makes them appealing. Their adventures are enjoyed by people from a wide variety of political and social and religious backgrounds,” he says. “And yet, the myths are so powerful that they all take it as their own.”
    


            In other words, all of us can see ourselves in Superman. And that may be a reason why so many people have such strong opinions about the character even today.
    


            Last week the White House's social media accounts shared an AI-generated image based on the new movie's poster, depicting President Trump in the title role.
    


            A few days later, though, it wasn't the Man of Steel that the Trump administration referenced on social media when it drew a connection between a beloved sci-fi character and today's undocumented immigrants.
    


            Instead, the Department of Homeland Security shared the iconic image of ET's bicycling silhouette. The text superimposed over the moon: “GO HOME.”

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who represents a slice of the Rio Grande Valley along the border with Mexico, won his last congressional election by just over 5,000 votes.

That makes him a tempting target for Republicans, who are poised to redraw the state's congressional maps this coming week and devise five new winnable seats for the GOP that would help the party avoid losing House control in the 2026 elections. Adjusting the lines of Gonzalez's district to bring in a few thousand more Republican voters, while shifting some Democratic ones out, could flip his seat.

Gonzalez said he is not worried. Those Democratic voters will have to end up in one of the Republican districts that flank Gonzalez's current one, making those districts more competitive — possibly enough so it could flip the seats to Democrats.

“Get ready for some pickup opportunities,” Gonzalez said, adding that his party is already recruiting challengers to Republicans whose districts they expect to be destabilized by the process. “We're talking to some veterans, we're talking to some former law enforcement.”

Texas has 38 seats in the House. Republicans now hold 25 and Democrats 12, with one seat vacant after Democrat Sylvester Turner, a former Houston mayor, died in March.

Gonzalez's district — and what happens to the neighboring GOP-held ones — is at the crux of President Donald Trump's high-risk, high-reward push to get Texas Republicans to redraw their political map. Trump is seeking to avoid the traditional midterm letdown that most incumbent presidents endure and hold onto the House, which the GOP narrowly controls.




Trump's push comes as there are numerous political danger signs for his presidency, both in the recent turmoil over his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and in new polling. Surveys from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show most U.S. adults think his policies have not helped them and that his tax cut and spending bill will help the wealthy.

The fear of accidentally creating unsafe seats is one reason Texas Republicans drew their lines cautiously in 2021, when the constitutionally mandated redistricting process kicked off in all 50 states. Mapmakers — in most states, it's the party that controls the legislature — must adjust congressional and state legislative lines after every 10-year census to ensure that districts have about the same number of residents.

That is a golden opportunity for one party to rig the map against the other, a tactic known as gerrymandering. But there is a term, too, for so aggressively redrawing a map that it puts that party's own seats at risk: a “dummymander.”

The Texas GOP knows the risk. In the 2010s, the Republican-controlled Legislature drew political lines that helped pad the GOP's House majority. That lasted until 2018, when a backlash against Trump in his first term led Democrats to flip two seats in Texas that Republicans had thought safe.

In 2021, with Republicans still comfortably in charge of the Texas Statehouse, the party was cautious, opting for a map that mainly shored up their incumbents rather than targeted Democrats.

Still, plenty of Republicans believe their Texas counterparts can safely go on offense.

“Smart map-drawing can yield pickup opportunities while not putting our incumbents in jeopardy,” said Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which helps coordinate mapmaking for the party nationally..

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature, which starts Monday, to comply with Trump's request to redraw the congressional maps and to address the flooding in Texas Hill Country that killed at least 135 people this month.

Democratic state lawmakers are talking about staying away from the Capitol to deny the Legislature the minimum number needed to convene. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton posted that any Democrats who did that should be arrested.

Lawmakers can be fined up to $500 a day for breaking a quorum after the House changed its rules when Democrats initiated a walkout in 2021. Despite the new penalties, state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, who led the walkout in 2021, left open the possibility of another.

“I don't think anybody should underestimate the will of Texas Democrats,” he said.

Texas is not the only Republican state engaged in mid-decade redistricting. After staving off a ballot measure to expand the power of a mapmaking commission last election, Ohio Republicans hope to redraw their congressional map from a 10-5 one favoring the GOP to one as lopsided as 13-2, in a state Trump won last year with 55% of the vote.

Some Democratic leaders have suggested that states where their party is in control should counter the expected redraw in Texas. “We have to be absolutely ruthless about getting back in power,” former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said Sunday on CNN.

But Democrats have fewer options. More of the states the party controls do not allow elected partisans to draw maps and entrust independent commissions to draw fair lines.

Among them is California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has floated the long shot idea of working around the state's commission.

The few Democratic-controlled states that do allow elected officials to draw the lines, such as Illinois, have already seen Democrats max out their advantages.

Trump and his allies have been rallying Texas Republicans to ignore whatever fears they may and to go big.

On Tuesday, the president posted on his social media site a reminder of his record in the state last November: “Won by one and a half million Votes, and almost 14%. Also, won all of the Border Counties along Mexico, something which has never happened before. I keep hearing about Texas ‘going Blue,' but it is just another Democrat LIE.”

Texas has long been eyed as a state trending Democratic because of its growing nonwhite population. But those communities swung right last year and helped Trump expand his margin to 14 percentage points, a significant improvement on his 6-point win in 2020.

Michael Li, a Texas native and longtime watcher of the state at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, said there's no way to know whether that trend will continue in next year's elections or whether the state will return to its blue-trending ways.

“Anyone who can tell you what the politics of Texas looks like for the balance of the decade has a better crystal ball than I do,” Li said.

One region of the state where Republican gains have been steady is the Rio Grande Valley, which runs from the Gulf of Mexico along much of the state's southern border. The heavily Hispanic region, where many Border Patrol officers live, has rallied around Trump's tough-on-immigration, populist message.

As a result, Gonzalez and the area's other Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, have seen their reelection campaigns get steadily tighter. They are widely speculated to be the two top targets of the new map.

The GOP is expected to look to the state's three biggest cities to find its other Democratic targets. If mapmakers scatter Democratic voters from districts in the Houston, Dallas and Austin areas, they could get to five additional seats.

But in doing so, Republicans face a legal risk on top of their electoral one: that they break up districts required by the Voting Rights Act to have a critical amount of certain minority groups. The goal of the federal law is to enable those communities to elect representatives of their choosing.

The Texas GOP already is facing a lawsuit from civil rights groups alleging its initial 2021 map did this. If this year's redistricting is too aggressive, it could trigger a second complaint.

“It's politically and legally risky,” Li said of the redistricting strategy. “It's throwing caution to the winds.”

CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) — Pope Leo XIV renewed his call on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, asking the international community to respect international laws and the obligation to protect civilians.

“I once again call for an immediate end to the barbarity of this war and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict,” the pontiff said at the end of his Sunday Angelus prayer from his summer retreat in Castel Gandolfo. 

Leo also expressed his “deep sorrow” for the Israeli attack on the only Catholic church in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, which killed three people and wounded 10 others, including the parish priest.

“I appeal to the international community to observe humanitarian law and respect the obligation to protect civilians as well as the prohibition of collective punishment, the indiscriminate use of force, and the forced displacement of populations,” the pope added.

The shelling of the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza also damaged the church compound, where hundreds of Palestinians have been sheltering from the Israel-Hamas war, now in its 21st month. Israel expressed regret over what it described as an accident and said it was investigating.

“We need to dialogue and abandon weapons,” the pope said earlier Sunday, after presiding over Mass at the nearby Cathedral of Albano.

“The world no longer tolerates war,” Leo told reporters waiting for him outside the cathedral.




Asked about his phone conversation on Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Leo said, “We insisted on the need to protect the sacred places of all religions.” 

The pope will remain in Castel Gandolfo until Tuesday evening, when he returns to his Vatican residence, a Vatican spokesman said Sunday.

A poem

After Ted Hughes 

Out on the moors in the late June light, I stood where the infinite hills halved the sky and saw where you first saw your horses. Were they left over from a fever dream, dropped momentarily from some other planet? But in that instant, they existed: ten of them, megaliths with draped manes and tilted hind hooves; each utterly silent, unmoving in the icy morning air. As you passed by, the big sun erupted, darkness shook open and showed you its fires. But your horses remained: patient and gray, statue-like in the iron light, enduring on the horizon. In the crowded streets of London, amid the sea of admiring faces, the scandals, the accolades, did you ever again find so peaceful a place? Or are you still out there, slipping through hills, hiding in the trees, lying in the heathers, combing the barren moors, still searching?","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

These movie adaptations find a way to elevate their source material.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily's Sunday culture edition.

Announcements of yet another book-to-film adaptation are usually met with groans by fans of the source material. But sometimes a new movie can be a chance to lift the best elements of a story. We asked The Atlantic's writers and editors: What's a film adaptation that's better than the book?

Jurassic Park (streaming on Peacock) 

I am not saying that the Michael Crichton novel Jurassic Park isn't great, because it is. The folly of man, the chaos of progress, the forking around, the finding out, the dinosaurs—God, the dinosaurs. But in 1993, Steven Spielberg took this promising genetic code, selected the fittest elements, spliced them with Hitchcock, and adapted them to the cool dark of the multiplex. The result is not just a great movie. It is a perfect movie.

The story is tighter; the characters are given foils, mirrors, and stronger arcs. On the page, Dr. Alan Grant is a widower and the paleobotanist Ellie Sattler his student; Dr. Ian Malcolm, chaos mathematician, is a balding know-it-all. On the screen, our dear Dr. Sattler feasts on Dr. Grant's restrained, tonic masculinity and Dr. Malcolm's camp erotic magnetism (as do we). The dialogue is punchier too. “You're alive when they start to eat you,” “Woman inherits the Earth,” “Clever girl,” “Hold on to your butts”—none of that poetry appears in the paperback.

Spielberg and his crew used CGI techniques to make the inhabitants of Isla Nublar come to life, but the real magic came from practical effects, including a 9,000-pound, bus-size animatronic T. rex. This ferocious predator deserves to live on-screen, chomping on velociraptors and snatching a lawyer off of the toilet. Thirty years later, I am still not sure man deserves to watch.

The Talented Mr. Ripley (streaming on Paramount+ and the Criterion Channel)

Patricia Highsmith wrote eminently filmable novels, none more so than her oft-adapted The Talented Mr. Ripley. The 1999 movie is the most famous and successful take, transforming the source material into a faster-paced and more suspenseful version of the story. The novel's crime-to-punishment ratio is Dostoyevskian; for each misdeed Tom Ripley commits, he spends twice as long regretting it or worrying that he'll get caught. Anthony Minghella's adaptation diverges from this claustrophobic narration and limits viewers' access into Ripley's mind, making his deceitful and violent actions all the more unexpected.

The final scenes contain the largest plot deviation—a shocking twist that manages to both show Ripley at his worst and invite sympathy for him. The film also clarifies his tortured sexuality, an element of his character that remains more ambiguous in the novel. What Highsmith hints at, Minghella more boldly asks: When someone is already ostracized, even criminalized, by society, what's to stop him from taking the leap into actual depravity?

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (available to rent on YouTube and Prime Video)

I'm going to make some people mad, but the 2011 adaptation of John le Carré's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is even better than the superb novel. It's a rare instance of a spy movie that transcends genre and stands on its own. Gary Oldman's portrayal of the intelligence officer George Smiley is one of the great performances of the 21st century—and it probably paved the way for Oldman to eventually play Jackson Lamb in the addictive Slow Horses series, also an adaptation. The treatment of the field agent Ricki Tarr (played by Tom Hardy) is both more intense and to the point than in the novel. The scenery—the shots of Budapest alone—brings le Carré's writing to life in a way that few adaptations ever do. And the film has easily one of the most gripping, poignant, and creative final scenes I've ever seen. (Julio Iglesias's rendition of “La Mer” is on my dinner-party playlist. If you know, you know.)

The Devil Wears Prada (streaming on Disney+)

At first glance, the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada seems to make only cosmetic changes to Lauren Weisberger's fizzy novel about a young woman trying to break into New York's publishing industry. In the movie, the protagonist, Andy, is a graduate of Northwestern, instead of Brown. Her boyfriend is a chef, not a teacher. And Miranda Priestly, the imposing editor of a fashion magazine—a thinly veiled version of Anna Wintour—who hires Andy as an assistant, isn't always seen wearing a white Hermès scarf.

But the movie's sharp screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna elevated the material past its breezy, chick-lit-y origins. Anchored by a top-notch cast (Anne Hathaway as Andy, Meryl Streep as Miranda, and a breakout Emily Blunt as Andy's workplace rival), the film is the rare rom-com focused more on professional relationships than romantic ones: between mentors and mentees, bosses and employees, colleagues and competitors. Even amid its glossy setting, The Devil Wears Prada captured the reality of work, showing how finding career fulfillment can be a blessing and a curse. For me, the film is a modern classic, endlessly rewatchable for its insights—and, of course, its fashion. I certainly have never looked at the color cerulean the same way again.

— Shirley Li, staff writer

The Social Network (available to rent on Prime Video and YouTube)

Did Mark Zuckerberg's girlfriend really break up with him by calling him an asshole in the middle of a date? Did he actually spend the moments after a disastrous legal deposition refreshing a Facebook page, again and again, to see if she'd accepted his friend request? Well, probably not—Erica Albright, Rooney Mara's character in David Fincher's film The Social Network, is admittedly fictional. But her opening scene establishes Fincher's version of Mark Zuckerberg as a smug, patronizing jerk who can't imagine other people's feelings being as important as his own, and sets the movie off at a furious, thrilling pace that doesn't slow until the very end, when Mark has alienated everyone who once cared about him.

The Social Network is a biopic that doesn't hold itself to facts, to its absolute advantage. Ironically, this approach elevates the nonfiction book it's based on, Ben Mezrich's The Accidental Billionaires, which was written without even an interview with Zuckerberg and panned as shoddily reported. (In a New York Times review, Janet Maslin wrote that Mezrich's “working method” seemed to be “wild guessing.”) The truth doesn't matter as much as telling a good story—as long as you keep control of the narrative, which Fincher's Mark struggles to do.

Clear and Present Danger (streaming on MGM+)

Clear and Present Danger the book is the size, shape, and weight of a brick; Phillip Noyce's bureaucratic thriller slims Tom Clancy's nearly 1,000 pages into a svelte 141 minutes (though movies could always be shorter). The action takes place on the sea, in the jungle, at a drug lord's mansion, and in the streets of Bogotá—the latter setting the scene for an ambush sequence so memorable that the Jack Ryan series restaged it. But the film is most gripping in hallways and offices, culminating in Henry Czerny and Harrison Ford brandishing dueling memos at each other like light sabers. (“You broke the law!”) And although the character of Jack Ryan can sometimes blur into a cipher in Clancy's novels, Ford embodies him with a Beltway Dad gravitas—never more so than when he announces to the lawbreaking president of the United States, “It is my duty to report this matter to the Senate Oversight Committee!” Such a Boy Scout.

What Pixar Should Learn From Its Elio Disaster

By David Sims

Early last year, Pixar appeared to be on the brink of an existential crisis. The coronavirus pandemic had thrown the business of kids' movies into particular turmoil: Many theatrical features were pushed to streaming, and their success on those platforms left studios wondering whether the appeal of at-home convenience would be impossible to reverse … Discussing the studio's next film, Inside Out 2, the company's chief creative officer, Pete Docter, acknowledged the concerns: “If this doesn't do well at the theater, I think it just means we're going to have to think even more radically about how we run our business.”

He had nothing to worry about: Inside Out 2 was a financial sensation—by far the biggest hit of 2024. Yet here we are, one year later, and the question is bubbling back up: Is Pixar cooked?

To become Americans, we promised to defend the laws of the United States. What if defending them now puts our status at risk?

On a bookshelf near my desk, I still have the souvenir United States flag that I received during my naturalization ceremony, in 1994. I remember a tenderhearted judge got emotional as the room full of immigrants swore the Oath of Allegiance and that, afterward, my family took me to Burgerville to celebrate. The next morning, my teacher asked me to explain to my classmates—all natural-born Americans—how I felt about becoming a citizen at age 13.

One girl had a question: “So Chris can never be president?”

I wasn't worried about becoming president—I just wanted to get to the computer lab, where we were free to slaughter squirrels in The Oregon Trail. But her question revealed that even kids know there are two kinds of citizens: the ones who are born here, and the ones like me. The distinction is written into the Constitution, a one-line fissure that Donald Trump used to crack open the country: “Now we have to look at it,” Trump said, after compelling Barack Obama to release his birth certificate in 2011. “Is it real? Is it proper?”

Nearly 25 million naturalized citizens live in the U.S., and we are accustomed to extra scrutiny. I expect supplemental questions on medical forms, close inspection at border crossings, and bureaucratic requests to see my naturalization certificate. But I had never doubted that my U.S. citizenship was permanent, and that I was guaranteed the same rights of speech, assembly, and due process as natural-born Americans. Now I'm not so sure.

Last month, the Department of Justice released a civil-enforcement memo listing the denaturalization of U.S. citizens as a top-five priority and pledging to “maximally pursue” all viable cases, including people who are “a potential danger to national security” and, more vague, anyone “sufficiently important to pursue.” President Trump has suggested that targets could include citizens whom he views as his political enemies, such as Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayoral candidate who was born in Uganda and naturalized in 2018: “A lot of people are saying he's here illegally,” Trump said. “We're going to look at everything.”

Read: Why civics is about more than citizenship

“Looking at everything” can be unnerving for naturalized citizens. Our document trails can span decades and continents. Thankfully, I was naturalized as a child, before I had much background to check, before the internet, before online surveillance. I was born in Brazil, in 1981, during the twilight of its military dictatorship, and transplanted to the United States as a baby through a byzantine international-adoption process. My birth mother had no way of knowing for sure what awaited me, but she understood that her child would have a better chance in the “land of the free.”

I don't consider myself “a potential danger to national security” or “sufficiently important to pursue,” but I also don't believe that American security is threatened by international students, campus protesters, or undocumented people selling hot dogs at Home Depot. I'm a professor who writes critically about American power; I believe in civil disobedience; and I support my students when they exercise their freedom of conscience.

Because I was naturalized as a child, I didn't have to take the famous civics test—I was still learning that stuff in school. I just rolled my fingertips in wet ink and held still for a three-quarter-profile photograph that revealed my nose shape, ear placement, jawline, and forehead contour. My parents sat beside me for an interview with an immigration officer who asked me my name, where I lived, and who took care of me.

But these days, I wonder a lot about that civics test. It consists of 10 questions, selected from a list of 100, on the principles of democracy, our system of government, our rights and responsibilities, and milestones in American history. The test is oral; an official asks questions in deliberately slow, even tones, checking the responses against a list of sanctioned answers. Applicants need to get only six answers correct in order to pass. Democracy is messy, but this test is supposed to be easy.

However, so much has changed in the past few years that I'm not sure how a prospective citizen would answer those questions today. Are the correct answers to the test still true of the United States?

What does the Constitution do? The Constitution protects the basic rights of Americans.

One of the Constitution's bedrock principles can be traced back to a revision that Thomas Jefferson made to an early draft of the Declaration of Independence, replacing “our fellow subjects” with “our fellow citizens.”

As with constitutional theories of executive power, theories of citizenship are subject to interpretation. Chief Justice Earl Warren distilled the concept as “the right to have rights.” His Court deemed the revocation of citizenship cruel and unusual, tantamount to banishment, “a form of punishment more primitive than torture.”

By testing the constitutional rights of citizenship on two fronts—attempting to denaturalize Americans and to strip away birthright citizenship—Trump is claiming the power of a king to banish his subjects. In the United States, citizens choose the president. The president does not choose citizens

What is the “rule of law”? Nobody is above the law.

Except, perhaps, the president, who is immune from criminal prosecution for official acts performed while in office. Trump is distorting that principle by directing the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and ICE to enforce his own vision of the law without regard for constitutional norms.

Civil law is more malleable than criminal law, with fewer assurances of due process and a lower burden of proof. ICE raids rely on kinetic force to fill detention cells. Denaturalization cases can rely on stealthy legal proceedings. In 2018, the Trump administration stripped a man of his citizenship. He was married to a U.S. citizen and had been naturalized for 12 years. The administration accused him of fraudulently using an alias to apply for his papers after having been ordered to leave the country. In an article for the American Bar Association, two legal scholars argued that this was more likely the result of a bureaucratic mix-up. Whatever the truth of the matter, the summons was served to an old address, and the man lost his citizenship without ever having had the chance to defend himself in a hearing.

Read: The fragility of American citizenship

The DOJ is signaling an aggressive pursuit of denaturalization that could lead to more cases like these. In the most extreme scenarios, Americans could be banished to a country where they have no connection or even passing familiarity with the language or culture.

What stops one branch of government from becoming too powerful? Checks and balances.

Denaturalization efforts may fail in federal court, but the Trump administration has a habit of acting first and answering to judges later. When courts do intervene, a decision can take weeks or months, and the Supreme Court recently ruled that federal judges lack the authority to order nationwide injunctions while they review an individual case. FBI and ICE investigations, however, can be opened quickly and have been accelerated by new surveillance technologies.

How far might a Trump administration unbound by the courts go? Few people foresaw late-night deportation flights to El Salvador, the deployment of U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, a U.S. senator thrown to the ground and handcuffed by FBI agents for speaking out during a Department of Homeland Security press conference. To many Americans who have roots in countries with an authoritarian government, these events don't seem so alien.

What is one right or freedom from the First Amendment? Speech.

And all the rights that flow from it: Assembly. Religion. Press. Petitioning the government.

During the McCarthy era, the Department of Justice targeted alleged anarchists and Communists for denaturalization, scrutinizing the years well before and after they had arrived in the U.S. for evidence of any lack of “moral character,” which could include gambling, drunkenness, or affiliation with labor unions. From 1907 to 1967, more than 22,000 Americans were denaturalized.

Even if only a handful of people are stripped of their citizenship in the coming years, it would be enough to chill the speech of countless naturalized citizens, many of whom are already cautious about exercising their First Amendment rights. The mere prospect of a lengthy, costly, traumatic legal proceeding is enough to induce silence.

What are two ways that Americans can participate in their democracy? Help with a campaign. Publicly support or oppose an issue or policy.

If, apparently, it's the “proper” campaign, issue, or policy.

What movement tried to end racial discrimination? The civil-rights movement.

The question of who has the right to have rights is as old as our republic. Since the Constitutional Convention, white Americans have fiercely debated the citizenship rights of Indigenous Americans, Black people, and women. The Fourteenth Amendment, which established birthright citizenship, and equal protection under the law for Black Americans, was the most transformative outcome of the Civil War. Until 1940, an American woman who married a foreign-born man could be stripped of her citizenship. Only through civil unrest and civil disobedience did the long arc of the moral universe bend toward justice.

The 1964 Civil Rights Act opened the door for the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended the national-origin quotas that had limited immigration from Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. The act “corrects a cruel and enduring wrong in the conduct of the American Nation,” President Lyndon B. Johnson said as he signed the immigration bill at the foot of the Statue of Liberty. The possibility of multiracial democracy emerged from the civil-rights movement and the laws that followed. Turning back the clock on race and citizenship, and stoking fears about the blood of America, is a return to injustice and cruelty.

What is one promise you make when you become a United States citizen? To support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

Now Americans like me have to wonder if we can hold true to that promise, or whether speaking up for the Constitution could jeopardize our citizenship.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

By emphasizing scientific uncertainty above other values, political appointees can block any regulatory action they want to.

Late last month, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released a document detailing its vision for scientific integrity. Its nine tenets, first laid out in President Donald Trump's executive order for “Restoring Gold Standard Science,” seem anodyne enough: They include calls for federal and federally supported science to be reproducible and transparent, communicative of error and uncertainty, and subject to unbiased peer review. Some of the tenets might be difficult to apply in practice—one can't simply reproduce the results of studies on the health effects of climate disasters, for example, and funding is rarely available to replicate expensive studies. But these unremarkable principles hide a dramatic shift in the relationship between science and government.

Trump's executive order promises to ensure that “federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available.” In practice, however, it gives political appointees—most of whom are not scientists—the authority to define scientific integrity and then decide which evidence counts and how it should be interpreted. The president has said that these measures are necessary to restore trust in the nation's scientific enterprise—which has indeed eroded since the last time he was in office. But these changes will likely only undermine trust further. Political officials no longer need to rigorously disprove existing findings; they can cast doubt on inconvenient evidence, or demand unattainable levels of certainty, to make those conclusions appear unsettled or unreliable.

In this way, the executive order opens the door to reshaping science to fit policy goals rather than allowing policy to be guided by the best available evidence. Its tactics echo the “doubt science” pioneered by the tobacco industry, which enabled cigarette manufacturers to market a deadly product for decades. But the tobacco industry could only have dreamed of having the immense power of the federal government. Applied to government, these tactics are ushering this country into a new era of doubt in science and enabling political appointees to block any regulatory action they want to, whether it's approving a new drug or limiting harmful pollutants.

Historically, political appointees generally—though not always—deferred to career government scientists when assessing and reporting on the scientific evidence underlying policy decisions. But during Trump's first term, these norms began to break down, and political officials asserted far greater control over all facets of science-intensive policy making, particularly in contentious areas such as climate science. In response, the Biden administration invested considerable effort in restoring scientific integrity and independence, building new procedures and frameworks to bolster the role of career scientists in federal decision making.  Trump's new executive order not only rescinds these Joe Biden–era reforms but also reconceptualizes the meaning of scientific integrity. Under the Biden-era framework, for example, the definition of scientific integrity focused on “professional practices, ethical behavior, and the principles of honesty and objectivity when conducting, managing, using the results of, and communicating about science and scientific activities.” The framework also emphasized transparency, and political appointees and career staff were both required to uphold these scientific standards. Now the Trump administration has scrapped that process, and appointees enjoy full control over what scientific integrity means and how agencies review and synthesize scientific literature necessary to support and shape policy decisions.

Although not perfect, the Biden framework also included a way for scientists to appeal decisions by their supervisors. By contrast, Trump's executive order creates a mechanism by which career scientists who publicly dissent from the pronouncements of political appointees can be charged with “scientific misconduct” and be subject to disciplinary action. The order says such misconduct does not include differences of opinion, but gives political appointees the power to determine what counts, while providing employees no route for appeal. This dovetails with other proposals by the administration to make it easier to fire career employees who express inconvenient scientific judgments.

When reached for comment, White House spokesperson Kush Desai argued that “public perception of scientific integrity completely eroded during the COVID era, when Democrats and the Biden administration consistently invoked an unimpeachable ‘the science' to justify and shut down any reasonable questioning of unscientific lockdowns, school shutdowns, and various intrusive mandates” and that the administration is now “rectifying the American people's complete lack of trust of this politicized scientific establishment.”

But the reality is that, armed with this new executive order, officials can now fill the administrative record with caveats, uncertainties, and methodological limitations—regardless of their relevance or significance, and often regardless of whether they could ever realistically be resolved. This strategy is especially powerful against standards enacted under a statute that takes a precautionary approach in the face of limited scientific evidence.

Some of our most important protections have been implemented while acknowledging scientific uncertainty. In 1978, although industry groups objected that uncertainty was still too high to justify regulations, several agencies banned the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as propellants in aerosol spray cans, based on modeling that predicted CFCs were destroying the ozone layer. The results of the modeling were eventually confirmed, and the scientists who did the work were awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Elevating scientific uncertainty above other values gives political appointees a new tool to roll back public-health and environmental standards and to justify regulatory inaction. The result is a scientific record created less to inform sound decision making than to delay it—giving priority to what we don't know over what we do. Certainly, probing weaknesses in scientific findings is central to the scientific enterprise, and good science should look squarely at ways in which accepted truths might be wrong. But manufacturing and magnifying doubt undercuts science's ability to describe reality with precision and fealty, and undermines legislation that directs agencies to err on the side of protecting health and the environment. In this way, the Trump administration can effectively violate statutory requirements by stealth, undermining  Congress's mandate for precaution by manipulating the scientific record to appear more uncertain than scientists believe it is.

An example helps bring these dynamics into sharper focus. In recent years, numerous studies have linked PFAS compounds—known as “forever chemicals” because they break down extremely slowly, if at all, in the environment and in human bodies—to a range of health problems, including immunologic and reproductive effects; developmental effects or delays in children, including low birth weight, accelerated puberty, and behavioral changes; and increased risk of prostate, kidney, and testicular cancers.

Yet despite promises from EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to better protect the public from PFAS compounds, efforts to weaken current protections are already under way. The president has installed in a key position at the EPA a former chemical-industry executive who, in the first Trump administration, helped make regulating PFAS compounds more difficult. After industry objected to rules issued by the Biden administration, Trump's EPA announced that it is delaying enforcement of drinking-water standards for two of the PFAS forever chemicals until 2031 and rescinding the standards for four others. But Zeldin faces a major hurdle in accomplishing this feat: The existing PFAS standards are backed by the best currently available scientific evidence linking these specific chemicals to a range of adverse health effects.

Here, the executive order provides exactly the tools needed to rewrite the scientific basis for such a decision. First, political officials can redefine what counts as valid science by establishing their own version of the “gold standard.” Appointees can instruct government scientists to comb through the revised body of evidence and highlight every disagreement or limitation—regardless of its relevance or scientific weight. They can cherry-pick the data, giving greater weight to studies that support a favored result. Emphasizing uncertainty biases the government toward inaction: The evidence no longer justifies regulating these exposures.

This “doubt science” strategy is further enabled by industry's long-standing refusal to test many of its own PFAS compounds—of which there are more than 12,000, only a fraction of which have been tested—creating large evidence gaps. The administration can claim that regulation is premature until more “gold standard” research is conducted. But who will conduct that research? Industry has little incentive to investigate the risks of its own products, and the Trump administration has shown no interest in requiring it to do so. Furthermore, the government controls the flow of federal research funding and can restrict public science at its source. In fact, the EPA under Trump has already canceled millions of dollars in PFAS research, asserting that the work is “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

In a broader context, the “gold standard” executive order is just one part of the administration's larger effort to weaken the nation's scientific infrastructure. Rather than restore “the scientific enterprise and institutions that create and apply scientific knowledge in service of the public good,” as the executive order promises, Elon Musk and his DOGE crew fired hundreds, if not thousands, of career scientists and abruptly terminated billions of dollars of ongoing research. To ensure that federal research support remains low, Trump's recently proposed budget slashes the research budgets of virtually every government research agency, including the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the EPA.

Following the hollowing-out of the nation's scientific infrastructure through deep funding cuts and the firing of federal scientists, the executive order is an attempt to rewrite the rules of how our expert bureaucracy operates. It marks a fundamental shift: The already weakened expert agencies will no longer be tasked with producing scientific findings that are reliable by professional standards and insulated from political pressure. Instead, political officials get to intervene at any point to elevate studies that support their agenda and, when necessary, are able to direct agency staff—under threat of insubordination—to scour the record for every conceivable uncertainty or point of disagreement. The result is a system in which science, rather than informing policy, is shaped to serve it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What the right gets wrong about Superman's origins.

In a recent interview with The Times, Superman director James Gunn said that his new blockbuster tells the story of “an immigrant.” He also explained it was a story about “basic human kindness.” But that first comment — about Superman's foreign origins — is the one that set off some pundits on the right.

Fox News commentator Jesse Watters joked on air: “You know what it says on his cape? MS-13.” Ben Shapiro blasted Gunn and the Hollywood left for being out of touch with everyday American audiences: “The reality [is] that Hollywood is so far to the left that they cannot take a core piece of Americana and just say it's about America.”

But, Grant Morrison — author of the seminal comic book series All-Star Superman — said the conservative backlash ignores the leftist origins of the world's most famous superhero.

Not only was Superman created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, but those very first comics portrayed their character as a “socialist figure.”

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

In one comic published in 1939, Superman is seen shielding young thieves from police because he figured the kids were victims of poverty, then tearing down slums and forcing authorities to build low-rent housing. Before becoming the “Man of Steel,” Superman was “The Champion of the Oppressed.”

Gunn has said that All-Star Superman was a big influence on his new film. Morrison sat down with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram to talk about where Superman came from, how the character has evolved, and why he will endure.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

How did you get into Superman? What did this character mean to you?

I grew up on the west coast of Scotland next to an American naval and nuclear base. My parents were anti-nuclear activists. My father was a World War II soldier who became a peacenik. So, my big fear in the world was the atom bomb, and I associated it with the Americans, but the Americans also brought the comics.

Then I discovered Superman. And although I knew no real Superman was coming to save me from an actual atom bomb, metaphorically he really solved a lot of problems for my head when I was a little kid.

Those are the primal roots for me, and they're quite deep. So yeah, getting a chance to do that character, sitting here overlooking that same stretch of water where we did the protests…To write All-Star Superman kind of defies the forces of entropy. If anything survives in my career, it will be that one book.

Who was the Superman that you created in that series?

We went for an older Superman. The basic idea was: What if Superman was dying and he had a year to live? Basically, it's a part of Lex Luthor's scheme to send Superman to the sun, and the solar radiation overcharges Superman's cells, so they begin to decay and die. Basically, Superman's dying of cancer. What would this man do in the last 12 months of his life to leave the Earth a better place than he found it?

Were you surprised to find out that James Gunn wanted to relaunch this character and relaunch an entire cinematic universe with your story about a dying Superman?

James didn't necessarily take the dying part. His is a younger Superman. But I think he certainly took the character as we decided to define it, and he saw something that he could work with. Instead of Superman having flaws, let's present a fictional character who doesn't have flaws. You know, he has problems of his own. He still can't get the girl. He still works for a boss in an office, but he's Superman. He's a kind of everyman whose life happens at a much higher scale. He's got an unruly dog, but his unruly dog can laser his own dinner and cook a steak. His unruly dog can fly through buildings, but he's still dealing with an unruly dog.

In previous attempts people have asked: What would Superman be like if he was in the real world? Which to me is an absurd question. The only existence Superman has in the real world is as a comic book or movie character, and that's where he is most useful and most functional, as far as I'm concerned. He's a metaphor. He is an allegory. He stands for everything that is good in us.

It sounds like there have been at least some iterations of this character throughout his near-century of existence — from your dying version to this ideal version, to this all-powerful version. But I believe Superman even started as a bit of a tough guy, a headbasher, and maybe even a left-wing revolutionary. Can you tell us about the non-Kryptonian origins of this character, and how he came to be on Earth?

Well, he arrived in Cleveland, Ohio. He was created by two teenagers, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, who'd met at school. Jerry was the writer and Joe was the artist. They wanted to work for newspapers. Newspaper syndication was the place to go for cartoons back then. They were working on this notion called “The Superman.” The original version was an evil bald guy who eventually became Lex Luthor in the Superman story. But after a few tries, they hit on this fabulous notion of: Let's give him a wrestling costume with a cape so that we can track his movement across the panels, and make him very colorful so that he's memorable.

The greatest addition to the design was to put his monogram on his chest so that the character's entire identity was summed up in this very simple advertising motif that people can remember and people can also wear and partake in being Superman. It was created by two young kids who were the sons of immigrants — European immigrants, Jewish boys — and this was their vision.

Superman was a do-gooder. He was here to help people. He'd come from a distant world, but thought the only use for power and strength was to help the downtrodden and the oppressed. Early issues of Action Comics depict a Superman who's very much an outlaw. He goes after corrupt union bosses. He goes after mine owners. He goes after politicians who are corrupt.

Superman later was seen as a messianic figure of hope, which I don't really like, because I think he's a fighter, he's a scrapper. He gets into fights on behalf of the little guy. He gets bloodied up and he gets up again. You shoot him [with] a tank shell, and he gets up again.

Through the years, that changed quite radically. The socialist figure of the early years hit 1942 and suddenly it was war, and Superman became incredibly patriotic, and that's where the “Truth, justice, and the American way” thing first appears.

Then, in the 1950s, Superman changes again completely. You're dealing with guys coming home from the war, domestication, and living in suburbia. So Superman becomes a family drama, but on a titanic scale. He has friends from the future who visit and cause trouble. He has a cousin who survived the destruction of Krypton, he has a dog, and he has a monkey. So Superman then, to me, was probably at his peak, but he was representative of post-war masculinity trying to adjust to a world of relatives and not being married. Those stories were obsessed with the relationship with Lois [Lane].

In the 1960s, he becomes a cosmic seeker. He almost goes back to his roots, and we have stories where he is fighting for Native American land rights, he's up against polluters, and very much back to the activist Superman. And so it goes. In the 1980s, he's a yuppie. In the 1990s, they kill him in order to make it interesting, then bring it back as a soap opera set around the fictional newspaper, the Daily Planet. And into the 2000s, you get the work that I did.

It's funny to hear you lay out this history in which Superman at one point is something of a socialist warrior, because all of these pundits who are mad about James Gunn saying that Superman's an immigrant, if they really knew the history here, there's so much more they could be mad about.

Absolutely. As you say, if anyone had bothered to look at the history of Superman, they'd see that he was always an immigrant created by immigrants. He represented that experience, but he was assimilated. I mean, he was an American. He'd been raised by American parents. So that was very important as well. And I think the combination of these two qualities is what maybe drives people mad, because they want it to be either one thing or another, but Superman's trying to embody everyone.

It's funny, a thing that we talk about the first half of the show is that depending on how tuned into the news you are, you can see a lot of what's going on in the world today in this movie. But of course, this movie wasn't made this week. It was made a year ago.Yeah.The meetings about this movie probably started five years ago. Do you think there's something about the nature of Superman that makes him timeless?

I definitely believe that. I mean, we are talking about the history of Superman, which goes back to 1938. Superman has outlived his creators. He's also outlived the people who took over from his creators, and the next generation of the people who took over from his creators.

Superman is more real than I am. He's more real than most of us. He will outlive us all, and he'll still have meaning to people in the future. People have even forgotten that his look was based on early 20th-century circus strongmen and wrestling outfits. So now it's the template for the ideal superhero. And because he was the first, he's got the best name, the most primal name. I absolutely think Superman will persist beyond even the next few generations. As long as the world stays together and there's such a thing as culture, I think there'll still be a Superman.

Americans say they want a third party — but making it happen is tricky.

Earlier this month, Elon Musk said he wanted to form a new political party. He'd been teasing the idea ever since clashing with President Donald Trump over his “big, beautiful bill,” which Musk accused of exploding the deficit. In June, Musk ran a poll on X asking users whether it was “time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” More than 5 million people responded, and 80 percent voted yes. Then, on July 5, Musk announced he was forming the American Party in hopes of giving voters their “back [their] freedom.”

Those who follow Musk closely, like Bloomberg Businessweek national correspondent Joshua Green, have said Musk's latest project is in line with his pursuit of political power and attention.

“I think he thought he'd essentially bought that by backing Donald Trump to the tune of $300 million in the last election,” Green said previously on Today, Explained. “And Trump turned on him, ousted him, took away his EV tax credits, didn't cut the deficit, trashed him on social media. And now I think Elon is humiliated and looking for a way to respond and hit back.”

Trump has called Musk's third-party proposal “ridiculous.” And the billionaire appeared to have moved from his third obsession by mid-July — at least on X — posting instead about Europe's fertility rate and running damage control for the antisemitic rants of his AI platform Grok.

But regardless of whether he follows through on the “America Party,” Musk appears to have hit a chord with an American electorate disillusioned by the two-party system.

On Today, Explained, co-host Noel King dove into voters' desires, the history of third parties, and possible solutions to the two-party stranglehold with Lee Drutman, senior fellow at the New America think tank and author of Breaking the Two Party Doom Loop: The Case for Multiparty Democracy in America.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You are not a big fan of the two-party system.

You know, I think it's outlived its usefulness. I think America is a pretty big, diverse country these days, you may have noticed. And to fit everybody into just two parties seems like kind of insanity, and it's clearly not working. Also, it has divided this country into two teams — the red and the blue team — that have learned to absolutely hate each other. It's created these artificial divisions around this zero-sum, winner-take-all electoral politics that is just really breaking down the foundations of democracy in this country. So, I think there was a time when it worked reasonably well for certain reasons, but that time is in the past.

You will know that Elon Musk agrees with you. He says he wants to start a third party. He ran one of his polls [on X], and the question was: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” I'm looking at that poll now. Eighty percent of people said yes, 20 percent said no. How does that match up with reality in the US?

Well, there are two parts to that question. One is: How many people want a third party? And then two is: How many people want that party to be somewhere in the middle?

Now, the first part: How many people want a third party? That 80 percent is a little bit high. There might be some selection bias there, but it is close to polls that I've seen. Generally, about 60 to 70 percent of Americans say there ought to be more than two parties when polled. So, overwhelmingly, Americans say they want more than two parties.

Now, is the party that they want a party in the center? That's less clear. I think people's perception of the political center depends on themselves. [Most] people think that they're more reasonable and they're more moderate. But in reality, when you look at the viewpoints of the American electorate, as I've done repeatedly, you see that the support for a genuine center party is limited to maybe 10 to 15 percent. But there is a lot of interest in parties that are maybe not as traditional.

Third-party candidates do run for office all the time in the United States, they very rarely win. If so many voters want more options, why don't we have more people in elected office from third parties?

Here you're hitting on the core problem, which is that we have a single-winner system of elections. So in a single-winner election, third parties become spoilers and wasted votes, because one of the two major parties is going to win every election. So, voting for a third party is just basically a protest vote, or maybe it could spoil the election. And as a result, most people don't want to do that because they think, well, I want to vote for somebody who at least has a chance of winning. And, more importantly, people who have ambition in politics say, well, I'm not going to waste my time with one of these fringe parties. I want to actually win. So you get minor parties that are mostly cranks and weirdos and people say, well, I'd like to vote for another party, but not that third party.

What's the recent history of third-party candidates? Serious third-party candidates at a national level? I have a vague memory of Ross Perot, but I couldn't give you many details. It was the nineties. How serious have third-party candidates been over time?

Well, Ross Perot is the most recent third-party candidate to actually get a pretty decent share of the electorate. He got almost 20 percent of the electorate, although he didn't win a single state. A lot of people remember Ralph Nader in 2000, who only got about 3 percent of the vote, but it was a very well placed 3 percent because his votes were more than the difference between Bush and Gore in Florida and a few other states.

Before that, you had George Wallace running in 1968 on the American Independent Party as sort of a “preserve segregation” platform. And then 1912, you have Teddy Roosevelt running as a Bull Moose third-party candidate. [He] was the most successful third-party candidate. Of course, he had already been president. So you've periodically had third-party challenges at a presidential level. At a House and Senate level, you have a few people who run as independents. But people tend to go right for the presidency because that creates a level of visibility if you're trying to build a party.

If one thinks that the two-party system is a problem, let's talk about solutions. You advocate for something called proportional representation. Explain what that is and why you think it might be a solution here.

Well, proportional representation is the most common system of voting, and it basically, at its simplest level, it means that parties get shares of seats in proportion to what percent of the vote they get. So if a party gets 30 percent of the vote, it gets 30 percent of the seats in the legislature. If it gets 10 percent, it gets 10 percent. Now, there are varieties of proportional representation that we could spend an hour going in the weeds.

Tell me the one you like the best. What would work in the US?

What I think would work in the US is probably the most commonly used version, which is called open list proportional representation with multi-member districts — which is this idea that rather than having a single district with a single representative, you have a single district with five representatives. The district is larger, and then the parties put forward lists of candidates. You choose the candidate from the party that you like, all the votes for each party get tallied up, and then the seats get allocated in proportion. So if a party gets 40 percent of the votes in that five member district, its top two candidates go to represent the district. If a party gets 20 percent, its top candidate [goes]. So, in theory, you could have five parties representing the same district.

“We've never had this level of dissatisfaction with the two-party system as far back as we've seen polling.”

We talk a lot about gerrymandering as a huge problem, and it is. But [if] you move to five member proportional districts, gerrymandering becomes irrelevant. It doesn't matter because votes are going to be allocated proportionally no matter what. So, everybody gets to cast a meaningful vote because every seat matters. Every seat is competitive. Every vote matters. Electoral reform is the most powerful tool we have.

So, at the end of the day, has Elon Musk done something admirable here [by] making this a topic of conversation in a kind of real way?

Yeah. So, I think by raising the issue of the need for a third party, it certainly opens up a conversation about what it would take. I'm not sure Elon's approach is going to be successful. On the other hand, if he's strategic and wants to spoil a few races that will determine control of the House and the Senate by running a spoiler candidate, then, historically, that's actually what has led to a wider conversation about electoral reform. And that's one of the reasons that a lot of countries moved to electoral reform.

We've never had this level of dissatisfaction with the two-party system as far back as we've seen polling. So, there is a real understanding that what we're doing in our electoral system is just not working.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","New Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang recounts a frantic weekend of dealmaking to save the startup: 'I was on the verge of tears'","https://www.businessinsider.com/windsurf-ceo-jeff-wang-openai-google-cognition-deal-2025-7","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 02:38:00 GMT","

In the ultra-competitive world of artificial intelligence, dealmaking sometimes must be a frantic, around-the-clock affair.

The recent deal between AI startup Windsurf and Cognition, which took place over a single weekend sprint, was no exception.

To sum it up: The industry's most successful AI startup, OpenAI, was initially set to acquire Windsurf, which makes an AI coding assistant, in a $3 billion deal. But the deal fell through, and Google swooped in to hire away its CEO and some of its top executives. 

That left the company's remaining executives scrambling to figure out what to do next and to break the news to the company's 250 employees, who were anticipating a windfall from the OpenAI deal.

""It was my job to explain to the company our path forward,"" Windsurf's new CEO, Jeff Wang, wrote in a post on X. Wang was formerly the company's head of business. He had planned to discuss the options — fundraising from VCs, selling the company to someone else, distributing remaining cash, or just keeping it going.

""The mood was very bleak,"" Wang wrote. ""Some people were upset about financial outcomes or colleagues leaving, while others were worried about the future. A few were in tears.""

Later that day, a ray of light emerged. Wang said Cognition cofounder Scott Wu, and its president, Russell Kaplan, reached out. They wanted what was left of Windsurf.

Cognition makes the AI coding agent Devin, which it calls ""the first AI software engineer."" It is valued at $4 billion, coming off a $120 million funding round in March, according to PitchBook.

Wang saw the melding of the company's products as a potential win-win. 

""Devin would benefit from a foreground synchronous agent, while we needed a remote asynchronous agent,"" he wrote. Added to that, he was excited about both companies sharing talent.

The dealmaking kicked off immediately. They brought in lawyers and spent all weekend hashing it out.

In just over 24 hours, they had signed a letter of intent, the first step. A key part of the deal was prioritizing Windsurf employees — ensuring payouts, waiving cliffs, and accelerating equity vesting, Wang said.

Lawyers pored over the deal all day Sunday, and by Monday morning, it was finalized. One lawyer called the deal ""one of the fastest"" they had ever seen, Wang wrote.

When the deal was at last announced to Windsurf's employees Monday morning, Wang said they celebrated.

""The applause from our people seemed to last forever, and I was on the verge of tears myself,"" Wang said.

Japan's ruling coalition looked set to lose its majority in the upper house, according to exit polls, an outcome that would further weaken embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's leadership and potentially unsettle markets.

A poll by public broadcaster NHK showed that the ruling coalition is set to secure about 32-51 seats of the 125 up for grabs in Sunday's election, likely leaving it short of the 50 needed to maintain a majority in the 248-member chamber. The Asahi newspaper estimated that Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito would win 41 seats combined. Nikkei said the bloc is expected to lose a significant number of seats, without giving an estimate.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

European Union envoys are set to meet as early as this week to formulate a plan for measures to respond to a possible no-deal scenario with US President Donald Trump, whose tariff negotiating position is seen to have stiffened ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline.

The overwhelming preference is to keep negotiations with Washington on track in a bid for an outcome to the impasse ahead of next month's deadline. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The state GOP is locked in a Byzantine power struggle amid the downfall of a disgraced financier and an explosion of conspiracy theories. Sound familiar?

Not a good time for the Georgia GOP to get distracted.

The MAGA-world blow-up over the Trump administration's about-face in handling the Jeffrey Epstein files isn't the only conspiracy-fueled dispute splintering Republicans. Another feud is playing out in the state of Georgia, where a group of ultraconservative Republicans that rose to power with the backing of a wealthy financier is at war with the GOP leadership over control of the party.

The infighting may provide a window into what Republicans are now facing as the heretofore monolithic MAGA movement begins to fissure. And whether nationally or in Georgia, an intraparty firefight could darken the party's chances in the midterms.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Department of Justice seal at the headquarters in Washington, DC.

The US Justice Department is conducting a criminal antitrust investigation into whether some investors in collateralized loan obligations colluded to bolster their positions as markets transitioned away from the scandal-plagued London interbank offer rate in early 2023, according to people familiar with the matter.

Antitrust prosecutors in New York have sent subpoenas to financial firms as they seek to determine whether investors with an equity stake in the $1.3 trillion CLO market illegally coordinated as the underlying buyout debt was repriced, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential probe. The investigation was opened about a year-and-a-half ago, the people said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The European Central Bank is likely to stare down the economic danger posed by US President Donald Trump's tariffs by opting to leave a potential cut in borrowing costs for another day.

In their final decision before a seven-week summer break, policymakers on Thursday will probably keep the interest rate unchanged at 2%, pushing off a response to Trump's threatened tariffs of 30% until they materialize and their impact can be better assessed.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

A car slammed into a crowd outside a Los Angeles nightclub early Saturday morning, injuring at least 30 people, before the driver was assaulted by onlookers and shot, the city's police and fire departments said.

At least seven people were in critical condition and six others were seriously injured, the fire department said in an online statement.

The incident, which took place outside a club called The Vermont, occurred just before 2 a.m. local time (0900 GMT), the fire and police departments said.

Captain Adam VanGerpen, a fire department spokesperson, was quoted by ABC News as saying the car apparently first careened into a taco truck outside the club and then through a valet stand and into a large group of people.

The Los Angeles Police Department said on X it was still investigating why the driver slammed into the crowd.

Officers responding to a radio call of an assault with a deadly weapon found the driver had been shot while being assaulted by onlookers, the police said, adding that he was taken to a hospital and his condition was unknown.

A man suspected of shooting the driver fled the scene on foot and possibly was armed with a silver revolver, the police said.

Next week, the CNBC teams are back on the road – and it's all about the banks and the ECB. From Frankfurt to Milan, and Paris to London, the financials are in focus.

The markets seem to be banking on the financial sector to keep up the positive earnings momentum this quarter. Citi described the first quarter as ""remarkably resilient,"" with analysts now expecting Stoxx 600 earnings-per-share growth to turn positive year-on-year this quarter.

Much of that optimism is centered on the big banks, while other sectors like luxury, autos and energy have been plagued by earnings downgrades.

Unicredit kicks things off on Wednesday. The Italian banking giant will try to keep investors focused on the numbers, rather than its M&A ambitions. While its moves around Commerzbank have seen it increase its equity stake to 20%, Saxo Bank analysts highlight the uncertainty around its potential takeover of Banco BPM, after an Italian court blocked the move until further conditions are met. The stock is up over 50% so far this year, providing some cheer for CEO Andrea Orcel as he battles to keep his expansion plans on track.

French financial BNP Paribas — the euro zone's largest lender by assets — reports earnings on Thursday.

Last quarter, the bank soared past expectations driven by performance at its investment bank, but revised its profitability target slightly lower.

On the same day, attention will turn to Frankfurt for Deutsche Bank's latest set of numbers. The German lender logged its best profit in 14 years last quarter, benefiting from increased trading volumes around the market volatility. CEO Christian Sewing told CNBC in June that he sees an opportunity for Europe to invest more in its own defense sector as a key growth area.

For macro-watchers, the highlight of the week in Europe will come from the European Central Bank. President Christine Lagarde and her fellow policymakers are expected to keep rates on hold at 2% on Thursday. But there is a BIG catch…

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats are not expected to derail this meeting's outcome, according to Reuters, citing five ECB governing council member sources. But if Trump does push ahead with 30% tariffs on EU imports, there is a broad assumption the ECB will cut rates in response.

Investors will have until Sept. 11 to assess the impact, as the ECB breaks for the summer after this week's meeting.

In terms of the underlying economic conditions, Deutsche Bank warns that European inflation risks are ""still being underestimated, with a remarkable complacency across key assets,"" with the tariff impact yet to fully trickle through.

The bank's macro strategist also told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe that the Aug. 1 tariff deadline for negotiations between the U.S. and EU sets the stage for a late outcome to trigger a ""very sharp market reaction.""

Start spreading the news: Retirees are moving out of New York City.

As well as other major cities, including Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Denver and San Diego, California, according to a June study by SmartAsset, which analyzed data from the Census Bureau's latest American Community Survey.

These cities experienced the highest net loss of residents aged 60 and over in 2023, meaning significantly more people in the age group moved out than moved in.

While larger cities could have higher net migration numbers because they have more people, what stands out about New York is the scale of retirees leaving: Nearly 24,000 seniors left the city in a single year — more than triple the number who moved in, and more than three times the net outflow of the next-highest city.

Four of the top 10 cities retirees left were in California, which had the highest net loss of residents aged 60 and over. The state lost 56,858 residents over 60 in 2023, according to the study.

Here are the top 10 U.S. cities retirees fled in 2023, ranked by the highest net outflow of people aged 60 and over.

Retirees may choose to move for various reasons, such as being closer to family, enjoying better weather or taking advantage of more favorable tax laws, but a high cost of living can also be a major factor in deciding to leave a city.

In September, WalletHub ranked New York City as the priciest city to retire in, and a majority of the top 10 cities that retirees are leaving are in states where you typically need over $1 million in savings to retire comfortably, according to an analysis by GOBankingRates earlier this year.

In New York state, you can expect to need around $1.3 million in savings to retire, while in California you'll need about $1.6 million, the analysis says.

As parents, we spend so much time helping our kids succeed on the outside — teaching them words, setting routines, and encouraging good behavior.

But there's one skill that quietly shapes whether they'll be successful in life: self-connection, or the ability to tune into one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice. When kids feel safe in who they are, they carry that sense of worth into every relationship, challenge, and decision. When they don't, it can unravel their self-esteem from the inside out.

I've spent years studying over 200 parent-child relationships, and I'm a mother myself. The No. 1 thing I tell other parents is that if they teach their kid just one skill in life, it needs to be self-connection.

The loss of self-connection happens in small, well-meaning interactions that send the wrong message. A toddler cries after a toy is taken away. A parent says, ""You're okay. It's not a big deal."" What the child hears is: ""My feelings don't matter.""

Or they might say they're scared at bedtime. The parent responds, ""There's nothing to be scared of."" To the child, it can feel like: ""I shouldn't feel this way, so I guess I shouldn't trust my feelings.""

Subtle messages like this, repeated over time, chip away at a child's ability to connect with themselves. They then become more anxious, reactive, insecure, or they'll shut down entirely. Even worse, they can carry those patterns into adulthood.

But here's how self-connection adds value to their lives:

The good news? You don't need to overhaul your parenting style to help your kids stay self-connected. Small shifts make a big difference.

Resist the urge to say, ""You're fine."" Instead, try: ""That was upsetting, wasn't it? I'm here.""

Validation doesn't mean agreement. It means showing your child that their emotional world is real and safe to express. This helps them develop trust in their feelings, which is a key component of self-connection.

Give spaces for messy emotions, hard questions, and quirky traits. When kids feel seen and accepted, even when they're angry or scared, they learn: ""All of me is welcome.""

This sense of belonging strengthens self-worth and emotional confidence well into adulthood.

Micromanaging chips away at self-trust. Give your child age-appropriate choices, whether it's picking their outfit, managing sibling dynamics, or deciding how to spend their afternoon.

Letting them experiment and recover in a safe space helps them build their inner voice and resilience.

Say things like: ""I'm feeling overwhelmed. I need to take a deep breath.""

When you name and regulate your own emotions, your child learns that feelings aren't something to fear or suppress — they're signals that can be acknowledged and handled.

Swap ""Why did you do that?"" for: ""What were you feeling when that happened?""

A curious, compassionate tone invites introspection. And over time, your words become their internal dialogue.

When a child lashes out, it's easy to focus on the yelling or refusal. But behavior is often a message: Are they feeling disconnected? Powerless? Unheard?

Meeting the need behind the behavior helps your child understand they're not ""bad,"" they're just human.

Yes, achievements matter. But also notice and name the qualities that often go unseen: ""You're so thoughtful with your friends,"" or, ""I love how curious you are.""

These reminders reinforce the idea that they're loved for who they are, not just what they achieve.

Typhoon Wipha toppled trees and caused major flight disruptions Sunday in Hong Kong and at some nearby airports in China as it moved west off the southern coast of the country.

Airports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and the casino hub of Macao canceled or postponed flights for most of the day, according to their websites. Hong Kong grounded at least 400 flights, affecting around 80,000 passengers, broadcaster RTHK said. Some high-speed train services were also suspended.

The typhoon stayed just offshore until about 6 p.m., when it made landfall in a coastal area of Taishan city in Guangdong province, China's National Meteorological Center said. It then weakened to a severe tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 108 kph (67 mph).

Earlier Sunday, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a hurricane signal No. 10, its highest warning. The eye of the storm passed just south of the city around midday with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph (87 mph), the observatory said.

The high winds brought down trees in Zhuhai and other cities on China's southern coast.

In Hong Kong, vehicles weaved around branches strewn on the streets. The government said that it had received more than 450 reports of fallen trees and that 26 people had sought medical treatment at public hospitals. A statement didn't provide details on any injuries.

More than 250 people had sought refuge in public shelters, the statement said. Hong Kong Disneyland and other amusement parks were closed.

The storm, which reached typhoon strength overnight, later passed off Macao and was forecast to make landfall on China's coast late Sunday. It is expected to reach Vietnam later this week.

Wipha, which is a Thai name, passed over the Philippines at tropical storm strength and drenched parts of Taiwan on Saturday. Names for typhoons in the western Pacific are chosen by the countries in the region.

In the Philippines, the storm intensified seasonal monsoon rains, leaving at least one villager dead in floodwaters in northern Cagayan province.

More than 370,000 people have been affected by days of stormy weather, including 43,000 who fled to government-run emergency shelters or homes of relatives because of flooding, landslides and fierce winds. More than 400 houses were damaged, officials said.

Elsewhere in Asia, five days of torrential rain in South Korea has left 14 people dead and 12 others missing, the government said Sunday.

 Santiment says the “historic social dominance spike” may indicate another buying opportunity for Bitcoin soon. 

Nearly half of all crypto-related mentions on social media this week centered around Bitcoin as it hit new highs, a level of dominance that may signal a local top and a potential short-term pullback, according to sentiment platform Santiment.

“As Bitcoin's market value crept above $123.1K for the first time in its 17+ year history, there was an equally historic social dominance spike,” Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan said in a report on Wednesday.

“43.06% of all crypto discussions were about $BTC just as the coin's market value was peaking,” Quinlivan added. Quinlivan said that “the sudden spike was indicative of many retail traders FOMO'ing in,” challenging the view held by several other industry participants who believe retail investors have yet to enter the market. 

On July 11, Bitwise head of research André Dragosch said, Bitcoin (BTC) is at new all-time highs, but retail is “almost nowhere to be found.”

Just three days after, on Monday, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $123,100 on Binance, before retracing to $117,011 at the time of publication, according to Nansen data.

Quinlivan said that while rising sentiment may seem positive, history shows that spikes in social media mentions about Bitcoin are often followed by price declines.

“Wait for the euphoria to cool down some, and you'll likely find another key entry point coming up,” he said.

It comes after Quinlivan's recent warning that similar spikes in trader optimism were followed by Bitcoin price drops on both June 11 and July 7.

However, some analysts say the uptrend is likely to continue.

On Wednesday, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr pointed to the absence of the Bitcoin peak signal, which is a metric that shows up when the market is overheated, suggesting “we're not at a peak yet.”

However, Galaxy Digital's head of franchise trading, Michael Harvey, said Bitcoin could be in for a brief consolidation phase after its recent surge to new all-time highs, but another leg up before the end of July isn't off the table.

“Consolidation around current prices is my base case given the large rally and new ATH,” Harvey told Cointelegraph.

 Bitcoin and Ether traders are eyeing price milestones into the weekly close, with a resistance trend line keeping BTC bulls from heading to all-time highs. 

Key points:

Bitcoin market participants expect a resistance trend line breakout, with nearby targets including $125,000.

Attention continues to focus on altcoins while Bitcoin consolidates, with Ether reaching seven-month highs.

Upside potential across altcoins remains, with many not yet copying Ether's rebound, says the latest market commentary.

Bitcoin (BTC) circled $118,500 into Sunday's weekly close as traders waited for a new upside BTC price breakout.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD heading higher after a trip below $117,000 Friday.

The pair retained much of its gains through the week, still shy of new all-time highs as consolidation took over.

Now, traders say, a resistance trend line stands in the way of Bitcoin returning to price discovery above $123,000.

“BTC is getting ready for a big move,” popular trader Marcus Corvinus told X followers in a post on the day.

Uploading a chart showing the trend line in question, Corvinus said that a breakout would take BTC/USDT to $125,000 next.

“If it breaks below support, price may fall to $111,000 or lower,” he added. 

On daily time frames, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital eyed a similar structure.

“Bitcoin remains in the Range and the consolidation continues, facilitating further money flow into Altcoins,” he commented on his own chart.

As Cointelegraph reported, altcoins have returned to the radar this week as Bitcoin consolidates.

Of particular interest are largest altcoin Ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP), which are both fielding lofty price predictions.

“Ethereum has long ago resynchronised with its $2200-$3900 Macro Range,” summarized in part of an X post which included a chart stretching back to late 2023.

Crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe called the rebound on ETH/USD ""absolutely phenomenal.”

“Ethereum is the first one to move and it has basically ran back to the highs of December '24. That means that there's still a lot of upside to come,” he argued at the weekend. 

On Sunday, ETH/USD traded above $3,750 for the first time since December 18, 2024.

In a twist of fate, Vanguard has become the largest shareholder of the most established Bitcoin equity play.

The $10 trillion asset manager has famously refused to touch Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies while its peers have jumped headfirst in the past year.

Now Vanguard is the largest shareholder in MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), a firm whose value proposition is that it is the most established Bitcoin proxy in the stock market, Bloomberg reported on Monday.

Vanguard owns more than 20 million shares of all of MicroStrategy's outstanding class A shares, worth over $9 billion, the report said. Bloomberg said that the firm likely surpassed Capital Group in Q4 2024 to claim the top spot among the firm's shareholders. In comparison, MicroStrategy Chair Michael Saylor owns just under 20 million shares, according to an April company filing.

The disconnect between Vanguard's professed cryptocurrency stance and its financial holdings primarily comes from its passive index fund strategies through funds like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (NASDAQ:VITSX), Vanguard Extended Market Index (NASDAQ:VIEIX) and the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VUG).

But Vanguard also has exposure to MicroStrategy in some of its actively managed funds. Still, the firm maintains that this is not the result of conviction but the fact that those funds are comprised of stocks chosen by mathematical models.

“God has a sense of humor,” Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas told Bloomberg. “Vanguard chose this life. When you have an index fund, you have to own all the stocks, for better or worse, and that includes stocks that you may not like or approve of personally.”

NovaDius Wealth Management President Nate Geraci said Tuesday on X, “if you don't see the irony here, I don't know what to tell you.”

Meanwhile, VanEck Head of Digital Assets Research Matthew Sigel said, “Indexing into $9B of what you openly mock isn't strategy. It's institutional dementia.”

The views come as Vanguard now already offers its customers indirect cryptocurrency exposure through its funds, but refuses to offer customers access to products like Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform.

""What Vanguard is missing (*huge* miss IMO)... Is there are tons of investors who love Vanguard's low cost approach to stock & bond investing AND they want to own some btc & crypto,” Geraci said. “Vanguard is essentially making a *market call* on btc/crypto. And alienating a lot of investors.”

While Vanguard struggles to fight off the cryptocurrency wave, competitors like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity are divvying market share amid significant demand. For example, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT) has become the fastest ETF to hit $80 billion in assets under management. Also, IBIT now generates more revenue for BlackRock than its product tracking the S&P 500.

Vanguard's inability to avoid offering cryptocurrency exposure to customers despite its views on the asset class highlights how intertwined the asset class now is with traditional finance. Depending on who you ask, that can be a sign of progress or a looming financial disaster.

Oops, something went wrong

A handful of publicly traded companies, including SharpLink Gaming, have now embraced the Ethereum treasury company model.

Just like the Bitcoin treasury company model, it relies on raising money from investors to buy crypto.

It remains to be seen if a strategy created for Bitcoin will be just as successful for Ethereum.

10 stocks we like better than Ethereum ›

Something very interesting is going on with Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) right now. Small, relatively unknown companies are starting to add Ether, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, to their balance sheets as part of a new strategy designed to lift their stock market valuations. And so far, it's working.

Case in point: during the past 30 days, shares of SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET) are up a whopping 150% (as of July 18). SharpLink Gaming has attracted so much attention with its new crypto strategy that it's almost certain to attract other companies as well.

In a very short time, SharpLink Gaming has become the largest corporate holder of Ether coins on the planet. It now holds 280,706 coins, worth about $960 million at recent prices. To put that figure into perspective, that's more Ether than even the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation holds.

In early July, the company raised more than $400 million for its Ether war chest. After its latest buy in mid-July, it still has more than $250 million for future purchases, so it's likely that we'll be hearing more from SharpLink Gaming soon.

If this strategy sounds familiar, that's because the Ethereum treasury company model is a replica of the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) treasury company model pioneered by Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), the company formerly known as MicroStrategy. The concept is very simple: Instead of using cash from operations to fund crypto purchases, you tap the capital markets for funding. Once you have this funding lined up, you go on a crypto buying spree.

All of this works as long as the price of the cryptocurrency continues to go up. We've seen this work with Bitcoin, because the price of Bitcoin -- aside from a few pullbacks here and there -- has mostly gone up during the past 24 months. The same might be said for Ethereum, which is up 7% in 2025 (as of July 18) after registering losses for much of the year. It remains to be seen if Ethereum can deliver the same type of performance as Bitcoin, which is up 30% in the same period.

For now, only a handful of publicly traded companies have adopted this strategy. Two other notable examples are Bitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSEMKT: BMNR) and Bit Digital (NASDAQ: BTBT). Both announced their pivots to this model in June.

Now that the groundwork has been laid, it's easy to see how other companies could be tempted to jump in. The price of Ether is still only $3,600, which makes raising money from investors easier than raising money to buy Bitcoin at about $120,000. The lower barrier to entry is likely to be much more attractive for small-cap companies with relatively limited access to the capital markets.

Right now, I have mixed feelings about SharpLink Gaming, which is also a marketing partner for sports betting books and online casino operators. Just look at this chart, and you'll see why I think it's a risky gamble:

In mid-2025, the company's stock had been flatlining. Nothing it did could get its stock price up. Until, of course, it latched on to the idea of investing in Ethereum.

And I'm not very enthusiastic about Bitmine Immersion Technologies, either. Granted, it now has renowned investment strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat as its chairman. That gives it a lot of power to reach out to investors for more capital.

But what in the world is a Bitcoin mining company doing buying Ether? It doesn't make any sense to me. We can ask the same about Bit Digital, which is now winding down its Bitcoin mining operations. How can you be an evangelist for Ethereum when your core DNA is rooted in Bitcoin?

That's why I'm starting to appreciate Strategy more and more these days. While Michael Saylor, the founder and executive chairman of the company, can be a bit over the top in his predictions, he's a strong evangelist for Bitcoin. I get the impression that, from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed, he's thinking about Bitcoin. That's the type of person I want running a crypto treasury company.

So before you invest in an Ethereum treasury company, make sure you do your due diligence. Only a small handful of them may ever turn into long-term plays worthy of your investment.

Before you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum: Overbought and overcrowded, is ETH due for a cooldown?","https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-overbought-and-overcrowded-is-eth-due-for-a-cooldown/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:02:06 GMT","

Is Ethereum's rally running out of steam under the weight of overbought momentum?



Ethereum is riding high with a 46.62% Q3 ROI, but with RSI overheated and over 95% of supply in profit, signs of exhaustion are flashing, hinting at a potential pullback before $4k is in play.

Ethereum [ETH] is ripping through Q3 with a 46.62% ROI so far, already outpacing the last two quarters, with price hovering around $3,640 at press time.

Notably, the last time Ethereum saw a monthly move this aggressive was in November, when it rallied 47.21% and tapped a local high near $3,740. 



 But that explosive move triggered a brutal Q1 drawdown. ETH retraced over 50% of its gains, while Bitcoin [BTC] held up relatively well, dipping just 10%, as BTC dominance ripped past 62% for the first time since 2021.

Source: Coinglass

In simple terms, Bitcoin and Ethereum have been trading out of phase, and the charts reflect that too. 

BTC dominance RSI has dropped into extremely oversold territory, while ETH's daily RSI remains overheated, reinforcing the sharp divergence between ETH's 46% monthly run and BTC's modest 9.96% climb.

However, with BTC.D now approaching the key 60% support zone, the setup looks ripe for a rotation. If dominance catches a bounce, could we see capital flow back into BTC, putting ETH at risk of a Q1-style pullback?

Beyond the overheated ROI and stretched momentum, Ethereum's % supply in profit adds another layer to the setup. 

With ETH pushing toward $3.7k, over 95% of the supply is now in the green, entering a historically saturated zone that's typically marked by distribution.

We've seen this play out before.

Similar spikes into the 95–100% range (highlighted by the red band), particularly in late December 2024 and early January 2025, lined up with ETH's sharp Q1 reversal, as profit-taking pressure kicked in.

Source: Glassnode

However, it looks like smart money might be getting ahead of that risk.

Lookonchain tracked two fresh whale wallets, scooping up 58,268 ETH at an average cost basis of $3,680, roughly $212 million in size. That adds to the $18 billion+ in large transfers flowing through the Ethereum network.

But is that enough to lock in a bottom? Not just yet. ETH's approaching a key inflection zone, and if past cycles are anything to go by, a shakeout or reset could be on the cards before $4k becomes a clean target again.

Aside from a new all-time high in the Bitcoin market, the last trading week also heralded some altseason shouts as a slight price decline by the premier cryptocurrency coincided with significant price rallies by major altcoins. A popular market analyst with the X username PlanD has weighed in on these recent market developments, highlighting three factors that would confirm the presence of an altseason.

A BTC.D Retest At 63% May Mark Crucial Altseason Moment – Analyst

Over the last week, a bullish rise in the altcoin market cap to $1.45 trillion sparked widespread speculations about the current status of the altseason. Interestingly, in an X post on July 19, PlanD outlines three market events that will signal the altseason's commencement, namely a potential pullback in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside a critical technical development in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D).

Following Bitcoin's ascent beyond $121,000 and Ethereum's price rise above $3,400, PlanD says the first two signals to watch for are healthy corrections in these assets' prices. Specifically, the analyst explains that pullbacks toward the $111,000 and $3,250 regions for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, present an ideal situation that would allow capital to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, effectively causing a decline in BTC.D.

Far from indicating weakness, PlanD says this retracement could actually catalyze the rise broader crypto market. Notably, if Ethereum finds support at $3,250, the ETH/BTC pair could strengthen, creating a favorable setup for altcoin rallies. This is because a stronger ETH/BTC pair is often a precursor to altcoin outperformance, as it signals increased investor appetite beyond Bitcoin.

The third and perhaps most pivotal signal is unfolding in Bitcoin dominance. After months of holding above a rising support trendline, Plan D notes BTC.D has broken below it, signaling a potential change in market structure. However, the next test lies at the 63.40% dominance level. Should BTC.D retest this zone and fail to reclaim it, the analyst believes a new downtrend in dominance may begin, i.e., presenting the largest hallmark of altseason.

In case of this scenario, PlanD also tells investors to expect strong bullish momentum in tokens linked to sectors such as real-world Assets (RWA), artificial Intelligence (AI), and gaming beyond the large and medium-cap tokens on popular blockchains.

Crypto Market Overview

At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is valued at $3.83 trillion following a 0.20% decline in the past day. More data from CoinMarketCap shows the Fear & Greed index sits at 69, suggesting a healthy level of risk appetite from investors. Importantly, the altseason index ranks at 42, indicating a rising momentum in the market's favor for altcoins.

Oops, something went wrong

Wall Street has long mastered the creative art of turning complexity into a money-printing machine. How do they do it? Financial engineering — an art of structuring debt, equity, and derivatives to squeeze out returns in ways that often defy convention.

It's a playbook that made fortunes — and nearly broke the system in 2008. Now, this complex engineering of money has entered the crypto market.

With Wall Street's takeover of crypto, financial engineering is fast becoming a pillar of the crypto market. It is now at the center of the latest iteration of one of the hottest trends in the space: the crypto treasury strategy.

This trend is championed by Michael Saylor, whose company — MicroStrategy (MSTR), now rebranded simply as Strategy — began acquiring bitcoin as both a corporate reserve asset and a market signal.

But the real innovation wasn't just buying BTC and holding it. It was how the firm financed those purchases: issuing convertible notes and equity to raise capital, then cycling that capital into buying more bitcoin. Each announcement triggered a surge in Strategy's share price, which in turn made new capital raises easier and more lucrative.

Others took note.

What began as a bitcoin bet turned into a blueprint for a new kind of treasury management: announce crypto treasury strategy, stock pumps, raise funds, buy tokens, watch the share price pop more, repeat.

This is the new ""Infinite Money Glitch,"" according to Animoca Brands Research.

""This financial engineering approach of utilizing debt and equity issuances, such as convertible notes and stock offerings, specifically to raise funds for continuous crypto asset acquisitions creates a “flywheel"" effect,"" the firm said in a research note.

Obviously, this money printing machine didn't stop with bitcoin. Smaller firms started to apply this to other popular altcoins, including XRP, ETH and SOL.

But why altcoins? After all, the bitcoin market has matured, the cycle has been well defined, and the likes of Michael Saylor have shown that the returns serve the shareholders well while enabling firms to continue to raise funds.

It's the early-stage advantage, according to Animoca's research.

""Applying this 'flywheel' model to altcoins might offer a more extended runway for growth and profitability compared to bitcoin. While bitcoin's market is more mature and its price discovery has undergone several major cycles, the vast and diverse altcoin market is still, in many respects, in its nascent stages,"" the research noted.

A quick look at the return charts shows that in the short term, this altcoin treasury strategy has paid off for the firms and their shareholders.

""On the day of the [altcoin treasury] announcement, share prices saw an average increase of 161%. This upward trend persisted, with average gains of 150% one day after, 185% after seven days, and 226% after 30 days,"" the note said.

""This immediate market response also underscores the market's willingness to invest in publicly traded 'wrappers' for altcoin exposure.""

Interestingly, launching these treasury strategies didn't impact the actual prices of the underlying tokens, Animoca's data shows. This perhaps makes a compelling case for investors to flock to these equity ""wrappers"" rather than to the actual tokens.

Also, the lack of altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) means that Wall Street has limited options but to buy into these strategy companies to capture the upside.

For investors, these massive short-term gains are hard to ignore, and as long as there is an appetite for such financial engineering, capital will continue to flow into them.

The only question is: Is this sustainable?

""Should market sentiment shift or altcoin prices experience a prolonged decline, the leveraged nature of some of these strategies that could be employed carries substantial inherent risks,"" Animoca Brands research analysts said.

""Nevertheless, the trend highlights a significant addressable market for structured products that bridge traditional finance with crypto,"" the report added.

So for now, the ""Infinite Money Glitch"" is here for the win.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Cryptocurrency analysis company Alphractal has issued a cautionary report regarding the altcoin market, highlighting both the potential for higher returns and the risks associated with investing in these digital assets. The report notes that altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in recent days, with investors achieving higher returns by taking positions in altcoins instead of BTC, according to daily signals.

However, Alphractal's report also includes a warning signal: the Correlation Heatmap. This map indicates that the average correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin is rapidly declining, even turning negative in some cases. This suggests that altcoins are no longer tracking Bitcoin's price movements, which could be a precursor to high volatility and mass liquidations of long or short positions. According to Alphractal's analysis, this low correlation has historically been observed before periods of increased market volatility.

Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson emphasized the importance of Bitcoin's correlation with classic market indicators, such as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Wedson noted that Bitcoin's current low, even negative, correlation with the VIX suggests that BTC is moving more independently from the S&P 500. Historically, this has coincided with periods of increased volatility and often price rallies in the following year. Wedson advised investors to be cautious, stating that if the VIX is low, it could indicate an explosive move for Bitcoin, but if the VIX is high, it might be more prudent to monitor stocks due to potential market fear impacting BTC.

Prominent crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also issued a warning to beginners about the risks associated with altcoins. While altcoins have the potential for significant returns, they also come with amplified risks. Van de Poppe's caution is timely, given the current market conditions and the potential for increased volatility. The recent divergence in the correlation between Bitcoin and altcoins, as shown in a heatmap, could be a sign of increasing market volatility. This divergence suggests that altcoins may not follow Bitcoin's price movements as closely as they have in the past, which could lead to a severe price downturn for altcoins.

An on-chain analyst also noted the decoupling of Bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies or altcoins, which could lead to a severe price downturn within the altcoin market. This warning is based on on-chain metrics that signal overextension in the Bitcoin market, which could have a ripple effect on altcoins. Bitcoin's recent peak has triggered warnings of a potential local top as on-chain metrics signal overextension. The overall trend classification for the crypto market remains ""weak bullish,"" but multiple technical indicators are flashing warning signs that suggest potential downward pressure.

Despite the warnings, some altcoins, such as Binance Coin and Ethereum, have shown impressive price action. Binance Coin has surpassed resistance levels as its ecosystem thrives, particularly in decentralized exchanges. Ethereum has also seen a significant price increase, reclaiming the $3,000 level. While this price action could be a sign of increased investor confidence, it also comes with its own set of risks and could indicate increased volatility in the altcoin market.

Elon Musk has also warned against excessive investment in cryptocurrencies, urging caution. His advice aligns with the warnings issued by other analysts about the risks associated with altcoins. Musk's role in the crypto market remains a topic of discussion, with some speculating that he could be an active player in the future.

In summary, the current warnings from analysts about the risks associated with altcoins are timely and relevant. The potential for increased volatility in the altcoin market, as well as the decoupling of Bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies, are factors that investors should consider. The recent price action of altcoins, such as Binance Coin and Ethereum, could be a sign of increased investor confidence, but it also comes with its own set of risks. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before investing in altcoins.

Home - Reviews - Maple Finance Review: Where Blockchain Meets Real-World Borrowing Needs

Maple Finance pioneers institutional-grade lending within DeFi, bridging blockchain technology with traditional credit markets. This ecosystem connects vetted borrowers seeking capital with yield-focused lenders through a unique delegated pool structure. Its evolution includes migrating from MPL to the SYRUP governance token and expanding access via Syrup.fi.







Maple Finance functions as a decentralized lending platform that is based on blockchain technology. Its core purpose is to facilitate lending and borrowing within the crypto ecosystem, specifically targeting institutional participants. Instead of traditional banks, Maple leverages smart contracts deployed on networks like Ethereum and Solana to create a permissionless infrastructure for capital allocation, aiming to provide efficient and transparent access to credit.

The platform functions as a crucial link between institutional borrowers seeking capital (such as cryptocurrency trading firms, market makers, and fintech companies) and lenders looking for yield (typically accredited investors and decentralized autonomous organizations – DAOs). 

Maple Finance specializes in providing uncollateralized or undercollateralized loans, a significant offering within the often overcollateralized DeFi lending space, addressing a key need for established crypto businesses requiring working capital.



A defining feature of Maple Finance's structure is the use of Pool Delegates. These are professional entities or teams responsible for originating loans, performing due diligence and credit assessment on potential borrowers, setting loan terms (like interest rates), and actively managing the performance of specific lending pools on the platform. Lenders effectively delegate the critical task of credit risk evaluation and management to these designated experts.

Maple Finance positions itself as a capital-efficient solution for institutional crypto participants. It emphasizes transparency, with loan terms, borrower identities (often disclosed), and pool performance visible on-chain. By offering fixed-rate, term loans primarily in stablecoins like USDC, Maple aims to provide predictable yields for lenders and reliable funding for vetted institutional borrowers, differentiating itself within the broader decentralized finance landscape.







Maple Finance organizes capital through distinct lending pools created and managed by Pool Delegates. Lenders deposit funds, primarily stablecoins like USDC, directly into these specific pools. Each pool operates under predefined parameters set by its Delegate, including target borrower profiles, interest rate models, and fee structures. 

Lenders choose which pools to fund based on the Delegate's reputation, strategy, and the offered terms, effectively allocating their capital to specific credit strategies.

Institutional borrowers apply for loans through a specific Pool Delegate. The Delegate conducts rigorous due diligence, including assessing the borrower's financial health, track record, business model, and proposed loan purpose. This involves evaluating creditworthiness beyond just on-chain collateral. 

Based on this assessment, the Delegate negotiates loan terms (amount, interest rate, duration, covenants) and approves or rejects the application, acting as the underwriter and risk manager for their pool.

Once approved, the loan agreement is formalized on-chain via Maple's smart contracts. Funds are drawn from the chosen lending pool and transferred to the borrower's wallet. The contract automatically enforces the loan terms, including repayment schedules and interest accrual. Repayments made by the borrower (principal + interest) flow back into the lending pool's smart contract, ready for redistribution to lenders or reinvestment into new loans.







SYRUP serves as the foundational governance and utility token for Maple Finance and its Syrup.fi platform. Holders stake SYRUP (as stSYRUP) to participate in protocol governance, voting on upgrades, fee structures, and ecosystem enhancements. Stakers also earn rewards from protocol fee buybacks, directly tying token value to Maple's operational success. Additionally, SYRUP incentivizes lender participation in Syrup.fi pools through “Drips”, convertible rewards distributed in seasonal phases to boost user engagement.

SYRUP took the place of Maple's original MPL token through a community-approved migration (MIP-009/MIP-010) with a conversion ratio of 1:100. The migration window closed definitively in May 2025. Post-deadline, unconverted MPL and its staked variant (xMPL) lost all utility, governance rights, and staking benefits. 

Residual value from unclaimed MPL was allocated to the Syrup Strategic Fund for ecosystem development. Exchanges like Kraken facilitated automatic conversions, while others (e.g., Coinbase) required manual migration via Maple's portal.

SYRUP warrants consideration only within the speculative allocation of an investment portfolio, suitable exclusively for risk-tolerant participants with multi-year time horizons. Its investment case strengthens those bullish on specific megatrends: institutional blockchain adoption, the convergence of TradFi and DeFi, and the tokenization of real-world assets. 

Prospective investors should continuously monitor protocol metrics including TVL, loan origination volume, and treasury revenue, indicators that directly influence SYRUP's fundamental valuation. While the token offers compelling exposure to institutional DeFi's growth narrative, its ultimate success depends on Maple Finance's execution against an ambitious roadmap and ability to navigate an evolving regulatory landscape.

SYRUP's tokenomics emphasize aligned incentives and deflationary mechanisms. A circulating supply of 1.19B SYRUP supports governance, staking, and liquidity provisioning. Fee revenues from Maple's lending operations fund SYRUP buybacks, distributing value to stakers while countering inflation. 

The token further integrates into Syrup.fi via utility perks, including fee discounts for lenders and enhanced features for long-term depositors. This design positions SYRUP as both a governance lever and a reward engine for Maple's credit ecosystem.







Syrup.fi is a permissionless yield protocol powered by Maple Finance, designed to democratize access to institutional-grade yields for DeFi-native users. It enables anyone to deposit stablecoins like USDC and earn returns sourced from fixed-rate, overcollateralized loans to vetted crypto institutions, with all collateral verifiable on-chain in real-time. 

No KYC is required for lenders, contrasting with Maple's institutional focus. Users receive liquid LP tokens representing their deposits, which can be utilized across DeFi for additional yield opportunities.

Maple Finance pioneers institutional DeFi credit through its delegated lending pools and transparent on-chain infrastructure. The migration to the SYRUP token strengthened governance alignment while Syrup.fi expanded access to institutional yields. By balancing regulatory navigation with blockchain innovation, Maple carves a unique niche in crypto finance, offering scalable capital solutions while redefining trust in decentralized credit markets.

Babylon Protocol has introduced a groundbreaking innovation that transforms Bitcoin into a security layer for blockchain networks. This development challenges Ethereum's dominance in the decentralized security space and enhances the overall security of blockchain ecosystems. By leveraging Babylon Protocol, Bitcoin holders can contribute their BTC to secure blockchain networks in a non-custodial manner, earning yield in the process. This integration allows Bitcoin to actively participate in modular consensus mechanisms, rewarding users who restake their BTC through the protocol.

The protocol incentivizes users by rewarding them for restaking their BTC, thereby enhancing the security of the network. This approach not only secures the blockchain but also provides economic benefits to Bitcoin holders. The non-custodial nature of the protocol ensures that users maintain control over their assets while contributing to the network's security.

Babylon Protocol's integration with various blockchain networks, such as the Union network, further strengthens the security of these ecosystems. By enabling Bitcoin staking, Babylon Protocol introduces a new layer of consensus validation, making the network more robust and resilient against attacks. This innovation is particularly significant as it expands the utility of Bitcoin beyond its traditional role as a store of value and a medium of exchange.

The protocol's ability to handle the behind-the-scenes work, such as keeping track of staked assets and managing the staking process, ensures a seamless and secure experience for users. This technological advancement makes it possible for Bitcoin to be used as a security layer without the need for intermediaries, thereby enhancing the decentralization and security of the network.

SatLayer, a platform built on Babylon Protocol, further enhances this security integration by allowing direct restaking of Bitcoin and liquid staking tokens (LSTs). This eliminates the need for wrapped tokens, reducing the security risks associated with bridged or wrapped assets. SatLayer also offers safety slashing mechanisms, ensuring that applications developed on the platform are stable against threats. The platform recently raised 8 million in pre-seed funding, indicating strong investor confidence in Bitcoin's security capabilities.

This development is poised to have a profound impact on the future of decentralized security and the utility of Bitcoin. By enabling Bitcoin holders to contribute to network security in a non-custodial manner and earning yield in the process, Babylon Protocol challenges Ethereum's dominance and enhances the overall security of blockchain ecosystems. This innovation represents a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency space, opening up new possibilities for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, making it more secure and decentralized.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Shiba Inu ($SHIB), a cryptocurrency that has positioned itself as a competitor to Dogecoin, has recently seen a surge in interest. With a current price of $0.00001338, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 7.05% increase over the past week, boasting a market capitalization of $5.63 billion. Analysts are optimistic about its potential, with some forecasting a 20x rally as the next crypto bull run approaches. This optimism is largely driven by Shibarium, Shiba Inu's Layer-2 network, which promises low fees, fast transactions, and enhanced scalability. Since its launch, transaction volume on the Shibarium testnet has surged, and the ecosystem has seen integrations with DeFi, NFT utilities, and token burns, making it more than just a meme coin.

However, a new player has entered the meme coin arena: Arctic Pablo Coin. This cryptocurrency has gained attention with its unique narrative and location-based presale model, which is redefining what meme finance can look like. Unlike other meme coins that focus on utility, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a storyline that engages users. With each presale drop unlocking fresh chapters and staking rewards as high as 66% APY, this cryptocurrency is not just another meme coin—it's a myth in motion, aiming for a 1951% ROI at launch. The presale model is gamified, with each week unlocking a new location, new mysteries, new artwork, and new price levels, making it a blend of crypto speculation and storytelling.

Another project that has caught the attention of investors is Rollblock. Unlike SHIB or Arctic Pablo Coin, Rollblock is not just a cryptocurrency—it is building a full-blown launch platform for play-to-earn gaming and NFT projects. The platform aims to host new tokens, offer staking-as-a-service, and onboard users into decentralized gaming economies. Rollblock's infrastructure-first approach sets it apart, as the development team is prioritizing UI, user onboarding, and token integrations. Early investors have already shown interest, and excitement is building in Telegram groups about what could be the next big breakout in the crypto world.

Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is making significant strides in the meme coin landscape. Currently in its 32nd presale location, Icebound Estates, the cryptocurrency's animated adventure is more than just storytelling. The presale is not a typical hype-fueled flash in the pan. At $0.0005 per token, with a listing price of $0.008, Arctic Pablo is offering a potential ROI of 1500%. Analysts think $APC might even reach $0.1 in this cycle, which is a blistering 19,900% gain. With over $3 million already raised and 66% APY staking in play, the project combines meme coin hype with long-term investor rewards. Each presale location lasts exactly one week, and at the end of each chapter, unsold tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply crunch. This approach ensures relentless forward motion and hype that snowballs like an avalanche.

For investors looking for the next big thing in the meme coin space, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out. It's not just a token—it's a time-sensitive ticket into a mythical journey that gets more valuable with every passing week. The cryptocurrency runs on Binance Smart Chain, ensuring quick, cheap transactions. The launchpad-like presale model feels gamified, and each week unlocks a new location with new mysteries, new artwork, and new price levels. It's a unique blend of crypto speculation and storytelling that appeals to a younger generation of investors.

In conclusion, Shiba Inu remains a strong contender with the potential for significant gains, especially with the traction gained by Shibarium. Arctic Pablo Coin, with its unique narrative and deflationary mechanics, is quickly becoming a standout in the meme coin space. Rollblock, on the other hand, is quietly building the infrastructure for the next phase of crypto's evolution, offering a launch platform for gaming and NFT tokens. Early adopters who get in on these projects could see substantial returns as the crypto market continues to evolve.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","""The age of gameplay mechanics has already passed,"" says ICO, Shadow of the Colossus director","https://www.eurogamer.net/the-age-of-gameplay-mechanics-has-already-passed-says-ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-director","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 17:03:16 GMT","

""This is not the age to offer new mechanics with each and every new game.""

The director behind ICO and Shadow of the Colossus believes the days of creating new and innovative gameplay mechanics ""has already passed"".

In an interview with To a T and Karamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi earlier this year, Fumito Ueda praised To a T, commending Takahashi for ""not relying on unique gameplay mechanics"".

Talking to Denfaminicogamer, Ueda said he called up Takahashi when To a T was revealed, wanting to know if the unusual game involved any new or complicated mechanics to play. When Takahashi revealed it did not, he responded with a simple: ""That's great!""

Reminded of this exchange during his interview with Takahashi, Ueda joked ""ah, these are the words of a professional"", but then expanded on the comment, explaining that what he meant was that contemporary games felt over-concerned with gameplay (thanks, Automaton).

""While I don't know why I replied with 'that's great' back then, I was most likely thinking – the age of gameplay mechanics had already passed,"" Ueda said. ""I guess this is not the age to release new devices or offer new mechanics with each and every new game.

""Even if there's nothing novel about the mechanics, you can push the game further with a certain vibe or artwork, he added. ""Personal preferences aside, what I'm saying is – I think it would be better to give already existing game mechanics more definition.""

Ueda believes this is why he enjoyed To a T so much; rather than innovating or inventing complex control schemes and mechanics, it instead concentrated on its visuals and story to tell a tale about what it's like to live with a disability.

Interestingly, our Donlan took away a different take. ""Over the five or six hours it takes to play To a T, I've had a series of revelations that in turn built to one giant revelation: I have had the wrong idea about pretty much everything here,"" Donlan wrote when he gave To a T a try.

""As a result, I've never played a game where I spent so much of the time simply trying to work out what it's doing. What's the intent, To a T? What do you want to be? It turns out I wouldn't truly understand any of this until the final credits had rolled. In fact, I'm still thinking about a lot of it.""

The White House has expressed its approval for the passage of the GENIUS Act, a significant piece of legislation aimed at positioning the United States as a leader in the global digital currency revolution. President Donald J. Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act into law, marking the first comprehensive regulatory framework for digital currency in the U.S. This legislation is designed to guide the $250 billion digital currency market.

The GENIUS Act received strong bipartisan support, passing in the House of Representatives with a vote of 308 to 122. Nearly half of the Democratic members and a majority of the Republican members supported the bill, highlighting its importance in shaping the future of digital currency in the U.S. The act is intended to promote innovation and ensure that the U.S. remains competitive in the rapidly evolving digital currency landscape.

President Trump praised the act, stating that it creates a clear and concise regulatory framework for establishing and unleashing the potential of a USD-backed stablecoin. He described it as the greatest revolution in the fintech sector since the birth of the internet. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President's Digital Asset Advisory Committee, emphasized that the act ensures the dominance of the U.S. dollar, fosters innovation, and secures the U.S.'s control over the future of digital finance.

David Sacks, the White House Cryptocurrency Czar, described the passage of the GENIUS Act as another historic legislative milestone, aligning with President Trump's commitment to making the U.S. the global capital of cryptocurrency. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that blockchain technology will drive the next generation of payments, and the U.S. dollar is poised to go on-chain. He credited President Trump's visionary leadership for the act, which will help solidify the dollar's position as the global reserve currency for generations to come.

The GENIUS Act is expected to have significant implications for the digital currency industry. It will facilitate the creation of new digital currency products and services, fostering innovation and competition. The act also aims to protect consumers by ensuring that digital currencies are subject to the same regulatory standards as traditional financial instruments. This legislation represents a pivotal moment for the U.S. as it seeks to lead the global digital currency revolution, attracting investment and talent to the country and further cementing its position as a leader in the digital currency space.

The passage of the GENIUS Act underscores the U.S.'s commitment to innovation and its willingness to adapt to the changing financial landscape. By establishing a regulatory framework for digital currencies, the act ensures that the U.S. remains at the forefront of the digital currency revolution. The legislation is expected to have a positive impact on the digital currency industry, fostering innovation and competition while protecting consumers.

In a statement that marks a major policy shift, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that blockchain technologies will play a central role in the future of American payments, with the U.S. dollar officially moving ""onchain.""

Bessent praised President Trump's “visionary leadership” and acknowledged Senator Bill Hagerty's legislative work in securing the GENIUS Act's passage through Congress. According to the Treasury chief, this new law will help cement the U.S. dollar's role as the global reserve currency for the foreseeable future.

“The U.S. dollar is coming onchain,” Bessent posted on social media, emphasizing that blockchain is set to power the next generation of financial infrastructure.

The GENIUS Act, which aligns federal policy with crypto innovation, appears to be a key part of the Trump administration's broader effort to ensure American dominance in the emerging digital currency era.

While specifics of the onchain dollar implementation remain under wraps, the announcement signals an accelerated push by Washington to digitize national currency, potentially through a U.S.-backed stablecoin or blockchain-integrated payment rails. Bessent's endorsement underscores how blockchain has moved from fringe to foundational in U.S. monetary strategy.

 







JPMorgan and other major U.S. banks are under fire for a lawsuit aimed at dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) newly established “Open Banking Rule.”

The crypto market remains firmly in “Greed” territory, with CoinMarketCap's Fear & Greed Index clocking in at 69/100 on July 19. Despite a modest 24-hour dip from 71, the index has now held above 60 for 11 consecutive days.

The crypto industry saw major advancements this past week across DeFi, NFT, Layer 2, and AI-powered platforms.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, backed by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO), marking a major step toward entering the public markets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Embedding human rights into crypto isn't optional, it's foundational","https://cointelegraph.com/news/human-rights-crypto","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

 Embedding human rights into crypto systems is a necessity. Self-custody, privacy-by-default, and censorship-resistant personhood must be core design principles for any technology. The future of digital freedom depends on it. 

Opinion by: Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Human.Tech

Beyond the hype of accelerationist and technophile circles, a quiet crisis of confidence is taking hold in emerging technologies.

Crypto and decentralized identity solutions still carry enormous potential to empower individuals and distribute power — but many builders and users are sounding the alarm. Their disillusionment stems from real concerns: surveillance overreach, centralization disguised as innovation and tools that serve power, not people.

This conversation is no longer theoretical. From deepfake scams and AI impersonation to state-backed biometric ID proposals and the EU AI Act, digital rights are being defined in real time, often without public consent.

In this climate, the question isn't whether to embed human rights into crypto systems, but how soon we must.

The root of the problem isn't technology itself, but the values embedded in its design. Crypto's future legitimacy depends on embedding human rights into its architecture. 

Principles like self-custody, universal personhood and privacy-by-default shouldn't be treated as optional features — they must be prerequisites for any system that claims to advance human freedom.

If we fail to embed ethical principles into protocols now, we risk recreating the same power dynamics Web3 was meant to disrupt. 

Self-custody has long been a cornerstone of crypto. The failures of centralized exchanges — like those that led to the collapse of FTX — and the usability challenges of many existing custody tools have revealed a critical gap: Most self-custody solutions aren't built for people; they're built for power users.

To be viable at scale, the next generation of custody must preserve user control without sacrificing accessibility. Lost keys, obscure interfaces and fragile backups are unacceptable if the goal is true user empowerment. The future of custody will depend on a design that balances safety, simplicity and sovereignty.

As bots grow more convincing and AI-generated interactions flood the web, proving you're human is becoming more complex and essential. We need methods to verify humanity without compromising privacy or individual autonomy.

State-run biometric IDs and corporate credentialing systems pose serious risks. Instead, decentralized and censorship-resistant systems of personhood must enable individuals to prove their humanity without surrendering it. This is the foundation for trust, integrity and inclusion in digital space.

Surveillance, data breaches and behavioral tracking are the legacy of Web2. Web3 has the opportunity, and the obligation, to break that pattern. Privacy is often treated as an add-on rather than a built-in right.Related: Crypto's true revolution is about humanity, not technology

Privacy-by-default means designing systems that minimize data collection, encrypt by design and preserve autonomy in storing and using data. Visibility should never be the default. Every system should begin from the premise that user protection is a feature, not a toggle.

Some critics argue that embedding values into systems can backfire and that ethical frameworks might be co-opted or politicized. That's a genuine concern. It's still not an excuse for inaction. Transparent system design, open governance and pluralistic alignment mechanisms can mitigate this risk and help ensure protocols remain accountable to users, not just founders or investors.

Web3 offers tools that, if built responsibly, can decentralize control, empower communities and resist misuse. This potential will only be realized if builders consciously embed rights into the protocol layer rather than try to retrofit ethics after launch.

We are at a turning point. Human rights can no longer be treated as external guardrails. They must become internal operating principles for digital infrastructure. That's not a philosophical luxury; it's imperative for design.

The window is open, but narrowing. If we want a digital future that serves humanity, the time to embed our values into code is now.

The transformation didn't happen by accident. It started in 2013 when South African entrepreneur Johann Gevers moved his crypto startup Monetas to Zug after researching locations worldwide. His vision was simple: create a ""Silicon Valley"" for blockchain technology in Switzerland.

In a small Swiss town of just 30,000 people, a financial revolution began that would reshape the global cryptocurrency landscape. Zug, Switzerland, now known as “Crypto Valley,” hosts over 700 blockchain companies worth a combined $382.93 billion – making it the world's largest cryptocurrency hub.

“We want to express our openness to new technologies,” said former Zug Mayor Dolfi Müller at the time. This openness would prove crucial as crypto companies flocked to the region.

The real breakthrough came in February 2014 when 20-year-old Vitalik Buterin chose Zug as the home for the Ethereum Foundation. Working from a modest house nicknamed “Das Raumschiff” (The Spaceship), Buterin and his team built what would become the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.

The Ethereum Foundation became the first blockchain foundation ever created, setting a legal precedent that nearly every major crypto project would follow. Today, nine cryptocurrency “unicorns” (companies worth over $1 billion) call Switzerland home, including Cardano, Polkadot, and Nexo.

Switzerland's tax structure offers something almost unheard of in the crypto world: zero capital gains tax for private investors. This means individuals can buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies without paying taxes on their profits as long as they meet specific criteria.

To qualify for tax-free gains, investors must:

However, there's a catch. Switzerland imposes a wealth tax on crypto holdings, ranging from 0.3% to 1% annually. In Zug, this rate is just 0.125% – among the lowest in the country. Investors must declare their crypto holdings each December 31st at market value.

According to Swiss Federal Tax Administration guidelines, this wealth tax applies to all crypto assets, treating them similar to stocks or real estate.

Unlike many countries that struggle with crypto regulation, Swiss authorities embraced the technology early. In July 2016, Zug became the first government worldwide to accept Bitcoin payments for municipal services up to 200 Swiss francs (about $210).

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) published clear cryptocurrency guidelines in 2018, categorizing digital assets into three types: payment tokens, utility tokens, and asset tokens. This regulatory clarity eliminated the legal uncertainty that plagued crypto companies in other countries.

Corporate taxes in Zug are equally attractive, with rates of just 11.85% – the lowest in Switzerland. This compares favorably to other major financial centers and has drawn companies like Bitcoin Suisse, which was founded in 2013 and now manages over 3 billion Swiss francs in client assets.

One advantage that sets Switzerland apart is its crypto-friendly banking sector. Traditional banks like UBS and Credit Suisse work alongside specialized crypto banks such as SEBA and Sygnum. These partnerships provide crucial services like custody, trading, and regulatory compliance that crypto companies need to operate professionally.

Bitcoin Suisse, Switzerland's oldest crypto company, helped facilitate the world's first cryptocurrency crowd-funding campaign for Ethereum in 2014. The company has since grown to employ over 300 people across offices in Zug, Copenhagen, and Slovakia.

The ecosystem's growth has been remarkable. In 2023 alone, Swiss crypto companies raised $283.5 million across 47 funding deals, showing strong recovery from the 2022 market downturn. The sector now employs over 3,000 people directly, with hundreds more in supporting industries.

The concentration of companies is striking: 512 blockchain companies operate in tiny Zug canton, compared to 289 in much larger Zurich. This density creates network effects where entrepreneurs, investors, and talent naturally connect.

Switzerland's crypto sector has matured significantly since its early days. “The more fringe side of crypto has kind of moved away,” noted Alexander Brunner, author of “Crypto Nation Switzerland.” “Crypto is growing up, in Switzerland.”

 The GENIUS Act marks a turning point for crypto regulation, but experts say true integration with finance and identity systems is only beginning. 

The proclaimed Crypto Week has concluded with significant regulatory progress, including the passage of the much-anticipated GENIUS Act. However, industry experts claim the regulatory clarity is just the foundation for what lies ahead.

“Clarity is just a starting point, not an endpoint,” Leo Fan, co-founder of Cysic, told Cointelegraph. He pointed to the need for scalable blockchains, instant verification systems, and trusted custody for further integration.

Fan acknowledged that Crypto Week delivered “legal clarity,” with the GENIUS Act formally recognizing that not all crypto assets are securities. He called this a “foundational shift” that provides a “green light for developers, investors, and institutions to build and deploy with clearer legal guardrails.”

Fan said crypto is finally being recognized as foundational infrastructure, paving the way for real-world integration in finance, identity and privacy systems. “With the legal groundwork forming, the path is clearer for real-world integration,” he said.

Altan Tutar, co-founder and CEO of MoreMarkets, described the GENIUS Act as “the best sign yet that DeFi is here to stay,” noting the US is closing the gap with Asia in crypto adoption.

Tutar said the legislation would drive stablecoin adoption “in a meaningful way,” enabling traditional assets like gold or oil to be tokenized and bringing DeFi into new territories.

However, he cautioned that regulatory clarity benefits institutions more than everyday investors and stressed the importance of building payment systems, apps, and earning opportunities for retail investors to avoid crypto's own version of a “dot-com bubble.”

Likewise, Ryan Chow, CEO of Solv Protocol, said Crypto Week “laid the legal foundation for digital assets for legal clarity and structural legitimacy,” ending years of regulatory uncertainty that stalled institutional adoption.

He called the GENIUS Act's distinction between decentralized digital assets and traditional securities “monumental,” giving builders and investors confidence to innovate.

Looking ahead, he said, “clarity is necessary, but credibility is what builds markets,” urging the development of “Bitcoin-backed credit, tokenized treasuries, and yield tied to real assets” with transparent risk pricing and compliance built in from the start.

Will K, CEO of VOOI and co-founder of Symbiosis.Finance, also highlighted that regulation alone isn't enough. He pointed out the need for mature infrastructure, simplified user experiences, and AI-driven tools that level the playing field.

Without these, crypto risks remaining a niche ecosystem rather than a global financial standard, Will warned. “The industry needs to stop building for crypto natives and start building for everyone else.”

Passed last week with more than 300 House votes, including support from 102 Democrats, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, establishes the first federal framework for stablecoins.

 Santiment says the “historic social dominance spike” may indicate another buying opportunity for Bitcoin soon. 

Nearly half of all crypto-related mentions on social media this week centered around Bitcoin as it hit new highs, a level of dominance that may signal a local top and a potential short-term pullback, according to sentiment platform Santiment.

“As Bitcoin's market value crept above $123.1K for the first time in its 17+ year history, there was an equally historic social dominance spike,” Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan said in a report on Wednesday.

“43.06% of all crypto discussions were about $BTC just as the coin's market value was peaking,” Quinlivan added. Quinlivan said that “the sudden spike was indicative of many retail traders FOMO'ing in,” challenging the view held by several other industry participants who believe retail investors have yet to enter the market. 

On July 11, Bitwise head of research André Dragosch said, Bitcoin (BTC) is at new all-time highs, but retail is “almost nowhere to be found.”

Just three days after, on Monday, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $123,100 on Binance, before retracing to $117,011 at the time of publication, according to Nansen data.

Quinlivan said that while rising sentiment may seem positive, history shows that spikes in social media mentions about Bitcoin are often followed by price declines.

“Wait for the euphoria to cool down some, and you'll likely find another key entry point coming up,” he said.

It comes after Quinlivan's recent warning that similar spikes in trader optimism were followed by Bitcoin price drops on both June 11 and July 7.

However, some analysts say the uptrend is likely to continue.

On Wednesday, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr pointed to the absence of the Bitcoin peak signal, which is a metric that shows up when the market is overheated, suggesting “we're not at a peak yet.”

However, Galaxy Digital's head of franchise trading, Michael Harvey, said Bitcoin could be in for a brief consolidation phase after its recent surge to new all-time highs, but another leg up before the end of July isn't off the table.

“Consolidation around current prices is my base case given the large rally and new ATH,” Harvey told Cointelegraph.

 Circle's Dante Disparte says the GENIUS Act ensures tech giants and banks can't dominate the stablecoin market without facing strict structural and regulatory hurdles. 

The GENIUS Act contains a little-noticed clause that prevents technology giants and Wall Street behemoths from dominating the stablecoin market, according to Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte.

“The GENIUS Act has what I'd like to call — just for my own legacy sake — a Libra clause,” Disparte told the Unchained podcast on Saturday. Any non-bank that wants to mint a dollar-pegged token must spin up “a standalone entity that looks more like Circle and less like a bank,” clear antitrust hurdles and face a Treasury Department committee with veto power over the launch.

Banks don't get a free pass either. Lenders that issue a stablecoin must house it in a legally separate subsidiary and keep the coins on a balance sheet that carries “no risk-taking, no leverage, no lending,” Disparte noted.

That structure is even “more conservative” than the deposit-token models JPMorgan and others have floated. “It creates clear rules that I think in the end the biggest winners are the US consumers and market participants and frankly the dollar itself,” he added.

Passed last week with more than 300 House votes, including support from 102 Democrats, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act gives the dollar “rules-based” firepower in the global digital-currency race, Disparte argued.

“Crypto is finally getting what it wanted: legitimization, a path for legal and regulatory clarity in the United States and an opportunity to compete,” he said.

The bill preserves the patchwork of state money-transmitter laws for issuers under a $10 billion threshold but demands a national trust-bank charter once assets breach that level.

Notably, the law bans interest-bearing stablecoins, pushes rigorous disclosure standards and introduces criminal penalties for unbacked “stable” tokens. Terra-style experiments are “gone,” Disparte said.

However, critics argue the ban on yield could stunt consumer adoption and hand an advantage to overseas issuers. Disparte claimed that yield “is a secondary-market innovation” better delivered by decentralized finance protocols once the base layer is rock-solid.

The GENIUS Act's ban on yield-bearing stablecoins could redirect investor demand toward Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

With no interest incentives left in stablecoins, DeFi becomes the primary option for generating passive income onchain, according to analysts like Nic Puckrin and CoinFund's Christopher Perkins, who predicted that “stablecoin summer” may now evolve into “DeFi summer.”

The ban is especially significant for institutional investors. Unlike retail users, financial institutions have fiduciary duties to generate returns, making yield opportunities essential. Analysts suggest this could lead to a surge in institutional capital flowing into DeFi, particularly on Ethereum, which dominates total value locked in the sector.

Right down to the Holy Grail ... almost.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The sandstone cliff faces of the ancient city of Petra (one of the New Seven Wonders of the World) have long been in the archaeological limelight. They've even spent time in the Hollywood limelight as the location for several scenes in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But in their most recent on-screen appearance—and no offense to Harrison Ford's iconic professor—they were the site of a very real discovery.

Discovery Channel's popular show “Expedition Unknown” was on site to document the discovery of 12 human skeletons and artifacts dating back at least 2,000 years, which had all been long hidden beneath the famed Khazneh (or “Treasury”) in Petra. The colossal find was accomplished by a team lead by archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman.

It's a find that, were he real, Indiana Jones would certainly be proud of. 

“This is a hugely rare discovery,” said Josh Gates, host of the Discovery Channel's program, according to CNN. “In the two centuries that Petra has been investigated by archaeologists, nothing like this has been found before. Even in front of one of the most famous buildings in the world … there are still huge discoveries to be made.” 

Creasman, executive director of the American Center of Research, employed ground-penetrating radar to first see if it was possibile that additional tombs were located at the site. The gathered data matched up to data collected from areas where tombs had been found in the past, and the Jordan government gave the approval for excavation beneath the world-famous site. 

The team was beyond pleased to see an actual tomb materialize, and truly shocked by the fact that it was full of remains and artifacts—many of the tombs at the ancient city have been found empty, picked clean long ago. 

Along with the 12 sets of skeletal remains—several of the bones from which had mold, thanks to the porous sandstone allowing moisture into the space in the flood-prone area—the team found a mix of bronze, iron, and ceramic artifacts. This included one ceramic chalice tucked in the arms of one of the deceased, ironically reminiscent of the “Holy Grail” depicted in The Last Crusade. “It really was this awesome moment,” Gates said, “of history imitating art.” 

The Treasury, located near the main entrance to the city, is believed to be at least 2,000 years old. It is a striking mausoleum carved into the sandstone cliffs that has long attracted tourists aplenty, but dating this iconic monument has proven difficult because of the lack of finds within the tombs. 

“We were hopeful to find anything that might tell us more about the ancient people and place,” Creasman said. For instance, Gates believes that the individuals buried in the newly discovered tomb show must have been of very high status because of the prime real estate used for the burial place.“Human remains,” Creasman continued, “can be a really valuable tool in that regard. The burials in this tomb are articulated, so the bones haven't been rummaged around and moved, so that's exceedingly rare.” 

Delving deeper into the remains and artifacts found in the tomb could open additional information about the Khazneh, Petra, and the lives of the Nabataeans who once inhabited the area. “I think learning who they are,” Gates said, “is really going to help unlock part of the story of the Treasury.”

Researchers are creating new moiré materials at the nanometer scale using advanced DNA nanotechnology: DNA moiré superlattices form when two periodic DNA lattices are overlaid with a slight rotational twist or positional offset. This creates a new, larger interference pattern with completely different physical properties. A new approach developed by researchers at the University of Stuttgart and the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research not only facilitates the complex construction of these superlattices; it also unlocks entirely new design possibilities at the nanoscale. The study has been published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.

Moiré superlattices have become central to modern condensed matter and photonic research. However, realizing such structures typically involves delicate and laborious fabrication steps, including precise alignment and transfer of pre-fabricated layers under highly controlled conditions. ""Our approach bypasses traditional constraints of creating moiré superlattices,"" says Prof. Laura Na Liu, director of the 2nd Physics Institute at the University of Stuttgart.

New paradigm for the construction of moiré superlattices

""Unlike conventional methods that rely on mechanical stacking and twisting of two-dimensional materials, our platform leverages a bottom-up assembly process,"" explains Laura Na Liu. The assembly process refers to the linking of individual DNA strands to form larger, ordered structures. It is based on self-organization: The DNA strands join together without external intervention, solely through molecular interactions. The Stuttgart research team is taking advantage of this special feature. ""We encode the geometric parameters of the superlattice -- such as rotation angle, sublattice spacing, and lattice symmetry -- directly into the molecular design of the initial structure, known as the nucleation seed. We then allow the entire architecture to self-assemble with nanometer precision."" The seed acts as a structural blueprint, directing the hierarchical growth of 2D DNA lattices into precisely twisted bilayers or trilayers, all achieved within a single solution-phase assembly step.

Exploring Uncharted Territory: Moiré Structures on the Intermediate Nanometer Scale

While moiré superlattices have been widely explored at the atomic (angstrom) and photonic (submicron) scales, the intermediate nanometer regime, where both molecular programmability and material functionality converge, has remained largely inaccessible. The Stuttgart researchers have closed this gap with their current study. The team combines two powerful DNA nanotechniques: DNA origami and single-stranded tile (SST) assembly.

Using this hybrid strategy, the researchers constructed micrometer-scale superlattices with unit cell dimensions as small as 2.2 nanometers, featuring tunable twist angles and various lattice symmetries, including square, kagome, and honeycomb. They also demonstrated gradient moiré superlattices, in which the twist angle and hence moiré periodicity varies continuously across the structure. ""These superlattices reveal well-defined moiré patterns under transmission electron microscopy, with observed twist angles closely matching those encoded in the DNA origami seed,"" notes co-author Prof. Peter A. van Aken from the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research.

The study also introduces a new growth process for moiré superlattices. The process is initiated by spatially defined capture strands on the DNA seed that act as molecular 'hooks' to precisely bind SSTs and direct their interlayer alignment. This enables the controlled formation of twisted bilayers or trilayers with accurately aligned SST sublattices.

Broad implications across molecular engineering, nanophotonics, spintronics, and materials science

Their high spatial resolution, precise addressability, and programmable symmetry endow the new moiré superlattices with significant potential for diverse applications in research and technology. For example, they are ideal scaffolds for nanoscale components -- such as fluorescent molecules, metallic nanoparticles or semiconductors in customized 2D and 3D architectures.

When chemically transformed into rigid frameworks, these lattices could be repurposed as phononic crystals or mechanical metamaterials with tunable vibrational responses. Their spatial gradient design also opens avenues for transformation optics and gradient-index photonic devices, where moiré periodicity could steer light or sound along controlled trajectories.

One particularly promising application lies in spin-selective electron transport. DNA has been shown to act as a spin filter, and these well-ordered superlattices with defined moiré symmetries could serve as a platform to explore topological spin transport phenomena in a highly programmable setting.

""This is not about mimicking quantum materials,"" says Laura Na Liu. ""It's about expanding the design space and making it possible to build new types of structured matter from the bottom up, with geometric control embedded directly into the molecules.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Mysterious object found dancing with Neptune","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250720091630.htm","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 13:57:53 GMT","

A team of astronomers led by the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian has discovered a rare object far beyond Neptune, from a class known as trans-Neptunian objects, that is moving in rhythm with the giant planet. This object, called 2020 VN40, is the first confirmed body that orbits the sun once for every ten orbits Neptune completes.

This discovery helps scientists understand how objects in the outer solar system behave and how they got there. It supports the idea that many distant objects are temporarily ""caught"" in Neptune's gravity as they drift through space.

""This is a big step in understanding the outer solar system,"" said Rosemary Pike, lead researcher from the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. ""It shows that even very distant regions influenced by Neptune can contain objects, and it gives us new clues about how the solar system evolved.""

The finding was published this month in The Planetary Science Journal, a publication of the American Astronomical Society.

The discovery was made by the Large inclination Distant Objects (LiDO) survey, which searched for unusual objects in the outer solar system. This survey used the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope for the main survey operations, and Gemini Observatory and Magellan Baade for additional observations.

The survey was designed to search for bodies with orbits that extend far above and below the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun, part of the outer solar system that hasn't been well-studied.

""It has been fascinating to learn how many small bodies in the solar system exist on these very large, very tilted orbits,"" said Dr. Samantha Lawler (University of Regina), a core member of the LiDO team. The object's average distance is about 140 times farther from the sun than Earth and follows a very tilted path around the solar system.

What makes 2020 VN40 even more interesting is how it moves compared to Neptune. Most objects with a simple ratio of the duration of their orbit compared to the duration of Neptune's orbit always come closest to the sun when Neptune is far away. In contrast, 2020 VN40 comes closest to the sun when Neptune is very close by, if you look at their positions from above the solar system. The tilt of 2020 VN40's orbit means that the objects are not actually close, because 2020 VN40 is actually far below the solar system- they only appear close when flattened onto a map. All other known resonant trans-Neptunian objects orbit such that they avoid this alignment at their closest approach to the sun, even in the flattened view.

""This new motion is like finding a hidden rhythm in a song we thought we knew,"" said Ruth Murray-Clay (University of California Santa Cruz), co-author of the study. ""It could change how we think about the way distant objects move.""

These findings suggest that highly tilted orbits can lead to new and unexpected types of motion. The LiDO survey has already found over 140 distant objects, and more discoveries are expected from future surveys. With telescopes like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, scientists hope to find many more objects like 2020 VN40.

""This is just the beginning,"" said Kathryn Volk of the Planetary Science Institute. ""We're opening a new window into the solar system's past.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A strange fossil at the edge of the solar system just shook up Planet Nine theories","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250720092541.htm","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 15:09:23 GMT","

Subaru Telescope has made an exciting discovery: a small body beyond Pluto, with implications for the formation, evolution, and current structure of the outer Solar System.

The object was found as part of the survey project FOSSIL (Formation of the Outer Solar System: An Icy Legacy), which takes advantage of the Subaru Telescope's wide field of view. The object was discovered through observations taken in March, May, and August 2023 using the Subaru Telescope. The object is currently designated 2023 KQ14; a more classical name will be assigned later by the International Astronomical Union. After that, follow-up observations in July 2024 with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and a search for unrecognized sightings of the object in old data from other observatories allowed astronomers to track the object's orbit over 19 years. Due to its peculiar distant orbit, 2023 KQ14 has been classified as a ""sednoid,"" making it only the fourth known example of this rare type of object.

Numerical simulations conducted by the FOSSIL team, some of which used the PC cluster operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, indicate that 2023 KQ14 has maintained a stable orbit for at least 4.5 billion years. Although its current orbit differs from those of the other sednoids, the simulations suggest that their orbits were remarkably similar around 4.2 billion years ago.

The fact that 2023 KQ14 now follows an orbit different from the other sednoids indicates that the outer Solar System is more diverse and complex than previously thought. This discovery also places new constraints on the hypothetical Planet Nine. If Planet Nine exists, its orbit must lie farther out than typically predicted.

Dr. Yukun Huang of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan who conducted simulations of the orbit comments, ""The fact that 2023 KQ14's current orbit does not align with those of the other three sednoids lowers the likelihood of the Planet Nine hypothesis. It is possible that a planet once existed in the Solar System but was later ejected, causing the unusual orbits we see today.""

Regarding the significance of this discovery, Dr. Fumi Yoshida states, ""2023 KQ14 was found in a region far away where Neptune's gravity has little influence. The presence of objects with elongated orbits and large perihelion distances in this area implies that something extraordinary occurred during the ancient era when 2023 KQ14 formed. Understanding the orbital evolution and physical properties of these unique, distant objects is crucial for comprehending the full history of the Solar System. At present, the Subaru Telescope is among the few telescopes on Earth capable of making such discoveries. I would be happy if the FOSSIL team could make many more discoveries like this one and help draw a complete picture of the history of the Solar System.""

These tools can help you refine text, generate images, and summarize documents, among other tricks, and you don't have to go far through your apps to find an AI feature ready and willing to help you with something.

With Samsung Galaxy AI, you have the option to disable the AI features you don't want to use, or switch off artificial intelligence altogether. If you're on one of the latest Galaxy S25 phones (with the fastest, AI-capable chips), you also get the option to keep most of the AI enabled but process it on your device, without transferring anything to the cloud.

Galaxy AI is spread right through the latest One UI 6 and One UI 7 software updates from Samsung. More recent additions include the Now Brief screen that aims to bring you the information you need the most at the right time, and the Audio Eraser tool for quickly removing background noise from videos.

There are generative AI editing tools for your photos, and generative AI writing options for your emails and messages. If you're not happy with the way a block of text reads or the way a picture is looking, you can deploy some Galaxy AI magic and make changes with a few well-chosen prompts.

Galaxy AI is only ever a few taps away.

This all requires some pretty deep access to your apps and to your data, which is one reason to carefully consider whether or not you want to use these tools. For example, Galaxy AI has to be able to read your email in order to rewrite it, and some of the data you're asking the AI to work with may be traveling to and from Samsung's servers for processing.

Samsung says that all Galaxy AI data is securely encrypted and protected from prying eyes, though of course no security protection can ever be guaranteed to be fully 100 percent effective all of the time. You can find the full Samsung privacy policy online.

Perhaps you're not sure about allowing Galaxy AI access to everything you're writing and editing, or maybe you just find the AI features a little too pushy. On Galaxy smartphones, you've got the option to turn off some or all of these features.

To see the AI features that are currently active, open up Settings, then choose Galaxy AI. You get a full list of what the AI can do on Samsung phones, and it might be more comprehensive than you realized: everything from transcribing voice recordings to giving you personalized insights into your fitness data.

You can access all the Galaxy AI features from the same menu.

Tap on any of these Galaxy AI features to make changes. The exact options you see will depend on the feature, and some of these features come with sub-features, but they all come with toggle switches for turning the tools on or off. You also get descriptions for how your data is managed.

Select Photo assist, for example, and there are three tools listed: Generative edit (using AI to remove and move objects in images), Sketch to image (for turning basic outlines into photos), and Portrait studio (for turning photos of people into cartoons and sketches). Use the toggle switch at the top to turn all these features on or off.

Open Galaxy AI from Settings on a Samsung Galaxy S25 phone, and you'll see a Process data only on device toggle switch at the bottom of the AI feature list. These phones have Snapdragon 8 Elite chipsets inside them, with powerful enough AI processing capabilities to take care of some jobs without transferring data to and from the cloud.

That's some jobs, not all jobs; you'll see that some of the features are no longer available when you flick the toggle switch for on-device processing. Samsung doesn't provide a definitive list of which features can work without the cloud, but automatic summaries and generative AI editing are among those mentioned as needing internet access.

On-device processing is more private, but limits some features.

There are also a few Process data only on device toggle switches available inside the Galaxy AI feature menus—there's one for Writing assist, for example. You can still use the feature without accessing the cloud, but the number of languages available to you for translations is reduced, because you're relying on local files.

Overall, there's a good amount of control here, letting you strike your preferred balance between Galaxy AI features, software bloat, and data privacy. No doubt there are more Galaxy AI features to come further down the line, so be sure to check this list regularly to see what you have access to on your device.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Hunt for a Fundamental Theory of Quantum Gravity","https://www.wired.com/story/the-hunt-for-a-fundamental-theory-of-quantum-gravity/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Two blind spots torture physicists: the birth of the universe and the center of a black hole. The former may feel like a moment in time and the latter a point in space, but in both cases the normally interwoven threads of space and time seem to stop short. These mysterious points are known as singularities.

Singularities are predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. According to this theory, clumps of matter or energy curve the space-time fabric toward themselves, and this curvature induces the force of gravity. Pack enough stuff into a small enough spot, and Einstein's equations seem to predict that space-time will curve infinitely steeply there, such that gravity grows infinitely strong.

Most physicists don't believe, however, that Einstein's theory says much about what really happens at these points. Rather, singularities are widely seen as “mathematical artifacts,” as Hong Liu, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, put it, not objects that “occur in any physical universe.” They are where general relativity malfunctions. The singularities are expected to vanish in a more fundamental theory of gravity that Einstein's space-time picture merely approximates—a theory of quantum gravity.

But as physicists take steps toward that truer and more complete theory by merging general relativity and quantum physics, singularities are proving hard to erase. The British mathematical physicist Roger Penrose won the Nobel Prize in Physics for proving in the 1960s that singularities would inevitably occur in an empty universe made up entirely of space-time. More recent research has extended this insight into more realistic circumstances. One paper established that a universe with quantum particles would also feature singularities, although it only considered the case where the particles don't bend the space-time fabric at all. Then, earlier this year, a physicist proved that these blemishes exist even in theoretical universes where quantum particles do slightly nudge space-time itself—that is, universes quite a bit like our own.

This trilogy of proofs challenges physicists to confront the possibility that singularities may be more than mere mathematical mirages. They hint that our universe may in fact contain points where space-time frays so much that it becomes unrecognizable. No object can pass, and clocks tick to a halt. The singularity theorems invite researchers to grapple with the nature of these points and pursue a more fundamental theory that can clarify what might continue if time truly stops.

Karl Schwarzschild first discovered an arrangement of space-time with a singularity in 1916, just months after Einstein published general relativity. The bizarre features of the “Schwarzschild solution” took years for physicists to understand. Space-time assumes a shape analogous to a whirlpool with walls that swirl more and more steeply as you go farther in; at the bottom, the curvature of space-time is infinite. The vortex is inescapable; it has a spherical boundary that traps anything falling inside, even light rays.

It took decades for physicists to accept that these inconceivable objects, eventually dubbed black holes, might actually exist.

J. Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder calculated in 1939 that if a perfectly spherical star gravitationally collapses to a point, its matter will become so dense that it will stretch space-time into a singularity. But real stars bubble and churn, especially while imploding, so physicists wondered whether their nonspherical shapes would stop them from forming singularities.

Penrose eliminated the need for geometric perfection in 1965. His landmark proof relied on two assumptions. First, you need a “trapped surface” inside of which light can never escape. If you cover this surface in light bulbs and switch them on, their light rays will fall inward faster than they can travel outward. Crucially, this shell of light will shrink regardless of whether it started out as a perfect sphere, a dimpled golf ball, or something more misshapen.

Second, space-time should always curve in such a way that light rays bend toward each other but never diverge. In short, gravity should be attractive, which is the case so long as energy is never negative.

With these two stipulations, Penrose proved the mortality of at least one of the trapped light rays. Its otherwise eternal journey through space and time must terminate in a singularity, a point where the space-time fabric ceases to exist, where there is no future for the light ray to travel into. This was a new definition of a singularity, distinct from the infinite curvature of the Schwarzschild solution. Its generality enabled Penrose to prove in three scant pages of math that, under his two assumptions, singularities will inevitably form.

“Penrose's paper was probably the most important paper in general relativity ever written, other than Einstein's original paper,” said Geoff Penington, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.

Stephen Hawking soon extended Penrose's argument to the early universe, proving that a cosmos described by general relativity must have sprung from a singular point during the Big Bang. This cosmological singularity resembles a black hole in that, if you imagine rewinding the history of the universe, light rays will run into a wall at the beginning of time.

Over the years, physicists have accumulated heaps of evidence that black holes exist, and that the universe began with an event that looks very much like a Big Bang. But do these phenomena truly represent space-time singularities?

Many physicists find the actual existence of such points unthinkable. When you try to calculate the fate of a particle approaching the singularity, general relativity glitches and gives impossible, infinite answers. “The singularity means a lack of predictability,” Liu said. “Your theory just breaks down.”

But the particle in the real world must have a fate of some sort. So a more universal theory that can predict that fate—very likely a quantum theory—must take over.

General relativity is a classical theory, meaning that space-time takes on one, and only one, shape at every moment. In contrast, matter is quantum mechanical, meaning it can have multiple possible states at once—a feature known as superposition. Since space-time reacts to the matter in it, theorists expect that any matter particles in a superposition of occupying two different locations should force space-time into a superposition of two distortions. That is, space-time and gravity should also follow quantum rules. But physicists haven't yet worked out what those rules are.

Theorists approach their quest for a quantum theory of gravity the way they might peel an onion: layer by layer. Each layer represents a theory of a universe that imperfectly approximates the real one. The deeper you go, the more of the interplay between quantum matter and space-time you can capture.

Penrose worked in the outermost layer of the onion. He used the general theory of relativity and ignored quantumness entirely. In effect, he proved that the space-time fabric has singularities when it is completely devoid of any quantum matter.

Physicists aspire to someday reach the onion's core. In it, they'll find a theory describing both space-time and matter in all their quantum glory. This theory would have no blind spots—all calculations should yield meaningful results.

But what about the middle layers? Could physicists resolve Penrose's singularities by moving to something a little more quantum, and therefore a little more realistic?

“It was the obvious speculation, that somehow quantum effects should fix the singularity,” Penington said.

They first tried to do so in the late 2000s. The assumption that had confined Penrose's proof to the outermost layer was that energy is never negative. That's true in everyday, classical situations, but not in quantum mechanics. Energy goes negative, at least momentarily, in quantum phenomena such as the Casimir effect, where (experiments show) two metal plates attract each other in a vacuum. And negative energies play a role in the way black holes are thought to radiate particles, eventually “evaporating” entirely. All the deeper, quantum layers of the onion would feature this exotic energetic behavior.

The physicist who peeled the top layer was Aron Wall, then based at the University of Maryland and now at the University of Cambridge. To cut into the quantum realm and abandon Penrose's energy assumption, Wall latched on to a theoretical discovery made in the 1970s by Jacob Bekenstein.

Bekenstein knew that for any given region of space, the contents of the region grow more mixed up as time goes on. In other words, entropy, a measure of this mixing, tends to increase, a rule known as the second law of thermodynamics. While considering a region that contains a black hole, the physicist realized that the entropy comes from two sources. There's the standard source—the number of ways that quantum particles in the space around the black hole could be arranged. But the black hole has entropy too, and the amount depends on the black hole's surface area. So the total entropy of the region is a sum: the surface area of the black hole plus the entropy of nearby quantum stuff. This observation became known as the “generalized” second law.

Wall “made it his mission to understand the generalized second law,” said Raphael Bousso, a physicist at Berkeley. “He was thinking about it in much clearer and much better ways than everybody else on the planet.”

Reaching the quantum layers of the onion would mean accommodating negative energy and the presence of quantum particles. To do so, Wall reasoned that he could take any surface area in general relativity and add to it the entropy of those particles, as the generalized second law suggested. Penrose's proof of his singularity theorem had involved the trapped surface. So Wall upgraded it to a “quantum trapped surface.” And when he reworked Penrose's singularity theorem in this way, it held. Singularities form even in the presence of quantum particles. Wall published his findings in 2010.

“Aron's paper was a seminal breakthrough in combining quantum mechanics and gravity in a more precise way,” Penington said.

Having peeled back the classical outer layer of the onion, where energy is always positive, Wall reached a lightly quantum layer—a context physicists call semiclassical. In a semiclassical world, space-time guides the journeys of quantum particles, but it cannot react to their presence. A semiclassical black hole will radiate particles, for instance, since that's a consequence of how particles experience a space-time warped into a black hole shape. But the space-time—the black hole itself—will never actually shrink in size even as the radiation leaks energy into the void for all eternity.

That's almost, but not exactly, what happens in the real universe. You could watch a black hole radiate particles for a century without seeing it shrink a single nanometer. But if you could watch for longer—many trillions upon trillions of years—you would see the black hole waste away to nothing.

The next onion layer beckoned.

Bousso recently revisited Wall's proof and found that he could cut a little deeper. What about the world where black holes shrink as they radiate? In this scenario, the space-time fabric can react to quantum particles.

Using more refined mathematical machinery developed by Wall and others since 2010, Bousso found that, despite the intensified quantumness of his scenario, singularities continue to exist. He posted his paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, in January.

The world of Bousso's new theorem still departs from our universe in notable ways. For mathematical convenience, he assumed that there's an unlimited variety of particles—an unrealistic assumption that makes some physicists wonder whether this third layer matches reality (with its 17 or so known particles) any better than the second layer does. “We don't have an infinite number of quantum fields,” said Edgar Shaghoulian, a physicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Still, for some experts, Bousso's work delivers a satisfying denouement to the Penrose and Wall singularity story, despite its unrealistic abundance of particles. It establishes that singularities can't be avoided, even in space-times with mild reactions to quantum matter. “Just by adding small quantum corrections, you can't prevent the singularity,” Penington said. Wall and Bousso's work “answers that pretty definitively.”

But Bousso's theorem still doesn't guarantee that singularities must form in our universe.

Some physicists hold out hope that the dead ends do somehow go away. What seems like a singularity could actually connect to somewhere else. In the case of a black hole, perhaps those light rays end up in another universe.

And a lack of a Big Bang singularity might imply that our universe began with a “Big Bounce.” The idea is that a previous universe, as it collapsed under the pull of gravity, somehow dodged the formation of a singularity and instead bounced into a period of expansion. Physicists who are developing bounce theories often work in the second layer of the onion, using semiclassical physics that exploits negative-energy quantum effects to get around the singularity required by the Penrose and Hawking theorems. In light of the newer theorems, they will now need to swallow the uncomfortable truth that their theories violate the generalized second law as well.

One physicist pursuing bounces, Surjeet Rajendran of Johns Hopkins University, says he is undaunted. He points out that not even the generalized second law is gospel truth. Rejecting it would make singularities avoidable and continuations of space-time possible.

Singularity skeptics can also appeal to the theory at the core of the onion, where space-time behaves in truly quantum ways, such as taking on superpositions. There, nothing can be taken for granted. It becomes hard to define the concept of area, for instance, so it's not clear what form the second law should take, and therefore the new theorems won't hold.

Bousso and like-minded physicists, however, suspect that a highly quantum arena with no notion of area is tantamount to a dead-end for a light ray, and therefore that something Penrose would recognize as a singularity should persist in the core theory and in our universe. The beginning of the cosmos and the hearts of black holes would truly mark edges of the map where clocks can't tick and space stops.

“Inside of black holes, I am positive there is some notion of singularity,” said Netta Engelhardt, a physicist at MIT who has worked with Wall.

In that case, the still-unknown fundamental theory of quantum gravity would not kill singularities but demystify them. This truer theory would allow physicists to ask questions and calculate meaningful answers, but the language of those questions and answers would change dramatically. Space-time quantities like position, curvature and duration might be useless for describing a singularity. There, where time ends, other quantities or concepts might have to take their place. “If you had to make me guess,” Penington said, “whatever quantum state describes the singularity itself does not have a notion of time.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Is the Commodore Comeback Fans Have Waited for—but the Odds Are Still Against It","https://www.wired.com/story/the-risky-business-of-bringing-commodore-back-to-life/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

In 1994, Commodore crashed and burned. Once a home computing giant across the US and Europe, the company was undone by mismanagement and misfires. The carcass was picked clean and the pieces resold so many times that it was hard to keep track, but with each new owner came the inevitable—an attempt to make a fast buck by slapping the famous C= logo on any old junk.

Fans watched in horror as the brand appeared on the mediocre Web.it all-in-one PC, the bizarrely named Gravel in Pocket media player, and the Commodore smartphone. There was even a Commodore-branded shredder. So when retro gaming YouTuber Christian “Perifractic” Simpson announced he wanted to buy what remained of Commodore and give it a new life, questions were asked. Chief among them: does the world still even need Commodore?

Commodore as a brand initially focused on typewriters and calculators, but its glory days arrived with the rise of home micros, causing a swift rebirth as Commodore International Computing.

Its biggest success was the Commodore 64, which hit the sweet spot between affordability and potential. While the CPU was sluggish, powerful graphics and a surprisingly capable sound chip (which remains revered today) spurred creativity on both sides of the Atlantic. Over 5,000 commercial games were released during the machine's heyday, and more than 15 million units were sold, making the C64 still one of the highest-selling single computer models ever.

It's this legacy Simpson aims to revive. Initially, he sought a licensing deal with the Commodore brand owners, imagining “official” boards and replacement components as part of an inclusive, community-friendly conglomerate. These plans snowballed during discussions, and Simpson found himself securing an agreement to buy Commodore outright for a “low seven-figure” sum. He now serves as Commodore CEO and promises to revive the company in a sustainable way—one that won't repeat the failures of the past.

But here's where things get tricky. Simpson doesn't actually own the original company because that company no longer exists. Commodore's 1990s dismemberment means the current iteration owns a number of trademarks, but essential parts of the ecosystem remain scattered. C64 ROMs and Amiga (Commodore's 16-bit micro) rights belong to Cloanto and Amiga Corporation. AmigaOS is controlled by Hyperion Entertainment. And aside from the odd mass-market flirtation from clone machines, like the C64DTV all-in-one joystick and the plug-and-play THEC64 Mini, major developments that mattered for the past 30 years have all come from the community, not the brand.

It's for these reasons Simpson finds himself walking multiple tightropes. He must avoid alienating enthusiasts that kept the Commodore flame alive, and not imply that only his new Commodore confers legitimacy. He must collaborate closely with owners of other key puzzle pieces and license the Commodore brand fairly to interested third parties. And to recoup that seven-figure sum, the new Commodore must sell enough new hardware, which means moving beyond a dwindling core fanbase.

For now, Simpson's initial play banks heavily on nostalgia—not solely for the C64, but for an entire era. The new Commodore website pitches the company as a “digital detox brand [that's] grounded in digital minimalism.” It rails against social media, glorifies the good old days of “techno optimism”—apparently, the 1980s through to the mid-1990s—and hints that Commodore can help users reclaim their childhoods. But the company also wants to be seen as an innovator with an eye on the future, and this results in a kind of branding whiplash. The new Commodore wants to be both reboot and original; past and future.

Fittingly, this iteration's debut product, the Commodore 64 Ultimate, embodies such tensions. The $500 gold-bling Founders Edition and $350 LED-laden disco case Starlight Edition don't exactly scream digital minimalism. But the $300 BASIC Beige is the spitting image of the original hardware. All models bridge authenticity and modernity by supporting original C64 peripherals and current connectivity, including 1080p HDMI output so you needn't hunt down a CRT TV. Inside, it's all FPGAS—field programmable gate arrays—which ultimately mean simulation rather than the less-accurate emulation found in Chinese retro handhelds and cheap plug-and-play TV devices.

Some critics nonetheless grumble that even this “new” machine is past and present in another way, effectively being an amalgamation of existing products, from the keycaps to the having the Ultimate64 board at its core. However, Ultimate64 creator Gideon Zweijtzer has publicly disagreed that Simpson is merely assembling other people's hard work and slapping on a logo. He believes the Commodore 64 Ultimate was a “joint effort between parties to create a cohesive package” and credits Simpson as someone with reach who can “bring people together.”

That reach will be essential because noble efforts, sentiment, and saying the right thing won't bring sustainability. Even pent-up demand for a new Commodore 64—at the time of writing, over 4000 units have been sold, amounting to $1.5 million in revenue—is a one-off trick that can't be repeated. History shows retro appeal can be short-lived. Outside the hardcore enthusiasts, fans tend to rapidly move beyond rose-tinted, wide-eyed nostalgia; the retro devices they've bought then gather dust. Few remain on sale for long because the market is finite and fickle.

And then, there's the question of games. A large slice of the annual retro gaming market—estimated to be around $2.5 billion, though no one has a great handle on the numbers—comes from software rather than hardware. The issue for Commodore here is that it never released any notable games of its own, so it can't mimic Atari's ability to remake the Atari 2600 with modern connectivity while also reimagining 1980s classics like Pong and Missile Command. And even if Commodore were to license games, nothing in the entire C64 catalog has the cultural clout of Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Sonic the Hedgehog, or Super Mario Bros.

The Commodore 64 Ultimate menu.

The alternate mainstream option would be an attempt to reestablish Commodore's reputation as a brand that offers computing for the masses, not the classes, ringing in Simpson's desire for a “simpler, distraction-free computing experience.” But what would that mean in practice? Unplugging? Educational and creative tools? Commodore 64 BASIC is notoriously bad, and it's unclear whether enough newcomers will see value in a relatively expensive beige retro box when a Raspberry Pi costs a fraction of the price and can tap into a massive existing ecosystem. But an entirely new platform would be a colossally risky endeavor.

What is the endgame, then? Without hit games and obvious mainstream appeal, how does Commodore survive, let alone thrive? Is it even possible for this 1980s cultural icon to move beyond people who were there at the time and break out of its bubble? It's hard to say.

Perhaps it doesn't have to. Simpson envisions a “single, joined-up family of Commodore machines,” and that could be enough. Commodore would become a community-focused brand, presiding over a modest ecosystem, acting as a benevolent curator that elevates quality projects, brings just enough polish and legitimacy to help the scene flourish, and simply refuses to let the legacy fade. Although investors who've pumped in cash might see things differently.

A much worse scenario would be a repeat of the past: panic over income, leading to the brand again being stamped on unremarkable products, or the mismanagement and misfires that alienate partners and fans. There's also the very real possibility that Commodore might just discover the harsh reality of being a very niche, small player in an industry of giants. Any one of those could deal a final, fatal blow to the brand from which it would never recover, taking down swathes of the community with it.

Still, this time feels different. This revival doesn't come from cynicism but from genuine passion and love for the brand. Even so, the odds of success feel slim, whether that means sparking a new wave of computing optimism or returning the brand to cultural relevance. But for a while at least, fans can remain optimistic this might finally be the play that truly brings Commodore back to life.

Tesla opened the doors to its first showroom in India this week, and among the first visitors was Vishal Gondal — a longtime Tesla and Elon Musk loyalist who pre-booked a Model 3 in April 2016, just hours after reservations went live. But despite showing up on day one, Gondal says he has no plans to buy a Tesla now.

“I felt a little bit underwhelmed,” said Gondal, founder and CEO of fitness-tech startup GOQii, after visiting the maiden Tesla showroom in Mumbai's Bandra-Kurla Complex.

Over the better part of a decade, Gondal held out hope for Tesla's debut in India. But his excitement soured when he had to chase the company for a refund in 2023 — sending multiple emails just to get his $1,000 reservation fee.

“Trying to get the money back was a problem,” he told TechCrunch. “And the joke was, had we invested that money in Tesla IPO stock, we would have made more money.”

Gondal is among the earliest backers of Tesla in India — someone who pre-booked a vehicle long before there were any guarantees. But nine years on, it seems many of those early believers are not celebrating the launch and have instead made up their mind not to go with Tesla, at least on its debut.

Those backers never got their Model 3s, for which they paid the reservation fee soon after Musk promised to launch the car in the country. And some, like Gondal, even waited and tried hard for years to get the refund, while some got it in May, just a couple of months before Tesla's formal debut.

“It is frustrating to see Tesla take so long. I mean, our government and processes and red carpet are hard, but it's hilarious that even Starlink has gotten approval in a shorter period,” said Varun Krishnan, who runs tech blog FoneArena from Chennai and is also one of Tesla's early backers in India.

Tesla did not invite these loyalists to visit its Mumbai showroom, nor did it give them an update on the launch.

The 6,000-square-foot Tesla showroom is located in Maker Maxity Mall, near Apple's first store in the country. Nonetheless, Gondal said Tesla's store was nowhere near similar to that of the Apple store launch.

“When Apple launched their showroom in the same place, the buzz that Apple was able to create versus the buzz that Tesla was able to create, there is a world of difference,” he said.

Gondal went to the Tesla showroom in his Audi e-Tron, which he had bought the previous year, after waiting a long time for the Model 3.

“This felt like the coldest launch,” said Amit Bhawani, founder of tech blog Phoneradar, who also pre-reserved the Model 3 in 2016.

Bhawani eventually got the $1,000 refund after criticizing Tesla in a video released on YouTube in 2020.

The video received comments from dozens of people who had also reserved the Model 3 in India and were waiting for a refund, he said.

“That's when I felt that the whole love for Tesla became a real hatred for Tesla,” he told TechCrunch.

“The least Tesla could have done was email all the people who reserved the car earlier and said, ‘Guys, we are going to have a special event for you',” Gondal said. “Those people really went out of their way, and even though let's say it's not a big amount, it was saying that we support Tesla.”

Some others, like Kawaljit Singh Bedi, said they have no regrets about supporting Tesla, although they received the refund just before the launch this year. Nevertheless, they are also not looking to buy a Tesla soon.

“After all these years I have waited, I'm in no hurry to buy it now and become the first one to have it, because what's the point? I waited nine years? I can wait nine years and six months more,” said Bedi, co-founder and CTO of Frammer AI.

“Most of them who had put in their early vote of confidence are disappointed, including, I know, Vishal and Vijay [Shekhar Sharma of Paytm],” said Krishnan. “People like Vishal or Vijay, they are taken with a lot of authority. So, if they are buying something, there would be 100 people going by their word.”

Sharma, founder and CEO of Indian fintech giant Paytm, echoed comments from other early backers, telling TechCrunch that he would not go with Tesla and would rather wait for a larger portfolio of cars.

“It may be a bit too late,” he said. “There are so many other options with price-value math more suited for India.”

The years-long delay in Tesla's launch — along with not being invited to the showroom opening — has left some of the brand's earliest Indian loyalists feeling let down, said Arun Bhatt, founder of Tesla Club India, who also pre-booked a Model 3 in 2016

“You paid something and you ardently waited for 10 years, and then out of the blue, they just tell you, we'll cancel it and we'll refund, then what happens — 10 years having waited for something, will we be given preferential treatment?” he questioned. “There's zero communication regarding that. So, eight out of 10 reservation holders are frustrated.”

Bhatt started the club with another Tesla enthusiast and Delhi University student, Nikhil Chaudhary, in 2019 as an informal group for people having an interest in the EV carmaker. However, he told TechCrunch that due to the delay in Tesla's launch in the country, the club has slowly changed from a Tesla awareness club to an EV and clean energy awareness club.

One of the concerns that many Tesla early backers have is the lack of clarity on how Tesla will set up the Supercharger network in the country and handle after-sales care. The company announced that it would establish eight charging stations, equally distributed across Delhi and Mumbai, before starting its deliveries in Q3. However, it is unclear whether these will be sufficient to provide enough backing to Tesla drivers in these two cities. Additionally, there are no announcements regarding how Tesla plans to handle after-sales service of its cars in India.

“Having gotten older in nine years, I've also gotten more prudent in my vehicle purchase process. I'm more worried about practical things than just the Tesla brand tag, which I fell in love with 10 years ago,” said Krishnan of FoneArena.

“There is no real excitement to own the first car, knowing that there is no Supercharger network also,” Bedi of Frammer AI said.

In recent months, Musk's public persona has undergone a shift — from a visionary entrepreneur running multiple companies to a polarizing political figure in the U.S. This transformation has impacted Tesla's stock and business not only in America but also in key international markets. India appears to be no exception.

“After the whole elections and the politics, and whatever is happening, I don't see Elon with the same colors as what I used to,” FoneArena's Krishnan said.

Kunal Khattar, an EV-focused investor in India and founder of VC firm AdvantEdge Founders, echoed Krishnan's sentiment, saying Tesla has lost “a little bit of its shine” due to several factors — including Musk's political involvement, his alignment with Trump, and the public fallout that followed.

“People used to think Tesla is saving the world, it's saving the climate, and this and that, it's no longer there,” he said.

Khattar was invited to the Tesla launch in Mumbai. Just like Gondal of GOQii and others, he also described it as “underwhelming” and “not like a typical vehicle launch.”

Tesla has launched the Model Y in India, starting at ₹59,89,000 (approximately $68,000). Some compare the India pricing with that of the Model Y in the U.S., which begins at $44,990 (₹38,71,000). However, the carmaker is importing the car from China — rather than manufacturing it locally in the country — something that the industry commonly refers to as a Completely Built-Up (CBU). This adds up to tariffs that Tesla is set to pay for some time, until it decides to set up a local factory, and thus, customers will have to pay an exorbitant price.

In India, the premium segment, which starts from ₹35,00,000 (approximately $40,700) and goes up to ₹1,00,00,000 (approximately $116,200), comprises just 1% of the total car sales in India, roughly 50,000 vehicles. However, in that 1%, electric cars have almost a 10% share so far, per Puneet Gupta, director, S&P Global Mobility.

“With Tesla coming in, and if Tesla really starts manufacturing in India, maybe two years down the line, there is no doubt about it that it will make a strong case for all these OEMs [original equipment manufacturers], including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi, to make a vehicle for our Indian customer for the first time,” he said. “The problem is that India has never been able to convince these OEMs that they can really make an India-centric product, and it will have sufficient volumes.”

Overall, electric car sales in India accounted for just 2.5% of the total market in 2024, per Counterpoint. But it was “almost negligible” in 2016, when Tesla initially announced its entry. This was also the reason why people showed a lot of interest in Tesla back then.

“These days, everyone can get a beautiful, amazing, super powerful electric vehicle in India. So, Tesla is not something ‘wow' worthy, except for 5-10 minutes, people should ask to just take a look inside it,” Bhawani of PhoneRadar said.

India's automobile giant Tata Motors has dominated the country's electric car market in recent years, though others — including China's MG Motor, which recently signed a joint venture with Indian conglomerate JSW Group — are starting to gain ground.

The premium segment remains niche in the country, though the increasing number of high-net-worth individuals has led to a 66 percent year-over-year rise in the sales of premium EVs during the first five months of 2025, Abhik Mukherjee, a research analyst for automotive and IoT at Counterpoint, told TechCrunch.

BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover, Volvo, and select models from Hyundai and Kia are sitting in the segment where Tesla has brought the Model Y to the country.

“Tesla's current price point is unlikely to cause any dent to the brands operating within that price range,” Mukherjee said.

Nonetheless, Tesla's debut is likely to draw some customer attention to electric cars in a market where two-wheelers dominate the EV space.

“People will at least put EVs in their consideration set. Will Tesla sell a lot of cars? I don't think so … Will Tesla increase the sales of other EV brands? I think so,” Khattar of AdvantEdge Founders said.

Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

I feel qualified to opine on this as both a former power user of Word and someone building a word processor for lawyers from scratch[1]. I've spent hours pouring over both the .doc and OOXML specs and implementing them.

As for complexity, an illustration-- while using M365 I recently was confounded by a stretch of text that had background highlighting that was neither highlight markup, not paragraph or style formatting. An AI turned me onto an obscure dialog for background shading at a text level which explained the mystery. I've been a sophisticated user of M365 for decades and never encountered such a thing, nor have a clear idea of why anyone would use text-level background formatting in preference of the more obvious choices. Yet, there it is. With that kind of complexity and obscurity in the actual product, it's inevitable the file format would be convoluted and complex.

Since entering Jupiter's orbit in 2016, NASA's Juno spacecraft has been hard at work unveiling the many mysteries of our solar system's largest planet. And its latest discovery may be one of the most intriguing yet: an entirely new type of plasma wave near Jupiter's poles. 

In a paper published Wednesday in Physical Review Letters, astronomers describe an unusual pattern of plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere—a magnetic “bubble” shielding the planet from external radiation. Jupiter's exceptionally powerful magnetic field appears to be forcing two very different types of plasmas to jiggle in tandem, creating a unique flow of charged particles and atoms in its polar regions. 

Plasma is a key force in shaping Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere. As such, the researchers believe the new observations will further advance our understanding of not only Jupiter's weather events but also the magnetic properties of distant exoplanets. 

For the study, the researchers analyzed the behavior of plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere containing highly magnetized, low-density plasma. The team, a collaboration between researchers from the University of Minnesota, the University of Iowa, and the Southwest Research Institute, Texas, found an unexpected oscillation between Alfvén waves and Langmuir waves, which reflect the movement of the plasma's atoms and the movement of the electrons in the plasma, respectively. 

Electrons are much lighter than charged atoms, meaning that, normally, the two wave types ripple at very different frequencies—which was clearly not the case for Jupiter's magnetosphere, prompting the researchers to take a closer look. The ensuing investigation unveiled a never-before-seen type of plasma oscillation near Jupiter's poles. 

“The observed plasma properties are really unusual, not found before and elsewhere in our solar system,” John Leif Jørgensen, a planetary scientist at the Technical University of Denmark who wasn't involved in the new work, told New Scientist. 

Unlike Earth's auroras, which are caused by solar storms, Jupiter's auroras—a barrage of frisky, superfast particles that are hundreds of times more energetic than auroras on Earth—sometimes emerge as a product of its powerful magnetic field. Getting a better grasp on how such phenomena work could be valuable information for future missions in the search for alien life on exoplanets, according to the study authors.

Detailed New Images of Jupiter's Aurora Reveal Strange and Unexplained Brightness

“While such conditions do not occur [on] Earth, it is possible that they apply in polar regions of the other giant planets and potentially in strongly magnetized exoplanets or stars,” the astronomers wrote in the paper.

“Jupiter is the Rosetta Stone of our solar system,” said Scott Bolton, Juno's principal investigator, in NASA's introductory page for the spacecraft. “Juno is going there as our emissary—to interpret what Jupiter has to say.”

Initially, NASA expected Juno's mission to conclude in 2017, when they would intentionally steer the spacecraft into Jupiter's atmosphere, a decision that adheres to NASA's planetary protection requirements. But Juno's flight path evolved over time, and NASA concluded that the spacecraft no longer posed a threat to Jupiter's moons. As a result, the agency authorized extensions to the mission. 

Heck Yes, NASA's Juno and InSight Missions Are Getting Bonus Time

That being said, the scientists do believe that, by September this year, Juno's orbit will degrade naturally, and it will be gobbled up by Jupiter's atmosphere. However, this by no means ends humanity's exploration of Jupiter; Europa Clipper is slated to reach Europa, Jupiter's moon, in 2030 (the last time we checked, it did some sightseeing near Mars). Of course, even after Jupiter consumes Juno, scientists will still have loads of invaluable data from the spacecraft that they'll continue to meticulously analyze for years to come.

There are more than enough smartphone chargers available on the market, yet true portable laptop chargers are few and far between. That's why the popular Anker laptop power bank is so popular among users looking for fast and reliable juice to their bigger gear. Anker is the one everyone's talking about when it comes to charging, and its 25,000mAh 100W power bank is a hot ticket right now – especially since it's currently discounted to an all-time low price on Amazon.

You can pick up this Anker power bank for $109, down from its typical $135 list price with a limited-time promotion that's discounted 19% from the regular price. This all-time low gets you a serious battery boost for a shockingly low price. And obviously, you can also charge your phones and tablets with that gadget.

See at Amazon

Its massive 25,000mAh capacity gives you enough to fully charge most laptops or provide multiple charges on phones and tablets before it needs to be replenished. For extended flights or working sessions away from the office, this high-capacity battery is a real game-changer as it allows you to work or stream for several hours without having to hunt for an outlet. Its power capacity is 90Wh (under the 100Wh regulation limit), so you can store it in your carry-on bag on virtually any airline.

This charger can also charge multiple devices at once: It includes three USB-C charging ports, each giving a maximum of 100W—more than enough to charge up the newest MacBook Pro, a Windows ultrabook, or USB-C charge tablets. If you must split power with colleagues, charge your phone and headphones and charge your laptop, this charger is more than ready to perform the job. Other than the USB-C ports, there is even a USB-A port so you're covered for legacy devices as well.

Two USB-C cables are provided one being retractable to a length of 2.3 feet and being put through more than 20,000 pulls, and the other being used as a stiff carry strap and tested to more than 20,000 bends. You won't need to fossick for other cords in the bottom of your bag and you'll have a cable on hand at all times.

Charging the power bank itself is also quick and easy with 100W ultra-fast input support: Fill the bank up by 30% in only 20 minutes so you can quickly get back to a functional level in a short time-out. Charging four devices at a time is another innovation and the energy management system makes sure every device plugged in is charged safely and efficiently.

If you're looking for a serious charging upgrade, this Anker charger checks all the boxes.

Sometimes you don't have to wait for Prime Day or Black Friday to score the lowest prices on Amazon. And actually, it just dropped a record low price on one of the most popular and easy-to-use outdoor cameras available: the eufy Security SoloCam S220. For a short while, this 2K solar-powered security camera can be yours for $69 which is a whopping 46% discount from its regular list price of $130.

See at Amazon

For outdoor security cameras, the SoloCam S220 is a low-maintenance choice that is easy to install and easier to maintain. With its solar panel built right in, you'll never again waste your time climbing up and down ladders to replace batteries or dealing with heavy power cables. Several hours of direct sun per day are enough to keep the camera running continuously, and it gives you total peace of mind with virtually no upkeep. Its compact and weather-resistant (IP67-rated) housing can tolerate snow, rain and scorching summer sun.

The SoloCam S220 delivers a crisp 2K video resolution and captures every detail with breathtaking clarity. Faces, license plates and even small movements are clearly visible during the day or night, thanks to built-in infrared night vision. The wide field of view covers a lot of area of your property: you can see driveways, entrance points, and backyards with equal ease, all through the eufy Security app on your phone for free.

If you're looking for an easy method for increasing the security of your home, capabilities like human detection make sure you get notified about what matters most and avoid unnecessary alerts due to pets or passing cars. Instant alerts appear on your smartphone and notify you what's happening outside your home the moment something gets detected. Two-way audio lets you hear and talk straight through the camera picture, so you can greet guests or deter unwanted visitors.

Among the most important advantages of the SoloCam S220 is its commitment to value and privacy: you don't need to pay recurring subscription fees. Unlike nearly all competition which has recurring subscription costs for cloud storage, eufy's SoloCam saves recorded events on board, which means you keep full ownership of your clips and can play back important ones at will.

The camera needs just a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connection to operate, quickly installing in seconds and with complete flexibility. The provided mounts provide seamless wall, eave or outdoor fixture installation, while the single-piece design becomes nearly imperceptible in most outdoor environments.

If you're looking to improve your home security, this record-low Amazon deal is a no-brainer.

Amazon has barely had time to catch its breath with Prime Day, and already it is launching Back to School deals with a new wave of discounts. In all these deals, some of the small (but vital) pieces of hardware like Anker's chargers have caught our attention.

Right now, Amazon is featuring the Anker 2-Pack 20W fast USB-C charger at its lowest price ever: Normally $19, with a coupon applied at checkout, this set drops to only $12 which is a savings of over 32%. For less than the cost of a single charger from many brands, you're getting two high-quality blocks plus two 5-foot USB-C cables.

See at Amazon

These wall charger blocks give you a maximum of 20W fast charging power each, and that's precisely what you require for the latest iPhone models (like the iPhone 16, 16 Pro Max, and more) and really any other more recent Apple device. Fast charging allows you to charge your battery from flat to more than 50% in around 25 minutes so you never have to sit around waiting for your phone to come on. The blocks are also universal for a wide selection of other devices including the iPad Pro, AirPods, Android phones, tablets, and even some small laptops.

There's actually a dual-port feature: both adapters feature a USB-C and a USB-A port. You can charge two devices at once without slowing down which is perfect if you're working with a phone and a wireless earbud case for instance. Having both ports available to use simultaneously enables you to have your tech ready for the needs of all day, and it makes life a little bit easier where power outlets are limited.

Safety is of the highest concern with this Anker pack: Each charger has Anker's MultiProtect safe system which safeguards your devices using advanced temperature control, overcurrent protection, and short-circuit prevention. It is nice to have peace of mind and know your phone or tablet is safe to fast charge.

At $12 for a pair of chargers and cables, it's hard to find something better or more useful in your daily tech setup before the new term begins.

FSR 4 the masses.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD has finally caught up to Nvidia's latest DLSS technologies with its recent FSR 4 update. For years, the Green Team have dominated upscaling, delivering near-native quality while boosting frame rates. Nvidia took the AI route from the start, training its neural networks on massive datasets, so each iteration improved automatically, even without manual intervention. FSR, by contrast, relied on traditional techniques — until this year, when FSR 4 finally made the jump to an AI-driven approach as well. Now, FSR 4 sits between the Transformer-based DLSS 4 and the older DLSS 3, which is to say, it's very good. Unfortunately, the strength of any upscaler depends on adoption, and the Red Team still lags behind.

Fortunately, third-party (and often open-source) solutions are abound, if you know your way around a few files and repositories. One such app is OptiScaler — previously known as CyberXeSS — and it works to replace upscalers in a game with a different one that might be better in certain scenarios. For instance, if the game supports FSR 2 and was never updated beyond that, OptiScaler can take that FSR 2 input and convert it to DLSS, XeSS, or upconvert it to a newer version of FSR. And now, it supports FSR 4... as long as the game isn't running on Vulkan API or needs an anti-cheat. Apart from replacing upscalers, OptiScaler can also, by extension, replace frame-gen tech and even handle anti-lag features like Nvidia Reflex.



This means that any game with older FSR or DLSS tech is now technically FSR 4-compatible. We use the word ""compatible"" here on purpose because ""FSR 4-ready"" is a bit of a stretch as there is no guarantee you'll have a stable experience. Firstly, it's not a simple toggle that you can enable in some GUI. You have to manually tweak files for every single game, and then further mess around with some settings in order to get the best experience possible. This is before installing FSR 4 in the game's directory, individually, which will be different for every game. It's certainly not convenient, but for a free solution that modernizes upscalers in a wide variety of games, it can be a worthwhile tradeoff for many.

There are only about 65 games that support FSR 4 natively, and most of them are obscure titles. In contrast, over 125 games have DLSS 4 (with frame gen) as of May 2025, alone. With OptiScaler, you can now take that number way higher on the AMD side. All you need is a game with FSR 2 and above, or DLSS 2 and above, and OptiScaler will do the magic to replace that with FSR 4. Of course, you need an RX 9000-series card in order to even get FSR 4 as only those GPUs have the necessary hardware (AI accelerators) for it. On top of that, the game must not need anti-cheat software to run in the background or use the Vulkan API, as FSR 4 does not support Vulkan yet.

As long as you meet those prerequisites, and you're comfortable configuring a few options yourself — moving around DLLs and such — FSR 4 can be all yours, ever before AMD seems to start caring about it on a serious level. It's funny because all the hard work is already behind them, they've made the upscaler we always wanted but stopped at the final step where you actually make the tech prevalent. If the community with barely any resources can do it, a billion-dollar corporation should certainly be able to as well. For now, though, this is our best bet, without spending money on alternatives like Lossless Scaling.

Filament—the future of forensics?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Tracing the source of 3D printing ghost guns has been a serious topic since the beginning of their existence. Those doing the printing want to keep the manufacturing source a secret, while forensic investigators like Kirk Garrison from the San Bernardino Sheriff's department are looking to find any sort of ""fingerprints"" left behind by nefarious manufacturers. An interview with Garrison shared by 404 Media suggests he may have found a way to link 3D printed objects, like ghost gun components, to specific printers.

In the interview, Garrison explained how he recently began looking for ways that forensics investigators might be able to identify printers by any traces left behind in the objects they print. So far, he's had success in identifying key signatures, also known as toolmarks, found consistently from specific 3D printers.

If you're not familiar with the term toolmark, it refers to a type of mark found on an object that's left by the maker and or one of the tools used in its manufacturing process. In this case, Garrison has discovered consistent toolmarks in the way in which filament is dispersed during the print process on certain lines.

Garisson has studied 3D printed objects, more specifically, 3D printed weapons, using a microscope. It was while studying the 3D printed component up close that he noticed scuff marks in a repeated pattern across the object. Using this, he was able to find matching characteristics in other objects, suggesting they were printed by the same printer and possibly even the same batch.

It's important to note that this information isn't enough to determine exactly what printer created what object. However, it can help narrow down information during investigations. There are also many factors like extruder size, nozzle temperature and bed type that can impact the look of the final object. It's also hard to determine when an object was printed using a different printer or if it was printed from the same one but in a different location on the print bed.

This type of forensic study is brand new and unexplored. Whether or not it turns into a useful foray has to be seen, but Garisson is for sure one of the brilliant minds asking questions and leading the way.

If you're interested in 3D printing but aren't sure where to start, we always suggest newcomers check out our list of the best 3D printers to get an idea of what's out there. Who knows, it could bring you one step closer to a career in forensics.

Thingiverse is cracking down on gun-related models using a new automated system.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


As much as we love 3D printing, there's no denying the dangerous potential that comes with something like a modern 3D printer. Creating a weapon is as easy as loading a print file in your print queue, which is why big companies like Thingiverse have taken action to make the file acquisition process as hard as possible on their part. According to ABC, Thingiverse is now implementing a new strategy to stop users from uploading things like gun-related files before they're openly distributed on the platform.

This effort comes in response to an investigation handled by the New York Police Department (NYPD). The NYPD came across hundreds of weapon-related files on Thingiverse that could be downloaded by users and presumably 3D printed. Thingiverse is one of the largest websites for downloading 3D printable model files. ABC argues its rapid growth and subsequent jump in scale made it harder for the team to regulate these types of files.

The lack of control made it difficult for the team to manage, which led to the results found in the NYPD investigation. Thingiverse is now responding with a new ""automated technology"" designed to block the upload of dangerous files, like guns and gun-related components, before they're published.

The powers behind the movement at the District Attorney's office in New York confirm that they do not expect this effort to eradicate ghost guns. They do, however, want to make the process of finding ghost gun files as hard as possible and have decided to address one of the biggest sources for 3D printable CAD files in their efforts to help make that happen.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg also contacted 3D printer companies like Bambu Lab, requesting they join in efforts to add hurdles to users who want to 3D print guns and gun-related components. Bragg requested Bambu Lab consider implementing an AI-driven system that checks CAD files against a model trained on gun blueprints to automatically detect gun-shaped parts.

Sharing is caring.

Microsoft has reportedly added a new feature to the latest Windows Insider build that lets you play its output across multiple devices or speakers. X (formerly Twitter) user phantomofearth shared screenshots that showed a new ‘Shared audio' button in the Quick Settings panel beside the ‘Project' button (that's already widely available on Windows 11 devices). When clicked, it reveals a selection of audio devices connected to your computer. You can then tick the checkboxes on the devices you want to listen to and click Share to start outputting sound across multiple speakers.

Windows 11 is getting a ""shared audio"" quick setting to let you easily play audio through multiple output devices! (Hidden in the latest Dev/Beta CUs) pic.twitter.com/aalAJ68OSzJuly 19, 2025

At the moment, Windows does not support a native way of outputting audio to multiple different devices. A workaround involving the built-in Stereo Mix feature often does not work and can result in unwanted audio feedback. There are some third-party apps you can download, like OBS, Voicemeeter, or Audio Router, but they can get complicated and a bit too difficult for most people who simply want to share their audio experience.

Unfortunately, this new feature remains undocumented by Microsoft — even in the latest Windows Insider Blog — meaning it's not yet an official or confirmed feature that is on the way to the wider Windows user base. We also don't know if it works with just physically connected speakers, or if it's also compatible with multiple Bluetooth devices. Nevertheless, we hope that this makes it through Beta testing and into mainstream release, as it's a great feature for laptops and gaming handhelds. While not quite useful for 5.1 surround sound effects and the like, the multi-speaker sharing option is great if you want to watch a movie with someone else in a public place, like a plane, without having to share a single pair of earbuds between you.

If you want to get your hands on this feature (and several more that Microsoft experiments with) in advance, you need to sign up for Windows Insider and join the Canary Channel. However, these are often the most unstable builds of Windows that haven't been thoroughly tested yet (remember, you're the one doing the testing), so you might run into unexpected issues if you have these updates turned on. It's also not a guarantee that you'll get the ‘Shared audio' feature or any other features you might find other Insiders people have, especially as Microsoft may push updates to different devices randomly.

INDIANAPOLIS — Some friendly advice for WNBA leaders as they negotiate with the players on a new contract:

Don't make the same mistake U.S. Soccer did in 2019 by underestimating the players' resolve. It will not go well for you, either in the negotiations or the court of public opinion.

The players and the WNBA had their first face-to-face meeting in months Thursday during All-Star weekend. To say it was lacking in substance is an understatement. “Wasted opportunity,” “disrespectful"" and ""frustration"" were words used by players to describe it.

It did serve one purpose, however. With 40 players showing up — veterans and rookies, megastars and role players, the largest gathering outside the Wubble — it sent an unmistakable message to the league about their commitment.

“I hope it expedites the process so we're not going back and forth where they're trying to test us and see who flinches first. Because we're not going to,” Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier, a WNBPA vice president as well as this season's favorite for MVP, said Friday.

“We are always going to stand firm. Hopefully they just realize that earlier, so that we're not wasting time over things that we're not moving on.”

The W, like U.S. Soccer, seems to think players should be grateful just to be playing. That the money the NBA and some of its owners pumped into the league entitles them to gouge the players in perpetuity.

Funny how this is never an issue with men's teams, even the ones that are perennial money losers.

The W didn't respond to the players Friday. But on Thursday night, league commissioner Cathy Engelbert told The Associated Press the talks are “a process.”

“We're both in listening mode,” Engelbert told the AP. “We're going back and forth on issues. We know what's important to players. We know what's important to owners and striking the right balance.”

Does the W really, though? Because it's been nine months since the players opted out of the existing contract and five months since the players sent the league ideas for salary increases and pay structure. To show up Thursday unprepared or unwilling to negotiate is not the move of a league that understands the urgency and gravity of the moment.

“It was pretty shocking to see,” New York Liberty forward Breanna Stewart, also a union vice president, said. “Not many things did we both agree on. I think there were two bullet points where we were like, `OK, we can move forward with this.'”

But this is what happens when women aren't taken seriously.

When the U.S. women's national team sued U.S. Soccer for equal pay in 2019, three months before the World Cup, the federation failed to appreciate how determined the players were. This despite the fact the players had taken the drastic step of suing their employer, and every single member of the team had signed onto the lawsuit.

The federation assumed, wrongly, that the women would eventually give in, preferring to get something rather than holding out for everything they deserved. They didn't realize how knowledgeable the players and their advisers were about the economics.

U.S. Soccer's biggest miscalculation, however, was not recognizing the public support for the players. When fans serenaded the USWNT with chants of “Equal pay! Equal pay!” after they won the World Cup in France, it was a resounding rebuke to U.S. Soccer and everyone else who short-changed women.

Sound familiar?

This is a time of explosive growth for the WNBA. A monster media rights deal that will pay the league $200 million a year, more than triple what it gets now, begins next year. Franchise valuations are soaring, with the expansion Golden State Valkyries recently valued at $500 million and five other teams worth $250 million or more, according to Sportico. Sponsors are clamoring for any piece of the action they can get.

None of this is a secret. Nor is it a secret that W players are woefully undercompensated. Player salaries top out at $250,000 and revenue “sharing” is around 10%, compared to the 50% that is typical of almost every professional men's league.

The players, rightfully, want more. They know they deserve more. And, like the USWNT in 2019, they're no longer willing to accept less.

“We're not just players that run up and down the court and do amazing things. Some of us are business owners, some of us are foundation owners. So we know what it takes,” said Las Vegas Aces center A'ja Wilson, who, coincidentally, was wearing the latest version of her signature shoe released for the All-Star Game.

“When we see the revenue, when we see things flowing into our league, we want that. We are going to demand that because we see it and we see the growth,” Wilson said. “And when you see a business growing, obviously the people that are working for the business should have some say in that as well. So I think we know what we are talking about for sure.”

The public knows, too. Aside from the Neanderthals who parrot that misleading narrative of the W being propped up by the NBA, fans are going to be on the side of Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers, Wilson and Collier rather than rich owners and league officials.

So, too, will the sponsors. And when that happens, the league might regret its choices.

“We as players know what we're worth. The fans know what we're worth,” said Nneka Ogwumike, the longtime union president. “Now we need the league to know what we're worth.""

The WNBA and its players will eventually come to an agreement. The league has a choice: Be seen as an equal partner that wanted to do right by the players or as an overlord that had to be dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing.

It might want to ask U.S. Soccer which one is better.

Chelsea were given a little something extra to fight for ahead of their Club World Cup final triumph over Paris Saint-Germain, a new report has revealed.

The Blues outclassed the European champions last week to win 3-0 and become the first side to lift the Club World Cup in its revamped 32-team format.

Enzo Maresca's side were relentless from the first whistle in New Jersey, scoring all three before half-time and putting the game well out of reach; PSG looked a far cry from their usual selves which saw them win the treble last season.

And now, it can be revealed what triggered that added motivation in the Chelsea camp.

On the eve of the final, at a FIFA-organised dinner involving both clubs, Chelsea's delegation noticed how occupied PSG's representatives were with discussing the logistics of their trophy celebration.

The Parisians were preoccupied with how and where they would collect the trophy, according to The Times. 

Maresca was informed of this over-confidence and passed the information onto the players, who seemingly took it to heart. 

But tensions between the clubs did not stop at full-time, with a heated post-match clash between following the result.

PSG boss Luis Enrique appeared to strike Chelsea striker Joao Pedro in the face during a confrontation.

Pedro was initially embroiled in a conflict with Gianluigi Donnarumma and Achraf Hakimi - with Andrey Santos also on the scene - before Enrique marched over towards the situation.

But rather than defusing the situation, the Spanish manager made it physical, laying his hands on Pedro before being held back by his own player Presnel Kimpembe.

Pedro fell to the floor in dramatic fashion, clutching at his face. 

Christopher Nkunku and Romeo Lavia stepped in to defend their team-mate, holding back a visibly frustrated Gianluigi Donnarumma, who appeared to berate Pedro for his animated reaction.

What followed was pandemonium, with around five Chelsea players swarming Donnarumma in the aftermath.

The PSG goalkeeper was shoved by Tosin Adarabioyo, as Kimpembe continued his attempts to defuse tensions alongside Chelsea's Filip Jorgensen.

Pedro eventually got back to his feet, only to find himself at the centre of a chaotic melee involving too many bodies to count.

On the touchline, a furious Enzo Maresca stormed in to drag his players away, shouting at those involved as he tried to restore order.

The Chelsea boss was also seen pulling Donnarumma aside, attempting to calm his fellow Italian in a bid to defuse the flare-up.

The chaotic scenes followed a match that saw six yellow cards shared between the two sides, and a red card for PSG midfielder Joao Neves, who was sent off in the 85th minute for violent conduct. 

Speaking on the incident, Enrique said: 'This was completely avoidable at the end, my goal was always to separate footballers, there was a lot of tension and pressure, there was a whole bunch of pushing that we should all try to avoid. My intention is to avoid it getting worse.' ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Prior to Chelsea's 3–0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final, a harmless FIFA dinner can be said to have primed the pump, according to emerging reports from The Times. On the eve of the game, Chelsea's delegation noticed that PSG officials were preoccupied with how and where they'd receive the trophy. That information was quickly passed on to head coach Enzo Maresca, who shared it with his team.

The message was loud and clear: PSG already believed they had won. Maresca converted their overconfidence into fuel for his players, and they came back with a scorching first half that left the French giants stunned.

Maresca explained afterward:

“I think we won the game in the first 10 minutes and the message before the game was to make them understand that we are here to win the game. I think the first 10 minutes the team was there. It probably set a little bit the tone of the game.”

Chelsea's press suffocated PSG's midfield, and the psychological boost gained overnight was reflected in the increased energy levels.

Cole Palmer hit twice, and a third by João Pedro before the break put the game to bed in quick time. PSG, with players who had just achieved the treble, couldn't recover from the early assault. Although they had technical excellence on paper, they were tactically and mentally outplayed.

After the game, Pedro said:

“PSG have won the Champions League, they have a great team, but we know our power as well. We have a great team as well, and we just needed to play the game, and in the end, we're happy to win.”

The win was Chelsea's second Club World Cup win and their second trophy win under Maresca. What reportedly began as an overheard chat at a dinner gala concluded as victory for the Blues, who are preparing for next season's Premier League campaign.

Chelsea's dominant Club World Cup victory this summer has led to an unexpected snowball effect, with several Premier League clubs, including Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United, having their previous titles effectively downgraded.

Enzo Maresca's side cruised to a convincing 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the final at the MetLife Stadium, with Cole Palmer scoring twice and Joao Pedro adding a chipped finish to cap off a historic performance.

The win makes Chelsea the first English club to have won every major domestic and international title available. This landmark includes the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Super Cup, Europa League, and now, the new-format FIFA Club World Cup.

But it's not just a milestone moment for Chelsea, it's also one that has triggered a significant reclassification of footballing honours.

Following the final, FIFA shared an image of Chelsea lifting the trophy with the caption: ""The first ever FIFA CWC Champions."" That phrasing sparked confusion, particularly among fans of clubs that had previously won the tournament.

According to The Mail, FIFA will now recognise Chelsea as the first official winners of the new-format Club World Cup. 

In turn, all previous winners, including Real Madrid, Barcelona, and English clubs like Liverpool, Man City and Man United, will have their victories rebranded as ""Intercontinental Champions"" rather than Club World Cup winners.

Real Madrid have won the tournament a record five times. Chelsea, meanwhile, now officially hold one Club World Cup 'title' despite having previously lifted the trophy in 2021. That earlier win, like the others, has now been reclassified.

The change stems from the restructuring of the competition. Traditionally held every year since 2005, the Club World Cup has now become a quadrennial event, modelled more closely on the FIFA World Cup.

The 2025 edition, held in the United States, was the first under this new format. It featured an expanded roster of top teams from every continent and offering a larger global platform.

And while Chelsea celebrate becoming inaugural champions in FIFA's eyes, their triumph has also rewritten the modern honours list.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","“Very brave person”","https://chelsea.news/2025/07/alan-shearer-chelsea-next-season/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

Alan Shearer has backed Chelsea to be in the mix for the Premier League title because of their achievements last season.

Chelsea had a successful first season under Enzo Maresca which saw them qualify for the Champions League and win the Conference League.

The Blues then jetted off to America for the Club World Cup and won the tournament with a fantastic performance against Paris Saint Germain in the final.

Chelsea's performance has rightly been praised, and people are starting to take notice of Enzo Maresca's men as a serious threat next season.

The Blues have already strengthened their squad with the signings of Joao Pedro, Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens, with more new faces expected to follow.

It's been reported the only expectation for Chelsea next season is to qualify for the Champions League through the league, and go as far as possible in every cup competition.

Maresca will be under pressure to improve on last season, but Shearer has been impressed by what he's seen, and believes the Blues will be in the mix for the title.

“I think it would take a very, very brave person to say that Chelsea would not be involved in the title hunt next year because of what they've achieved this season, what they've just achieved, who they've signed, who they will sign,” he told The Rest Is Football.

“It was a masterclass from Maresca because PSG went in, their football has worked all season… Why should they change anything?

“But [Chelsea were] pressing high and all those things and I just think it worked perfectly for them and he deserves huge credit, not only for the job he's done in this competition, but for the whole season.

“He's done a magnificent job.”

Whilst Chelsea will be aiming to close the gap on the teams above, it's thought Maresca isn't under immediate pressure to win the league title.

John Terry doesn't think Chelsea are ready to win the league yet, and the Blues haven't challenged since they last won it in 2017 under Antonio Conte.

The Blues still have a gap to close on the Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, but it'll be interesting to see how close they get next season.

Chelsea were given a little something extra to fight for ahead of their Club World Cup final triumph over Paris Saint-Germain, a new report has revealed.

The Blues outclassed the European champions last week to win 3-0 and become the first side to lift the Club World Cup in its revamped 32-team format.

Enzo Maresca's side were relentless from the first whistle in New Jersey, scoring all three before half-time and putting the game well out of reach; PSG looked a far cry from their usual selves which saw them win the treble last season.

And now, it can be revealed what triggered that added motivation in the Chelsea camp.

On the eve of the final, at a FIFA-organised dinner involving both clubs, Chelsea's delegation noticed how occupied PSG's representatives were with discussing the logistics of their trophy celebration.

The Parisians were preoccupied with how and where they would collect the trophy, according to The Times. 

Chelsea were seemingly given extra motivation ahead of their Club World Cup final last week 

The Blues beat PSG 3-0 to become the first team to win the competition in its revamped format

PSG's people were reportedly preoccupied with how and where they would collect the trophy

Maresca was informed of this over-confidence and passed the information onto the players, who seemingly took it to heart. 

But tensions between the clubs did not stop at full-time, with a heated post-match clash between following the result.

PSG boss Luis Enrique appeared to strike Chelsea striker Joao Pedro in the face during a confrontation.

Pedro was initially embroiled in a conflict with Gianluigi Donnarumma and Achraf Hakimi - with Andrey Santos also on the scene - before Enrique marched over towards the situation.

But rather than defusing the situation, the Spanish manager made it physical, laying his hands on Pedro before being held back by his own player Presnel Kimpembe.

Pedro fell to the floor in dramatic fashion, clutching at his face. 

Christopher Nkunku and Romeo Lavia stepped in to defend their team-mate, holding back a visibly frustrated Gianluigi Donnarumma, who appeared to berate Pedro for his animated reaction.

What followed was pandemonium, with around five Chelsea players swarming Donnarumma in the aftermath.

Enzo Maresca informed his Chelsea players of this and it appeared to light a flame in them

The affair was heated throughout and ended in a huge brawl between both sides, with PSG boss Luis Enrique appearing to slap Chelsea's Joao Pedro

The chaotic scenes followed a match that saw six yellow cards shared between the two sides and a red card for PSG midfielder Joao Neves

The PSG goalkeeper was shoved by Tosin Adarabioyo, as Kimpembe continued his attempts to defuse tensions alongside Chelsea's Filip Jorgensen.

Pedro eventually got back to his feet, only to find himself at the centre of a chaotic melee involving too many bodies to count.

On the touchline, a furious Enzo Maresca stormed in to drag his players away, shouting at those involved as he tried to restore order.

The Chelsea boss was also seen pulling Donnarumma aside, attempting to calm his fellow Italian in a bid to defuse the flare-up.

The chaotic scenes followed a match that saw six yellow cards shared between the two sides, and a red card for PSG midfielder Joao Neves, who was sent off in the 85th minute for violent conduct. 

Speaking on the incident, Enrique said: 'This was completely avoidable at the end, my goal was always to separate footballers, there was a lot of tension and pressure, there was a whole bunch of pushing that we should all try to avoid. My intention is to avoid it getting worse.'

The recently concluded FIFA Club World Cup in the United States offered a troubling preview of what players and fans may face during the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host with Mexico and Canada. With global temperatures on the rise, scientists are warning that summer tournaments in the Northern Hemisphere are becoming increasingly dangerous for everyone involved.

Some experts now suggest that FIFA should consider shifting the football calendar to mitigate the risks of heat-related illnesses. “As we move further into the decade, the risks will continue to grow unless we take drastic measures, such as moving competitions to winter months or cooler regions,” said Professor Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures in Leeds. “We're potentially one heatwave away from a major sports tragedy.”

From the inaugural 1930 World Cup onward, June and July have traditionally been reserved for international tournaments. But summers have warmed dramatically—up by 1.89°F globally and 3.26°F in Europe since the 1990s—raising red flags for outdoor, high-intensity sports like soccer.

During the expanded Club World Cup, held in 11 U.S. cities from June 14 to July 13, extreme heat and thunderstorms disrupted matches. FIFA responded with updated extreme heat protocols, including extra water breaks, sideline fans, and shaded benches. Still, Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernández said he felt dizzy from the heat and urged FIFA to avoid afternoon kickoffs during the World Cup.

National Team could miss out on 2026 World Cup over several doping cases

FIFPRO, the global players' union, has flagged six of the 16 World Cup host cities as “extremely high risk” for heat stress. FIFA President Gianni Infantino recently assured that covered stadiums would host daytime matches in 2026.

Looking ahead, the 2030 World Cup—co-hosted by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco—may face even greater heat challenges, with temperatures already surpassing 104°F this summer. FIFA's internal reports have downplayed the threat, but climate experts disagree.

Playing 90 minutes under direct sunlight can trigger hyperthermia, cardiovascular strain, heat exhaustion, or even life-threatening heatstroke. “Athletes are now 28% more exposed to moderate or higher heat risks than in the 1990s,” said Professor Ollie Jay from the University of Sydney.

While adjusting match times to cooler hours is common in marathons or tennis, morning games are rare in soccer due to broadcasting demands. But with 48 teams in 2026, avoiding midday matches may be impossible.

FIFA's decision to shift the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to November was a rare exception. A similar move is expected for Saudi Arabia in 2034. Still, rescheduling tournaments disrupts European club seasons, making such changes logistically complex.

“The danger goes beyond discomfort,” said climate scientist Michael Mann. “It reflects how climate change is fundamentally reshaping our way of life—even the world's most popular sport.”

Canadians will have serious bragging rights next summer when we co-host the FIFA World Cup with Mexico and the U.S. Sixteen North American cities, including Vancouver and Toronto, will host the world's biggest sporting event, though the most hotly contested matches, from the quarter-finals on, will be played on U.S. turf.

This makes some people distinctly nervous. The America of our united bid in 2018 – presented as “a unique opportunity to promote human rights and social development” – is barely recognizable today.

In truth, scandal-plagued FIFA may not be troubled much by America's rising jackboot spirit. Numerous executives have been jailed for corruption. U.S. prosecutors accused officials of bribery in awarding the last two World Cups to Russia (2018) and Qatar (2022).

The beautiful game was badly tarnished in Qatar. The tiny petrostate was an incomprehensibly bad choice, too hot and too small. A staggering 6,500 migrant labourers died expanding infrastructure at breakneck speed.

With upcoming matches in 11 U.S. cities, FIFA 2026 continues what seems to be its authoritarian tour. Next stops include Morocco in 2030 (jointly hosted with parliamentary democracies Portugal and Spain) and Saudi Arabia four years later.

Fans of the game (and of human rights) worry U.S. matches could become targets for immigration enforcement. The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup recently concluded in New Jersey with a win for Chelsea FC. Before the tournament opened in June, Customs and Border Protection posted on X they were “suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games.” The overeager post was subsequently deleted.

It was not the cup's only embarrassment. At the final match, President Trump refused to leave the stage after he and FIFA president Gianni Infantino presented the trophy to Chelsea. The sycophantic Infantino tried to guide the president off camera, extending an arm, then beckoning repeatedly, before finally pushing his way into the throng, effectively steering the president toward the back. The cringeworthy scene brought to mind last November's town hall where Trump inexplicably stood swaying on stage for over half an hour, saying: “Let's make it into a music.”

Infantino has reportedly spent more time with Trump in his second term than any sitting president or prime minister. This month, the FIFA president opened an office in Manhattan's Trump Tower. He visits Mar-a-Lago. They've travelled together to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Despite this apparent influence, and the world's largest sporting event as leverage – not to mention FIFA's own human rights policy – the federation has been silent on America's unconstitutional immigration policies and brutal enforcement.

The result may be a distinctly different experience for millions of ardent soccer fans. A recent executive order bars people from 12 countries from entering the U.S., including Iran, a World Cup qualifier. Moreover, South Americans may think twice about entering cities where Hispanic migrants are energetically being rounded for detention and deportation.

It's hard to imagine chants of “vamos, vamos, Argentina” filling Los Angeles, where Trump mobilized the national guard, or rival Brazil's “ole ole ole” ringing through the streets of Miami where, last month, migrant detainees in an overcrowded ICE facility spelled “SOS” with their bodies to protest lack of food and medical attention.

Human Rights Watch has warned travelling fans may be “interrogated, detained, or even denied visas for their social media posts.”

More importantly, FIFA's silence is a tragic missed opportunity to use its economic leverage to protect the rights and dignity of immigrants who live and work in the host cities. Instead, it gives its silent blessing.

Alexander Bublik has secured his sixth ATP title after defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo in the Swiss Open final. 

Bublik beat Cerundolo in three sets, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 to hoist the trophy in Gstaad, claiming his second tour-level crown of the season. 

The Kazakh has been on a roll recently, winning 19 of his last 22 matches, and will now return to the world's top 30. 

With his triumph, Bublik has achieved something in tennis that only Roger Federer has managed before. 

Bublik has clinched two titles in less than a month, following his victory over Daniil Medvedev in the Halle Open final.

He is now the second player in the Open Era to win the Halle Open and the Swiss Open in the same season, following Federer in 2004. 

Federer's summer of 2004:

The feat comes during a hot run of form for the 28-year-old, who has come on leaps and bounds in recent months. 

After the Halle Open final, he spoke candidly about his struggles on and off the court and revealed he was close to quitting the sport after last year's Wimbledon championships.

Now, however, Bublik is producing some of the best tennis of his career and will look to carry forward his momentum into the hard-court swing. 

Bublik has now won an ATP title on hard-court, grass, and clay, becoming the 14th active player to do so.

Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and Jannik Sinner are among the names he joins, as well as veterans such as Grigor Dimitrov and Marin Cilic.

Alexander Bublik's stellar 2025 campaign has continued after defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo to win the Gstaad Open.

The Kazakh star has stunned many with his form in 2025, reaching the quarter-finals of the French Open before beating Jannik Sinner and Daniil Medvedev on his way to a second Halle Open title.

Bublik's progress was halted briefly at Wimbledon. The Kazakh player came into the tournament as a potential dark horse for the title. However, he lost in the first round to Jaume Munar.

Despite this setback, Bublik has endeavoured to bounce back at the Gstaad Open in Switzerland. On Sunday, he defeated Juan Manuel Cerundolo to win his sixth ATP Tour title.

During the acceptance speech, Bublik was complimentary of his opponent, claiming the final was one of the toughest he had played.

Bublik said: “First of all, Juan, I told you at the net this was not tennis, it was complete ‘torturing.'

“This is my sixth title and I have played the greats of the game but this final I will remember as one of the toughest I ever played so good job to you, congrats to your team, that's really, really good.”

Bublik was made to fight for his victory in Gstaad. Cerundolo, ranked 109 in the world, performed admirably across the week, beating both David Goffin and Casper Ruud on his way to the final.

The Argentinian player made 73 per cent of his first serves, while also limiting Bublik to winning only 39 per cent of his second serve points.

However, Bublik's 13 aces helped carry him to victory against Cerundolo, winning 6-4 4-6 6-3.

The 28-year-old has returned to the top 30 on the ATP Tour with victory in Gstaad.

The Kazakh had dropped outside the top 30 following his shock loss to Jaume Munar in the Wimbledon first round.

However, his triumph in Switzerland has seen him move above Alex Michelsen, Sebastian Korda, Brandon Nakashima and Tallon Griekspoor. The achievement marked his first ever tour-level title on clay.

Now ranked 30 in the world, Bublik will be aiming to capture a seeded position at August's US Open.

The tropical area at the tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula is best known for its beaches, resorts and sport fishing.

Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., reeled in a big catch of his own Saturday with a victory in the men's singles final of the Mifel Tennis Open in one hour 11 minutes.

Shapovalov defeated seventh-seeded American Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-4, 6-2 to win the ATP 250 event at the Cabo Sports Complex. The first set took only 35 minutes to complete.

Shapovalov led most categories in the final. He had six aces, won 20 points while receiving, won three games in a row, and won nine service games. He had one less unforced error (23-22) than his opponent.

“We have been working for quite a few years now and it hasn't been easy coming back from injury,"" Shapovalov said in a Tennis Canada release. ""But all the work we've done, it is really paying off.""



Kovacevic had two aces, two double faults, and won six service games.

The 26-year-old Shapovalov won the Dallas Open in February, and now has four career ATP titles. He advanced to Saturday's championship match with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Australian Adam Walton in the semifinals.

All three of Shapovalov's previous career ATP Tour titles have came on indoor hard-courts. This was his first event of the summer hard-court season after capping a rough grass-court campaign with a first-round loss at Wimbledon.

Kovacevic upset the top-seeded Andrey Rublev of Russia 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 in the other semifinal.

Shapovalov will be one of the featured Canadians at the 2025 National Bank Open in Toronto, which gets underway on Saturday, July 26.

Jack Draper has suffered an arm injury which will put him out of action for at least a month ahead of the US Open at the end of August.

Draper will miss the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Open, both live on Sky Sports Tennis, over the next three weeks, two events he planned to enter.

The British No 1 has not played since losing in the second round of Wimbledon earlier this month to Marin Cilic.

""After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season,"" he said.

""Unfortunately, I won't be able to compete in Toronto and Cincinnati.

""See you in NYC!""

Lois Boisson's breakthrough season keeps getting better.

Riding her heavy topspin forehand, Boisson Anna Bondar of Hungary 7-5, 6-3 to collect her maiden WTA title at the Hamburg Ladies Open today.



Facing a 4-0 deficit, Boisson began to find her range and rhythm. Boisson burst through seven of the next eight games to snatch a one-set lead

The fifth-seeded Frenchwoman was down 3-1 in the second set but responded with another rousing rally. Boisson won six games in a row to capture the clay-court championship and her first Tour-level title.

It comes six weeks after the then world No. 361 made history at her home slam at Roland Garros.

French wild card Boisson scored the biggest upset of the 2025 Roland Garros draw shocking third-seeded Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, to reach her maiden Roland Garros quarterfinal and send French fans into frenzy last month.

Playing her maiden Grand Slam, Boisson was the lowest-ranked woman to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal since the 2017 US Open when No. 418 Kaia Kanepi did it. Boisson became the first Frenchwoman to reach the French Open quarterfinals since doubles partners Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic each did it back in 2017.



All this from a woman who was rehabbing an ACL injury last season, did not launch her comeback until February and arrived in Paris as a 500 to 1 longshot to win Roland Garros before the tournament began.

Now, Boisson continues her summer thrill ride as a WTA tournament champion. ","{'href': 'https://www.tennisnow.com', 'title': 'Tennis Now'}","tennis"

Loïs Boisson, recent Roland-Garros semi-finalist, defeated Anna Bondar in the final, (7-5, 6-3).

If you thought Loïs Boisson's early exit in the first round of Wimbledon qualifying was a harsh return to reality – think again. The Frenchwoman bounced back in style by winning the WTA 250 Hamburg tournament on Sunday. It was only her second appearance in a main draw at Tour level, the first being her stunning semi-final run at Roland-Garros just six weeks ago.

Boisson's meteoric rise in women's tennis is showing no signs of slowing down. To date, Coco Gauff remains the only player who has managed to neutralise her explosive forehand and fierce competitiveness. Aged 22, she will be in the Top 50 at the WTA rankings on Monday. She was No. 361 two months ago.

Seeded No. 5 in Hamburg, Boisson overcame No. 7 seed Anna Bondar of Hungary in a tense clay-court battle. After trailing 0-4 in the opening set, she found a way to shift the match's momentum in her favor, ultimately securing a 7-5, 6-3 victory in 111 minutes.

Down 5-2, the Frenchwoman raised her level, clawing back to 5-all with the help of some beautifully executed drop shots. She kept the momentum going and snatched the first set 7-5, though she appeared to be struggling physically. She has been playing in recent days with an apparent injury to her left thigh.

At the start of the second set, Loïs Boisson fell back into the same difficulties that had troubled her early in the match. Quickly trailing 3-1, she once again leveled the score before overtaking Anna Bondar on the scoreboard at 5-3. All that remained was to close out the match, which the Frenchwoman did calmly, converting her first match point.

The difference came down to break point conversion. Anna Bondar finished the match having converted just 4 of 13 break points (31%), while Loïs Boisson was far more efficient, converting 6 of 9 opportunities (67%).

After a hard-fought win (6-4, 6-7 [3], 6-4) in nearly three hours of play against Germany's Tamara Korpatsch (ranked 163rd) on Thursday, Loïs Boisson followed up with convincing victories over Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova (No. 105, 6-3, 6-3) and Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska (No. 39, 6-1, 7-6 [5]).

She's the first French player to win a WTA trophy on the main stage since Caroline Garcia in 2022. “Reaching this level so quickly is very impressive”, Bondar said on court, before breaking into tears. “It was not the trophy I was dreaming of.” Bondar had defeated the Top seed Ekatarina Alexandrova in the quarterfinals (6-7 [1], 6-3, 7-6 [4]).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Former top 20 player calls out Wimbledon for their treatment of players in qualifying, 'the worst out of all Slams'","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/former-top-20-player-calls-out-wimbledon-for-their-treatment-of-players-in-qualifying-the-worst-out-of-all-slams/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Wimbledon continues to be a big topic of conversation even a week after the event has concluded for another year.

Jannik Sinner won the men's singles title at Wimbledon for the first time this year, after beating his rival Carlos Alcaraz in a four set final.

The women's singles final was certainly less competitive, with Iga Swiatek brushing Amanda Anisimova aside to win her sixth Grand Slam title.

Like any tennis tournament, Wimbledon is not averse to criticism and they have now been called out by two players who were in qualifying this year.

All four of the Grand Slam tournaments have a qualifying draw, consisting of 128 players in both men's and women's singles.

These 128 players compete over three rounds, before being whittled down to 16 players from each draw who will all be granted a spot in the main draw.

The Australian Open, Roland Garros and the US Open all host their qualifying on the same site, but Wimbledon does not and instead holds it 3.7 miles away in Roehampton.

One of the players competing in Wimbledon qualifying this year was former world number 20 Daria Saville, who actually lost in the first round.

Her namesake and new Australian compatriot Daria Kasatkina spoke to Saville about what she thought of playing at Wimbledon qualifying this year for her YouTube channel.

Discussing a number of different topics, Saville called out the food, quality of the grass courts and the reason Wimbledon changed the prize money.

Saville: “I haven't eaten because it sucks here.”

Kasatkina: “Like sucks? We are comparing the main site to the qualies, what you can tell us about this?”

Saville: “…It's fine…To be fair I don't have appetite so…Main draw food, I mean it's still good food, but the worst out of all Slams.”

Kasatkina: “Worse than Paris?”

Saville: “Actually I think so. In Paris, well there's no sushi. The sushi in Paris is better.”

Kasatkina followed up with a question about the grass, “How are the courts here?”

Saville responded, “Hmm, I mean it's…the grass was high. I mean it's windy, it's slow, high.”

Wimbledon increased the combined singles prize pot for the main draw and qualifying this year by over 9%, but the most significant increase from this went to champions Sinner and Swiatek, who took home £3million each.

This is something that Saville appeared particularly passionate about, claiming that all players would want more of the increase in prize money to go to players in the first round.

“Did you know the prize money they increased by 7% or whatever, but it really is only five because they increase the winners prize money,” said Saville. “So only winner gets 7% increase. Because it's more about headlines, ‘Oh now our champion makes more prize money than every other Grand Slam winner'.

“Every tennis player would agree that you get more prize money in the lower rounds, every tennis player would sign up for it. I mean no-one is guaranteed to win it.”

Saville is not the only player who was frustrated by the way that players were treated in Wimbledon qualifying, with another Australian Arina Rodionova also criticising the event.

Rodionova, who was knocked out in the second round of qualifying, was also critical of the courts, and she also called out the general facilities and lack of equipment.

Rodionova said, “The grass is so slow here, everyone is like breaking each other oh my god.”

Kasatkina added: “It doesn't look bad, I mean the whole facilities looks pretty good actually.”

Rodionova: “The problem is that if you want to go to the WTA office it's about 10 minutes that way. Physio is like 500 metres, so you go that way there to the right and to the right (pointing). Gym, I don't know, I haven't seen but from what I heard it's there…Yeah, but it's so far like if you want to go grab ice also like that way. It's just like…”

Kasatkina: “Not convenient.”

Rodionova: “No, locker rooms also like that way kind of like the gym area…Food is the same. So there's been no changes for the past 15 years. So they like the traditions and consistency at Wimbledon, so they still use the same chickens I think from the same family for the past 15 years (laughs).”

Rodionova continued, “Also there's no f—— air conditioning anywhere. It's so, like on Saturday it was like 30 degrees (Celsius). I thought we're all going to die here, because you don't have a place where you can actually sit. Like locker rooms, oh my god. 

“But actually this place is pretty bad. And they run out of everything. They're like, ‘Oh we're like out of balls'. I'm like, ‘I'm sorry. Well you do know there's a Grand Slam going on right? I need to practice'. They're like water bottles, they're like, ‘Oh come back, we're waiting for a shipment it's not there yet'. I'm like, ‘Did you not know that you have a tournament going on?'.”

Kasatkina: “Are you allowed on the main site?”

Rodionova: “I feel like I'm not even allowed in half of the places here.”

The one thing that Rodionova did feel was an improvement was the electronic line calling, which was a big issue at Wimbledon this year.

Wimbledon still remains as the only major tournament not to have qualifying on site, with that begging the question as to why that is the case.

Grass being a live surface means that the courts need to be protected, and an extra week of tennis would be too damaging to the current courts at SW19.

However, Wimbledon are currently in the process of trying to expand and have revealed their hopes to have qualifying on the main site in the early 2030s.

Wimbledon's plans have been strongly contested, and it appears to be a long way off for players like Saville and Rodionova to get the changes they want.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic have been forced to withdraw from the upcoming National Bank Open in Canada. Both players were due to feature at the event, which was scheduled to have been their first tournament after Wimbledon. However, neither man will be involved when the competition gets underway next week.

The news was confirmed by National Bank Open organisers, who issued a brief statement on Sunday afternoon. They said: ""Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic have been forced to withdraw from the 2025 National Bank Open in Toronto as they recover following Wimbledon. Jack Draper has also withdrawn due to injury.""

Sinner recently secured his maiden Wimbledon triumph, beating Carlos Alcaraz in the final. Djokovic, meanwhile, made it to the semi-finals where he was comfortably dispatched by the young Italian.

In a release shortly after the official announcement, Sinner opened up on his decision to skip the National Bank Open. He won the tournament in 2023, beating Alex de Minaur in straight sets to claim the honours for the first time.

""I'm really disappointed to be missing the National Bank Open in Toronto, especially as I have such fond memories of playing in Canada,"" he said.



""Winning that title in Toronto two years ago was the start of a really special moment for me, but after speaking with my team, I have to recover.""

Draper's withdrawal from the National Bank Open came as a surprise, with the 23-year-old explaining that he is nursing a minor injury. He is expected to return to action at the US Open, which will begin in the second half of August.

On X (formerly Twitter), Draper wrote: ""After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, I won't be able to compete in Toronto and Cincinnati…. See you in NYC.""

Alcaraz will be the favourite to claim the spoils in Toronto with former champion Alexander Zverev also topping the bill. They will be joined by the likes of Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti, Holger Rune, Denis Shapovalov and Felix Auger-Aliassime.

This year's edition of the National Bank Open features an expanded 12-day format with 96 players competing in the main draw. There is also a women's event, which runs concurrently with the men's tournament.

Several big-name players will not be involved, though, with Ons Jabeur, Paula Badosa and Aryna Sabalenkahaving already withdrawn from the competition.

At Wimbledon's post-tournament party, ‘The Champions' Dinner', Iga Swiatek, the winner of women's title, bedazzled in a lilac Stella McCartney gown that was reportedly worth over $2000. Who dresses the Wimbledon champions? 

Town And Country magazine reports that the styling is done by Elisabeth Piner, the stylist and owner of ‘Having a ball dress hire', a company that rents out dresses for formal affairs. She sets up a full-service salon inside centre court in an empty space across the hall from the ladies' locker room. 

“We've got everything, we kit them out from top to toe,” Piner told Town And Country. She and her team reached the club at 8 am on the morning of the ball, “with a car full of hundreds of dresses in multiple sizes; 50 to 60 pairs of shoes; jewellery including diamonds and colored stones; and an assortment of handbags”, the magazine reported. The Champions' Dinner is held at the lavish Raffles London. 

“Because we don't know who will win the tournament we choose styles that perhaps can be flexible, perhaps they have a lace up back or are more or less an average size,” she says. “The jewellery is easier because it's one size. We try to choose items that are just glamorous and ready to compliment the dresses … Most of the footwear and accessories are carefully selected for comfort, elegance, and reliability under pressure,” she said. “The jewellery ranges from contemporary pieces to vintage-inspired.” The magazine noted that she ‘ also tries to guess which players are most likely to make it to the finals and gather looks that might suit their individual styles'.
 
“The room is totally transformed into a glamorous, lovely boutique with all these wonderful dresses,” Piner said. “It's a tennis locker room with rails of silk and sparkle.”

Wimbledon doesn't offer this kind of service to the men's winners, letting their individual sponsor attire them. Sinner had worn a custom dark Gucci suit, with signature loafers. 

Sinner and Iga would dance, though it wasn't initially part of the plan. “Yes I mean we were there and, in the beginning, they told us that because it was quite late that we don't have to do it and then Iga told me, no, no, let's do it and I was like OK,” said Sinner. “Its a tradition. So it's good to make that happen. And yea it was nice to share that moment with Iga. And it's yeah, a beautiful moment,” Sinner shared later with BBC Sport. 

On the ‘Nothing Major' podcast, the American tennis player Sam Querrey shared more details from the night. 

“It's in the city. At that hour, there is no traffic, so it's like 25 minutes. They have a cocktail party, and then you go down to the dinner, where it's set up beautifully. Laura Robson hosted, and she went up and gave a speech. You have some appetisers, and then Iga showed up at 10:30 pm.

“She came in, and you stand up. They made this cool video up on the Jumbotron. She holds up her trophy, and then you sit down.“Sinner came at 00:05. I did not care, but he was just in the back hammering drinks with his team, having a good time. He came out with the trophy, and at some point, Laura Robson brought them both on stage. She does a Q&A with Iga and Jannik pretty quickly. And there was a rumour they were not going to have to dance, and the crowd peer pressured them into dancing.“It was good, though. Jannik did a good job; he was feeling good and made it really fun. He started twirling Iga, and then 45 seconds in, they were done dancing and went back to the table … You had unbelievable food, wine,” Querrey shared.

About this rating 



As the annual Wimbledon tennis championships played out from June to July in 2025, social media users claimed that the thousands of tennis balls used at the tournament get second lives as homes for tiny mice facing habitat loss.

For example, one Instagram user shared an image (archived) with text that read: ""55,000 tennis balls are turned into homes for harvest mice after Wimbledon.""

The caption of the post, which had amassed nearly 20,000 likes as of this writing, claimed that the balls ""are donated to conservation groups"" that cut out small entrances for the mice to enter in ""grassy meadows and hedgerows.""

Similar iterations of the rumor appeared on Facebook (archived) and Reddit (archived).

 

 

A post shared by Vacations (@vacations)



In short, while Wimbledon has previously donated some of its tennis balls for conservation groups to use as homes for harvest mice, these donations appear to have been one-offs. For this reason, we have rated this claim as outdated.

The oldest source for the alleged donation appeared to come from a 2001 BBC article, which at the time stated that some of the tournament's 36,000 tennis balls were donated to The Wildlife Trusts — a British federation of wildlife conservation charities — to be recycled as homes for harvest mice. A 2003 BBC article featured a small follow-up note to that story, stating that Wimbledon had donated 350 tennis balls to The Wildlife Trusts two years earlier.

Snopes contacted The Wildlife Trusts and Wimbledon to confirm if the tournament has continued to make such donations and, if so, for details about what is included in them. A spokesperson for The Wildlife Trusts said: ""Unfortunately, the tennis ball story is very out of date as we haven't worked with Wimbledon in this way for some time."" Similarly, a Wimbledon spokesperson confirmed that the story about harvest mice was an old one.

In 2011, The Guardian newspaper reported that Wimbledon again donated tennis balls to house mice, this time at the request of an aquarium in northern England. The Guardian did not say how many tennis balls were donated at the time.

It was not possible to find more recent articles about the tournament making such donations, although other tennis clubs in the U.K. have reportedly gifted tennis balls for the same purpose.

While not endangered globally, harvest mice are considered ""Near Threatened"" in the U.K., according to the Mammal Society, a British charity. Harvest mice are Britain's smallest rodent, which means a tennis ball with a hole cut into it can be a place for the mice to rest safe from their predators.

During the tournament, Wimbledon sells its used tennis balls on-site, and the proceeds go to the Wimbledon Foundation, its charity organization. Wimbledon has been selling its used tennis balls for the last several years, according to the tournament's spokesperson.

Wimbledon's website did not include any information on the fate of unused and unsold tennis balls, but Keith Prowse, a sports hospitality company that partners with Wimbledon, said they are donated or recycled in the weeks and months after the tournament finishes. Keith Prowse's website added: ""Previously, some of the balls have been donated to the UK Wildlife Trust who cut them up and used them to make homes for harvest mice!""

Venus Williams is set to make a jaw-dropping comeback on the WTA Tour, after accepting a wild card to play in the Washington Open.

Venus, a seven-time Grand Slam champion, is now aged 45 years old and is set to face compatriot Peyton Stearns in the first round.

The American, alongside her sister Serena, has lived a storied career, emerging from Compton, California to become one of the biggest names in tennis history.

In the summer of 2000, Venus claimed her first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, a place she would go on to win a further four times in the Ladies Singles competition.

After defeating her 18-year-old sister in the semi-final, Venus beat Lindsay Davenport 6-3 7-6 to claim her first Wimbledon crown. By doing so, Venus and Serena became the first sisters in the Open era to win Grand Slam titles, after Serena's US Open triumph in 1999.

Following her maiden victory at SW19, Venus spoke of ending a ‘nightmare.'

Venus Williams became an instant legend after winning Wimbledon in 2000. Her victory paved the way for future successes

Venus' path to the final was not easy. Seeded fifth at the tournament, the American battled past top seed Martina Hingis in a three-set phenomenon during the quarter-finals, before defeating her sister in the semi-finals.

Venus also dethroned the reigning Wimbledon champion. Number two seed Lindsay Davenport won the Wimbledon Ladies Singles title in 1999.

Speaking on-court after the final, Venus said: “Yes it's really great because I've been working so hard all my life to be here.

“And you know it's strange because like I'll go to bed at night and I'll dream and I'll dream that I've won a Grand Slam.

“When I wake up, it's a nightmare! So now that I've done it I don't have to wake up like that anymore.”

Then 20 years old, the American captured two Grand Slams at the same tournament, winning a title with her sister, Serena Williams.

Serena and Venus defeated Julie Halard-Decugis and Ai Sugiyama in the final 6-3 6-2 to win the Ladies' Doubles tennis title at the 2000 Wimbledon Championships.

Venus Williams' last WTA Tour match was around 16 months ago.

Venus last played a WTA Tour match at the 2024 Miami Open, where she lost to Diana Shnaider 3-6 3-6 in the first round.

Wimbledon 2025 was, of course, a showcase of some tennis greats, but when folks weren't watching the ball, all eyes were on the royal family. 

Princess Catherine, Prince William, and the two eldest members of their royal brood made a few surprise appearances in the stands last week. And while the adorable Princess Charlotte no doubt stole the show, I couldn't help but notice Prince George's striking body language as he took in the tournament.

The direct heir to the throne, who is turning 12 years old on July 22, seemed to truly step into the role while attending the tennis championship with his fam on July 13. In contrast to his younger siblings, Charlotte, 10, and Louis, 7, who are always quite expressive, George appeared stoic and serious throughout his appearance, taking on the posture of a future king. 

Confident and considerate, George stood tall, applauded at the right times and was even seen shaking hands with the players, including Gentleman's Singles champ Jannik Sinner (who gifted George and his sister signed tennis balls).

At one point during the matches, the camera captured him looking rather regal, almost as if he were surveying his kingdom (in this case, a tennis court).

His grown-up manner was underscored by the fact that he stayed close by his father, Prince William, during the majority of the tournament. Not only did the younger match the older in appearance—donning a similar blue suit and tie—he also mimicked dad's body language at a number of points, even borrowing Will's signature move of crossing his hands in front of his body while chatting.

Though the young royal is still a ways away from taking the throne (and, of course, still just a kiddo), his air at Wimbledon certainly indicates a new level of maturity, suggesting that he's preparing to take on new responsibilities in his next phase as a public-facing member of the monarchy—and the future King of England. 

Now the question on everyone's mind: Will he attend Eton like his father, or Marlborough like mom?

Jack Draper has never won a Grand Slam

British number one Jack Draper has withdrawn from forthcoming tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati because of an arm injury.

But the 23-year-old is targeting a return at the US Open, which begins on 24 August.

Draper, who reached the US Open semi-finals in 2024, said on social media: ""After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious.

""I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season.""

The Canadian Open gets under way on 26 July, while the Cincinnati Open starts on 4 August.

Draper was knocked out of Wimbledon in the second round as he lost in four sets to Croatia's Marin Cilic.

He is not the only big name to withdraw from the Canadian Open, with Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner and 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic also confirming they will not play.

Jack Draper will be looking to go one step further at the US Open this year, after enjoying his best Grand Slam campaign at Flushing Meadows in 2024. 

Draper advanced to the semi-finals last year without dropping a set throughout the tournament, before ultimately bowing out to eventual champion Jannik Sinner. 

The Briton will be even more determined to bounce back in New York following his disappointing Wimbledon run, which ended abruptly in the second round.

However, he'll now have to enter the US Open without featuring at a hard-court tune-up event, after he revealed an injury update on social media. 

Draper took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to say: “After Wimbledon, I picked up an injury in my left arm.

“Nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, I won't be able to compete in Toronto and Cincinnati. See you in NYC!”

After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, I won't be able to compete in Toronto and Cincinnati…. See you in NYC !

His run at the All England Club was short-lived, when after beating Sebastian Baez in the first round, he was knocked out by former finalist Marin Cilic in five sets.

It was yet another shocking result at the championships, which saw several seeded players bow out in the early rounds. 

Draper entered the US Open as the 25th seed last season and got off to the perfect start with comfortable wins over Zhang Zhizhen and Facundo Diaz Acosta. 

After beating Botic van de Zandschulp and Tomas Machac in rounds three and four, he came up against his first seeded opponent at the event. 

He played 10th seed Alex de Minaur in the quarter-final, whom Draper defeated 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 to advance to a maiden Grand Slam semi-final. 

In the final four, a red-hot sinner proved too much for the then-22-year-old, who lost in straight sets to the Italian. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Draper has dropped from fourth to fifth in the ATP rankings and could drop further before the final Grand Slam of the year in New York, live on Sky Sports, if players behind him perform well during the North American swing.

Jack Draper's announced partnership in the U.S. Open's new-look mixed doubles event with Qinwen Zheng was one of the most unusual but now it appears it won't happen.

Zheng, the 2024 Olympic gold medalist at the Paris Games, said on social media on Saturday, July 19 that she had undergone successful surgery on her right elbow.

“During recent training sessions and competitions, I have been consistently bothered by pain in my right elbow,” Zheng wrote in a post on her Chinese social media account, according to Xinhua news service. “Although I persisted through interventions, the impact of the pain persisted. After diagnosis by elbow specialists, they recommended that complete minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery on the right elbow be performed as soon as possible to thoroughly resolve the issue.”

Recovery time for arthroscopic surgery is likely several months, but with the U.S. Open six weeks away – and the U.S. Open mixed doubles competition just five weeks away – it appears unlikely that Zheng will be able to compete.

Zheng also stated: “In the coming period, I will focus my efforts on rehabilitation training, striving to return to the court at 100 percent as soon as possible. This brief adjustment is for a stronger comeback in the future. Thanks, everyone, for your support and patience. Please wait for me to return to full strength, we will meet on the court.”

The U.S. Tennis Association announced in February that it will be re-imagining its mixed doubles competition, giving singles players priority in entry and hosting the event in the week before the main draw of singles and doubles starts – it's branded “Fan Week” as you can read about here: US Open To Host Mixed Doubles Championship During Its Lead-Up “Fan Week” Starting In 2025 – Tennis Grandstand

Zheng and Draper, the 2025 Indian Wells singles champion and a semifinalist at the 2024 U.S. Open, were among the interesting U.S. Open pairings announced by the USTA and can be read about here: https://worldtennismagazine.com/carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-novak-djokovic-aryna-sabalenka-iga-swiatek-madison-keys-among-early-u-s-open-mixed-doubles-entries/25150

Earlier this year, Zheng reached a career-high No. 4 in the WTA singles rankings. She was the runner-up at the Australian Open in 2024 and was also the runner-up at the season-ending WTA Tour Finals. Earlier this year, Zheng failed to replicate her success in the Australian Open and lost in the second round. She reached the semifinals of the Italian Open.

I really hope the US Open will ask Hsieh Su-Wei to take her place to play w/Draper as opposed to some popular non-doubles player. Hsieh consistently goes deep in mixed and ladies pro tournaments and has 35 doubles titles. Won the Australian mixed in 2024. The fact that Osaka even got in is a crime.

38-year-old Novak Djokovic's career appears to be winding down after yet another semifinal exit at Wimbledon, marking a seventh consecutive Grand Slam where the Serbian great has failed to capture the title. 

After his three-set loss to Jannik Sinner, he emphatically explained that he's ""not planning to finish my Wimbledon career today,"" hinting that he has at least four more Grand Slams in him. 

Legendary Australian player Rennae Stubbs doesn't think that's the case. Stubbs, a four-time Grand Slam doubles champion and former coach of Serena Williams, thinks Djokovic will retire sooner.

Speaking on the ‘Rennae Stubbs Tennis Podcast,' Stubbs — who is very tapped in with the Australian tennis circuit — thinks the 2026 Australian Open will be his final tournament.

“I think he has sort of hinted that the last Grand Slam will be the Australian Open,” she said. ""....And I think the reason for that is because it has been his most successful, winning it [10] times.""



""I thought his best chance was at Wimbledon, that has slipped away, but I think he probably almost feels that the Australian has been so mercurial in his life, he has had so many dramatic moments in his life, where he was treated very poorly by the Australian government,"" Stubbs continued, referencing when Djokovic was kicked out of the country during the 2022 tournament

“So it's an interesting dichotomy, but I think that is where he wants to finish his career, and that is where I think probably will be his last Grand Slam.”

Djokovic boasts the most career Australian Open wins with 10. It's the site where he won his first major title in 2008, when a then-gangly 20-year-old looked more like an outsider than a future member of tennis's coveted ""big three.""

Murray shares part of Djokovic coaching gig that left him 'uncomfortable'

He's fallen in the semifinals in each of the last two Australian Opens. In 2025, he was forced to retire against Alexander Zvarev in the second set. 

""I did everything I possibly could to basically manage the muscle tear that I had,"" Djokovic said post-match. ""Medications and, I guess, the strap, and the physio work helped to some extent today. But towards the end of that first set I just started feeling more and more pain. It was too much, I guess, to handle for me at the moment.""

Denis Shapovalov captured his fourth ATP Tour title and second of the season on Saturday night at the Mifel Tennis Open by Telcel Oppo in Los Cabos, where he defeated American Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-4, 6-2.

Shapovalov had not dropped more than three games in a set en route to his ninth tour-level final and the Canadian was once again dominant in the title match. In his first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Kovacevic, Shapovalov won 81 per cent of his first-serve points, saved the one break point he faced and struck 15 winners, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to triumph after 75 minutes.

“We have been working for quite a few years now and it hasn't been easy coming back from injury. But all the work we've done, it is really paying off,"" Shapovalov said.

🏆 sealed with an ace!@Denis_Shapo | @MifelTennisOpen | #LosCabosTennisOpen pic.twitter.com/XCf6porG8I

The 26-year-old is up five spots to No. 28 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. Shapovalov was forced to shut down his 2023 season after Wimbledon, where he suffered a knee injury. Last year, he fell to as low as No. 140 in the PIF ATP Rankings but has worked his way back up in the past 10 months.

In February, Shapovalov clinched the title in Dallas. It was his third tour-level trophy on indoor hard courts, having won in Stockholm in 2019 and Belgrade at the end of 2024. On the outdoor hard courts at the ATP 250 in Los Cabos, Shapovalov brushed aside Govind Nanda, Tristan Schoolkate, Adam Walton and Kovacevic.

The third seed is the sixth player to win multiple tour-level titles in 2025, while he is just the fourth player – alongside Ugo Humbert, Taylor Fritz and Tallon Griekspoor – to capture a trophy this season without dropping a set.

Kovacevic upset World No. 10 Andrey Rublev to reach his second ATP Tour final. The 26-year-old American was aiming to lift his maiden trophy and become the eighth first-time champion this season. The seventh seed is up 10 places to No. 66 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will climb to a career high on Monday.

“I want to congratulate Aleksandar on an amazing week,"" Shapovalov added. ""He beat some great players. Honestly, I didn't watch the match [vs. Rublev] yesterday, but my coach told me you played insane, so, congrats on an amazing week. I think you are an amazing player. I love your game. Obviously, us one-handed backhand [players], we gotta stick together. Definitely love watching you play.""

Did You Know?
Shapovalov's meeting with Kovacevic was the first tour-level final featuring two players with a one-handed backhand since the 2019 Nitto ATP Finals title match between Dominic Thiem and Stefanos Tsitsipas.

 Alexander Bublik added a clay-court milestone to his 2025 European summer surge on Sunday at the EFG Swiss Open Gstaad. 

 The second-seeded Kazakhstani held off Juan Manuel Cerundolo 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to clinch the trophy at the ATP 250 in the Swiss Alps. Competing in his first clay final, Bublik regained his composure after a difficult second set to earn his sixth ATP Tour singles title. 

 “First of all, Juan, as I told you at the net, this was not tennis. It was complete torture,” joked Bublik at the trophy ceremony. “This is my sixth title and I have played the greats of the game, but this final I will remember as one of the toughest I ever played. So good job to you and congrats to your team, it was really good.” 

 Bublik is now 17-5 in tour-level matches since the beginning of the Mutua Madrid Open in mid-April, a tally that also includes an ATP 500 title run in Halle. Although he was upset in the first round at Wimbledon earlier this month by Jaume Munar, the 28-year-old bounced back in style this week by defeating Alexander Shevchenko, Francisco Comesana, Arthur Cazaux and Cerundolo to claim the Gstaad crown. 

 “It was real pleasure to come here,” said Gstaad debutant Bublik, “I can't wait to come back next year. The beautiful Alps. It's an amazing spot. I'm really happy that I'm standing here as a winner, but even if I'd lost in the first round, the view is amazing anyway.”

 Having reached the championship match without dropping a set, Bublik carried his momentum into his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Cerundolo. Although the 28-year-old dropped serve in the opening game of the match, he immediately reclaimed the break and soon wrapped up the first set with a rock-solid display. 

 Bublik fended off four break points to hold in the opening game of the second set, but he soon cut a frustrated figure as Cerundolo began to wear him down in extended rallies. Although the Kazakhstani rallied from a break down to level at 4-4, he immediately dropped serve again and his opponent made no mistake in serving out to force a deciding set. 

 Those mid-match struggles did not stop Bublik from turning on his best level again for the decider, however. The second seed's greater power from the baseline came to the fore once again and he won all 16 points behind his first serve in the third set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to completing a two-hour, eight-minute victory. 

 Bublik will on Monday reenter the Top 30 of the PIF ATP Rankings as a result of his Gstaad title run. The Kazakhstani's red-hot form contrasts starkly with the way he began 2025 — Bublik was 3-10 for the year prior to Madrid in April, and he was as low as World No. 82 as recently as mid-March.

Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic have withdrawn from the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, the tournament announced on Sunday.

The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner lifted the trophy the last time the Canadian ATP Masters 1000 was held in Toronto in 2023, while the 38-year-old Djokovic is a four-time National Bank Open Presented by Rogers champion. British No. 1 Jack Draper has also withdrawn from the Toronto draw due to an arm injury.



After finishing his standout 2024 with his maiden triumph at the Nitto ATP Finals, Sinner lifted his second major title of 2025 a week ago at Wimbledon, where he defeated Djokovic in the semi-finals for his fifth consecutive victory in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. In the absence of Sinner and Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and former champion Alexander Zverev will headline the field in Toronto.

 Alcaraz and Zverev are joined by other Top 10 stars including Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti and Holger Rune, as well as Canadian hopes Denis Shapovalov and Felix Auger-Aliassime. The 2025 edition National Bank Open Presented by Rogers runs from July 27 to August 7 at Sobeys Stadium in Toronto.

She spent nearly 50 years on the CBS soap opera, and her conniving character went through eight husbands.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Eileen Fulton, the minister's daughter who spent the better part of 50 years portraying Lisa Miller, one of the first “bad girls” of daytime television, on the CBS soap opera As the World Turns, has died. She was 91. 


	Fulton died Monday in Asheville, North Carolina, after “a period of declining health,” her family announced.




	Four years into the run of As the World Turns, Fulton joined the No. 1 daytime drama in 1960 for what was originally supposed to be a three-month summer storyline. She exited the soap three times — once to headline her own primetime spinoff, 1965's Our Private World — but continued on through the final episode broadcast Sept. 17, 2010.

	Her Lisa had eight husbands, with Nicolas Coster portraying two of them. Three of her marriages ended in divorce, four ended in death and one was annulled. When As the World Turns was done, her character's full name was Lisa Miller Hughes Eldridge Shea Colman McColl Mitchell Grimaldi Chedwyn. She also had lots and lots of lovers.


	“She's a romantic, that's why she falls in love so much,” Fulton said in a 2005 conversation for the Television Academy Foundation website The Interviews.


	Inducted into the Soap Opera Hall of Fame in 1998 and given a lifetime achievement award from the Daytime Emmys in 2004, Fulton was one of the first soap actors to have her own publicist.

	











	She also employed a bodyguard to protect her from angry viewers who disapproved of what Lisa was up to. “They had a great love/hate thing [with me], it was amazing,” she said.


	And in the '70s, Fulton famously had a clause inserted into her contract that guaranteed she would never have to play a grandmother. “At that time, grandmothers had no romance at all — and I wasn't about to let that happen to me,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. She eventually became OK with that.


	The oldest of three kids, Margaret Elizabeth McLarty was born in Asheville on Sept. 13, 1933. Her mother, Peggy, was a schoolteacher and her father, James, a Methodist preacher. She said she knew by the third grade that she was going to be an actress.


	After graduating from Lee Edwards High School in her hometown and, in 1956, as a music and drama major from Greensboro College, she moved to New York and studied acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her classmates was Keir Dullea.


	Fulton had played a hooker in Girl of the Night (1960), starring Anne Francis, when someone from As the World Turns called her manager looking to see if one of his clients, East of Eden actress Lois Smith, was available to play Lisa. Smith was not, so he suggested Fulton.


	“I knew I was going to get that part. There were 250 other girls there [at the audition], but I just knew,” she said.

	











	Lisa “was supposed to be the sweet girl next door. I said, ‘I'm tired of being the sweet girl next door.' I can't change the lines, but I can change my intention once we're on the air. I just thought of little conniving things I could do to Bob.” That would be her first TV husband, played by Don Hastings.


	During one stretch in the early '60s, Fulton would work in the mornings on As the World Turns (when it aired lived), race to the Billy Rose Theater on Broadway to play Honey in matinee performances of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and then appear downtown at the Sullivan Street Playhouse in the evenings in The Fantasticks.


	Fulton quit As the World Turns for the first time in 1963 to “do other things,” which included an off-Broadway turn opposite Hal Holbrook in Abe Lincoln in Illinois. As she had trouble finding other work, viewers did not take to her replacement, Pamela King, and so she returned.


	She left again in 1965, this time to star in Our Private World, which aired Wednesday and Friday nights on CBS. Lisa had fled Oakdale after dumping Bob to move to Chicago, where she wed the wealthy John Eldridge. (Coster played Eldridge; decades later, he would portray Lisa's seventh husband, Eduardo Grimaldi.)


Our Private World, however, was canceled in September after just four months on the air, and Fulton was back on As the World Turns in 1966.


	In 1983, Fulton exited in a contract dispute, to be replaced by Betsy von Furstenberg. But when she heard the writers were thinking about killing off Lisa, she made another comeback. “I don't think anybody would believe Lisa is dead unless I do it,” she said.

	











	Fulton co-authored two autobiographies, 1970's How My World Turns and 1995's As My World Still Turns; several murder mysteries; and another book, 1999's Soap Opera: A Novel. She also was a cabaret performer and had her own clothing line at J.C. Penney.


	In real life, Fulton, unlike Lisa, was married (and divorced) only three times.


	Survivors include her brother, Charles, and her niece, Katherine.


	In a 2010 interview with NPR, the actress said she was well aware that many viewers despised her character. There was one in particular.


	“I was standing in front of Lord & Taylor. I'd only been on the show a few weeks,” she said. “And this beautifully dressed woman in a Chanel suit — in the days before there were knockoffs — came up to me and said, ‘Aren't you Lisa?' And I said, ‘Yes, that's the part I play.' And she said, ‘Well, I hate you!' And she hit me! And people looked at me like I was rotten and this woman was a heroine.


	“But I thought, ‘You know what? I've reached them.' Then a telegram came into the studio. It said, ‘If that bitch Lisa marries Bob I'll never watch As the World Turns again.' That is how the character was truly locked in.”

	“We'll also be hosting a free public screening of the film in the newly reopened Plaza de Valero. Until then, don't worry… the bike will be stored for safekeeping,” the post concluded. “Maybe in the basement!”


	In Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Paul Reubens‘ Pee-wee Herman heads out on quite a big adventure to get his stolen bike back. Early in May, People reported the bike had been sold at a memorabilia auction to a private collector for $125,000.

The enduringly popular Discovery Channel summertime TV event is back for its 37th year.


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	With the season's big holiday in the nation's rearview and the majority of the summer's blockbusters currently playing in cinemas, mid-July is now upon us. At this time of year, you'll notice certain sensory shifts: the smells of sizzling barbecues, the noise of children in the street and the record heat you've been cursing becomes less bothersome. Why? Because you are, or should be, inside enjoying Shark Week. 


Discovery Channel‘s enduringly popular summertime TV event is back, for its 37th year, starting on Sunday and featuring a slew of new shows. Expect another wildly entertaining and at times informative variety with plenty of personalities. Giddy gratification and gory glimpses of the ocean predators are plentiful this year, as is some frightening and fascinating footage of the summer season's seminal scallywag.

					How to Watch 'Shark Week' 2024 Without Cable		
			









	Here's a brief look at some of the highlights below, with the full viewing schedule here.


	This white-knuckle show provides practical knowledge for every ocean swimmer and Jaws fan's ultimate fear: facing down an apex predator in a real-life shark attack. Using three potential scenarios, the hour-long episode breaks down survival tactics that could mean the difference between life and death for an unlucky human shark bait. It's hosted by the affable Paul de Gelder, a former Australian Navy bomb disposal diver and Army paratrooper who survived a bull shark attack in 2009. Watch as sharks tear into his prosthetic limbs, squirm amid some gripping close calls, and allow the very macho commentary to wash over you and grimace (or giggle) at a shocking amount of fake blood. 

	











	An unusually aggressive and elusive shark terrorizes the California coast, prompting a deep-sea hunt to determine if it's a known species —or if it may be something far more mysterious. Producer, marine biologist and shark expert Kendyl Berna, who co-founded Beyond the Reef, teams up with researchers to deploy cutting-edge tech in pursuit of the so-called “black mako.” Ample sonar drama is afoot — and it comes with a side of speculative science — in an episode that's giving half-sci-fi thriller, half-documentary.


	The iconic great white leaping spectacle is known for stunning shots of breaches as it focuses on high-speed hunts and aerial acrobatics. This time on the Shark Week classic, a crack team of marine biologists and — let's face it, aqua adventure junkies — are on the hunt for Colossus, a legendary 20-foot Great White who disappeared off the coast of South Africa and has not been seen in 10 years. Could he be off the coast of New Zealand? Will the marine-loving crew of shark seekers find their “white whale”? Will they capture some of the most stunning shark breaches in Discovery's history? Anything is possible — it's Shark Week, after all…


	This episode compiles jaw-dropping footage of sharks turning the tables — biting cameras, boats and sometimes the people trying to film them. Hosted by incomparable adrenaline junkie Kinga Philipps, this highly entertianing episode blends viral clips with commentary from startled scientists and thrill-seeking divers. The jump-scare editing style keeps the pace moving, even if its at the cost of the insights into shark behavior we're here for. But that's for the other shows. Pass the Goldfish….

	











	 Legend meets biology in this deep dive into the myth of a monstrous shark blamed for the death of a man attacked in St. Martin. Again, an assembled team of cryptozoologists and shark researchers comes together, this time looking to draw a line between fiction and facts as they find an innovative way to draw the shark — and dozens of its closest pals — toward the underwater crew in what to most viewers is an absolute nightmare scenario. Sit in a deeper chair because this hour of television will redefine the edge of your seat. 


	In this beautifully shot special, we are invited to explore the unusual bond between humans and sharks as free divers interact with the ocean predators in choreographed underwater encounters. Featuring journalist and adventurer Kinga Philipps, the episode showcases some gorgeous and serene dives with tiger sharks and hammerheads. One may ask, should wild animals turn into dance partners? But one should also be certain to remember this piece of sage advice: “Live every week like it's Shark Week.”


Shark Week 2025 starts Sunday July 20 on Discovery.

The pop queen stepped into the kitchen to whip up a small taste of what's to come.

	Ashley Iasimone



	It's not just a sweet, sweet fantasy: Mariah Carey‘s about to deliver something “Sugar Sweet.” The pop queen stepped into the kitchen to whip up a small taste of what's to come for fans this weekend — in the form of a light, sugary song.


	Carey shared a short video of herself mixing batter at the kitchen counter on Saturday (July 19). In the social media clip catered for fans, she fixes her gaze on the camera with a knowing smile and mouths the lyrics to a new tune.


	Dressed in bubblegum pink, the star previews a sweet hook that has her singing, “Imma keep it nice, Imma keep it neat, Imma keep it sugar, Imma keep it sweet.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	No release date or further details have emerged about “Sugar Sweet,” but assuming the single arrives soon, it'll be the follow-up to “Type Dangerous,” which just got a remix EP release featuring collaborations with Big Sean, DJ Snake, Method Man and more. Both tracks would likely find a place on Carey's as-yet-untitled 16th studio album.

	











	Fortunately for eager fans awaiting Carey's first full-length studio project since 2018, the new album is ready to go when she's ready to reveal it.


	“What is next? The album coming out. I don't wanna tell too much about it because I just don't want to reveal the whole thing. It's finished,” she confirmed in an Apple Music interview last month. In that conversation, she also left a hint that “Sugar Sweet” was on the way,  adding that “a second single is coming soon. I'm very excited about it. It's very summery. I like the beat as well.”

	Following his bombshell revelation about the abuse he endured at Nickelodeon, Drake Bell is shedding more light on their “evil, corrupt” practices.


	The Drake & Josh alum recently opened up about the “flawed” system used to protect child actors' earnings, dispelling misconceptions that his time at the kids' network was as profitable as it seemed.


	“That's the perception of the world, it's always been this way,” he explained on The Unplanned Podcast. “It's like, you know, ‘Oh, you made a Folgers Coffee commercial. You must live in a mansion in Hollywood. Like, I saw you on TV. You're rich.'”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Bell added, “That's far from the case. And especially, which is the bummer for most of us on Nickelodeon, we don't get residuals for our shows.”


	After starring alongside Josh Peck in the sitcom for its four-season run from 2004 to '07, Bell noted that the goal for most TV actors is getting to 100 episodes so they can get to syndication, which pays residuals. “That's where you make your money,” he said.


	“It's a lot of evil, corrupt people,” said Bell of the studio execs who take advantage of child actors. “That's the only thing, that is the answer. There's no other answer.”


	Despite Drake & Josh now streaming on Netflix and running marathons on multiple networks with major sponsors, Bell said he doesn't receive any residuals.

	











	“Do everything that they do to us mentally and emotionally, and then throw us to the wolves. And we're like, okay, cool. I got rent this month,” he mused. “There are three channels doing Drake & Josh marathons. Netflix just bought it, it's top 10 on Netflix, and I gotta figure out how to pay my rent this month.”


	Bell added, “And some fat cat with a cigar is just sitting up at the top of Viacom just … getting high on child labor.”


	In ID's docuseries Quiet on Set, which debuted last March, Bell spoke for the first time about the abuse he suffered from his Nickelodeon dialogue coach/manager Brian Peck, which began during his time on The Amanda Show and continued into Drake & Josh‘s run.


	Brian Peck was arrested in 2003 on 11 charges, including sodomy, lewd act upon a child 14 or 15 by a person 10 years older and oral copulation by anesthesia or controlled substance, receiving 16 months and prison and being required to register as a sex offender. Bell was never publicly identified as the minor until the docuseries.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM WRITETHRU: DC Studios and Warner Bros' Superman has landed atop a second weekend of $57.2M, which catapults the Burbank, CA lot to the top of the studio domestic box office with $1.32 billion, higher than Disney/20th Century Studios' $1.27 billion for the period of Jan. 1-July 20. Again, Disney is bound to reclaim the top spot next weekend with the $100M-plus opening of Fantastic Four: First Steps, however, the works of Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy as Warner Bros Motion Picture Group Chairs, and the revamped DC Studios, are paying off. 


	Warners has also had six movies open to No. 1 more than any other studio this year with nine weekend at No. 1. They've also had five movies in a row bow to $45M+, a first for any studio. Also, Warner Bros. has had more $10M+ grossing days this year more than any other studio (as of today Warner Bros has 34 days of films grossing over $10). 

	











Superman‘s second weekend ease is -54%, a second weekend percentile decline on par with Deadpool & Wolverine, and better than the second weekend superhero holds we've seen YTD, Thunderbolts (-56%) and Captain America: Brave New World (-68%). Imax auditoriums delivered another $7.2M (13% of weekend 2) for a running cume of $32.8M. Running ten-day cume on Gunn's Superman is $235M. 


			Watch on Deadline		







	Word of mouth remains excellent with continued Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak polling showing a high definite recommend at 74%, with parents at 70% and kids under 12 at 65%. Warners is having a great weekend overall, the fourth weekend of Apple Original Films' F1 is only down -26%.


	Also, let's give props to Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth: The Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey, Mahershala Ali movie posted a 3rd weekend ease of -42%, the best third weekend hold for any Jurassic World movie with a 3-day of $23.4M. Previously, 2015's Jurassic World had a third weekend hold of -49%. 


	Overall weekend for all titles before Fantastic Four: First Steps gives the summer box office another bump is $135.2M, which is -9% off from a year ago when Twisters opened to $81.2M.

	











	The new stuff isn't really impressive…


	Despite any heralding of profit by Sony on I Know What You Did Last Summer with a net production cost of $18M, $13M opening isn't a win. It doesn't indicate any kind of revived interest in this '90s fave property. Some rivals are betting the movie comes in lower, like $12M, but the reboot 27 years later after its previous sequel is bound for the lowest opening in the theatrical pic franchise. That's not the grand B.O. plan when it comes to reviving these classic horror IPs. Sony was richer in their reboot of 28 Years Later debuting to $30M, and with a current running total of $68.7M. Snarked one film finance source about Summer, “It didn't feel like there was any stickiness in the marketing materials.” Overall social media universe reach was 196.8M, which was even below Sinners‘ 222M and under the original M3GAN‘s 330M reach. In regards to CinemaScore, I Know What You Did Last Summer gets a C+, the lowest in the series next to the 1997 original's B-, and the 1998 sequel's B. Sure, a sequel can be pulled off at a low cost, but with a depreciating scale of grosses.


	Says social media monitor RelishMix, “negative chatter on the new I Know What You Did Last Summer is filled with critiques and doubts. Since this feature-length revival comes not even four years after the television adaptation of the franchise, some are quick to judge its quality: ‘Looks like the TV series, which was awful,' and ‘This looks like a straight to streaming movie. It does not look like it was meant for the theater. It reminds me of the Scream TV show that aired on MTV.' Even the return of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. falls short of satisfying fans, ‘Bringing back aged old casts feels cliché. I just knew they would do this. Another movie that no one asked for. Original version always is better.'” 


	Low definite recommend on Summer at 43%. 50/50 male to female showed up. Demo breakdown is men over 25 (36%), female over 25 (30%), female under 25 (20%), and men under 25 (14%). Sixty-one percent 18-34 turnout. Even cash flow across the country, but South is the best. AMC Grove in LA is the highest cinema for the pic with $34K through Saturday. Few PLFs on Summer since they're staying with the Man of Steel.


	Paramount Animation's Smurfs is coming in lower at $11M. Though down from yesterday's $12M forecast, it's still better than expected as some feared the blue guys and gal would get crushed in the high single digits. Again, it's an international and consumer products play. No one was going into this thinking they were going to re-invent the wheel and soar these grosses into some rebooted stratosphere. It's a very old property (gosh, 1980s?) sans the coolness of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The first movie in pre-streaming 2011 opened to $35.6M (and finaled at north of $142M+) — because at that time there had never been a Smurfs movie before. The movie cost a net $58M before P&A. The Rihanna-starring Smurfs gets a B+, which is the lowest CinemaScore in the series of four films to date. The previous one, The Lost Village, received the franchise's only A grade. 


	How to make Smurfs cool again? That's the big question. It's hard to Dave Filoni this property. One could try to make it edgier for boys. Even in at their height in the 1980s, the Smurfs were embraced and then faced backlash like any other long-running it property. 

	











	There's a big reach on social with Smurfs at 309M across Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube with “Rihanna fully activated and cross-promoting her beauty brand, feeding 420M fans and pumping materials along with Nick Offerman at 3.4M fans with other cast not activated.” Rihanna has also been a trooper showing up to do extensive press at the pic's Belgian premiere and LA fan event.


	Definite recommend at 50% isn't a rush. Per Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak, 59% of the audience are parents with a child and mostly moms at 73%. Younger-skewing property for kids, as we told you and PostTrak shows that with 68% under 9 years old (47% between 7-9). Mostly girls here at 61%. Female leaning at 61%. Under 35 is 69%. Kids under 12 gave the movie an 80% positive, with a low 44% must-see right away. Grosses are evenly spread throughout the country but best in East, South and South Central. AMC MJ Harlem is the leading cinema stateside with $22K through Saturday.


	Diversity demos are 47% Caucasian, 29% Latino and Hispanic, 13% Black, and 4% Asian American.


	Ari Aster's Eddington gets a C+, which is the same grade as the director's Midsommar. Definite recommend on PostTrak is 39%. Aster loves being divisive. The opening per A24 $4.25M after a first day/previews of $1.88M. Midsommar, a genre movie, posted a 3-day of $6.5M in what was a $10.9M 5-day start. Hereditary with a D+ CinemaScore remains Aster's best opening at $13.5M. The wow here given Eddington‘s mash-up of two genres –70s Altman comedy and Rambo— is that it's guns-a-blazing ahead of Aster and Joaquin Phoenix's previous partnership, Beau Is Afraid which died with a $2.66M semi-wide break at 965 theaters, and $8.1M domestic gross. Seriously, coming away from the pic's premiere at Cannes, the sentiment felt Eddington was destined for the B.O. nightmares of Beau Is Afraid (that VFX filled movie carried at net production cost of $35M; we've heard gross is as high as $50M). The movie is playing on the coasts, which is no surprise, with AMC Burbank the highest grossing venue for the movie with just over $33K though last night. Demo breakdown is men over 25 (46%), women over 25 (27%), men under 25 (15%) and women under 25 (11%). 18-34 turnout is 60%. Who loves this movie? Per PostTrak 13-17 year olds (2% turnout, 80% grade) and 35-44 year olds (44% showed up, 79% positive grade).

FRIDAY PM: Not a gangbusters weekend, but solid enough to make exhibition content. Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman is looking at $16M, -71%, in its second Friday, for what's looking to be a $55M second weekend at 4,275 theaters, for a decline on the high-end that's in the -56% realm. Worldwide all in by Sunday is looking like $400M. 


	Matt Reeves' The Batman fell -50% in weekend 2 for a $66.5M take, while James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 eased -56% for a $65.2M second weekend. On the high side, Superman will stand at $232.7M by Sunday end of day. 


	Standing strong above the new stuff in second is Universal's third weekend of Jurassic World Rebirth with $21.5M at 3,854. The Gareth Edwards directed movie dips -47% with a running cume by Sunday of $274.2M. 


	Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems I Know What You Did Last Summer is seeing just under $6M today for what's hoped to be a $13M-$15M opening at 3,206 sites. Rivals believe it's in a fight for third with Paramount Animation's Smurfs which is seeing $4M today at 3,504 locations, and a $12M 3-day. The last one under Sony, 2017's Smurfs: The Lost Village opened to $13.2M. Smurfs is a much younger skewing movie among kids under 12. The IP always does better abroad, and the upside for those studios getting involved with the property is the share of the merchandise revs.  Paramount Global is handling the consumer products licensing for the Smurfs in most international territories including North America. 


I Know What You Did Last Summer 1 back in 1997 opened to $15.8M, while party 2 in 1998 debuted to $16.5M. That's unadjusted for inflation. 


	Apple Original Films' F1 is seeing a fourth Friday of $2.6M at 3,094 theaters, and 3-day of $9.4M, -28%, for a running cume of $153.4M. 


	A24's Eddington at 2,111 sites is looking at $1.9M today and $4.5M for the weekend. That's under what another Cannes premiere, Wes Anderson's Phoenician Scheme, did in its wide break at 1,678, $6.2M at 1,678. Eddington cost $25M net shot with New Mexico tax credits, which is under the reported $30M that Focus Features shelled out for Phoenician Scheme. 


FRIDAY AM: Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems' reboot of I Know What You Did Last Summer banked $2.2 million in previews from showtimes that began at 2 p.m. Thursday, while A24's Ari Aster socio-political Western Eddington did $625,000.


	Neither film, nor Paramount Animation's Smurfs, is expected to over swell with Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman still a fortress atop the box office chart with an expected second weekend of $55M-$60M, after the James Gunn movie ended its first week with $177.7M. Superman is pacing ahead of the first week of Matt Reeves' The Batman by 3% ($172.5M, final domestic $369.3M), 16% ahead of Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($152.7M first week, $359M final domestic) and 3% behind the first week of GOTG Vol. 2 ($183.1M, final domestic $389.3M).


I Know What You Did Last Summer is eyeing around $13M+, while Smurfs is anywhere in the high single digits to low teens. Eddington is expected to land in the under-$5M range.


	The Jennifer Kaytin Robinson-directed I Know What You Did Last Summer counts previews that are higher than Blumhouse/Universal's Wolf Man ($1.4M previews, $10.8M opening) from earlier this year, and 62% less than Sony's reboot of 28 Years Later ($5.8M previews, $30M opening). Critics have settled at 38% Rotten on I Know What You Did Last Summer while the Rotten Tomatoes audience meter is at 69%. That latter score is the best in franchise, ahead of the original 1997 installment at 41% and the 1998 sequel at 29%.

	











	The 1997 movie, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and the late Anne Heche, opened to $15.8M and legged out to $72.5M domestic, $125.5M worldwide. The 1998 sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer debuted to $16.5M and ended its run at $40M. The movies made $165M combined. The third movie, I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer starring Brooke Nevin, went direct to home video in 2006. The new installment features the return of Hewitt and Prinze Jr alongside newcomers Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon and Gabbriette Bechtel.


Eddington‘s critical score stands at 66%, which is under the 90% certified fresh of Aster's horror opus Hereditary, and his Swedish solstice genre pic run amok Midsommar (83% certified fresh), and 2 points under his trippy Joaquin Phoenix pic Beau Is Afraid (68% fresh).


Smurfs didn't hold previews last night.


	The rest of the week:


	1.) Superman (WB) 4,135 theaters Thu $10.9M (-7% from Wed) Week $177.7M/Wk 1 


	2.) Jurassic World Rebirth (Uni) 4,324 theaters, Thu $4.2M (-6% from Wed), Week $60.6M  (-56%), Total $252.7M/Wk 2

Only 406 million worldwide for Superman and in a few days Fantastic Four will take over multiplexes worldwide.

This movie will top out sub 500 million.

No it won't, it had this weekend to achieve that and it fell short.

Exactly people were saying its gonna pass 500 by the second weekend and close with 1billion. I think all the negative spewed towards synder and MoS its gonna fall short of closing 600

Superman is certainly no bomb, but looks to be underperforming 

Decent hold but with no major new competition, it better.  JW had Superman launch in week 2, Disney decided to give Supes and FF a break in Supes week 2.   Next week likely a bigger decline and the movie starts to fade.Unless FF bombs after week 1.

I still can't believe that people think $600 million worldwide for Superman is a good thing.

Especially considering that Man of Steel made $670 million 12 years ago. Adjusted for inflation, it's around $900 million, meaning about 33% less people will see Superman in theaters than saw Man of Steel in theaters.

Let the Snyderverse go. It's dead and it ain't coming back.

Only people without arguments try to disqualify facts by bringing something that has no relation to the conversation.

I still can't believe how many posts you've made about SUPERMAN's box office. Why are you so obsessed with this?

They really do seem obsessed.

Says another obsessed guy.

The best analogy I've heard regarding Superman and what it ‘needs' to do is comparing it to Batman Begins.

A reboot coming off the heels of a franchise that flamed out in dramatic fashion, lost interest from movie goers, and some questioning if the whole thing could ever recover. Superman has to win back audiences after Black Adam, Shazaam 2, and The Flash were the collective final nails in the coffin for the DCEU. Batman Begins had to win back audiences after Batman and Robin, a movie to this day still considered by many to be one of the worst comic book movies of all time (debatable, but not without some merit).

Batman Begins was a modest success, but it was no blockbuster. Audience and critic reviews were glowing, however, so it's modest financial success combined with great reviews earned it the sequel that everyone threw all of their money at. I think WB/DC is trying to recapture that moment; Superman is damage control, just like Batman Begins was, and it's main job is to generate interest in a rebooted DCU. That, combined with a ‘good enough' box office, would achieve that, if history repeats itself.

Imagine comparing superman with batman begins, you are getting desperate trying to find ways to spin this flop into a success.

All you people are saying now are excuses, six months ago you said it was going to be the film of the year and now you're trying to spin this as a first step in the right direction, the truth is that you don't want to admit you were wrong.

James Gunn is no Christopher Nolan.

That's what Begins had. A good director, flanked by good actors.

And it was dark. And brooding.

This Superman reboot is literally a joke. I think Gunn did it on purpose. There's no way he actually thought it was good.

Yet, this is the third time they've unsuccessfully tried to reboot Superman…So there's that.

Yeah this is a solid base hit. It's well liked and will make money. It's not a home run, and to extend the baseball analogy to really score the follow up hitters will have to do their jobs. Are Supergirl and Clayface upto the task? We'll see.

Exactly.

Say it louder so the trolls in the comments section finally understand.

					By Natalie Oganesyan 

Weekend Editor


Southern Hospitality‘s Will Kulp will not appear in the Bravo reality series' forthcoming fourth season, slamming the show as a “horrible experience and a life lesson” as he announced his departure.


	The decision is perhaps unsurprising, given that the future lawyer and former Republic Garden & Lounge bartender was notably absent during Season 3's reunion episode, hosted by Andy Cohen in March. The January-premiering third season of the show — about a group of friends in Charleston, S.C. working at Leva Bonaparte's crown jewel nightclub on King Street — saw Kulp face allegations of a cheating scandal with now-fiancée Emmy Sharrett.

	Taking to his Instagram Stories yesterday, per Parade, Kulp wrote in full: “A little update: The new season has started filming, and unsurprisingly, I will not be a part of it this year. I will likely never film a second of reality TV ever again. It has been a horrible experience and a life lesson.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“A big thanks to some cast, some production, Andy Cohen and ALL of the crew for the seasons past. You know who you are. Your kindness and professionalism are rare occurrences in the industry.”


	“Best of luck to this new season. I hope it can be entertaining without a defamatory storyline or unwanted use of my name, image, and likeness,” Kulp continued. “When it is appropriate, I will talk more about experiences with production and the network which led to this decision.”


	He concluded, “I am happy to be moving on and I will be cheering Emmy on from the sidelines with the rest of you.”


	First premiering in 2022, Southern Hospitality saw recent ratings wins for the cable network, with Season 3 up 22% from its previous installment's overall audience average, becoming Bravo's first original series to grow in each of its first three seasons since 2018.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved Soap Actress Passes Away & Tributes Pour In","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/eileen-fulton-passes-away-tributes-soap/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 11:32:46 GMT","

Longtime “As The World Turns” fans are in mourning as one of the show's great icons, Eileen Fulton, has sadly passed away. She was known as the originator of the “vixen” trope thanks to her role in the soap opera. Eileen Fulton played Lisa Miller on the series from 1960 until 2010. Eileen was 91. 

According to her obituary, Elieen passed away on July 14 in Asheville, North Carolina. Her death came after what her family referred to as a period of declining health. Notably, Eileen Fulton is from Asheville and was born on September 13, 1933. She retired from acting in 2019 after a long and memorable career in Hollywood. She was born Margaret Elizabeth McLarty. 

Eileen Fulton made a significant mark on Hollywood. This is especially the case when it comes to the world of soap operas. Naturally, this has led many fans to take to the internet to celebrate her life and achievements. 

One “As The World Turns” fan, Team Johnny Dimera, did this with a post on X. The person wrote, “I'm truly saddened by the passing of Eileen Fulton. Her role as Lisa Hughes on As the World Turns was unforgettable. She was one of a kind, and her loss leaves a big hole in our hearts. She will be deeply missed.”

Tommy Lightfoot Garrett, who had met Eileen Fulton, also tributed her on the X platform. They wrote, “Eileen Fulton, Longtime ‘Bad Girl' Lisa on ‘As the World Turns,' Dies at 91. Eileen invited me to be her special guest at Feinstein's, where we took this picture.”

Another fan, Daemon ONeil, also mourned her death. According to them, “Terrible news on a Saturday. Eileen Fulton, who played Lisa Miller Hughes on my soap opera #AsTheWorldTurns for more than 50 years, has passed away aged 91. A phenomenal actress and a Daytime legend.”

Eileen Fulton may be most known for her iconic role on “As The World Turns,” but her legacy stretches beyond the show. According to IMDb, her first television appearance was in 1959 on a show called “True Story.” Eileen was on for two episodes. 

Notably, Eileen also starred in the spin-off of “As The World Turns,” called “Our Private World.” The show lasted for one season. Her last credited role came in 2011 with “The Life Zone.” She leaves behind her brother and niece, as well as their respective children.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Katie Holmes' Quiet Reaction to Tom Cruise & Ana de Armas Romance Rumors Flew Under the Radar","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/katie-holmes-reacts-tom-cruise-de-armas/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 03:15:28 GMT","

Tom Cruise was married to Katie Holmes from 2006 to 2012. Now, the “Wonder Boys” actress has seemingly weighed in on the flurry of media attention her former flame is receiving for spending a lot of time lately with actress Ana de Armas, who portrayed Marilyn Monroe in the 2022 film “Blonde.”

Eagle-eyed fans noticed the 46-year-old had reacted to the rumored pairing by “liking” a May 1 Instagram post by the Daily Mail which bore the headline, “Tom Cruise and Ana de Armas love affair confirmed.” The story suggested Cruise and the 37-year-old beauty had “confirmed their love affair is real” by flying into London together ahead of de Armas' birthday.

The outlet claims another of Cruise's exes, 51-year-old Penelope Cruz, is “happy her ex-boyfriend has found new love.” The Mail reported in May they were told by an unnamed source that “Ana has said that Penelope is happy for her, she approves.” The source also said, “They know each other from the movie and also they have friends in common in Madrid from when Ana lived there for a while,” according to the story.

On July 17, 2025, Page Six reported the performers had been photographed by Backgrid spending time together in Menorca. In the shots, the pair can be seen sitting on a boat across from each other. They both looked relaxed in lightweight summer wear as they shielded their faces from the sun under hats.

E! News called the excursion “an intimate yacht date” and reminded fans the pair is set to star across from each other in the upcoming nautical action film “Deeper,” to be directed by Doug Liman. The outlet also pointed out that de Armas appeared to rest her hand on Cruise's leg in one of the shots.

As you know, the “Mission Impossible” star and de Armas first sparked romance rumors around Valentine's Day 2025 after being spotted together at a dinner. However, Elle pointed out that the pair's agents were also at the dinner, and said a source told people that the two were simply “discussing potential collaborations down the line.”

Ana de Armas' John Wick film “Ballerina” dropped June 6, 2025 and Tom Cruise enthusiastically supported the movie. 

Discussing the project with the Associated Press, Cruise said, “I love John Wick and what those guys do. I know what it takes to create these kinds of stories. Now you have ‘Ballerina' coming out with Ana. That's outstanding.” He emphasized that the movie was on his list of summer films he was “really excited about” before giving more praise to de Armas. 

“She's gonna kill it. Really, really talented.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jason Momoa Steps Out With His Teenagers & They're SO Gorgeous [PHOTOS]","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jason-momoa-teenage-children-gorgeous-photos/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 16:51:17 GMT","

Jason Momoa is a father to two children whom he shares with his ex-wife, Lisa Bonnet. They have a daughter, Lola, born in 2007, and a son, Nakoa-Wolf, born in 2008. Momoa's kids are growing up fast, and when he stepped onto the red carpet to promote his latest film, “Chief of War,” he was joined by his teenagers. 

The family posed for photos on the red carpet at Ko Olina Beach Park in Kapolei, Hawaii, on Friday, July 18, 2025. The sweet moment not only showed that Momoa's kids are growing up fast and are gorgeous, but it also gave a glimpse into a more playful side of their personalities. 

The film, a story about a Hawaiian war chief, saw Momoa posing for photos in the same cape that he wore in the movie. Momoa, who has Hawaiian heritage, plays the role of Kaʻiana. His son and daughter also posed in outfits that complemented his, each with their own capes. 

Lola paired hers with a brown cutout dress, and Nakoa wore a black vest and matching black trousers. 

Momoa's heritage is important to him, and he has honored his roots in many different ways. This includes the names he chose for his children. His daughter Lola's middle name is Iolani, which means “royal hawk,” People reports. 

Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha's name is also an honor to Momoa's heritage. People reports that Nakoa means “warrior,” and Manakauapo is a comment on the “dark and rainy weather conditions when he was born.”

Fatherhood is a role that the “Aquaman” actor takes seriously. He has discussed what having children means to him in several interviews. In a 2020 chat with InStyle, Momoa discussed becoming a father and how he had learned to share his emotions. “I didn't know what it takes to be a dad,” he told InStyle. “And I don't want to just tell my son, ‘Because I said so.' I really want to connect, and I want him to be vulnerable and open.”

In March 2024, Momoa told People how he has prioritised spending time with his children. “I spent a lot of time with them when they were younger, which is super important. Then they traveled with me quite a bit. But now, going into high school, they've got their friends and stuff,” he said.

He continued, “They still like me, which is good. I'm probably losing cool factor daily.”

Since his first Hallmark movie in 2011, “Love Begins,” beloved actor Wes Brown has been paired with some of the network's top leading ladies, from Rachel Boston in 2019's “Check Inn at Christmas” to Lacey Chabert in the “Haul Out the Holly” franchise.

But even after appearing in nearly 20 Hallmark movies, there are still actresses Brown has yet to co-star with, he told Swooon on July 19, 2025. When asked which ones he'd love to star with next, three stars were top of mind for the Hallmark hunk.

“I would love to work with Nikki DeLoach,” Brown told the outlet, and then added, “Kimberley Sustad, I've never done one with her. Sarah Drew, actually. I know all of the ladies, so it's just the ones that I haven't (filmed with). I love them all, so each one that I haven't is on the list.”

A post shared by Wes Brown (@wesbrown225)

Brown and DeLoach just spent time together in Boston and New York, teaming up to promote Hallmark's Christmas in July programming slate. 

On July 1, they were among the six Hallmark stars who appeared at Fenway Park for the Boston Red Sox game to launch the monthlong slate of holiday films and shows. Brown got to throw out the first pitch while the others cheered him on, and his upcoming “A Newport Christmas” co-star Ginna Claire Mason sang the national anthem. 

After the baseball game, Brown and DeLoach headed to New York City for multiple joint interviews about Hallmark's unscripted show they're both part of, “Christmas at Sea.” 

The four-part series follows fans and 11 stars — including Sustad and Drew, too — aboard the second-ever Hallmark Christmas Cruise in November 2024. All four stars — Brown, DeLoach, Sustad, and Drew — will be aboard the next cruise in November 2025, which sold out in a day. Brown told New York Live the ship has a waiting list of 70,000 fans. 

Although Brown would love the chance to work with DeLoach, Sustad, or Drew in the future, he's had some great female co-stars in his Hallmark past. Here's a rundown of his movies and castmates, per IMDb (not including his great cameos in movies like “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story” and “A Biltmore Christmas.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Johnny Depp Makes Major Life Move: DETAILS","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/johnny-depp-relocates-to-sussex-countryside/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 05:08:12 GMT","

It's a fresh start for Johnny Depp, and he's keeping things simple. Depp has officially put down roots in the UK, purchasing a large home in the Sussex countryside near the Kent border, according to the Daily Mail. Known for his bohemian style, the Hollywood star has surprised many by embracing a more grounded lifestyle outside London. The report states that Depp was chauffeured from his new residence to the premiere of “Modigliani: Three Days On The Wing Of Madness” last week.

Two years ago, rumors circulated that the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star had moved to Somerset. However, in reality, he was living in a Soho townhouse that also served as his art studio and creative space.

As Daily Mail journalist Alison Boshoff previously reported, several of Depp's recent interviews were conducted during this chapter of his life in the Soho area. However, for the sake of “peace, privacy, and security,” Depp has now relocated to the countryside — a move that mirrors the lifestyle of his late best friend, legendary guitarist Jeff Beck.

Depp spent a significant amount of time with Jeff Beck at the rock icon's 16th-century farmhouse in Wadhurst during the COVID-19 pandemic. Talking to a local British magazine, the actor reportedly called it “very beautiful and wet” — a nod to the lush, rainy English landscape.

The two artists first met in 2016 and began collaborating on music in 2019. In 2022, they released a full-length album, “18,” and embarked on a tour together that same year.

In an interview with Hollywood Authentic, Depp spoke candidly about his bond with Jeff Beck and his wife, Sandra. “There's a couple who very much helped to keep me alive and sane and happy through the weirdness. And that's Jeff and Sandra [Beck's wife],” he said.

People reported that Beck died of bacterial meningitis in January 2023, and Depp was reportedly at his bedside. He and Sandra gave Beck a “green burial” on the grounds of the Sussex home — a loss that deeply impacted Depp.

Depp has long been a globetrotter when it comes to real estate. He owns a sprawling estate in the south of France, where he and his ex-partner, Vanessa Paradis, raised their children, Lily-Rose and Jack. 

He also owns a private Caribbean island, Little Hall's Pond Cay, where he famously wed Amber Heard in 2015 — a marriage that ended in legal turmoil just two years later.  Many of his team members, including Stephen Deuters, CEO of his UK production company, are based there. 

As per the Daily Mail UK print edition, locals have spotted Depp enjoying the area, including at The Middle House pub in Mayfield. He also paid a visit to the Folly Wildlife Rescue center in Kent — an organization Jeff Beck once supported. In 2022, The Daily Mail posted photos of Depp holding a baby badger named Freddie Mercury.

Though a quiet country life may seem unexpected for Depp, it's not out of character. Depp may be leaning into a softer, more grounded chapter of life.

When it comes to Hallmark and holidays, the gifts just keep on coming. Fans were treated to another surprise on July 19, 2025, as the network revealed Hallmark Channel superstars Lacey Chabert and Andrew Walker will reunite onscreen during the 16th annual Countdown to Christmas programming lineup. 

Hallmark Media announced their surprise movie “She's Making a List,” with a special promo featuring Chabert and Walker, who last co-starred in 2018's “My Secret Valentine.” Here's everything you need to know! 

The promo for “She's Making a List,” which aired during Hallmark Channel's Christmas in July premiere of “Unwrapping Christmas: Lily's Destiny,” marked the second weekend in a row that Walker took fans by surprise with an unexpected movie reveal. 

One week earlier, Hallmark thrilled fans with the news that Walker, Tyler Hynes, and Paul Campbell will return with a third movie in their beloved “Three Wise Men” franchise, also slated to premiere during the 2025 holiday season. 

Walker will begin filming that movie in mid-August, but has spent part of July in Vancouver with Chabert filming “She's Making a List,” her 16th Hallmark Christmas movie and their first holiday title together. 

The duo had been hoping to reunite onscreen, even suggesting ideas to executives, Walker told EntertainmentNow, unaware that Hallmark was already working on finding the right script and timing for the two to come back together. 

According to the movie's logline, “When Naughty or Nice inspector Isabel Haynes (Chabert) is assigned to evaluate mischievous 11-year-old Charlie Duncan, she expects a routine case. But things get complicated when Isabel unexpectedly falls for Charlie's widowed father, Jason Duncan (Walker), and begins to question the rigid rules of her job. As Christmas approaches, Isabel must choose between following the holiday algorithm or following her heart.”

“This movie is really, really great,” Walker told EntertainmentNow. “It's an amazing concept — like ‘Men in Black' meets Christmas.” 

Jennifer Kramer, Vice President of Programming at Hallmark Media, said in a statement, “Bringing Lacey Chabert and Andrew Walker together for their first-ever Hallmark Christmas movie is a dream come true for our fans. ‘She's Making a List' captures the heart, humor, and holiday magic our viewers love, and we can't wait to share this unforgettable story with them this season.”

Although Walker and Chabert have remained friends, slipping back into work mode to film together after seven years has been a breeze, Walker told EntertainmentNow. 

Walker said that although Chabert is such a huge star and the undisputed “Queen of Christmas” at Hallmark, “She doesn't get affected by it at all. She's almost, like, innocent about it. Her whole life is her daughter and her family, and it's just a beautiful thing to be around.”

In a statement via Hallmark, Chabert said, “Reuniting with Andrew after all these years to do our first Christmas movie together is such a joy. Andrew brings so much heart, humor, and warmth to every role, and working with him again felt like coming home. I am thrilled to do this one together…finally.”

In addition to “She's Making a List,” Chabert also has several other Hallmark projects in the coming months, including a second season of her unscripted series “Celebrations With Lacey Chabert,” and “Haul Out the Halloween,” the third movie in her popular “Haul Out the Holly” franchise.

It has been almost 20 years since Isaac Hayes left his voice role of Chef in “South Park.” And it has also been 17 years since Hayes died at the age of 65. Now, the legendary performer's son Isaac Hayes III has addressed the long-held rumor as to why exactly his father Hayes left the popular Comedy Central series.

It should first be noted that Hayes quit following the controversy regarding an episode that skewered Scientology entitled “Trapped in the Closet” (Season 9, Episode 12), in which Stan joins Scientology after recruiters say he is the reincarnation of church founder L. Ron Hubbard. Scientology has long tentacles in the entertainment industry, even more publicly so in 2005 when the episode aired. Famous members like Tom Cruise and John Travolta were sent up in the episode. Years later, during the podcast “Basic!,” “South Park” co-creator Matt Stone explained why the writers chose to spoof Scientology.

“Everyone knew Scientology was so litigious,” Stone said. “People in Hollywood were scared of Scientology at the time because they would just sue you. I think that got us going. The Tom Cruise episode was really about getting sued. I mean, poking openly litigious people and seeing where the line is and what you can say. They picked a fight with us and we just went with it.”

“South Park” voice actor Hayes, though, was a scientologist in real life. The fallout from “Trapped in the Closet,” his son says, is indeed the reason he quit “South Park”…but it was not his dad's choice.

“For over 14 years, people have speculated about why my father left ‘South Park.' I'm here to set the record straight. My dad did not quit ‘South Park.' Scientology did,” Isaac Hayes III wrote on X. “After the episode ‘Trapped in the Closet' aired in 2005, my father suffered a stroke just a few months later that left him unable to speak or make decisions on his own. He was not in any condition to resign from anything. The truth is, someone else within his Scientology circle made that decision and quit the show for him.”

In a 2016 THR piece, Hayes' son — also known as Ike Dirty — said, “At the time, everybody around my father was involved in Scientology — his assistants, the core group of people. So someone quit South Park on Isaac Hayes' behalf. We don't know who.”

In his Twitter post, Hayes III said that his father “loved being the voice of Chef” and that he greatly enjoyed meeting fans. “The narrative that he quit because he was offended by the satire is not true,” he wrote. “That was a cover story created by others. My father never got to speak for himself because his health robbed him of that chance. So now I am speaking for him. He did not leave ‘South Park' willingly. He was forced out by illness and by people who did not have his best interest at heart. This is for anyone who loved Chef. This is for anyone who admired my father's work. This is the truth about what really happened.”

“Happy Gilmore 2,” set to drop on Netflix July 25, almost had one more cast member from the original film included: Carl Weathers — who played Derick “Chubbs” Peterson, the sage handless pro golfer who meets an unfortunate end. Weathers, though, died at the age of 76 on February 1, 2024. The movie did not begin shooting until later that year.

“We had a painful change. Carl Weathers had a massive part,” Sandler said in an interview with Collider. “I would talk to Carl, and we were excited, and then Carl passed away. We had to rewrite a lot of the stuff, and even what the story was. We made a lot of nice references to how great Chubbs was in the movie. That was the biggest change.”

In the initial drafts of the “Happy Gilmore 2” story, Chubbs played an integral role in the plot. “In the first version that we came up with, he had a son. He was coming back to me a lot in my dreams, and he had a son who was mad at Happy for causing the death of daddy,” Sandler explained.

 










When filming the first “Happy Gilmore” — released in 1996 — Weathers suffered a real-life injury, leading him to deal with back issues for the rest of his life.

“I didn't tell anyone because, you know, I'm tough, man,” the “Rocky” actor told GQ in 2020. “Yeah I hurt my back and actually, to this day, it still really bothers me, because it was right on the spine.”

Weathers said the accident happened during a “blind fall” stunt. “There are stunt bags, which, maybe are like two feet tall. But the bag wasn't pushed all the way against the wall, so when I went out backwards instead of hitting something flat, my body kind of got trapped, my head on the bags, and my tailbone at the wall, and so it just would crunch on the spine. I felt the pain and the burning sensation immediately,” he recalled. “But again, I'm an athlete, I'm tough, I'm an actor, let's keep going. And after about three or more of those, I said, ‘No more of that.'”

“Happy Gilmore 2” premieres on Netflix July 25. Watch the trailer below.

Billie Eilish may be coming again to a theater near you. At a concert in Manchester, England on July 19, the “What Was I Made For” singer/songwriter announced that her fans were on camera… and that she'd be wearing the same outfit for about four concerts in a row. And somehow James Cameron is involved? Yes, that James Cameron. 

If you're wondering what the connection is between the two artists… well, obviously, Eilish has two Oscars for Best Original Song, a category that Cameron's “Titanic” won in 1998. She won, of course, for the ballads she co-penned for “No Time to Die” and “Barbie.” But what exactly this new project will be isn't entirely certain, although a concert film would seem like the very obvious answer. We know for sure that whatever happens, it'll be in 3D. Here's exactly what Eilish said:

 








Related Stories Adam Sandler Says Carl Weathers Was Going to Return for ‘Happy Gilmore 2' Before His Death: It Was a ‘Painful Change' to the Script ‘Superman' Character Krypto Sends Dog Adoptions Sky High, with James Gunn Calling It the ‘Greatest' Blessing 

“So you may have noticed that there are more cameras than usual in here. Basically, I can't say much about it, but what I can say is that I'm working on something very, very special with somebody named James Cameron, and it's going to be in 3D. So, take that as you will, and these four shows here in Manchester — you and me are part of a thing that I am making with Jim. He's in this audience somewhere, just saying… But yeah, but don't mind that, and also I'll probably be wearing this exact outfit for like four days in a row.”

That's it. That's all we know. Hopefully the project will likely be something that is in league with the Beyoncé “Renaissance” and Taylor Swift “Eras” concert movies.

In 2023, Eilish spoke with IndieWire about the creative process she shared with her brother and collaborator Finneas O'Connell. “Every time we do anything in another world, it's just very inspiring in so many ways, like, ‘Damn, what could we do? What could we make happen?,” she said. “It feels like training in a way. It feels like we're working on a muscle that we really want to be bulky.”

They never found a body. They never found a car. She left a note. But no one ever heard from her after that. The way I imagine it goes like this: August 1974. She's in one of her house dresses, and there's music playing on the car radio. Ann Arbor, Michigan, where she was living at the time, disappears. It is replaced with a network of freeways, backcountry roads, and railroad tracks, first laid in the middle of the previous century. The flat upper Midwest becomes the Great Plains, the High Desert, the mountains, rivers, and streams, and eventually the Pacific coastline.

But I'm probably wrong. No one will ever know what happened to Elizabeth Eaton Converse and this is because she so very desperately did not want to be found.

And for a long time, she really did disappear without a trace. The music she wrote and performed as Connie Converse sat in a filing cabinet in Ann Arbor, while her family and friends resigned themselves to never hearing from her again. And they didn't, they never did hear from her again. But in 2004, two NYU students heard an old bootleg recording of Converse on the public radio station, WNYC. Gene Deitch, an old friend of Converse, played the track. He had made the recording back in the '50s at his kitchen table.

The students were spellbound by what they heard. A woman's strange and beautiful alto, paired with just a guitar and a lot of tape hiss. One of the recordings was “One by One,” a particularly abstract and haunting song about two lovers walking together at night, close together but so very far apart. She sings about how, as lovers, they don't walk two by two, “but it's one by one/One by one in the dark.” The students were enraptured. In 2009, they released How Sad, How Lovely, the first-ever compilation of songs by Connie Converse.

It has been said that Converse was ahead of her time, but only just barely. She was one of the first modern singer-songwriters, arguably the first modern DIY musician (she recorded many of her songs by herself in her apartment on a Crestwood 404 reel-to-tape). She left New York City and Greenwich Village in 1961, the same month that Bob Dylan arrived. She had a small but dedicated group of fans, mostly friends. She had one moment in the spotlight: a performance for Walter Cronkite on CBS' The Morning Show in 1954. But there is no surviving footage. Nothing came of it. Just some negatives in a scrapbook. The camera is trained on Converse's face, and in one moment she's looking at her guitar, and in the next her gaze is pointed almost at her feet. Like she is nervous, like there is something oppressive about the spotlight, the cameras, Cronkite, all of it.

There was very little precedent for what Converse was doing when she did it. Folk music, as it was thought of when Converse was working, commonly meant songs that had been passed down decades, with no known original author. But there was something uncommon and vulnerable, something deceptive and futuristic about Converse's songs. They took traditional songwriting sensibilities and transformed them into new forms that, at the time, were impossible to market in any sort of commercial setting. It's funny to think now about how shocking it must have been to hear Converse sing “Roving Woman,” a song about ladies habituating saloons and playing poker and going home with strange men.

The intimacy of Converse's music feels doubly present on these recordings. They are inherently imperfect, full of tape hiss and false starts as Converse accidentally begins a song in the wrong key. Many of the songs on How Sad, How Lovely open with Converse talking, explaining what she was about to perform. “This has a biblical text,” Converse says in the opening moments of “I Have Considered the Lilies,” as she clears her throat. She's just starting to play her guitar. “It goes like this! It's a whole story,” she says at the start of “Unknown (A Little Louder, Love).” In other recordings, you can hear cars on the road, or people shuffling around in the background, whispering things, just out of earshot.

All of it creates this unearthly sense of loneliness. Converse wrote unbearably lonely songs, with protagonists who find their alienation to be almost sweet. On “Talkin' Like You (Two Tall Mountains),” a place “called lonesome” is full of birds and squirrels and pigs and trees. It is not a state of exile, as you might think, to be separated from someone. When she sings, there is levity to her vocals. She sings like she is telling a child a story. A story about how it can be magical to be out on your own, not “in the need of company.” In Converse's world, to be so lonesome is to be so free. She's never resigned. Even if what she is singing about is heartbreaking, like how the you in question is someone who she misses greatly.

Converse's songs, as she mentions in “I Have Considered the Lilies,” are all little biblical texts. They are stories of dreamers and travelers and men who will break your heart. Her writing is not unlike Emily Dickinson's poetry. She traffics in allusion, in natural beauty, in alienation. Like Dickinson, she is also very funny. I'm drawn in particular to one poem of Dickinson's and one song of Converse's. In Poem 18, one of Dickinson's most famous, she writes, In the name of the Bee— and of the Butterfly—and of the Breeze—Amen! In Converse's “Honeybee,” she is dolorous when she sings about this small pollinator: “So, honeybee/Go and tell a starling/To go and tell my darling/To hurry home to me.” Converse's attention to the natural world, like Dickinson's, is full of longing and curiosity. It is a really profound song, capable of conveying a depth of emotion without saying much at all.

How can you listen to a song like “Playboy of the Western World,” and not feel transported, be made to think about your own past loves. “Oh he was elegant,” she sings, “Past all dreaming.” Then her syntax gets more strange, more allusive. She sings of Sheiks Araby, Shahs of Persia, Napoleon's tomb, and refers to his old Ford as “Mercedes Benz à la mode.” On “Father Neptune,” Converse imagines her love going off to sea and being taken by the Roman god of water. “I've got a man with a beard and a tan/And a passion for the sea,” she sings in one sardonic moment. And then her guitar wanders. Her alto quivers. And then the funny part becomes the sad part and she starts to slow down. And her alto reaches the top of its register and she goes: “And if it were not for this I would sink to the depths of the sea.”

Converse's style ostracized her at the time—Deitch had said her music was too hard to sell. When she performed at listening parties in the West Village, guests were often fixated on her strange appearance. “She dressed rather shabbily,” said a woman who saw Converse perform, “Like she had just milked the cows.” Deitch took it even further: “I wouldn't be surprised if she was deprived sexually,” he once said. This clear sexism, paired with Converse's unusual approach to making music, did not yield any success.

But in the decades that followed, countless women sat down and wrote vulnerable, personal music. And for many of those decades, none of them knew about Converse. It would be interesting, if you could rewrite history, to hear what Joni Mitchell thought of How Sad, How Lovely at the time she was working on Blue. Or Carole King when she wrote Tapestry. Like these artists, what Converse was writing was narrative, kinetic, joyful, complicated. Her songs seem to fall just one standard deviation away from being pop music. But because she struggled to find an audience for her music while she was alive, her work is often discussed in conversation with Daniel Johnston and Karen Dalton. Or maybe Vashti Bunyan, an outsider who did find an audience in her lifetime, and has cited Converse as a late influence.

She reminds me most of Angel Olsen—Pitchfork drew the comparison on a review of her album Halfway Home, in 2011. Unsurprisingly, Olsen is a fan, as are Greta Kline of Frankie Cosmos, Jeff Tweedy, and Karen O. It makes sense: All these artists make music about the intimacy of loneliness, about how strange and sad but also remarkable it is to be alive. As for me, when I listen to these songs, all I can think about is the place where I first heard them. I have my own inventory of loneliness that I associate with Converse. I think it was a friend's boyfriend who told me about her music first. At the edge of my adolescence, away from home for the first time, at college in flat-as-a-board Ohio. Soybean fields and these hugely dramatic sunsets. How I was cold and wearing a denim jacket covered in patches. And how now, when I think about it, this psychogeography of my own must not have been too different from Converse's in her last days, before she disappeared.

Fundamentally, you can't be a happy person and write a song like “We Lived Alone.” You can find the world infinitely fascinating and vast, but you can't be happy. Converse wasn't happy. In her final days in Ann Arbor, she was almost catatonic. She was entering her fifties. Her life had not gone as planned. So one day she sat down at her typewriter and wrote a letter. “This is the thin hard sublayer under all the parting messages I'm likely to have sent,” she writes, “Let me go, let me be if I can, let me not be if I can't.” She got her wish. When I say that Converse disappeared, I really mean it. Deitch's decision to play his Converse tape on WNYC in 2004 was really the first time anyone had heard from her in any capacity in over a quarter century.

If Converse were here today, she would be nearly 101 years old. But if you listen to How Sad, How Lovely, there she is. Completely and totally alive. Laughing and breathing and fucking up by starting a song in the wrong key. It's all there, unedited and totally perfect. Maybe she did OK when she left Ann Arbor and drove to God knows where. Maybe it went exactly the way I pictured it in my head, where she's driving and it gets so beautiful and so vast. Exactly the way she sang it in “We Lived Alone.” So in the end, she really was as happy as a lark.

	President Donald Trump said Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) should cancel the Senate's summer break and long weekends in order to confirm Trump's nominees, which include some controversial picks, more quickly in a Truth Social post Saturday. 


	“Hopefully the very talented John Thune, fresh off our many victories over the past two weeks and, indeed, 6 months, will cancel August recess (and long weekends!), in order to get my incredible nominees confirmed,” Trump wrote. “We need them badly!!!”


	The Senate is expected to go on recess from Aug. 4 to Sept. 1. It is one of 14 breaks or long weekends on the 2025 calendar. Their most recent break was June 30 to July 4, and then there is another break toward the end of September. Even when the Senate is in session, lawmakers are generally only in their Capitol Hill offices a few days a week, with ample time to travel back home. 


	Senators are scheduled to vote on six nominations on Monday, including Bradley Hansell for under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, and John Hurley for under secretary for terrorism and financial crimes. The Senate is also slated for a major vote on a funding bill.

	The Senate could soon vote on Emil Bove, a controversial nominee to become a judge on a federal appeals court. He served as one of Trump's personal lawyers before taking a role at the Justice Department. 


	A whistleblower said in June that Bove told lawyers at the Justice Department they “would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you' and ignore any such court order” that would block Trump from sending immigrants to prison in El Salvador. 

	











	The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced his nomination earlier this week, prompting Democrats to walk out. 


	“I have respect for you Mr. Chairman, but this is outrageous, this is unacceptable, this is wrong,” said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). “This is an abuse of power. It is an undermining of the wellbeing and the integrity of this Senate.”

	More than 75 former judges asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject Bove's nomination.


	“Mr. Bove's egregious record of mistreating law enforcement officers, abusing power, and disregarding the law itself disqualifies him for this position,” the group wrote.


	Another controversial nominee is former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, who is up for the role of U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C. Trump's first choice for the position was Republican lawyer Ed Martin, but he dropped the bid amid opposition. 


	The Senate Judiciary Committee also voted to advance Pirro's nomination. 


	Brian Christine, Trump's nominee for assistant health and human services secretary, is an Alabama urologist who said the issue of teen pregnancy should be left to “the purview of the parents.”


	He also said that “society works best when men and women are fulfilling their roles, when they are doing what they're supposed to do, raising children and propagating the species.”

	“I wanted a Superman who could be beaten,” Superman writer/director and DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn told Rolling Stone before the release of his film. David Corenswet's Kal-El does take more than his share of punches in the film, but he turns it around in the end — and the movie itself is flying to its own triumphs at the box office. “Those weekday numbers have been incredible,” Gunn says.


	Just after a press tour that took him around the world, Gunn joined Rolling Stone by Zoom for a follow-up to his recent Rolling Stone Interview. It was a spoilers-and-all conversation that digs into the film's plot twists, the future of the DCU, and more. (Again, spoilers ahead: If you haven't seen Superman yet, click away.)


So the point of the movie, in some ways, is Superman's “maybe that's the real punk rock”  line. Yeah! I do think that's the point of the movie.


And I was thinking that in casting David, one of the main things you needed was someone who could get a line like that across.Yeah. 












Tell me about writing that scene, which of course also takes place with the Justice Gang battling the “dimensional imp” in the background. I liked the idea of doing something where we showed the magic of this world being treated as ordinary. And in some ways it's not dissimilar from the beginning of Guardians 2, where we're focused on baby Groot dancing when there's this whole other thing going on behind him — but done with romance instead of poppy fun in that respect. It didn't change very much in the writing of it. It came out pretty clearly. The punk-rock thing was in the very first draft. I don't remember if I thought of that line before I wrote the scene or not. I'm going to guess that, yeah, I probably did, but I can't remember for sure. I will also give a shout-out to John Murphy's score in the scene, which is incredibly helpful for setting the tone.

	











By the way, would you want people to think that the imp might be the comic book character Mr. Mxyzptlk, who fits that description?Oh, no. He's just a stupid basic imp. He's nowhere near as powerful as Mr. Mxyzptlk.

And then of course the punk-rock line ties in with a song I've been hearing a lot now on TikTok, the Teddybears' “Punkrocker,” featuring Iggy Pop. How did that come into the picture for the ending?It just came up on my Spotify through my algorithm. I didn't know the song. And it just stuck with me. It's funny because one of my director friends, who I showed the movie to in an earlier cut for notes, was Jason Reitman. And Jason is like, “Oh, that's one of my favorite songs in the world. I've always wanted to use that in a movie.” And so when I wrote that line, I think I thought back to that song and knew that would really work well. And I just liked how the ending juggled all these different pieces of the movie in a way where we showed that the real punk rock was him, his dad, all the way to the shot of the dad making the baby fly. I'm getting touched now, just bringing it up. He flies because of his parents.


And then you have the mention of this fictional pop-punk band the Mighty Crabjoys, which spawns the poster in Clark's childhood room and the song that you co-wrote for the end credits. How does a thing like that evolve?When I was writing the scene of her looking around in his room, it was initially more just about the childhood of it all. The moment for me in that scene that's the most potent is actually not the poster. It's her seeing his parents being so sweet to him. And for me, that's a moment in which I think we see Lois understands who he is and maybe even falls in love with him.Yeah, that's definitely how Rachel Brosnahan plays it.I think there's still a part of it that is still part of her that's skeptical about who he is and his intentions, and when she sees that, she understands why he is the deep, loving soul that he is, and it's all completely honest.

	When I was first writing it, I was like, “What would he have in there?” I said, “I guess he would have a Mighty Crabjoys poster.” So I put that up, and then in the script it said she stops and looks at it and smiles. But the song at the end was completely not planned. At one point I said to [DC Studios co-CEO] Peter [Safran], maybe we should just do a Mighty Crabjoys song, and I talked to my friend Eric Nally, who's the lead singer of Foxy Shazam, and I said, “Do you want to write the song with me?” And I literally wrote that song and sang it into my phone the first thing in the morning. It took five minutes and I sang it, and then Eric turned it into the fun song that it is. But on my phone there is a recording of me singing the Mighty Crabjoys, and trying to also sing the background vocals at the same time, because they were funny to me. On the poster one of the Mighty Crabjoys is my godson Mason, because he was visiting on that day and I'm like, “Hey, you want to be in this photograph?” And then also on the poster is Lou Lou Safran, who is Peter's daughter, who also sings for real. She's actually a musician.I think people want to be reassured that there's a good explanation for why Supergirl didn't tell Superman about his parents. Since she's presumably more knowledgeable about Krypton.You're assuming that everybody on Krypton is the same! And how would she know? She's younger than him, so she wouldn't know. She wouldn't know anything about his parents.


Fair enough. Did you ever think about a bigger role for her in this film? Or was it always as we see it in the final cut?Yeah, it was always that. When I took this job, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow [the graphic novel that inspired 2026's Supergirl] was, like, number one for me of the things I knew I wanted to do. Ana Nogueira just killed the script right away, and saw what I saw in how the comic could be adapted to film, where [Supergirl is] even rougher in the film than she is in the comic, I think.

	











And obviously Krypto is her companion in that graphic novel, even though he's still Superman's dog in the comic book. I presume that's where you got the idea to make Krypto Supergirl's dog?Oh yeah, that's right. That's how that came about. Yeah.


You went as far as to want to explain the glasses. Did you feel people needed to understand why there are both dogs and humanoids on Krypton?No, because I talked to a scientist one time and he said if there are higher life forms on other planets, there's a good chance that they adapted somewhat similar to us — that if there are aliens from other planets, they're probably pretty similar to us. And if that's true, then it's probably also true that there could be other kinds of animals that are similar to us. The way the genetics worked was they developed similarly. I don't know about Beppo the Super-Monkey or Comet the Super-Horse [laughs], but we'll see.I guess Comet was actually a magic transformation of an Earth creature.That's right. Comet was a centaur that was turned into a horse. Beppo, though, was actually from Krypton.Yes.The cat, Streaky, was not. Streaky the Super-Cat.


How important is the mural we see in the Hall of Justice with a bunch of old superheroes on it? Is it just a fun Easter egg or was there a lot of thought about what was put in there and the characters in there?Oh, there was a ton of thought put into it. A ton of thought.


Should people assume that we will be seeing those specific characters? Not necessarily specifically see all of them, but yes, some of them we already have in the works in different things in different ways.


Have you decided whether we'll see Ultraman again or not?Maybe.


To shift to Peacemaker Season Two for a second, the trailer suggests a multiverse plot, which has made some fans assume you're going to directly address his shift from the prior DC film universe, the DCEU, to the current one, the DCU. But that seems to go against what you previously said, which is it will be a much more natural flow.That's true. Yes. People are realizing that Peacemaker Season Two is about two dimensions, and that's really the core of the show. But it's not as if one of these is old DCEU and one's DCU. That's dealt with in a different way, very upfront in a season where most everything in Season One is canon and some things are not. And in fact, I did a podcast with [actors] Steve Agee and Jen Holland. And we did every episode of Peacemaker, and in those episodes, I talk about what's canon and what's not. I basically chip off little things from Peacemaker Season One that aren't canon, like Aquaman. But most of the stuff is canon.


Did the original idea for the Jor-El and Lara twist come from your reading of the John Byrne comic run where Krypton was cold and sterile, and Clark embraced Earth over Krypton?Yeah. Listen, I read that when it came out. I definitely had that in my head. And isn't it also a little bit in Birthright, too? So I did have the comic background excuse to do it.


Even among people who love the movie, there are some who also have enough of a lingering affection for Krypton and the idea of a benign Jor-El and Lara that they're hoping that will somehow get retconned or revealed as a double-secret trick or something.They're shit out of luck!The problem is, fundamentally, that would undo the entire emotional arc of the movie, right? That's right. That's the whole point of the movie, that Superman thinks he is doing something because it is his destiny and his Kryptonian parents have set him out to do this thing, and along the way he discovers through the love of the people who are actually his parents that he's doing these things not because of someone else, but because of himself. It's like taking accountability in the deepest way possible that his morality is not based on some figure outside of himself, but on his own choices. I think it's really beautiful in that way, and I'm not gonna change that. 

	











	And  I don't really even think of Jor-El and Lara as being totally evil. They just have this mindset that humans are less than what they are. We're sea turtles to them. They're just trying to keep the Kryptonian genes alive.


People are calling the movie “hopecore.” And it did remind me of what George Lucas set out to do with the original Star Wars — he wanted to make something positive in the world for kids. And it does feel like you came into this with the same kind of idea.One thousand percent. Like, I had a dinner with the cast the night before we started shooting, and that's exactly what I said. That's what's driven me with this movie the whole time, is making something about kindness. It is about kindness and goodness more than hope to me. It's about being loved more than about hope. Hope is something outside of ourselves. We have this belief that maybe something will change in our lives. It almost denigrates the present moment, hope. And it's not about that. It's about being loving, being kind, and how that compassion is really the answer to everything. That's a basic human need.


I felt like the squirrel-rescuing moment was actually really key to the film.Yeah, although it was probably the second- or third-most hotly debated moment in the movie. Because we showed it to test audiences and some people did not like the squirrel. They're like, “Why the fuck is he saving a squirrel? Why is he taking time out, saving a squirrel?” There was a cut where I cut it out and I'm like, “I really miss the squirrel. He's gotta save the squirrel.” In addition, there were also some geographic problems with where he ended up if I didn't have him fly over with the squirrel. So I put the squirrel back in despite the protestations of some of my people on my crew.


I was surprised that some people thought the movie was too fast-paced. And I wonder if it's because people have gotten too used to the rhythms of television and to movies cut to the rhythms of television. So I'm curious what you were thinking as far as pacing and energy with this movie.When you test movies, almost always, especially in the early test screenings, one of the main questions they ask is, “Is it too slow? Is it too fast? Is it just right?” And my movies have always had an overabundance of “too fast” compared to “too slow.” Because I'm not indulgent. I just don't give a shit about my little precious moments that are so important to me in making a movie. I want to create something that's as streamlined as possible, and if that means I go too fast, sometimes I do. And so it really is about pulling back. 


I felt like the movie was meant to replicate the experience of picking up an issue of a comic book — and not the first issue.We've created this world, and in that world, we're picking out a certain place and a certain time. But in the DCU, we can pick out any place in any time. I wanted it to be like a comic book. I wanted it to be like what I experienced as a kid opening up a comic book, and there's his friends and they're experiencing all this stuff. Which is something I honestly pretty much ran away from in the Guardians movies. I didn't want it to be like a comic. I ran away from comic-book-y stuff.And the movie that you're writing now is, what — a semi-, not-exactly sequel to Superman? Can you clarify?[Laughs.] I mean, it follows Superman. What am I gonna say? I don't know what to say.


That's the quote on this subject? That's what you're going with?Yeah!

	











But when you see the reaction to this movie, does it inevitably shape what you do next? Or is that something you have to fight, letting the reaction shape it, if you see what I'm saying.I do totally see what you're saying. Yes. I think people like Superman because it's unexpected in certain respects, and I think that what we do next is gonna be unexpected. I just follow that. Listen, do I notice that people love Mr. Terrific and they love Krypto? Yes. I notice those things.


People who've read the Woman of Tomorrow graphic novel might have reason to be concerned about Krypto in Supergirl. You cut a scene where Ultraman punches Krypto because it upset audiences. If he can't be punched in this movie, how do you have a scarier thing happen to him in a Supergirl movie?Remember, this is a different movie than Supergirl. Supergirl is a way more rock & roll film. It's a little bit rougher, in certain ways. She's a tougher character. She's not Superman at all. And so it's not the same. This movie really is for everybody. And so is Supergirl, but it's a little bit edgier in some ways than this film. Mind you,I've seen all the dailies, but I haven't seen the cut. I see it next week, I think. So I'm very excited about that.


The tone of this movie is very much a Superman where the 31th-century team the Legion of Super-Heroes could exist. What are your thoughts about that for the DCU?I've thought about it. I'm not a time-travel person. I like science fiction, but time travel's a rough one for me. I am not into that. I'm not really into teleportation [either]. I have weird things that just aren't for me. Now, you can say that the pocket universe is teleportation, but I don't think of it as that. I think of it as traveling from one point in dimensional space to another as opposed to teleporting, which I think of as the person dying and being recreated.


There seems to be a thing where superhero movies, including Superman, maybe are not connecting the same way in international markets that they are domestically. Is there anything to be done about that? Is it just a fact of life now? How do you see that?We're definitely performing better domestically than we are internationally, but internationally is also rising and having really good weekday numbers in the same way we are. So obviously the word of mouth is very positive both here and everywhere else. Which is the thing that we needed to do the most. At the same time, there are certain countries in which it's really performing well. Brazil and the U.K.  

	











	Superman is not a known commodity in some places. He is not a big known superhero in some places like Batman is. That affects things. And it also affects things that we have a certain amount of anti-American sentiment around the world right now. It isn't really helping us. So I think it's just a matter of letting something grow. But again, for us, everything's been a total win. Having the movie come out and be something that has been embraced by people everywhere — this is just the seed of the tree that Peter and I have been watering for the past three years. So to be able to have it start off so positively has been incredibly overwhelming.


In the U.S., it does seem like you've reached beyond the typical superhero audience, to just normal people who just heard there's a good Superman movie, which is the kind of thing you need to do.Yeah. Kids, older people. I heard about somebody who went with a bunch of 80-year-old people the other day, and they were all applauding at points in the movie. That's really cool.They were all fans of the original Superman movie. Some of them were too old for the original Superman movie.


I can tell you there was applause at my theater in New York last night when I saw it again.I've heard that all the time. That makes me so happy. Yeah, dude.


Applause on a Wednesday night. That's what it's all about.That's gonna be the name of my biography.

There was a report that you are “fast-tracking a Wonder Woman movie.”I don't know what they mean by fast-tracking. [Laughs.] I've always had Wonder Woman as a priority. But we got the first few things started, and there's some other things that are really close to green-lighting — like there's a television show that I hope that we're gonna be green-lighting in the next few days. So now a little time has passed, and we really need Wonder Woman and we really need Batman, because they're so important to us. And so it's become a little bit more like going to everybody at DC and being like, we need to figure this out. We have good writers on Wonder Woman and we just have to make sure it's working and they have to not be somebody who's gonna take two years to write a script.


I'll let you go, but I'm looking forward to that prestige Bat-Mite TV show that you're green- lighting in a couple days.Yeah, the HBO Bat-Mite show. $150 million an episode.

	The Erie Moon Mammoths, a minor league baseball team rebranded by John Oliver and his Last Week Tonight staff, made their debut Saturday to a record-setting crowd that included Oliver in attendance.


	Back in May, during a segment about minor league baseball teams and their frequent crowd-drawing promotions, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals about why they deserved a rebrand; nearly 50 teams sent in proposals, with Oliver ultimately opting for the Erie SeaWolves, as that Pennsylvania team and Detroit Tigers affiliate played nowhere near a sea. 


	“Erie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,” Oliver said Saturday during a pregame press conference (via The Associated Press) before serving as the game's bat boy and “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” singer. 


	“There was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.”

	Just over two months later, the Erie Moon Mammoths — named after George Moon, an Erie man who discovered mammoth bones while scuba diving in nearby Lake Pleasant in 1991 — played their first game Saturday to an attendance of 7,070 people, the largest crowd in UPMC Park's history.


	George Moon was also on hand to catch Oliver's ceremonial first pitch. “It's fun. I'm enjoying it,” Moon said. “From all those years ago to today, I would never have thought anything like this would've been possible. The newspaper did something on its 30th anniversary [in 2021]. Other than that, I haven't heard much.”

	











	SeaWolves president Greg Coleman told the AP that, in the three weeks since the Moon Mammoths' rebrand was announced, the team has sold four years' worth of merchandise in their online store, and lines formed at the on-site team store.

	Despite their popularity, the Moon Mammoths will revert back to the SeaWolves for most games — this is just a minor league promotion, after all — but the Oliver-branded team will play three more times this season, Aug. 19 and Sept. 12 and 13. Moon Mammoths games are also planned for the 2026 season.


	“I love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,” Oliver said. “It felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That's a bad decision, and it's that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.”

T
HE GREATEST LOST CONCERT in American history almost never happened at all. It was Oct. 27, 1968, in Palo Alto, California. Outside of his high school, Danny Scher, a 16-year-old, bushy-haired, jazz-obsessed, self-described “weirdo,” was pacing the parking lot waiting for his hero, and music's most elusive and enigmatic genius, to show up: composer and pianist Thelonious Monk.


	To the disbelief of most everyone — including his mother and girlfriend waiting alongside him — Scher claimed to have booked the jazz legend for an afternoon gig, the modern equivalent of securing Kendrick Lamar for prom. Pulling this off at a nearly all-white school during his racially divided town's explosive Civil Rights battle — when the predominantly Black community of East Palo Alto was fighting to rename itself “Nairobi” — made it even more unlikely. But the mixed crowd in the parking lot proved how music could bring them together. “It was really the only time I ever remember seeing that many Black people,” Scher recalls. “Everyone was just there to see Monk.”

	











	During his 25 years working with famed concert promoter Bill Graham in San Francisco, Scher went on to book some of rock's most legendary shows and created the storied Shoreline Amphitheatre. But as the precocious 73-year-old with wispy gray hair and glasses tells me one afternoon in his apartment overlooking Manhattan, his ultimate — and unlikeliest — production happened before he was old enough to drive. And it carries a powerful untold story, revealed now for the first time: how the same establishment that marginalized one of music's most misunderstood virtuosos, Thelonious Monk, nearly silenced his greatest posthumous triumph.

	If it hadn't been for the high school custodian who taped Monk's show, it would have been lost forever. When the long-lost recording finally came out five years ago, it earned rave reviews (Rolling Stone picked the “remarkable show” as a top-10 reissue of 2020), shot to the top of the Billboard jazz charts, and seemed a shoo-in for a Grammy. But the battle behind the scenes went deeper than anyone knew. “Record companies are still taking advantage of musicians,” Scher says. Or, as Monk's 75-year-old son, drummer T.S. Monk, puts it, “They fucked him over.”

	But thanks to a dusty reel-to-reel tape, a teenage dream, and a family's fight for justice, Monk's music — and legacy — won in the end. And it all started the moment Monk arrived for the gig that afternoon long ago. With great relief, Scher watched as his big brother, Les, pulled up in their parents' car with Monk and the band. Larry Gales' double bass was sticking out the window. Monk looked sharp as ever in his dark suit, a white collared shirt, a checkered newsboy cap, and shades. It was time for this show to begin.


	ONE OTHER TIME THELONIOUS MONK had played a high school was to go to bat for T.S. It happened a few years earlier at the fancy boarding school in Connecticut where the musician had sent him. Monk didn't want his son, as one of the few Black kids on campus, getting hassled.


	One day, shortly after being hailed on the cover of Time, Monk showed up at the school in his limo and told his son, “‘Look, I'm gonna play a concert for the fucking school. They're never gonna fucking throw you out,'” T.S. says. Soon after, when T.S. showed up to school in an Afro, they made him cut it and suspended him. “But they didn't throw me out!” T.S. recalls with a laugh. We're talking in his bustling home in New Jersey, where his family has convened for lunch. T.S., bald with a gold earring and gray goatee, slaps the table in approval of his dad's deft moves. He says his father “knew the game!”


	By the time of the “Paly High” show in 1968, Monk had been on top of the jazz game for more than 20 years. Since his breakthrough debut, The Genius of Modern Music Vol. 1, his cubist compositions and percussive piano had garnered international acclaim. “There is hardly a jazz musician playing who is not in some way indebted to him,” as Time wrote. Musician, composer, and die-hard fan Jon Batiste considers Monk decades ahead of his time. “It's like somebody saying, ‘I'm going to take an engine from the 1930s and I'm going to do stuff to it that in 2025 is still considered state of the art,'” he tells me. “That's the type of artistic mind that is in the 0.1 percent of humanity.”

	But the “mad genius,” as Monk was often called, much to his chagrin, had a method behind him. Despite his off-kilter style, T.S. recalls, “he was very, very methodical. He really did his fucking work.” Few understood the grind behind the artistic brilliance: the obsessive repetition, the sleepless nights, the meticulous labor behind even a single bar of music. “I remember him going over this four-measure phrase all day and all night for weeks,” T.S. recalls. At the time, it sounded like nonsense to the boy. “I remember saying to myself, ‘What the hell is he writing?'” T.S. says. “‘This is going nowhere.'” But the bars became “Oska T.,” one of his standout tunes.


	Even Monk's theatricality was deliberate. He had handkerchiefs custom-made, four feet wide, that he'd stuff into his suit pocket and pull out halfway through a show like a magician. When he'd stand beside his piano and start spinning in circles, it wasn't some strange mania as some suspected. He was dancing, doing a series of moves rooted in African dance steps passed down from his family in North Carolina.


	His exaggerated movements at the piano — stabbing the keys and shuffling his feet — weren't bizarre quirks. They came from church. Monk had spent years as a boy playing at Pentecostal revivals, where people spoke in tongues and collapsed onstage. His disjointed, dissonant rhythms were his attempt to accompany the chaos — like providing a real-time soundtrack to a strange silent movie. His dancing feet came from playing the organ as a child and working the pedals, a rhythm he never lost. He played his favorite game, pool, like he played music: precise, propulsive, and without mercy. T.S. never won a single game. Neither did John Coltrane, who once lost 59 out of 60 ping-pong matches in a single night.


	But the same brilliance that elevated him isolated him. Monk's sensitivity ran deep, even if the world mistook it for madness. He had an unusually hard time with death — so hard, he couldn't bring himself to attend his own mother's funeral. The deaths of Coltrane and Bud Powell devastated him. He was becoming more and more silent. One night, T.S. found his father standing by the kitchen sink staring blankly at the ceiling. “He seemed like he was in another world,” T.S. recalls. “I didn't know what the fuck was going on. I was terrified.”


	Monk, the artist Coltrane had called “a musical architect of the highest order,” was struggling to keep his mind together. “Sometimes he doesn't know exactly what he's saying,” his wife Nellie told T.S. and his younger sister, Barbara, one day. “Sometimes he may not necessarily look like he recognizes you. We have to protect him. We have to look out for him, because if we don't, nobody else will.”

	











	“I got it all of a sudden,” T.S. recalls. “I realized that my mother was saying that Dad needs us and so don't take it to heart when he goes off the deep end.”


	The family didn't know at the time that Monk was suffering from undiagnosed bipolar disorder, which could have been eased with proper treatment. But they faced an impossible obstacle. “We're talking about America,” as T.S. puts it. “Mental illness among African Americans was not a priority.” One hospital wanted to give him shock treatment, until a friend intervened. Doctors overmedicated him on heavy sedatives such as Thorazine, dulling his faculties even further. The family feared what might come if they reached out again. “Their answer was lock him up, put him in a fucking straitjacket and sit his ass down,” T.S. says.


	As Monk's silent episodes mounted, so did his financial strains. With musical tastes changing, Monk's records hadn't been selling like they used to, and he had fallen into debt to his label, Columbia. In a pandering attempt to make Monk hip to the hippie generation, the label staged an elaborate cover shoot with him at a piano by a tied-up Nazi, bottles of wine, and what appeared to be a pirate. “They had a Sgt. Pepper's kind of outfit for him to wear,” T.S. recalls. “But when he got to the set for that, he basically said, ‘Fuck that. I got my Brooks Brothers shit. What the fuck y'all talking about?'” He posed in his own anachronous suit on the cover, a cigarette dangling from his lip.


	But Monk's family doesn't think he accepted Scher's invite for the money or the marketing. It was something simpler. “He had a soft spot,” T.S. says. “I wasn't surprised he agreed to play a concert for a kid.”


	FOR AS LONG AS DANNY SCHER could remember, Palo Alto had been divided. On the west side of Highway 101 was Palo Alto proper, leafy home to Stanford University, the early nerds of Silicon Valley, and largely white. On the east side of the 101 was East Palo Alto, which was predominately Black. The two sides seldom mixed. As Scher recalls, “People in Palo Alto did not go to East Palo Alto.” But from a young age, Scher refused to be one of them. When the white and Black high schools swapped students for two weeks to foster community, he volunteered to be in the program. “I was in the minority,” he said. “It was fine.”


	Best of all, there were more jazz fans in East Palo Alto like him. Scher had been listening to the music since his brother Les, a saxophone player, turned him on to it. Monk and Duke Ellington were his favorites. “It just spoke to me,” he says. “It was very accessible, but a little odd.” He adds, “I was a little off too.” While his classmates were listening to the Dead and the Stones, Scher was a jazzy percussionist in the marching band. At 15, he hitchhiked to the Monterey Jazz Festival, where he was among the only white kids. Too young to get into jazz clubs, he'd call them in advance and pretend to be a booking manager to get comped. “That way,” he says, “no one's ever going to ask for your ID.”

	











	One of six boys expected to follow his father into law practice, Scher chose music instead — despite his dad's warning: “There's no money in music. Go sell shoes.” After getting elected his high school's “commissioner of social activities,” Scher wanted to book more than just homecoming dances and teacher talent shows, he wanted to book Monk. So the wannabe Bill Graham hatched a plan.


	Monk was playing a residency at the Jazz Workshop, a club in San Francisco. The city was only 35 miles away. Maybe, Scher thought, Monk would be willing to come down for a Sunday-afternoon show. After tracking down the number of Monk's manager, Harry Colomby, and calling him with the outrageous offer, he got an even more surprising response: Monk was in. Scher was duly mind-blown. But now he faced a new challenge, pulling off the show.


	Using his student-activities funds and selling ads in the program to raise $500, Scher booked the gig for Sunday, Oct. 27, 1968. His principal signed the contract. But the question remained: Why would one of music's most acclaimed and elusive virtuosos take a high school gig from this kid at all?


	The kid promoting the Monk show, nonetheless, was having an unexpectedly hard time selling tickets. Despite Scher's booking, few people believed that the world's greatest jazz artist was really coming to town. To get the word out, Scher stuffed his newspaper-boy bag with rolled-up posters, and pedaled across Highway 101 to where he knew there were plenty of Monk fans like him: East Palo Alto.


	It was a busy week for postering. After the killing of Martin Luther King Jr. that spring, local leaders and activists, inspired by the Black Power and Pan-African movements of the time, moved to rename their town after Kenya's capital, Nairobi. With the vote scheduled for Nov. 5, the week after the Monk show, supporters and detractors had been plastering the area with flyers too. Tensions were high. Scher recalls a neighborhood cop seeing him taping up a poster. The cop warned him: “Hey, white boy, this isn't a safe place for you. You're going to get in trouble putting up posters.” Scher told him, “I'm going to be in bigger trouble if the show doesn't do well.”


	SCHER'S MOVE PAID OFF. With Black and white kids buying up the tickets, the show sold out. Two days before the gig, Scher called the jazz club where Monk was playing to go over details with his manager — only to hear Monk himself pick up the phone instead. There was just one thing more shocking than talking to his hero for the first time — realizing Monk didn't know about the gig at all. As he told this kid on the phone, “What are you talking about?”

	











	Scher's heart raced. He did his best to coolly fill in Monk, who'd either not been told about the gig by his manager or lost track. “How am I going to get there?” the piano great replied. Scher didn't have the budget for a limo, but he had something better: his older brother Les, who not only turned him on to Monk in the first place but also had a license. “My brother will pick you up!” Scher assured him. Yet without having received a fully executed contract back from Monk's manager, he didn't know if Monk would really show up at all.


	After his brother pulled up with Monk and his band, Scher tried to play it cool. “I realized from my very first show, when I'm producing a concert, it's not to be their friends,” he says.


	He asked Monk, “You hungry?”


	“I'm hungry,” Monk replied.


	Scher dispatched his mom to go across the street for food. With no greenroom, Monk and the band settled in off the stage. Scher checked the school's piano. One of the custodians, a Black man in his thirties, knew how to tune it and offered to set it up. A fan himself, he just wanted one thing in return. “If I tune the piano,” he said, “can I record the concert?” In all of Scher's meticulous planning, he hadn't thought about recording the show. But the custodian had access to a reel-to-reel tape recorder, and knew how to operate it, too. “Yeah, OK,” Scher told him.


	“I'll give you the tape when it's over,” the custodian promised.


	From the moment Monk and his band walked onstage, this wasn't like any gig before. T.S. Monk imagines his father would have been inspired by the mixed crowd and their placards for Nairobi. “He was always very aware of Civil Rights,” he says. “So I could see why that would be important to him.” Despite his own challenges, Monk didn't just show up — he unleashed an unusually incendiary and explosive 47-minute set, from the opening shot of “Ruby, My Dear,” to the last stab of “I Love You Sweetheart of All of My Dreams.” Scher could only stand and watch in awe. “Everyone was thrilled,” he says. Even better, the young promoter felt he'd done his job. “The sound was good, the lights were good,” he recalls. “And the piano was tuned.”


	Monk thanked the crowd, and said his only other words of the night: “We have another show to do.” Scher helped the band off the stage and make its way to his parents' car. Monk seemed to have a good time, and Scher allowed himself one moment to be a fan: asking his idol to sign the night's program. Monk wasn't fond of autographs. “I don't like to carry a pen on me,” he once said, “because somebody will say ‘Sign an autograph.'” But he made an exception for this bushy-haired kid. Then, just as magically as he arrived, he piled back into the car with the band, and with the bass sticking out a window, headed back to San Francisco.

	











	Scher stood there watching the car fade like a dream, clutching his autographed program. Though the vote to rename East Palo Alto as Nairobi was lost the following week, Monk's music had brought the town together. And Scher had the proof: the Ampex reel-to-reel tape the custodian had made of the show, handed over to Scher as promised. The 16-year-old went home and put it in a cardboard box. It would be 50 years before he heard it again.


	DESPITE HIS FATHER'S WARNINGS, Scher proved he could be happier, and more successful, promoting concerts than selling shoes. He followed up the Monk gig with another momentous feat: booking Duke Ellington to play his school. He ended up befriending the great composer and becoming his driver whenever he was in town. After studying music at Stanford, Scher hustled the biggest gig of all: working for the greatest booker in town himself, Bill Graham. Though Scher never again saw Monk, who died of a stroke in 1982 at age 64, he cherished the memories — the autographed program and a copy of the show's original poster. “This poster was always in my office,” he says.


	But he'd never heard the custodian's tape. The old reel-to-reel had been sitting in a box packed away until friends urged him to burn it onto a CD. When Scher popped it into his stereo, it was the first time he'd heard it since he was that bushy-haired 16-year-old listening from backstage. The custodian's raw tape captured Monk's performance in all its wonderful imperfections: the squeak of the piano bench as he shifted in his seat, the scratchy tap of his shoes swiping the piano pedals below. “It was really good,” Scher says. It had to come out.


	Though Scher had never been in touch with Monk's family, he figured they'd be as excited as him. But this time when he called, the Monk on the other end wasn't so receptive. T.S. Monk was so used to hustlers pestering him about dubious Monk recordings that he gave Scher his usual response. “I said, ‘I don't know who the fuck y'all are,'” he recalls with a laugh, “and we ain't releasing nothing.”


	When Scher brought the CD to T.S. Monk's house to let him hear it, he watched closely as the son listened closely to the man he knew so well — as a musician, and a dad. In Monk's later years, T.S. had backed him up as a drummer, too. After so long performing with his dad, and listening to countless live recordings, T.S. was the toughest critic of his father's work. “Most live performances suck,” he says. But from the first note, he could tell this was no ordinary gig. “My father was feeling good,” he told Scher.

	











	“How can you tell?” Scher asked.


	“Because everything's up, everything's a little faster,” he said, pointing out the urgency of his father's fingers, “and that's when he felt good.” He bobbed along as his father attacked “Don't Blame Me,” the 1932 pop standard. “He's playing the living shit out of this tune,” T.S. told Scher. “The band is rocking!” It wasn't just the performance that shook him. It was the story of the show, and how it humanized his father like nothing before. “I knew the story was as big as the record,” he recalls. “You got this 16-year-old white kid who picks up the phone and calls Thelonious Monk himself and says, ‘Mr. Monk, I want to hire you.' And Thelonious Monk says, ‘OK, kid.' I mean to me that was off the hook.” He knew his father would have wanted the world to hear it. “Hell yeah, no doubt,” T.S. says.


	With Impulse Records on board, Thelonious Monk: Live at Palo Alto was slated to come out in July 2020. Scher, T.S. Monk, and the label prepared a lavish package for the vinyl release, including copies of the original program and poster. Impulse submitted it for six Grammy nominations.


	But just as the advance raves were peaking two weeks before the release, they got a message from Monk's old sparring partner: his label. Sony, owners of Columbia, claimed the tape was contractually theirs. “They were saying that this recording was made during the period that Thelonious was on the contract to Columbia, and therefore they owned it,” T.S. Monk says. (A Sony Music spokesperson tells me, “We don't comment on confidential contractual details.”)


	This wasn't the first time the Monk estate had battled with Sony. In 2002, the estate conducted a forensic accounting of Monk's catalog and discovered it was owed hundreds of thousands of dollars from the label. A settlement was reached in 2023. But now Sony was threatening to sue if the Palo Alto concert got released. Faced with a legal battle, Impulse pulled the LP. The momentum crashed. And with no way of knowing when or if the record would get released, the hypothetical Grammy nominations went away, too.

	After searching through Monk's old paperwork, T.S. and the estate confirmed what they had known to be true: Monk's contract with Columbia had expired in 1967, a year before the Palo Alto High School show. Sony responded with another salvo: a contract extension through 1968 signed by Monk himself. But when his son eyed it 52 years later, he called bullshit. “That's not my father's signature,” he said. Scher— who had one of Monk's rare autographs on his Palo Alto program — agreed. A forensic handwriting analyst confirmed their assessment. Sony seems to have decided this was a losing battle. According to T.S., the company soon settled the matter. Thelonious Monk: Live at Palo Alto eventually came out in September 2020.

	











	Despite getting robbed of the momentum and the Grammy nominations, T.S. and Scher are happy the long-lost recording could finally be heard. “I know you think there's a bias because he's my father,” T.S. says with a smile, “but it's not because he's my father. It's because he's Monk. His music does the same thing to me as it does to everybody else.” For Scher, the legacy of the concert lives on, and so does his hero. He says, “I hear Monk every day.”

	On Friday morning, May 2, 2025, supporters of Washington Senate Bill 5375 were ushered through the massive concrete arches, and up the grand staircases of the Washington State Capitol — the veins of Alaskan Tokeen marble guiding them past oil portraits and century-old busts — to the governor's conference room on the second floor. 


	Inside, amid the dark wood paneling and gleaming seal of the state, Washington's new Governor and former Attorney General Bob Ferguson addressed the small crowd of advocates, lawmakers, and child abuse survivors who had gathered behind him. 


	“I'm a Catholic as some of you know. I'm aware of my upbringing,” he said, before adding plainly: “For me this is very clear legislation and important legislation.”


	Ferguson uncapped a blue felt-tip Paper Mate and, with the stroke of the pen, signed into law one of the most consequential child protection measures in recent memory, mandating the state's clergy — for the first time in 50 years — to report child abuse.

	











	“The room felt like it was buzzing,” recalls Sara Young, an advocate who was there that morning. She grew up one of Jehovah's Witnesses, surviving years of abuse she says congregation elders ignored. “None of us really knew what to expect, but being there felt like a weight finally lifted.”

	For supporters like Young, it closed a loophole that let clergy across denominations keep abuse in the dark. For opponents, it was an attack on religious freedom with no exception for sacred rites like confession.

	











	In that moment, Ferguson closed the door on a battle two decades in the making — and opened another. When the room cleared that morning, no one — not even Ferguson — could have predicted just how quickly the law's challengers would mobilize.


	Within 72 hours, Trump's Justice Department, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, had launched a First Amendment probe into what it called an “anti-Catholic” law.


	The Archdiocese of Seattle, along with the dioceses of Yakima and Spokane, filed a federal lawsuit — Etienne v. Ferguson — claiming the new law was a punch thrown straight at the Catholic Church; that it forces priests to choose between obeying the state or violating a core religious duty.

	Then, on June 23, the U.S. Department of Justice formally threw its weight behind the Catholic Church, filing a formal motion to intervene in the case — a request that was granted on Tuesday.


	And on Friday, Judge David G.  Estudillo issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the new law “as to the Sacrament of Confession” for the Seattle, Yakima, and Spokane dioceses, days before its July 27 effective date.


	What began as a move to close a dangerous loophole exploded into a high-stakes national fight over the limits of religious liberty: whether the First Amendment allows church doctrine to overrule secular law when the two conflict. 


	At its core, this battle turns on a crucial question the courts — and now the country — are forced to confront: Where does religious freedom end and the duty to protect children begin?


	Under Washington's new child protection law, clergy of all denominations are on the hook, just like physicians, nurses, social workers, teachers, law enforcement officers, childcare providers, and others.

	The law does not force priests to testify in court, turn over notes, or violate attorney-client privilege. What it does is narrow but consequential: If clergy learn about child abuse — even during confession — they have to notify authorities within 48 hours.


	That single requirement closes a loophole most states still leave wide open. 


	Across the U.S., child abuse reporting laws are a fragmented patchwork shaped by decades of political compromise and religious lobbying. Over the past two decades, efforts in other states — such as Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, and Wisconsin — to remove the clergy-penitent exemption have routinely stalled long before any high-profile showdown.

	











	Technically, clergy in all 50 states, D.C., and Guam are mandatory reporters of child abuse. But 33 states carve out exemptions for what is learned in confession or spiritual counseling.


	Washington now joins just six other states — including some of the most religiously conservative in the country — that take exemptions for clergy off the table completely: New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, and West Virginia.


	But even where states have laws like this on paper, enforcement is often a dead end. That's because 36 states have either their own Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRAs) or constitutional provisions requiring “strict scrutiny” for laws that burden religious practice. In those states, mandatory reporting rules that reach the confessional are nearly impossible to enforce. In much of the country, that means a priest or pastor can legally keep abuse secret if it's disclosed in a privileged setting.


	Washington has no state-level RFRA, but its constitution has at times been interpreted to demand strict scrutiny for religious freedom claims. That lack of certainty around religious exemptions — and specifically, confession — is part of what has made Washington's new law so contested. 


	For Catholics, the confessional isn't just private counseling; it's a foundational sacrament. . Behind the screen, a parishioner quietly confesses what weighs on their soul: “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.” The priest listens, counsels, prescribes a penance, and offers absolution. Known as Reconciliation, the rite is essential for spiritual life: Without it, believers cannot receive the Eucharist, the Church's central act of worship.


	In a public statement titled “Clergy: Answerable to God or the State?” Seattle Archbishop Paul D. Etienne — the lead plaintiff in the Church's lawsuit against Washington — invoked canon law, the Church's legal code, which deems the confessional seal “inviolable” and makes breaking it a crime. He warned plainly that any priest who violated it to report child abuse would face expulsion from the Church.


	Unlike abusing a child, breaking the seal triggers latae sententiae: automatic excommunication. 


	“You know, Jesus talks about protecting children at Matthew 18:6,” says Hiram Sasser, executive general counsel at First Liberty Institute, the legal group representing the Archdiocese of Seattle. He cites the verse in which Jesus warns that anyone who causes a child to stumble should have a millstone hung around their neck and be thrown into the sea. “They're not seeking the same level of exemption that lawyers are provided in the law,” he says of the Catholic Church. “If they did, I would probably not want to participate in representing them, because I think those things are important. The only exception we're seeking is just for the Sacrament of Confession.”

	











	But not so for the Trump DOJ, who are advancing a far more sweeping argument that goes for the law's jugular. 


	By filing a formal complaint, the Department of Justice is effectively teaming up with Washington's Catholic bishops to overturn the state's mandatory reporting law, in one of the most aggressive federal moves to back organized religion in recent memory. 


	“Laws that explicitly target religious practices such as the Sacrament of Confession have no place in our society,” said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's civil rights division, in a June 23 press release. 


	It's a stark divide. The bishops frame this as a limited fight to protect the sacred Catholic rite of confession. The DOJ sees something much bigger: a sweeping threat to religious liberty for everyone. While the Church asks for a surgical carveout, the feds want the whole law gone, putting all clergy back in the clear with no duty to report abuse.


	In its complaint, the DOJ argues that Washington's law unfairly singles out clergy while letting secular professions, such as therapists and lawyers, keep similar confidentiality intact.


	But that comparison only goes so far.


	Attorney–client privilege is not a blanket of secrecy granted out of deference to the profession; it's a rule designed to protect the legal system. Clients must be able to speak freely with their lawyers to ensure fair trials — an instrumental privilege serving the public interest, not the lawyer's. Psychotherapist–patient privilege, likewise, is structured to encourage patients to disclose sensitive personal information essential for effective treatment. Moreover, in most states including Washington, licensed therapists are mandatory reporters, legally required to report suspected child abuse. Both privileges are regulated by the state, enforced through licensing boards, and bound by explicit ethical rules. 


	Clergy, by contrast, are unlicensed and unregulated. Their claim to absolute confidentiality has historically existed outside any formal system of oversight, creating a space where institutional interests can override the protection of children — and where intimate knowledge of parishioners can be abused by those in power.


	Still, beyond defending the confessional seal itself, the Catholic Church claims its internal reforms place it a step ahead of the state when it comes to protecting children, so they do not need more oversight.

	











	After The Boston Globe's 2002 “Spotlight” investigation, and other explosive reporting exposed widespread sexual abuse and cover-ups, the Catholic Church was forced to confront a crisis of its own making. In response, it rolled out a slate of reforms it argues are proof of serious change. 


	The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops now maintains the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People, which includes independent audits, lay oversight boards, and national policies requiring clergy and lay staff to report suspected abuse.


	Additionally, the dioceses of Seattle, Spokane, and Yakima emphasize that priests are instructed to counsel suspected abusers or victims to come forward outside of confession, where mandated reporting can occur. They note that all three dioceses have undergone third-party audits and have supported mandatory reporting laws, provided confession is off limits, according to court documents.


	But investigations show these self-imposed safeguards have repeatedly failed to prevent continued cover-up — not just in Washington, but nationwide.


	A 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury report found more than 300 Catholic priests abused over 1,000 identifiable children in six dioceses over 70 years, with thousands more likely uncounted. The grand jury documented church leaders persuading victims not to report, pressuring law enforcement to drop investigations, and systematically reassigning accused priests to new parishes without warning communities. Among the most egregious cases were a priest raping a girl in the hospital after a tonsillectomy, another impregnating a minor and arranging her abortion, and coordinated diocesan instructions to call rape “inappropriate contact” and conceal removals as “sick leave.” The investigation revealed diocesan “secret archives” tracking abuse allegations, internal church lawyers shielding records, and tactics explicitly designed to “avoid scandal,” while senior church officials who enabled cover-ups retained their posts or advanced in rank. 


	A 2019 Associated Press investigation found more than 900 clergy across the U.S. credibly accused of child sexual abuse who were missing from diocesan and religious order disclosure lists, exposing major gaps in the Church's promised transparency nationwide.

	











	The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' internal audits reveal serious gaps. Annual compliance reviews — funded and overseen by the bishops themselves — depend heavily on diocesan self-reporting and have repeatedly flagged failures to fully implement safeguards. Survivors and advocates argue the system prioritizes restoring public credibility over real accountability, leaving secular authorities sidelined. In their landmark 2004 report, the U.S. bishops' national review board acknowledged that “in the past, secrecy has created an atmosphere that has inhibited the healing process and, in some cases, enabled sexually abusive behavior to be repeated.”


	While the Catholic Church has made efforts at reform, its track record offers a case study in the limits of institutional self-regulation, especially when the institution in question controls its own transparency, discipline, and accountability.


	It's a problem that extends well beyond Catholicism, playing out across the broader faith landscape.


Etienne v. Ferguson hinges on the argument that Washington's law imposes special burdens on Catholic clergy that do not apply equally to other religions. “Because the Catholic Church is one of the few religious organizations with a doctrine of absolute confidentiality,” the complaint asserts, Washington's law “uniquely targets and burdens Catholic priests.” 


	But central to the push for reform as Washington's new mandatory reporting law moved through the legislature was evidence of how clergy-penitent privilege had been exploited in other faith communities.


	Advocates argued that scrapping the clergy reporting exemption wasn't about picking on any one faith, but leveling the playing field — making sure every religious institution, no matter how powerful, must play by the same rules when it comes to protecting children.


	Court records show Jehovah's Witnesses — who have insisted for decades that they maintain no clergy-laity distinction — have nevertheless invoked the Catholic-rooted exemption broadly to protect internal conversations related to abuse allegations challenged in court. Not just direct confessions, but discussions with congregation elders, legal advisors, and staff at their global headquarters. 


	“Even though Jehovah's Witnesses do not apply the term ‘clergy' to elders in a religious context, the legal definition of ‘clergy' is far more inclusive,” says Jarrod Lopes, national spokesman for Jehovah's Witnesses. He notes that elders routinely share information about abuse allegations among themselves and with the denomination's headquarters, arguing that this kind of internal communication is essential. “Nothing in the Bible or the beliefs and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses prevents elders from internally sharing those details confidentially to ensure that children are protected,” he adds. 

	











	The religious organization of more than 9 million works within a structured framework of policies that guide how abuse allegations are investigated and handled within the congregation. They are largely internal, even in cases involving serious misconduct.


	A striking example comes from Caekaert v. Watchtower, a 2020 case in Montana, where elders in congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses investigated allegations of child sexual abuse, interrogated the accused, documented his confession in detail, and sent those records to the denomination's New York headquarters. Plaintiffs argued the records shouldn't be protected as confidential clergy communication because several elders were involved and the details were sent to the church's headquarters, but the court disagreed. It ruled that under Montana law, such internal handling of abuse allegations — however extensive — fell within the scope of the church's established religious practice and thus remained protected by clergy privilege. 


	The decision effectively shielded even confessions of abuse from discovery, setting a precedent where institutional secrecy could be maintained so long as it was formalized as religious protocol. The Montana case ended in a settlement, but the organization's legal strategy hasn't escaped scrutiny: Philip Brumley, a longtime general counsel for Jehovah's Witnesses, was sanctioned over $150,000 for submitting affidavits that falsely claimed the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses had no role in Montana congregations during the years when abuse occurred. A federal judge called his declarations “reckless and misleading,” finding they delayed justice in child sexual abuse cases.


	Across the country, other faiths have invoked clergy privilege to keep abuse hidden behind closed doors.


	In Arizona, the state Supreme Court let LDS bishops withhold evidence after a man who'd confessed to abusing his daughters continued for years. In California, Scientology fought court orders to release thousands of internal records, arguing that narrow clergy-penitent laws unfairly favored Catholic-style confessions over its multi-minister approach.


	What began as a limited protection for the intimacy of confession has morphed into a sprawling legal shield used to protect the pulpit, not the pews. And the more deeply religious institutions embed confidentiality into their doctrine, the stronger their legal insulation becomes, even when abuse is undisputed and dozens of individuals are involved. 

	











	This mounting evidence — how other faith communities exploited clergy-penitent privilege to circumvent reporting child abuse — is what drove Washington toward reform. 


	In 2022, Seattle investigative journalist Wilson Criscione dug into allegations of child sexual abuse within Washington State congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses. The result was an incendiary exposé for InvestigateWest that uncovered not only a decades-long pattern of child sexual abuse, but a coordinated effort to conceal it. 


	Criscione's story revealed that in cases of alleged abuse, congregation elders follow an internal playbook; standard protocol baked into the organization's internal policies that often bypasses law enforcement. 


	“When an elder in a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses becomes aware of an allegation of abuse, he has been instructed to immediately contact Watchtower's Legal Department for advice regarding the law in the state where he lives,” says Lopes, the national spokesperson for Jehovah's Witnesses. “We consider obeying the laws of the land as an extension of obeying and worshipping God.” 


	Lopes says they monitor the most current versions of all mandatory reporting laws in the United States.


	But in many cases, Criscione found, elders were explicitly instructed to withhold reports unless secular law demanded it. In Washington, there was no such mandate. Decades earlier, lawmakers had quietly removed clergy from the list of mandatory reporters, creating a legal blind spot that allowed for decades of silence.


	Criscione's reporting caught the attention of Mary Lou Dickerson, a former Democratic state representative from Seattle. Two decades earlier, she had spent years trying to bridge the gap Criscione's article exposed. 


	In 2005, Dickerson had introduced legislation that would have required clergy to report suspected child abuse. A lapsed Catholic who left the church in the mid-1960s, Dickerson holds a Master's in social work and considered herself one of the few true child advocates in the legislature at the time. 


	Still, she felt she was no match for the political muscle of the Seattle Archdiocese.


	“It felt to me like the Catholic Church was using its political power — and really strongly — to oppose that bill,” she says. “They unloaded all they could against it, and they were instrumental in its defeat.”


	Years later, her determination was reignited. Though she'd been retired from state politics for more than a decade, she picked up the phone.

	











	“She called me and said, ‘Hey, you should know, I worked on this, and I'd love to see you take it up,'” says state Sen. Noel Frame, a survivor of child sexual abuse, who now represents the same district Dickerson once did.


	What followed was a three-year legislative battle to finish what Dickerson had started, and to pull Washington — long a national outlier — into the modern era of child protection. 


	Frame now found herself, like Dickerson decades before, squared off against one of Washington's — and in fact the nation's — most urgent constitutional tests: balancing the First Amendment with the state's secular mission to safeguard its most vulnerable. 


	Following the landmark 1962 Kempe Report on battered children, states rapidly passed child abuse reporting laws, often with federal nudges. The law that took shape in Washington was updated in 1971 to mandate reporting by clergy.


	But in 1975, lawmakers quietly cut clergy from the mandatory reporter list during a special session, burying it in a larger legislative overhaul without debate or notice. Why remains a legal ghost story of a critical safeguard undone in silence, but the change held for five decades.


	When attempts were made to update this law in 2023, Washington's framework had become not just an outlier, but among the most permissive in the country — the only state to go backward from clergy being mandated reporters (in 1971) to being removed (in 1975), and then never restored. 


	On paper, the law divided lawmakers along predictable party lines. But behind closed doors, it forced unexpected reckonings, especially for those caught between political identity, religious tradition, and the duty to protect children. 


	In 2023 and 2024, the bill bounced between chambers as lawmakers fought over clergy privilege. It first passed the Senate with a confession carveout, but the House removed it after abuse survivors and advocates highlighted the risks. The Senate rejected the change. Despite repeated negotiations, the two sides couldn't agree for over a year.


	That year, lawmakers attempted a sleight-of-hand fix, drafting a “limited” privilege that protected only Catholic confession while excluding other religions, such as Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons. 


	This version of the bill gained broad bipartisan support, and even a nod of approval from the Seattle Archdiocese itself.


	In an email obtained by Rolling Stone, Jean Welch Hill, the newly appointed head of the Washington State Catholic Conference, told amendment backers the Conference “would not oppose you moving forward with your amendments,” but added a caution: “please do not reference the WSCC or Archdiocese in any public statements regarding support or opposition.”

	











	Neither the WSCC nor Hill responded to requests for comment.


	But Catholic survivors who testified in the House torched it as a carveout designed to protect the very institution that had hurt them. 


	Facing no path to Senate concurrence, the bill died in committee. 


	Meanwhile, then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson opened a probe into the Archdiocese's handling of abuse allegations, suing to enforce subpoenas for internal records — a case still on appeal.


	This year, as lawmakers pushed again to make clergy mandatory reporters, Catholic lobbyists descended on Olympia, branding the bill a direct attack on the sacred seal of confession. They deployed their heaviest hitters — including Hill, prominent priests, and a small army of church lawyers — to pressure lawmakers in both chambers.


	At times, several Republicans appeared to use their roles to echo the institutional voice of the Church itself. 


	One lawmaker, Rep. Phil Fortunato, describes himself as the de facto leader of what he calls the ‘Catholic Caucus' — an informal group of Catholic Republican legislators who, by his account, view representing the Church's interests as part of their role in public office.


	“Every week we have mass in Olympia. We set it up. My office actually coordinates it,” says Fortunato. “And one of the things that we try to do is coordinate with the Catholic Conference. I keep track of all the Catholics that are in the house, in the Senate and how we vote on those particular things.” 


	Frame corroborates this, saying Fortunato sent emails to all lawmakers he believed to be Catholic urging them to band together to stop passage of her legislation. 


	Still, the Church's stance isn't monolithic among Catholic lawmakers. Several self-identifying Catholics in the state legislature gave full-throated support for the bill. 


	The opposition was met by a formidable, diverse coalition — former Jehovah's Witnesses, current and former Catholics, abuse survivors, faith leaders, and even schoolchildren, all united in a single demand: close every loophole.


	Among them was Mary Dispenza, a former nun, lifelong Catholic, and survivor of clergy abuse. On the morning of the bill signing, she stood behind Governor Ferguson with tears in her eyes to witness a moment she'd spent years fighting for.


	“We want the best of Catholicism, which is protecting children,” Dispenza says. “Secrecy is not the best of the Catholic church. Secrecy protects perpetrators.” 

	











Dispenza was nearly 50, working in pastoral care for the Seattle Archdiocese, when a mandatory workshop on sexual misconduct triggered her first flashback: a vision of her seven-year-old self being molested by a priest in a dark auditorium in 1947. That priest, the late Rev. George Neville Rucker, went on to serve for decades and would later be accused by more than 30 children. Dispenza confronted him, and joined a civil lawsuit. But she was later fired by the Church after coming out as a lesbian in the early ‘90s. In 2014, she released a book, Split, which recounts her experiences. 


	In 2003, Rucker's charges were dropped after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling struck down California's attempt to revive old abuse cases by extending the statute of limitations. Rucker, who had been living in a home for retired priests, walked free without trial. He died in 2014.


	“This is about power, I believe. Just fighting for the sake of power,” Dispenza says. “The Catholic Church is the largest and most powerful church in the world…But children have no voice. They have no power. And I don't know where this is going to go, but I know we're prepared for a fight here. If we need to, we will fight for the children.”


	Dispenza wasn't the only one standing behind the governor that day. 


	With her was Tim Law — an attorney and lifelong member of Holy Rosary Catholic Church in Seattle, where he was baptized 75 years ago and attended grade school; a parish he still calls home today.


	“My mother and her parents were members going back to 1920. My grandparents helped build the church during the Great Depression,” Law says. “This is my community.” 


	Law is a co-founder of Ending Clergy Abuse, an international network of survivors and advocates. And for the past year, Law worked with such non-profit groups as the Clergy Accountability Project to move the needle in the Washington State legislature.


	“I'm a great believer in the faith of the Church and the gospel of Jesus, and this is my way of living out that faith,” Law says. 


	He has spent the last decade pressuring Catholic leadership to reform from within. Five years ago, he and other local Catholics sought a meeting with Seattle Archbishop Etienne, lead plaintiff now in the Catholics' suit against Washington state, to propose a kind of truth and reconciliation process; one that would open the Church's abuse files to review and help chart a path forward.

	











	“He kept saying he wanted to cooperate. Tells the public he wants to cooperate,” Law says. “But when they get together in a room, they get nothing.”


	Law's advocacy has not come without consequence. 


	Just days after the bill signing, Law says he was barred from long-held duties at his parish — a directive he claims came directly from Seattle Archbishop Etienne after parishioners circulated a photo of Law standing with the governor at the event in May. The archdiocese denies Law's claims, stating in an email that it “does not have a policy regarding lay leaders who speak publicly on controversial legislative matters.” 


	Still, advocates like Law and Dispenza won over the House, which passed the bill out of committee before it stalled in the budget process. The Senate didn't flinch, pushing it across the finish line with a decisive 64–31 vote — finally delivering the words they'd spent years fighting to hear from the Speaker of the House:


	“Having received the constitutional majority, Senate Bill 5375 is declared passed.”


	Washington stepped into this battle at a uniquely combustible political moment: one shaped by a Trump-era conservative legal movement that aggressively champions religious liberty claims in court — even as the same DOJ faces backlash for keeping the Epstein files sealed, protecting evidence tied to one of the nation's most notorious pedophiles and sex traffickers. Conservative religious influence increasingly shapes American policy debates, transforming religious liberty into a defining front in the nation's culture wars. Under Donald Trump, the federal judiciary was reshaped with dozens of conservative judges sympathetic to expansive religious freedom arguments. And this DOJ — led by Trump appointees — has shown a pattern of ideologically charged litigation on behalf of religious interests, turning even local policy fights into national constitutional battles.


	Trump — himself found liable for sexual abuse — has steered clear of criticizing the Catholic Church over its own scandals, instead casting himself as a defender of religion against government overreach. But his relationship with the religious community has not been smooth sailing. The Catholic Church has openly clashed with Trump over his hardline immigration policies. In June, two dozen bishops joined an interfaith coalition to denounce his “Big Beautiful Bill” slashing Medicaid for low-income and disabled Americans, prompting the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to issue one of its sharpest rebukes of his social agenda.

	











	Still, the Trump-era DOJ and the Catholic Church have found common cause in attacking Washington state, even if they don't agree on where the line should be drawn, forming a rare alliance against one of the first laws in decades to strip away clergy's confessional shield in child abuse cases. It has turned into a national flashpoint, a constitutional test case watched across the country, poised to redefine the boundary between church and state.


	Just weeks before Washington's new clergy reporting law is set to take effect, Pope Leo XIV issued a rare public reproof of clerical secrecy. In a message read aloud in Lima, Peru — where he spent decades as a missionary — Leo called for a culture of “active vigilance” against all forms of abuse. “This culture,” he wrote, “will only be authentic if it is born of transparent processes and sincere listening to those who have been hurt. For this, we need journalists,” according to Vatican News.


	Yet even amid papal calls for a Church rooted in transparency and active vigilance, U.S. church officials are lawyering up to defend secrecy around abuse confessions.


	The legal muscle behind the Catholics' lawsuit makes it clear this is not a local skirmish.


	In addition to First Liberty Institute and Seattle-based Crowley Law Offices, the plaintiffs are represented by WilmerHale, a global D.C. firm with a deep bench of constitutional litigators, and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has successfully argued major religious freedom cases before the Supreme Court. The composition of this legal dream team signals intent: They're engineering a challenge destined to climb the federal judiciary. 


	Jehovah's Witnesses, for their part, say they have “closely monitored Washington's clergy reporting law,” but “have made no decision yet on whether the law should be challenged,” according to spokesman Jarrod Lopes.


	But on June 16, the battlefield widened further as a coalition of Orthodox churches filed their own federal lawsuit, arguing Washington's law forces priests to choose between breaking the confessional seal or facing criminal charges. Represented by the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom — the same organization behind the law that led to the Supreme Court's 2022 decision ending the federal right to abortion — they'll seek an injunction at a July 25 hearing, just two days before the law is set to take effect.


	In announcing their lawsuit, the Orthodox Church in America echoed the language of the Catholic bishops and the DOJ, calling Washington's law “rank religious discrimination.” 

	











	Whether this second lawsuit strengthens the broader constitutional challenge, or complicates the Catholic Church's claim that it is being uniquely targeted, remains to be seen. 


	What is clear: with two active federal lawsuits and the U.S. Department of Justice now formally intervening on constitutional grounds, the ultimate audience for this battle could well be the U.S. Supreme Court. And the Roberts Court, in 2025, is not the same court that shaped modern religious liberty doctrine. Religious conservatism no longer sits at the fringe; it now occupies the commanding heights of the U.S. judiciary. 


	As of June 2025, six of the nine justices on the Supreme Court are Catholic: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Neil Gorsuch was raised Catholic but attends an Episcopal church. The remaining two — Justices Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson — are Jewish and nondenominational Protestant, respectively. 


	If challenges to the Washington law wind their way to the highest court in the land, a victory for the plaintiffs could not only invalidate Washington's law; it could constitutionalize the clergy-penitent privilege, transforming what was once a statutory exemption into a hard limit on state power. That could slam the door on similar reform efforts nationwide, blocking other states from closing similar loopholes, even in the specific context of child abuse. It could use the First Amendment as a vehicle to enshrine a system of legal exceptionalism.


	Washington Attorney General Nick Brown's office did not make officials available for comment, but affirmed by email that it “would obviously defend any legal challenge to this law.”


	But the state knows it has a fight on its hands. Brown has privately acknowledged to supporters that the legal terrain is tricky. According to someone familiar with the conversation, Brown told advocates at a private event he wished lawmakers had worked more closely with his office before passing the bill, warning that its narrow focus on clergy could make it hard to defend. 


	The future of Washington's freshly minted mandatory reporting law became even more uncertain at a July 14 hearing, just two weeks before it was set to take effect, when Judge David G. Estudillo granted the Justice Department's request to join the lawsuit. 


	Four days later, Estudillo dropped the hammer, issuing a preliminary injunction that bars the state from enforcing the requirement that Catholic clergy in the Seattle, Yakima, and Spokane dioceses report child‑abuse disclosures made during confession. That order stays any penalties or prosecutions for priests who honor the confessional seal, leaving the law inoperative for those dioceses until Etienne v.  Ferguson plays out in court. (Orthodox churches sued separately and remain subject to Washington's new law unless they secure their own injunction at a July  25 hearing.)

	











	Together, the two lawsuits, along with the DOJ's involvement, have made Washington's law a high-stakes legal test. Whether its promise of ending clergy secrecy in abuse reporting holds, or collapses under constitutional challenge, now rests with the courts.

	“Children will continue to suffer because religious leaders they trust are not reporting when children tell them they are being hurt,” says Sen. Frame. “People keep asking me, ‘What happens now?' What happens is that children who are being abused continue to be abused. Full stop. Period.”

WNBA All-Star players got straight to the point on the court ahead of their All-Star game on Saturday: “Pay Us What You Owe Us” their T-shirts read as they warmed up. The players union and league management have been in ongoing collective bargaining agreement negotiations.


	On Thursday, more than 40 players attended a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) meeting, which apparently did not land on a mutually agreeable deal getting done. Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was at the meeting.


	“We should be paid more and hopefully that's the case moving forward as the league continues to grow,” Clark said in a video posted on social platform X. “I think that's something that's probably the most important thing that we're in the room advocating about.”


	Clark, who was present at the All-Star game on Saturday, was unable to play due to a right groin injury.


	Thursday's CBA meeting was the first time the league and the players union, the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA), have met in person since December. “We were disappointed for sure,” co-WNBA All-Star captain Napheesa Collier said on Friday, via ESPN. “What they came back with was just nowhere near what we asked for or even in the same conversation.”

	











	Ahead of the game, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert offered an optimistic viewpoint contrasting the players' apparent outlook on the negotiations. “We want the same things that the players want,” Engelbert said in a Saturday press conference prior to game time, via Sportico. “We want to significantly increase their salary and benefits while balancing with our owners their ability to have a path to profitability as well as continued investment.”

	The opposing viewpoints highlight how far apart the WNBPA and league management appear to be in negotiations. The labor fight is centered on the union's call for a revamp on revenue sharing, where players would receive a bigger percentage of league revenue. Englebert has said the next pass will be “much more lucrative.” However, players have said that what has been recently proposed was far from “equitable.”


	As the WNBA grapples with labor negotiations, it has also been expanding, with three new cities being added in the next five years. With its expansion, racial attacks against players have also been growing.

The truth was out there. Maybe way out there.

Long before FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully began investigating “The X-Files” on television, an Akron schoolteacher searched for proof of unidentified flying objects.

Americo Candusso, also known as Amerigo, served for decades as chairman of the Flying Saucer Investigating Committee, an Akron group that researched UFO sightings across Northeast Ohio.

“One of these days, the truth is going to come out,” he vowed.

Ever since he could remember, he had watched the sky. He was born in Italy in 1922, emigrated as a child with his parents Remigio and Antonia Candusso, and grew up in Alliance with his little brother, Ermes.

As a kid, Candusso liked to read science fiction, which he later acknowledged “lit a spark in me.” He saw his first UFO at age 10 during recess at Alliance's Liberty Elementary School in the 1930s.

“It was a white ball of light, very brilliant, like a star,” he recalled. “It was moving.”

When he pointed out the strange object to a teacher, the unimpressed instructor ordered him back into the classroom. It wouldn't be the last time that Candusso questioned authority.

During World War II, he served as a weather observer for the U.S. Army Air Forces in North Africa, typing reports on an encryption machine. He heard pilots talking about strange encounters with unidentified aircraft that they called “foo fighters.”

The mystery deepened for him. For the rest of his life, he gathered clues.

“I guess I've just been driven by an urge to find out,” he said.

Candusso earned a bachelor's degree in history from Mount Union, and  bachelor's degrees in education and chemistry from the University of Akron. He lived in Cuyahoga Falls and taught science at Akron's Robinson School and later Harris School.

About 1956, he joined Akron's Unidentified Flying Objects Research Committee, a group formed by George Popowitch to study UFO reports. Coincidentally or not, Candusso experienced additional sightings over the next few years.

About 10:45 p.m. April 6, 1959, Candusso was driving with a date in Twinsburg when they noticed a bluish-white light in the sky near Route 91. The cigar-shaped object, which appeared to be traveling northwest 1,000 to 1,500 off the ground, suddenly circled back and briefly hovered over his car before flying away, he reported.

Around 9:30 p.m. May 27, 1959, he was driving alone in Stow when he saw two reddish-orange objects flitting in the sky about 3,000 feet up after a thunderstorm. The brick-shaped objects pulsated and seemed to interact with each other before disappearing. 

Shortly after midnight June 20, 1960, Candusso was driving at Steels Corners and Wyoga Lake roads in Stow when he saw an elongated object that appeared to be “two bands of horizontal lights, red, green and white — all sparks.” Much to the teacher's surprise, four other aerial objects emerged from the clouds and darted around before disappearing over the northern horizon.

“I've never been able to explain what I saw,” he said.

Candusso had no doubt that UFOs were real. He just didn't know what they were.

“There are a lot of theories,” he once told the Beacon Journal. “The popular one is they are interplanetary travelers. But they could come from another dimension or maybe even from our own planet. They could live in the ocean or at one of the poles and who would ever know.

“I'd like to believe they're interplanetary, but I have to be open-minded to all possibilities.”

Candusso served as a field investigator for the Mutual UFO Network, a national nonprofit group that reported sightings.

He thought the government was covering up evidence. 

“They have held back information and fooled the public,” he said. “Why is anyone's guess.”

In 1961, he and Larry Moyers formed the Flying Saucer Investigating Committee, which took a scientific approach to UFOs. The group documented aerial phenomena, interviewed witnesses, evaluated sightings, took radiation readings and issued community reports.

Local interest was keen. The club attracted 200 people to monthly meetings and mailed a newsletter, the FSIC Bulletin, to 800 households.

Candusso said that 90% of UFO sightings had some logical explanation, but it was the remaining 10% that intrigued him.

With its number listed in the Akron phone book, the club averaged about six calls a night from people claiming to see weird things in the sky.

“Most of the calls are ridiculous, but we try to run them all down,” Candusso said.

They recorded witness interviews, visited the scenes of sightings, analyzed atmospheric conditions and checked police logs. They filled hundreds of notebooks with written observations.

Candusso said that he and his colleagues routinely exposed hoaxes. Sometimes it was difficult to appear credible in a field that attracted “so many quacks and nutcases,” he said.

There were certain cases that made an impression, though.

In August 1960, four teens encountered a strange phenomenon about 3 a.m. while camping overnight at Firestone Metropolitan Park in Coventry Township. They saw a bright blue light before a bell-shaped, metallic-looking, robot-like object rose over the campsite.

The youths said it was 11 feet tall and had a square head with a black faceplate instead of features. Gradually, three similar objects appeared. The teens said they struck camp and raced home while one of the sentinels followed their car all the way to Wilbeth Road.

“To my mind, that is one of the strangest and most unexplainable stories,” Candusso said. “I hardly believe it myself, yet the boys seemed very sincere. We talked to them within 24 hours and interviewed them separately and they stuck to their story. Even the little things matched up in all the accounts. They swore it was true at the time and even years later.”

In June 1965, Carroll County farmer John Stavano was driving a tractor when he discovered a giant circle, over 50 feet in diameter, in the middle of his wheat field about 60 feet from Route 39. The ground was bare, stripped of all vegetation, as if a tornado had touched down. The wheat had exploded from the inside.

Had something landed there? At the center of the circle was a depression about 30 inches across and 5 inches deep. Soil samples revealed abnormally high levels of zinc and iron, but the earth was not scorched. Dozens of neighbors had reported hearing a sonic boom a few nights earlier. 

“The whole thing is still a mystery to us today,” Candusso said.

The most famous incident, later referenced in the Steven Spielberg movie “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” occurred April 17, 1966. 

Two Portage County sheriff's deputies reported chasing a humming “dome-shaped object as big as a house” for 86 miles along U.S. 224 from Randolph to Conway, Pennsylvania. Dale Spaur and W.L. Neff estimated the object to be 40 feet across and flying up to 800 feet off the ground. They said they drove 100 mph while trying to keep up with it.

The Air Force investigated the incident and concluded that the men had chased Venus.

“Can you believe that?” Candusso said. “These grown, professional men are going to be speeding along all the way into another state because they mistook a planet for a flying object?”

Candusso presented lectures to local groups and taught continuing education courses about UFOs at Kent State and the University of Akron.

He often investigated cases with his wife, Margaret, the club's secretary, who had worked as an artist for American Greetings in Cleveland and Saalfield Books in Akron. She, too, had witnessed a UFO — in 1949 over a trailer park in Cleveland.

The couple amassed 25 boxes of UFO materials, including photos, books, articles, tape recordings, illustrations and models. When they moved to Medina in the 1980s, they took it all with them — including the flying saucer committee. 

Club membership had dwindled over the decades. By 1989, there were only about 20 loyalists, mostly older people, attending meetings.

The group disbanded in 1990 after the Candussos announced they were moving to Arizona.

“There are no heirs,” Candusso said.

After retiring to the Southwest, the couple remained active in UFO research. 

Margaret passed away in 2008 at age 80. Americo died in 2015 at age 93. The Ohioans are buried at Holy Hope Cemetery in Tucson

Two years before his death, Candusso donated his UFO collection to the International UFO Museum & Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico. Now other scholars can pick up where he left off.

Candusso remained confident that the unidentified would be identified.

“The march of history cannot be stopped; the truth will be known,” he once noted. “Every citizen has a duty not just to obey — but to question and demand that whatever is known should be divulged; and that a great scientific effort should be mounted to prepare our earth for the great adventure, of confrontation by intelligences from other realms.”

With its number listed in the Akron phone book, the club averaged about six calls a night from people claiming to see weird things in the sky.

“Most of the calls are ridiculous, but we try to run them all down,” Candusso said.

They recorded witness interviews, visited the scenes of sightings, analyzed atmospheric conditions and checked police logs. They filled hundreds of notebooks with written observations.

Candusso said that he and his colleagues routinely exposed hoaxes. Sometimes it was difficult to appear credible in a field that attracted “so many quacks and nutcases,” he said.

There were certain cases that made an impression, though.

In August 1960, four teens encountered a strange phenomenon about 3 a.m. while camping overnight at Firestone Metropolitan Park in Coventry Township. They saw a bright blue light before a bell-shaped, metallic-looking, robot-like object rose over the campsite.

The youths said it was 11 feet tall and had a square head with a black faceplate instead of features. Gradually, three similar objects appeared. The teens said they struck camp and raced home while one of the sentinels followed their car all the way to Wilbeth Road.

“To my mind, that is one of the strangest and most unexplainable stories,” Candusso said. “I hardly believe it myself, yet the boys seemed very sincere. We talked to them within 24 hours and interviewed them separately and they stuck to their story. Even the little things matched up in all the accounts. They swore it was true at the time and even years later.”

In June 1965, Carroll County farmer John Stavano was driving a tractor when he discovered a giant circle, over 50 feet in diameter, in the middle of his wheat field about 60 feet from Route 39. The ground was bare, stripped of all vegetation, as if a tornado had touched down. The wheat had exploded from the inside.

Had something landed there? At the center of the circle was a depression about 30 inches across and 5 inches deep. Soil samples revealed abnormally high levels of zinc and iron, but the earth was not scorched. Dozens of neighbors had reported hearing a sonic boom a few nights earlier. 

“The whole thing is still a mystery to us today,” Candusso said.

The most famous incident, later referenced in the Steven Spielberg movie “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” occurred April 17, 1966. 

Two Portage County sheriff's deputies reported chasing a humming “dome-shaped object as big as a house” for 86 miles along U.S. 224 from Randolph to Conway, Pennsylvania. Dale Spaur and W.L. Neff estimated the object to be 40 feet across and flying up to 800 feet off the ground. They said they drove 100 mph while trying to keep up with it.

The Air Force investigated the incident and concluded that the men had chased Venus.

“Can you believe that?” Candusso said. “These grown, professional men are going to be speeding along all the way into another state because they mistook a planet for a flying object?”

Candusso presented lectures to local groups and taught continuing education courses about UFOs at Kent State and the University of Akron.

He often investigated cases with his wife, Margaret, the club's secretary, who had worked as an artist for American Greetings in Cleveland and Saalfield Books in Akron. She, too, had witnessed a UFO — in 1949 over a trailer park in Cleveland.

The couple amassed 25 boxes of UFO materials, including photos, books, articles, tape recordings, illustrations and models. When they moved to Medina in the 1980s, they took it all with them — including the flying saucer committee. 

Club membership had dwindled over the decades. By 1989, there were only about 20 loyalists, mostly older people, attending meetings.

The group disbanded in 1990 after the Candussos announced they were moving to Arizona.

“There are no heirs,” Candusso said.

After retiring to the Southwest, the couple remained active in UFO research. 

Margaret passed away in 2008 at age 80. Americo died in 2015 at age 93. The Ohioans are buried at Holy Hope Cemetery in Tucson

Two years before his death, Candusso donated his UFO collection to the International UFO Museum & Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico. Now other scholars can pick up where he left off.

Candusso remained confident that the unidentified would be identified.

“The march of history cannot be stopped; the truth will be known,” he once noted. “Every citizen has a duty not just to obey — but to question and demand that whatever is known should be divulged; and that a great scientific effort should be mounted to prepare our earth for the great adventure, of confrontation by intelligences from other realms.”

The Annabelle doll, a supposedly haunted relic, was found missing from paranormal investigator Dan Rivera's hotel room after his death in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, People reported.

The 54-year-old was found dead in his hotel room on July 13 after leading a sold-out ghost tour called ""Devils on the Run"" at the Soldiers National Orphanage, which featured the Annabelle doll.

The cause of death remains unknown, with autopsy results expected in eight to ten weeks. However, the authorities confirmed that Rivera's death didn't appear suspicious, and he was found alone in his hotel room. Adams County Coroner Francis Dutrow told People Friday that the doll wasn't in the room when first responders found Rivera.

The Annabelle doll is believed to be haunted and has been linked to a series of paranormal activities since the 1970s. According to the New England Society for Psychic Research's website, the doll was gifted to a student nurse. She brought it home, where she lived with her roommate in 1968.



""Almost immediately, the roommates noticed strange occurrences with the doll and they were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle,"" the organisation wrote. ""The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent.""

Ed and Lorraine Warren, renowned paranormal investigators, claimed the doll was ""demonically possessed"".

The doll also inspired the horror film franchise The Conjuring.

Conspiracy theorists have linked Rivera's death to the Annabelle doll, despite police statements that nothing unusual or suspicious was found at the scene. Some fans and followers are also speculating about the doll's curse, while others are paying tribute to Rivera's work and legacy.

In a report shared on July 16, the Pennsylvania State Police said, ""Members from PSP Gettysburg responded to a hotel in Straban Township, Adams County for a report of a deceased [man].""

""The decedent was discovered in his hotel room by workers. Nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene.""

Despite Rivera's death, the New England Society for Psychic Research plans to continue their supernatural tour, honouring Rivera's memory.

On Sunday, July 27, from 7-9 p.m., you can take part in the first paranormal investigation at Playcrafters Barn Theatre in Moline, a news release says. 

QC Haunts & History, S&S Paranormal Investigations, and Haunted Maps will lead the investigations. Proceeds will go to directly to Playcrafters.

The theater's history dates back to 1929 with a group of “wandering” actors and crew who performed anywhere they could. In 1958, Dr. William Otis gave Playcrafters the dairy barn from the Deere Experimental Farm. The barn was built in 1914. It had been sitting unused since 1933 on the Otis property. On Oct. 5, 1960, Playcrafters performed its first production, “Born Yesterday,” in its new home. 

“People hear footsteps going up and down the stairs. My husband and I have heard people talking on the stage when no one's there. We've checked around to find out who it was, but we haven't found anyone in those cases. It's just been us,” said Jacque Cohoon, Playcrafters board president. “We're very curious about what we'll find during the paranormal investigation.”

The cost of the ghost hunt is $40 per person. Recommended age is 13 and up; children under 18 must be accompanied by an adult. To purchase tickets, contact Minda here or text 309-781-7083.

Participants will have access to equipment and will be joined by experienced paranormal investigators.

“While we enjoy guiding people during these events and discovering what we can about the history of the location and those who came before us, what's most important to us is to help local businesses—especially the arts. Whether you're a believer in the supernatural or not, I think we can all agree that supporting our community is important,” said Minda Powers-Douglas of QC Haunts & History.

QC Haunts also offers ghost tours in downtown Rock Island and the Village of East Davenport. Visit here for more information.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","If You Miss Supernatural, The Perfect Replacement Is A Hit Sci-Fi Show That's Almost As Long","https://screenrant.com/x-files-perfect-supernatural-replacement-almost-as-long/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 12:25:00 GMT","

If you're still missing Supernatural, you should check out this similar show that will give you plenty to binge watch. Following brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester as they travel around the country hunting monsters, Supernatural ran for an impressive fifteen seasons on the CW.

Supernatural brilliantly combined monster-of-the-week episodes with season-long storylines, developing a complex mythology throughout its fifteen seasons. There are a lot of shows out there with elements that could appeal to Supernatural fans, but perhaps no show feels as much like Supernatural as The X-Files.

With its stories of cross-country monster hunting, Supernatural was heavily influenced by The X-Files, and even referenced the show in its pilot episode. The X-Files follows FBI Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) as they handle the cases that are too strange for the regular FBI.

The best X-Files episodes include Monster of the Week and Alien mythology episodes, making it an iconic show.

Where many of Supernatural's monsters come from folklore, The X-Files skews more paranormal, diving into conspiracy theories involving UFOs and alien abductions. Both shows blend horror, drama, and humor in fascinating ways, and both feature unforgettable characters you cannot help but fall in love with.

Several actors have appeared in both shows, including Mark Sheppard and Mitch Pileggi. A few crew members worked on both shows as well, most notably Kim Manners, who served as both a director and producer.

Several Supernatural episodes borrow ideas from episodes of The X-Files, from the more frightening stories like ""Family Remains"" (The X-Files: ""Home"") to the hilarious ones like ""Mystery Spot"" (The X-Files: ""Monday""). Like Supernatural, The X-Files combines standalone mysteries with season-long arcs, developing its own (sometimes convoluted) mythology.

Few shows run as long as Supernatural, and a sixteenth season remains a distinct possibility, but The X-Files has plenty of content to keep you busy in the meantime. The X-Files initially aired from 1993 to 2002, delivering nine seasons (and a movie) of alien shenanigans and a will-they-won't-they romance for the ages.

The X-Files season 9 is the lowest-rated out of any season of the acclaimed science fiction series so what exactly went so wrong with it?

The first X-Files movie, The X-Files: Fight the Future, premiered in theaters between seasons 5 and 6 and focused on the show's ongoing mythology. A second film, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, premiered in theaters in 2008, delivering a standalone story but ultimately ending the series on a lackluster note.

Although X-Files creator Chris Carter had plans for a third film, I Want to Believe did not perform well enough at the box office to warrant a sequel.

In 2016, Agents Mulder and Scully returned yet again for more alien adventures in a revival that lasted for two seasons on Fox network. While the mythology aspects of these seasons were met with mixed reviews, they nevertheless delivered some incredibly fun episodes that are well worth watching.

Another X-Files reboot is currently in the works from Sinners director Ryan Coogler, proving that just like Supernatural, The X-Files refuses to stay dead for long.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","10 Once-Great TV Shows That Lasted Way Too Long (& Went Downhill)","https://www.cbr.com/once-great-tv-shows-lasted-too-long-list/","Sun, 20 Jul 2025 01:00:00 GMT","

Everyone always roots for their favorite TV series to enjoy long runs, but when they do, there's always a chance that they will go downhill. Such is the case with some of the most popular series of all time, like Dexter or The Simpsons. And while there are cases of shows recovering after going downhill, like The Simpsons, more commonly, a good show turned bad is likely to only get worse the longer it goes on.

Far too often, the best TV shows will destroy their legacies by lasting far too long and failing to maintain their quality. They ruin their characters, confuse their lore, and pump out episodes endlessly without a point in sight. Not all of these series necessarily went on for a massively long time, but they all needed to end far sooner than they did.

Supernatural has become the poster child for TV series that needed to die far sooner than they did. In its early years, the urban fantasy was a fun spiritual successor to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, depicting the episodic adventures of demon hunters Sam and Dean Winchester, while also building out its interesting lore and dramatic central conflict. While the series' premise was strong enough to work initially, it did not have nearly enough fuel to keep the show going for the 15 seasons that it ended up running for.

Supernatural was originally intended to end with the conclusion of Season 5.

For 10 seasons and over 200 episodes, Supernatural is an unbearable, repetitive slog. The longest-running series to never win an Emmy, not once during its latter two-thirds, did it ever come close to being worthy of one. Not every season of Supernatural post-Season 5 is outright terrible, with some even being okay, but they're bereft of original ideas, the poor treatment of the supporting cast becomes increasingly inexcusable, and the main cast becomes downright annoying to follow.

 Nearly 20 years since it first premiered, How I Met Your Mother doesn't hold up at all, but there are still plenty of fun laughs and wholesome moments to be found in the traditional sitcom's early seasons. However, the core mystery of who Ted Mosby's future wife could be was not built to last for 9 seasons. As a result, the show becomes painfully boring and unfunny in its final seasons, and the series remains infamous for having one of the worst series finales of all time.

The ending of How I Met Your Mother Season 9 was scripted during Season 1.

How I Met Your Mother begins to get worse during Season 3, but it's Season 5 where it runs out of organic ideas and stops being funny. The switch in focus to Barney Stinson doesn't work at all, charming as Neil Patrick Harris may be, and all the time devoted to him and his romance with Robin Scherbatsky is rendered meaningless by Season 9. And, while its finale may overshadow everything else about it, Season 9 as a whole is still one of the weakest final seasons for any sitcom.

 While Dexter initially got continually worse with each season after its first outing, it blew fans away with the unmatched brilliance of Season 4. The conflict between serial killer Dexter Morgan and the even more monstrous Trinity Killer made for some of the best TV drama of the 2000s, and it seemed impossible that the show would ever be able to top itself. Sure enough, this proved to be the case, although no one could have predicted what a roller coaster of quality Dexter's final four seasons would be.

Since the airing of its finale, Dexter has received two sequel series, as well as a prequel series.

From Game of Thrones to Breaking Bad to The Sopranos, some of the best TV shows to date are those with mature audiences in mind.

Dexter Season 5 isn't bad, but it marks the biggest drop in quality in the series yet, and it kills all the momentum from Season 4. Season 6, meanwhile, is a boring, nonsensical mess that actively insults its audience's intelligence. Seasons 7 and 8 are better than Season 6, because they had to be, but still neither comes close to matching the quality of Dexter's earlier years.

Suits is a series about Mike Ross, a fake lawyer at a prestigious law firm who constantly works to make sure no one finds out he never actually went to law school. While not the series' only strong point, it was very much carried by the endlessly entertaining dynamic between Mike and his smarmy but charming mentor, Harvey Specter. Despite it being well-known that this was the main draw of the show, Suits continued on even after Mike left the series. 

Both of Suits' spin-off series, Pearson and Suits L.A., were canceled after only a single season.

Throughout its first five seasons, Suits burns through its premise as every major character learns Mike's secret one-by-one, before he's openly exposed as a fraud. The end of Season 5 is the series' high point, and Season 6 could have made for an effective epilogue, as it shows what Mike does next after losing everything. Instead, Suits trucked on for three more years, with Season 7 being underwhelming, Season 8 being a complete disaster due to Mike's total absence from it, and Season 9 only being marginally better, even with Mike's return.

Killing Eve may have only lasted four seasons, but the damage done by its final season is still worse than nearly any other in television history. For its first three seasons, its quality wasn't exactly consistent, but the series never came close to being bad, and the steamy drama between MI5 agent Eve Polastri and professional assassin Villanelle. Regardless of Season 3's many flaws, the two leads remained immensely deep and compelling, and there remained a strong desire among fans to receive pay-off for all the romantic and sexual tension between them.

Season 4 of Killing Eve is the only season with a rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Season 4 is so horrendously offensive that it defeats the point of even bothering with the first three seasons. What was previously hailed as one of the best LGBTQ+ dramas on television turns actively homophobic, leading to one of the worst endings in TV history. It's hard to say when Killing Eve should have ended, but Season 4 never should have been allowed to exist.

The first season of Elite is nothing short of iconic. Every member of the ensemble cast is well-developed, every episode is filled with memorable scenes, and the core mystery surrounding the murder of Marina Nunier is flawlessly constructed. Seasons 2 and 3 failed to be quite as legendary, but were still exceptional. The same cannot be said for the subsequent five seasons.

Along with its eight seasons, seven special Elite ""Shorts"" were released.

With so many streaming services for viewers to binge-watch TV shows like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad, the choices can be overwhelming.

With a change of writers and the loss of most of its best characters, Elite loses everything that made it great, beginning with Season 4. The show turns its focus away from interesting stories in favor of finding ways to include as many sex scenes as possible, and the stories it does tell range from boring to offensive. Season 8 is decent, but it is absolutely not worth sitting through Seasons 4-7 in order to get there.

You's first season was a competent thriller, but not one anyone would expect to lead to four more seasons, with it largely being carried by Penn Badgley's brilliant performance as the enigmatic and despicable Joe Goldberg. Season 2 is where the series became something truly special, thanks to its subversion of Season 1's formula and the introduction of the show's best character, Love Quinn. After peaking, however, You just continued to get worse with each of its following three seasons.

You began life as a Lifetime series, before finding a permanent home on Netflix, beginning with Season 2.

Season 3 is where Joe becomes insufferable, not just as a person, but as a protagonist, and the plot is the least interesting yet. Seasons 4 and 5, meanwhile, are complete nonsense that lack any of the atmosphere or effective twists of Seasons 1 and 2, and that lose track of who Joe is as a character. By the time Season 5 ends, Badgley's acting is far from enough to make the show bearable.

 With its first two parts, Money Heist tells a fantastic, complete story that's enjoyable from start to finish and that does justice to all its main characters. The show was about a group of masters in their field coming together to perform the ultimate robbery, as they grow as individuals and together as a found family, and it executed this premise to near perfection. But, due to Money Heist's popularity, it received an additional three parts that ruined the flawless ending of the first two.

Money Heist received a Korean remake in 2022.

The final three parts of Money Heist ask, ""what if everything that went right from the robbers during the first heist went wrong?"" and the result is genuinely compelling drama, with some great new characters being added to the mix as well. The problem is that they pointlessly rip away the happy endings of several fan-favorite characters, killing several of them off in cruel, borderline sexist ways, and it does this while feeling like it lacks any real point. Every season of Money Heist is perfectly watchable, but its latter three are noticeably weaker, and they retroactively make the first two parts worse.

No series with so much initial promise has ever wound up being as bad as Sliders. For its first two seasons, Sliders is an inconsistent series, but one with a lot of heart and passion behind it, that chronicles the adventures of a genius college student, his best friend, his professor, and a washed-up musician as they travel between different versions of Earth, where history played out differently, in an effort to get back to their own home. At its best, Sliders offers some of the greatest sci-fi stories of its era, but from Season 3 onwards, episodes of that level become few and far between.

Sliders was canceled by Fox after Season 3, but survived by moving to the Sci-Fi Channel.

From Scrubs to Futurama and everything in between, some TV show episodes have ripped audiences' heartstrings out.

Season 3 spends most of its time ripping off horror movies, and it marks the first of several instances of the series writing out its original cast members in horrible ways. Season 4 gets even worse, as the lore of the series is rewritten, and Sliders devolves into a generic and horribly executed sci-fi action series. By comparison, Season 5 is a bit better, but even it is mostly just boring, with each passing episode making a viewer question what they're even still doing here.

Gossip Girl Season 1 is one of the best and most influential seasons of television of the 21st Century. Depicting the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite, it was bold, controversial, witty, steamy, fun and, perhaps most importantly, satirical. The tragic downward spiral Gossip Girl goes on throughout its six-season run can almost entirely be attributed to it forgetting that it was mocking the millionaires and billionaires it focuses on, not taking them, their meaningless drama, and their ridiculous schemes seriously.

A Gossip Girl reboot was released on HBO Max in 2021 and ran for two seasons.

While there is fun to be had with the middle seasons of Gossip Girl, the lack of bite and self-awareness hurts the series immensely. And the longer it goes on, the less fun it gets, especially as the focus increasingly gets placed on Chuck Bass. Gossip Girl doesn't even manage to stick the landing when it comes to the mystery surrounding the identity of its eponymous blogger, with the answer being one of the few people it literally could not have been.

Follow:


            On the morning of July 4, an American marketing professor was walking towards his ex-wife's house in Athens to pick up their two young children. It should have been an unremarkable, if strained visit – the couple had apparently been disputing the terms of custody arrangements.
    


            But Przemyslaw Jeziorski never made it to the front door.
    


            In broad daylight, in this typically quiet, suburban neighborhood of Greece's capital, he was shot multiple times at close range, according to police. Jeziorski died where he fell, police said, his body riddled with gunshot wounds seen in grim photographs taken in the immediate aftermath.
    


            As eyewitnesses rushed to his aid, the masked gunman fled.
    


            The alleged perpetrator, arrested 12 days later for premeditated murder: His ex-wife's new partner. The motive, he told police – to prevent Jeziorski from taking away her children.
    


            “I did it all for (her) and our children so that we could have a normal life without problems,” he said, according to a transcript of a statement he made to police in the aftermath of his arrest.

            One of the most remarkable aspects of the case is that the statements made to police by the alleged perpetrators have been widely leaked to Greek media, including a CNN affiliate, CNN Greece. The statements, verified as authentic by a senior police source speaking to CNN, offer an insight into how the alleged murder plot was put together, why it was undertaken, and provide clues as to who may have known what, and when.  But there are key questions unresolved, too – not least the role, if any, of Jeziorski's ex-wife.
    


            According to Greek police, she is facing moral accomplice charges, which she denies, according to her lawyer, who spoke to CNN. Like all the suspects in this case, her identity is known to CNN but cannot be published due to Greek legal restrictions.
    


            The alleged perpetrator's confession, and other conflicting accounts from three alleged accomplices that were also leaked to the press, sets up what is likely to be a lengthy and high-profile trial.
    


            Meanwhile, the killing and the aftermath have shocked the friends and family of the victim, who say Jeziorski was a kind and introverted academic who loved his children.
    


            Jeziorski, 43, who went by the nickname Przemek or “PJ,” was an economist and tenured professor of marketing at the University of California Berkeley's Haas School of Business. He was born in Poland and moved to the United States in 2004 to study economics and math at the University of Arizona, and he went on to obtain his PhD from Stanford.
    


            “He was one of the sharpest people I've ever met,” said Robert Kowalski, the victim's friend from Stanford. “He was a great guy, a genius in many regards.”
    


UC Berkeley said in a statement that Jeziorski “had a passion for teaching” and during his 13 years at the California university, he taught data analytics skills to more than 1,500 graduate and PhD students. His research work centered on emerging markets, which took him around the world for field research, and Berkeley described him as “a leading expert in quantitative marketing, industrial organization, and the economics of digital markets.”
    


            The dean of UC Berkeley's business school, Jenny Chatman, said she was “heartbroken” by the death of Jeziorski, who she described as a “beloved member of our marketing faculty.”
    


            Jeziorski met his ex-wife – a Greek national – in San Francisco in 2013, and they got married the following year, according to Kowalski. The couple's twins were born shortly after.
    


            In 2015, the couple co-founded a start-up called Keybee, a short-term rental property management platform.
    


            It's unclear what led to their relationship falling apart, but Kowalski told CNN the couple broke up around 2020 after moving to Greece during the Covid pandemic.
    


            Their children are dual US and Polish citizens, according to a statement from the victim's brother. The children had applied for Greek citizenship and were awaiting a decision on that, according to the ex-wife's lawyer.
    


            Jeziorski filed for divorce in June 2021, according to California court records.
    


            It appears to be one element in a years-long custody battle for the children, who ultimately lived with their mother in Greece, with a provision that their father, Jeziorski, could take the children for one month every summer.
    


            According to Kowalski, Jeziorski asked during the custody battle that his children attend an American school in Greece, so that they could be able to attend high school or college in the US one day.
    


            But his ex-wife was afraid of losing the kids much sooner, according to the statement to police from the principal suspect, her boyfriend.
    


            “We were afraid that he (Jeziorski) would end up taking the kids completely. That would completely finish off (my girlfriend), who was overly fond of them. This summer Przemek wanted to take the children and take them to America. But (my girlfriend) did not agree and so she went back to court with Przemek,” the suspect said, according to the testimony transcript.
    


            On July 3, a custody judgement ruled that Jeziorski was indeed allowed to take the children for a month.
    


            “A month and a half ago I made the decision to end this torment we were experiencing once and for all,” the suspect told police, adding that it was a “good opportunity” given that Jeziorski was in Athens to attend the custody hearing.
    


            The statement details how the suspect says he bought a pistol more than a month ago and asked a friend, who is from Bulgaria, to help him “find Przemek and scare him so that he wouldn't take our children away from us.”
    


            He said it all began in Nafplio, a coastal city about two hours from Athens, “so that it would appear that I was there” and his cell phone would “leave traces.”
    


            The suspect said that that he, his friend and two others – a man and a teenager from Albania – he paid drove to Athens and waited on the same street as the ex-wife's house, where the suspect said he knew Jeziorski was coming that afternoon to pick up the kids. “I approached him and shot him a few times, but I don't remember how many times,” he said.
    


            According to the statement, the men had rented a gray Porsche Cayenne as a getaway car, but the murder suspect told police that his accomplices left him at the scene after they saw him shoot the victim.
    


            Police said Jeziorski died at the scene, where seven bullet casings were found after a masked gunman shot him in the neck and chest.
    


            The three unnamed men who allegedly helped, two Albanian nationals and a Bulgarian national, are facing accomplice charges, police announced Thursday. The suspected accomplices – one of whom is a minor – have confessed to their peripheral involvement in the killing, a Greek police source told CNN on Thursday. CNN has been unable to reach attorneys for those men.
    


            “My client has confessed his actions but as you can see from the simplicity of some of the things that took place this was not an organized plan. His accomplices only knew about a plan to scare him (the victim) so he would stay away from the children,” the main suspect's lawyer, Ermis Papoutsis, told CNN. “(The ex-wife), his partner, knew nothing about any of this.”
    


            “My client had come to me in the past to seek advice. He had said his partner's ex-husband had serious alcoholism issues and that he and the mother were worried about allowing access to the kids. He wanted to see if there was something he could legally do about limiting access,” the lawyer added. “Now he is completely devastated after what happened. We will ask for a psychiatric examination because he has had some issues in the past.”
    


            Jeziorski's friends have denied the allegations that he abused alcohol.
    


            On Friday, CNN Greece obtained the police testimony of the alleged accomplice from Bulgaria, which contradicts the account of the alleged gunman. In this account, the alleged accomplice claims the victim's ex-wife had “organized the whole thing.”
    


            He described his friend, the perpetrator, obtaining a gun and then asking “me to find some people to take him to Athens the next day to scare and threaten the Pole so that he would ‘back down' on custody of the children.”
    


            “In fact, from what he told me, (the ex-wife) made him do it because she didn't want to give the children to the Pole,” the accomplice said in the testimony,” adding that the perpetrator offered him thousands of euros after he “did something we hadn't agreed on.”
    


            As for the ex-wife – beyond the statement of her lawyer, denying all knowledge, there is no further information about her testimony. For reasons that unclear, nothing from her statements to police have made their way to the Greek media.
    


            These inconsistencies – and other unanswered questions – will all be dealt with at the trial.
    


            Meanwhile, the victim's family are dealing with the aftermath of an unimaginable tragedy. The victim's brother said in a statement that “our family is heartbroken,” but grateful to Greek police and security professionals who made the arrests.
    


            “Przemek's ten-year-old children, who are US and Polish citizens, are now under care in accordance with Greek child custody procedures,” the victim's brother Łukasz Jeziorski said in a statement. “Our primary concern is their safety and wellbeing, and helping them reconnect with their family to minimize the trauma they have already endured.”
    


            Jeziorski's family started an online fundraiser to repatriate his remains to his native Poland and pay for legal representation in Greece.
    


            A US State Department spokesperson told CNN the agency is providing consular assistance to the family.
    


            On Monday, the five people charged will appear in person in court for their plea, according to Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, the lawyer representing the victim's family. The court will determine whether the suspects will be remanded in custody pending the trial. A trial date will be set at a later stage, Dimitrakopoulos told CNN.
    


            “The victim's mother and brother will take sole custody of the children,” Dimitrakopoulos told Greek media on Friday. The lawyer said that “we've talked to the prosecutor for minors so that the victim's mom and brother can get full custody of the kids and live with them in Poland, where they are now.”
    


            “They have the opportunity to raise them in a loving environment, in a completely protective environment,” Dimitrakopoulos said, adding that “if the mother is acquitted, because we respect the presumption of innocence, then she has the right to request sole custody of her children.”

DUBAI, July 20. /TASS/. Iran and the Eurotroika (France, Germany and the United Kingdom) have agreed to resume their negotiating process on Tehran's nuclear program, the Tasnim news agency said, citing sources.

""The informed source told Tasnim that Tehran and the European troika have come to an agreement in principle on the resumption of the talks about Iran's nuclear program, but the timing and location of the negotiations are under debate,"" the news agency said.

""The decision as to which country will be hosting the upcoming talks has not been finalized yet,"" the sources said.

Iranian nuclear issue

The five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany struck a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015 to address the crisis over its nuclear program. Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018.

Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, the US and France have been in talks with Iran in Vienna since April 2021, seeking to restore the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in its original form, without achieving any specific results.

In response to Washington's withdrawal from the JCPOA, in 2020, the Iranian parliament passed a law outlining a strategic plan to remove sanctions and protect the Iranian people's interests. As part of this plan, Iran scaled back several obligations under the nuclear deal, particularly by suspending inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) beyond the safeguard agreement related to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and prohibiting the use of stringent monitoring measures.

Earlier, Iran vowed to withdraw from the NPT if the snapback mechanism, allowing for the return of all UN Security Council sanctions against Tehran that were suspended under the JCPOA is activated.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The US transport safety body said investigations into the Air India 171 crash in Ahmedabad will take time. It expressed support for India's investigating body AAIB.

The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Friday that media reports on the reasons behind the Air India Boeing Dreamliner crash which killed 270 were speculative and premature. 

 India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which is investigating the accident, had released a preliminary report last week which raised questions about the engine fuel cutoff switches.

Since the report came out, there have been several media reports speculating over the cause of the crash in Indian and Western media, pointing to a possible pilot error. The report itself has been condemned for not providing enough information.

The NTSB is an investigative agency that investigates civil transportation accidents.

""Recent media reports on the Air India 171 crash are premature and speculative. India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau just released its preliminary report. Investigations of this magnitude take time,"" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a statement shared on X.

According to the AAIB report, in the blackbox voice recording , ""one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff,"" and the other pilot ""responded that he did not do so.""

First officer Clive Kunder was believed to be flying the plane while Captain Sumeet Sabharwal was monitoring, hence it has been assumed that his hands were free to toggle with the fuel switch. 

The switches were restored 10 seconds later but the plane crashed, having already lost thrust. 

The report did not clarify what caused the engine fuel to cut off.

Some media reports and aviation experts have speculated that Sabharwal could have been suicidal and intentionally switched off the fuel.

The AAIB had condemned western media reports for being ""irresponsible"" and drawing conclusions ""through selective and unverified reporting,"" Times of India reported.

The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) sent legal notices to the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, saying the findings were ""neither substantiated by the official investigation nor endorsed by any competent authority,"" newspaper The New Indian Express said.

India's Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Ram Mohan Naidu urged the press and people not to ""jump to conclusions"" and wait for the final report.
