            On the morning of July 4, an American marketing professor was walking towards his ex-wife's house in Athens to pick up their two young children. It should have been an unremarkable, if strained visit – the couple had apparently been disputing the terms of custody arrangements.
    


            But Przemyslaw Jeziorski never made it to the front door.
    


            In broad daylight, in this typically quiet, suburban neighborhood of Greece's capital, he was shot multiple times at close range, according to police. Jeziorski died where he fell, police said, his body riddled with gunshot wounds seen in grim photographs taken in the immediate aftermath.
    


            As eyewitnesses rushed to his aid, the masked gunman fled.
    


            The alleged perpetrator, arrested 12 days later for premeditated murder: His ex-wife's new partner. The motive, he told police – to prevent Jeziorski from taking away her children.
    


            “I did it all for (her) and our children so that we could have a normal life without problems,” he said, according to a transcript of a statement he made to police in the aftermath of his arrest.

Greek police charge five people in murder case of UC Berkeley professor, including his ex-wife



            One of the most remarkable aspects of the case is that the statements made to police by the alleged perpetrators have been widely leaked to Greek media, including a CNN affiliate, CNN Greece. The statements, verified as authentic by a senior police source speaking to CNN, offer an insight into how the alleged murder plot was put together, why it was undertaken, and provide clues as to who may have known what, and when.  But there are key questions unresolved, too – not least the role, if any, of Jeziorski's ex-wife.
    


            According to Greek police, she is facing moral accomplice charges, which she denies, according to her lawyer, who spoke to CNN. Like all the suspects in this case, her identity is known to CNN but cannot be published due to Greek legal restrictions.
    


            The alleged perpetrator's confession, and other conflicting accounts from three alleged accomplices that were also leaked to the press, sets up what is likely to be a lengthy and high-profile trial.
    


            Meanwhile, the killing and the aftermath have shocked the friends and family of the victim, who say Jeziorski was a kind and introverted academic who loved his children.
    


            Jeziorski, 43, who went by the nickname Przemek or “PJ,” was an economist and tenured professor of marketing at the University of California Berkeley's Haas School of Business. He was born in Poland and moved to the United States in 2004 to study economics and math at the University of Arizona, and he went on to obtain his PhD from Stanford.
    


            “He was one of the sharpest people I've ever met,” said Robert Kowalski, the victim's friend from Stanford. “He was a great guy, a genius in many regards.”
    


UC Berkeley said in a statement that Jeziorski “had a passion for teaching” and during his 13 years at the California university, he taught data analytics skills to more than 1,500 graduate and PhD students. His research work centered on emerging markets, which took him around the world for field research, and Berkeley described him as “a leading expert in quantitative marketing, industrial organization, and the economics of digital markets.”
    


            The dean of UC Berkeley's business school, Jenny Chatman, said she was “heartbroken” by the death of Jeziorski, who she described as a “beloved member of our marketing faculty.”
    


            Jeziorski met his ex-wife – a Greek national – in San Francisco in 2013, and they got married the following year, according to Kowalski. The couple's twins were born shortly after.
    


            In 2015, the couple co-founded a start-up called Keybee, a short-term rental property management platform.
    


            It's unclear what led to their relationship falling apart, but Kowalski told CNN the couple broke up around 2020 after moving to Greece during the Covid pandemic.
    


            Their children are dual US and Polish citizens, according to a statement from the victim's brother. The children had applied for Greek citizenship and were awaiting a decision on that, according to the ex-wife's lawyer.
    


            Jeziorski filed for divorce in June 2021, according to California court records.
    


            It appears to be one element in a years-long custody battle for the children, who ultimately lived with their mother in Greece, with a provision that their father, Jeziorski, could take the children for one month every summer.
    


            According to Kowalski, Jeziorski asked during the custody battle that his children attend an American school in Greece, so that they could be able to attend high school or college in the US one day.
    


            But his ex-wife was afraid of losing the kids much sooner, according to the statement to police from the principal suspect, her boyfriend.
    


            “We were afraid that he (Jeziorski) would end up taking the kids completely. That would completely finish off (my girlfriend), who was overly fond of them. This summer Przemek wanted to take the children and take them to America. But (my girlfriend) did not agree and so she went back to court with Przemek,” the suspect said, according to the testimony transcript.
    


            On July 3, a custody judgement ruled that Jeziorski was indeed allowed to take the children for a month.
    


            “A month and a half ago I made the decision to end this torment we were experiencing once and for all,” the suspect told police, adding that it was a “good opportunity” given that Jeziorski was in Athens to attend the custody hearing.
    


            The statement details how the suspect says he bought a pistol more than a month ago and asked a friend, who is from Bulgaria, to help him “find Przemek and scare him so that he wouldn't take our children away from us.”
    


            He said it all began in Nafplio, a coastal city about two hours from Athens, “so that it would appear that I was there” and his cell phone would “leave traces.”
    


            The suspect said that that he, his friend and two others – a man and a teenager from Albania – he paid drove to Athens and waited on the same street as the ex-wife's house, where the suspect said he knew Jeziorski was coming that afternoon to pick up the kids. “I approached him and shot him a few times, but I don't remember how many times,” he said.
    


            According to the statement, the men had rented a gray Porsche Cayenne as a getaway car, but the murder suspect told police that his accomplices left him at the scene after they saw him shoot the victim.
    


            Police said Jeziorski died at the scene, where seven bullet casings were found after a masked gunman shot him in the neck and chest.
    


            The three unnamed men who allegedly helped, two Albanian nationals and a Bulgarian national, are facing accomplice charges, police announced Thursday. The suspected accomplices – one of whom is a minor – have confessed to their peripheral involvement in the killing, a Greek police source told CNN on Thursday. CNN has been unable to reach attorneys for those men.
    


            “My client has confessed his actions but as you can see from the simplicity of some of the things that took place this was not an organized plan. His accomplices only knew about a plan to scare him (the victim) so he would stay away from the children,” the main suspect's lawyer, Ermis Papoutsis, told CNN. “(The ex-wife), his partner, knew nothing about any of this.”
    


            “My client had come to me in the past to seek advice. He had said his partner's ex-husband had serious alcoholism issues and that he and the mother were worried about allowing access to the kids. He wanted to see if there was something he could legally do about limiting access,” the lawyer added. “Now he is completely devastated after what happened. We will ask for a psychiatric examination because he has had some issues in the past.”
    


            Jeziorski's friends have denied the allegations that he abused alcohol.
    


            On Friday, CNN Greece obtained the police testimony of the alleged accomplice from Bulgaria, which contradicts the account of the alleged gunman. In this account, the alleged accomplice claims the victim's ex-wife had “organized the whole thing.”
    


            He described his friend, the perpetrator, obtaining a gun and then asking “me to find some people to take him to Athens the next day to scare and threaten the Pole so that he would ‘back down' on custody of the children.”
    


            “In fact, from what he told me, (the ex-wife) made him do it because she didn't want to give the children to the Pole,” the accomplice said in the testimony,” adding that the perpetrator offered him thousands of euros after he “did something we hadn't agreed on.”
    


            As for the ex-wife – beyond the statement of her lawyer, denying all knowledge, there is no further information about her testimony. For reasons that unclear, nothing from her statements to police have made their way to the Greek media.
    


            These inconsistencies – and other unanswered questions – will all be dealt with at the trial.
    


            Meanwhile, the victim's family are dealing with the aftermath of an unimaginable tragedy. The victim's brother said in a statement that “our family is heartbroken,” but grateful to Greek police and security professionals who made the arrests.
    


            “Przemek's ten-year-old children, who are US and Polish citizens, are now under care in accordance with Greek child custody procedures,” the victim's brother Łukasz Jeziorski said in a statement. “Our primary concern is their safety and wellbeing, and helping them reconnect with their family to minimize the trauma they have already endured.”
    


            Jeziorski's family started an online fundraiser to repatriate his remains to his native Poland and pay for legal representation in Greece.
    


            A US State Department spokesperson told CNN the agency is providing consular assistance to the family.
    


            On Monday, the five people charged will appear in person in court for their plea, according to Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, the lawyer representing the victim's family. The court will determine whether the suspects will be remanded in custody pending the trial. A trial date will be set at a later stage, Dimitrakopoulos told CNN.
    


            “The victim's mother and brother will take sole custody of the children,” Dimitrakopoulos told Greek media on Friday. The lawyer said that “we've talked to the prosecutor for minors so that the victim's mom and brother can get full custody of the kids and live with them in Poland, where they are now.”
    


            “They have the opportunity to raise them in a loving environment, in a completely protective environment,” Dimitrakopoulos said, adding that “if the mother is acquitted, because we respect the presumption of innocence, then she has the right to request sole custody of her children.”

Ballot heaps pressure on Shigeru Ishiba's minority government after it lost control of lower house in October 

Japan's shaky ruling coalition is likely to lose control of the upper house, exit polls showed after Sunday's election, potentially heralding political turmoil as a tariff deadline with the US looms.

While the ballot does not directly determine whether prime minister Shigeru Ishiba's minority government falls, it heaps pressure on the embattled leader, who also lost control of the more powerful lower house in October.

Ishiba's Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and coalition partner Komeito need 50 seats to secure the 248-seat upper chamber in an election where half the seats are up for grabs.

They are forecast to hold 32 to 51 seats, the exit poll by public broadcaster NHK showed. Other broadcasters forecast the ruling coalition would return 41 to 43 seats. If the coalition drops below 46 seats it would mark its worst result since it was formed in 1999.

That comes on top of its worst showing in 15 years in October's lower house election, a vote that has left Ishiba's administration vulnerable to no-confidence motions and calls from within his own party for leadership change.

Speaking to NHK two hours after polls closed, Ishiba, 68, said he “solemnly” accepted the “harsh result”.

Asked whether he intended to stay on as prime minister and party leader, he said: “That's right.”

He later told TV Tokyo: “We are engaged in extremely critical tariff negotiations with the United States … we must never ruin these negotiations. It is only natural to devote our complete dedication and energy to realising our national interests.”

Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, faces a deadline of 1 August to strike a trade deal with the US or face punishing tariffs in its largest export market.

The main opposition Constitutional Democratic party is projected to win 18 to 30 seats, from 22 held previously, NHK's exit poll showed.

The far-right Sanseito party, birthed on YouTube a few years ago, has been the surprise package with its “Japanese first” campaign and warnings about a “silent invasion” of foreigners. It is forecast to win 10 to 15 seats in the chamber, up from one held previously, yet it holds only three seats in the lower house.

Opposition parties advocating for tax cuts and welfare spending have struck a chord with voters, the exit polls showed, as rising consumer prices – particularly a jump in the cost of rice – have sowed frustration at the government's response.

“The LDP was largely playing defence in this election, being on the wrong side of a key voter issue,” said David Boling, a director at the consulting firm Eurasia Group.

“Polls show that most households want a cut to the consumption tax to address inflation, something that the LDP opposes. Opposition parties seized on it and hammered that message home.”

The LDP has been urging for fiscal restraint, with one eye on a very jittery government bond market, as investors worry about Japan's ability to refinance the world's largest debt pile.

Sanseito, which first emerged during the Covid pandemic spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations and a cabal of global elites, has dragged once fringe political rhetoric into the mainstream and gained wider support among frustrated voters.

It remains to be seen whether the party can follow the path of other far-right parties with which it has drawn comparisons, such as Germany's AfD and Reform UK.

“I am attending graduate school but there are no Japanese around me. All of them are foreigners,” said Yu Nagai, a 25-year-old student who voted for Sanseito earlier on Sunday.

“When I look at the way compensation and money are spent on foreigners, I think that Japanese people are a bit disrespected,” he said after casting his ballot at a polling station in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward.

In Japan, which has the world's oldest population, foreign-born residents hit a record of about 3.8 million last year.

That is still just 3% of the total population, a much smaller fraction than in the US and Europe, but comes amid a tourism boom that has made foreigners far more visible across the country.

Ukraine intends to secured $6.9 billion in international arbitration rulings against Russian energy giant Gazprom, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on July 20, citing a report by Serhii Koretskyi, CEO of Ukraine's state-owned energy company.

"These are absolutely fair decisions that demonstrate the responsibility of Russia and Gazprom and affirms the strength of international law," Zelensky said.

He added that Ukrainian ambassadors will receive detailed instructions on July 21 on how to proceed with the recovery of the awarded funds. 

This June, Naftogaz secured another legal victory against Gazprom. An international arbitration in Switzerland has ordered the Russian energy giant to pay $1.37 billion in damages to Naftogaz.

In 2023, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague found Russia liable for the illegal expropriation of Naftogaz assets following Russia's occupation of Crimea in 2014. A French court authorized this April the enforcement of a $5 billion arbitration award against Russia for damages caused to Ukraine's state-owned energy company Naftogaz during the occupation of Crimea.

Under international law, arbitration awards can be enforced in multiple jurisdictions through domestic courts. If a defendant's state fails to pay voluntarily, creditors can seek to seize foreign-held assets to satisfy the judgment.

Naftogaz, Ukraine's largest energy firm, lost critical infrastructure, natural gas reserves, and service networks in the region. Its case against Russia became one of the most high-profile corporate arbitration claims against Russia following the start of the war in 2014.

Flag held up during curtain call for Il Trovatore, with attempts to remove it resisted

A Palestinian flag was at the centre of a tussle after it was unfolded on stage at the Royal Opera House in London by a cast member on Saturday night during a curtain call.

The incident took place during the encore of Il Trovatore on Saturday night, and attempts to remove the flag were resisted.

“At the Royal Opera House, one of the cast unfurled a Palestinian flag at the encore. Someone from the opera house/company then came on stage from the wings to try to remove the flag from the cast member who wrestled it back and refused to give it up during Il Trovatore,” a member of the audience told the Telegraph.

Another operagoer posted on X on Saturday: “Extraordinary scenes at the Royal Opera House tonight.

“During the curtain call for Il Trovatore one of the background artists came on stage waving a Palestine flag. Just stood there, no bowing or shouting. Someone off stage kept trying to take it off him. Incredible.”

Another post on X from Stephen Ratcliffe, who was also watching the production, added: “Controversy at end of Trovatore @rbo_org tonight when an extra/chorus member unfurled a Palestinian flag. Off stage manager tried to grapple with him but he held his ground. Bet he won't be working there again.”

A spokesperson for the Royal Ballet and Opera said: “The display of the flag was an unauthorised action by the artist. It was not approved by the Royal Ballet and Opera and is a wholly inappropriate act.”

A video of the incident, posted on social media, shows a man, thought to be a Royal Opera House staff member, appearing from the wings and attempting to forcibly wrest the flag off the protesting cast member.

But the cast member managed to yank the flag back, and continued to display it as the other cast members in front bowed to the audience. During the tussle, two other performers who are stood alongside the protester can be seen lurching to their side.

Cast members further forward on the stage appeared oblivious what was happening behind them.

Other officials standing in the wings can be seen shouting messages to the protesting cast member, who looks ahead and appears to ignore them.

The protest came on the closing night of Il Trovatore, a four-act opera by Giuseppe Verdi, after an 11-night run at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden.

Il Trovatore (“The Troubadour” in English) is a tale of doomed love, the destructive nature of revenge, and the inescapable influence of the past. The plot, which has many twists and secrets, revolves around four main characters: Manrico, Azucena, Leonora and Count di Luna, each caught up in misunderstandings and dramatic confrontations.

            A boy survived the sinking of a tourist boat in Vietnam which killed dozens of people by sheltering in an air pocket of the overturned vessel, it has emerged.
    


            The 10-year-old had been traveling with his family in Vietnam's famed Ha Long Bay when the vessel they were sailing on became caught in a sudden storm. Trapped in the boat as it capsized, the boy found refuge in an underwater air pocket, where he stayed and waited for help.
    


            He was eventually found by rescue teams relatively unharmed, although he was suffering from mental distress. He was warmed up and transferred to a nearby hospital, local outlet VietnamNet reported.
    


            “Everything happened so fast,” the boy said. “I tried to get out, and then the soldiers rescued me.”
    


            Search and rescue efforts are continuing for missing passengers and crew after sightseeing ship the Wonder Sea capsized in a squall on Saturday but have been hampered by bad weather.
    


            At least 37 people are confirmed dead from the sinking, state media reported, revising down an earlier toll but warning that it could still rise further. Vietnam News said there were 53 passengers and crew on board and 10 people had been rescued.
    


            Another survivor, a 36-year-old Vietnamese man, described escaping the overturned boat by dumping his life jacket and swimming through an underwater window.
    


            Fire extinguisher salesman Dang Anh Tuan described the moment the vessel suddenly capsized during bad weather, leaving little time for those on board to react.
    


            “It rained for about 15 minutes, and then the boat started to shake vigorously, tables and chairs were jostled around and seconds later the boat overturned,” Tuan told the Associated Press.
    


            He said that the boat quickly filled with water and he lost all orientation.
    


            “I tried to breathe. But more water came in. I took a deep breath, got rid of my life vest and dove down. I saw a streak of light and followed it to swim out, escaping the boat, and then I climbed on the overturned boat to look for help,” he said.
    


            Tuan, along with several others who had been on board, clung onto the overturned boat and waited for another two hours in pouring rain until emergency crews arrived.
    


            He'd been holidaying in Vietnam's popular tourist bay with 11 university friends. Only three of their group survived.
    


            VN Express reported that the Wonder Sea was caught in a storm around 1.30 p.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), which caused it to capsize.
    


            Most of the passengers were from the Vietnamese capital Hanoi and traveling as families, according to VN Express, which reported the eldest passenger as 53 years old and the youngest as just 3. Over 20 children were on board, VNExpress said.
    


            The capsize reportedly happened near the Dau Go Cave – one of the largest in the bay.
    


            Halong Bay is a popular tourist hotspot and a UNESCO world heritage site comprising about 1,600 limestone islands and islets.

DUBAI, July 20. /TASS/. Iran and the Eurotroika (France, Germany and the United Kingdom) have agreed to resume their negotiating process on Tehran's nuclear program, the Tasnim news agency said, citing sources.

"The informed source told Tasnim that Tehran and the European troika have come to an agreement in principle on the resumption of the talks about Iran's nuclear program, but the timing and location of the negotiations are under debate," the news agency said.

"The decision as to which country will be hosting the upcoming talks has not been finalized yet," the sources said.

Iranian nuclear issue

The five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany struck a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015 to address the crisis over its nuclear program. Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018.

Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, the US and France have been in talks with Iran in Vienna since April 2021, seeking to restore the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in its original form, without achieving any specific results.

In response to Washington's withdrawal from the JCPOA, in 2020, the Iranian parliament passed a law outlining a strategic plan to remove sanctions and protect the Iranian people's interests. As part of this plan, Iran scaled back several obligations under the nuclear deal, particularly by suspending inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) beyond the safeguard agreement related to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and prohibiting the use of stringent monitoring measures.

Earlier, Iran vowed to withdraw from the NPT if the snapback mechanism, allowing for the return of all UN Security Council sanctions against Tehran that were suspended under the JCPOA is activated.

Azerbaijan is preparing to submit documents to international courts over the crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines aircraft, President Ilham Aliyev said on July 19, according to local outlet Minval.

An Embraer 190AR plane operated by Azarbaijan Airlines crashed in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, after coming under fire over Grozny, Chechnya. Thirty-eight people were killed.

Azerbaijani authorities laid blame on Russia, with an investigation pointing to a Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system mistakenly targeting the plane amid a reported Ukrainian drone attack.

Aliyev said that despite seven months having passed since the incident, Azerbaijan has yet to receive a clear response from the Russian authorities. 

Moscow continues to reply to formal inquiries from the Azerbaijani Prosecutor General by saying that the investigation is still ongoing, the Minval reported.

"We understand that this may take time. In the Malaysian airline Boeing case, it took more than ten years. We are ready to wait ten years, but justice must be done," Aliyev said.

Earlier this July, the European Court of Human Rights found Russia responsible for the downing of Flight MH17, a Malaysian airliner shot down by Russian-controlled forces over Ukraine in July 2014.

Flight MH17 departed from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport en-route to Kuala Lumpur International Airport on July 17, 2014. Three hours into the flight, Boeing 777 was shot down by Russian militants using a Buk surface-to-air missile over Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast. All 283 passengers and 15 crew members on board, among them 196 Dutch citizens, were killed.

The crash of the Azerbaijani aircraft led to a public clash between Azerbaijan and Russia, otherwise close politically and economically. Previously, Aliyev accused Moscow of suppressing evidence and criticized his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for not openly admitting guilt.

Putin offered condolences for the incident, but stopped short of admitting Russian responsibility.



"The main thing for us is to achieve our goals. Our goals are clear," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian-state media reporter on July 20.

The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 20 imposed sanctions on five individuals, three Ukrainians and two Russians.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian ambassadors will receive detailed instructions on July 21 on how to proceed with the recovery of the awarded funds.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a railway in Russia's Tula Oblast, causing "serious disruptions" to Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on July 20.

Operatives with the group destroyed a relay cabinet on a railway near the town of Medvedky, west of the city of Tula, Atesh said. Russian troops reportedly use the railroad to transport military personnel and supplies to troops on the Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts fronts.

The sabotage operation disrupted Russian supply lines and led to delays in the delivery of ammunition, weapons, and dual-use components from Tula-based factories.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.

The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks on Russian territory and in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. Partisans reported similar attacks on railroads in occupied Luhansk Oblast and in Russia's Smolensk Oblast in March.

Tula Oblast, located about 250 kilometers northeast of Sumy Oblast, is a regular target of Ukrainian drone strikes. The region is home to several military industrial manufacturing facilities that power Russia's war machine along Ukraine's front line.

CHISINAU, July 20. /TASS/. Moldova spoiled relations with Moscow under pressure from the West, which supports the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity, Russian Ambassador to Chisinau Oleg Ozerov told TASS in an interview.

"It seems to me that the current policy, which is now being implemented by Moldova's ruling party, comes as a result of pressure exerted by European Union countries - first of all, by Brussels - on the Moldovan government. They claim this will guarantee prosperity. But if we look at the statistics, it is quite the opposite," the diplomat said.

"The entire complex of measures undertaken by the Moldovan government under the pressure from Brussels and NATO countries, as we think, has seriously harmed our bilateral relations," he added.

Relations between the two states began to deteriorate in 2021, when pro-European forces assumed power in Moldova. Following the 2023 decision to expel 45 Russian diplomats, Moldova has significantly restricted consular services, as well as cultural, educational, and business ties with Russia. These measures have primarily affected Moldovan citizens. The measures have been harshly criticized by the country's opposition.

BERLIN, July 20. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump's decision to continue military aid to Ukraine, in many aspects, came as a result of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's efforts, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told Bild in an interview.

"The entire Europe is on Ukraine's side. The United States is also ready to continue support. This is, to a significant extent, a result of the German chancellor's initiative," he said. "Friedrich Merz played a significant role in this, because he made it clear from the very outset that he defends Ukraine."

"Friedrich Merz phoned Donald Trump and said there is a need for the United States now. We can only be glad that the chancellor has established a pragmatic relationship with the US president, and that the voice of Germany is heard in Washington again," Wadephul said.

On July 14, Trump said that Washington will continue transferring weapons and military equipment to Kiev if Europe pays for the supplies. NATO will coordinate the process. According to the head of the White House, the deliveries will include 17 Patriot systems.

The American leader also said that Washington would impose import duties of 100% on Russia and its trading partners if Moscow and Washington did not reach an agreement on resolving the conflict in Ukraine within 50 days.

Russia aims to be able to launch 2,000 drones towards Ukraine simultaneously, German Major General Christian Freuding said in an interview published on July 19.

The staggering figure described by Freuding, who heads the Ukraine task force at the German Defense Ministry, comes as Russia continues to expand its drone production. 

Ukrainian Foreign Intelligence Service (SZRU) told Politico in June that the Kremlin plans to produce 2 million first-person-view (FPV) drones and 30,000 long-range and decoy drones in 2025, marking a critical expansion of Moscow's drone warfare program.

Between Sept. 13, 2022, and Aug. 30, 2023, Russian forces fired nearly 2,000 Shaheds into Ukraine, according to Airwars, a London-based conflict monitoring organization. That number has surged in 2025 — in June alone, Moscow launched a record 5,337 Shahed-type drones.

Freuding's comments come as Russia has continued to ramp up its Iranian-designed Shahed drone attacks on Ukrainian cities in recent weeks, including strikes on Ukraine's far-western regions. On July 9, Russia launched a record 728 Shahed-type drones and decoys across the country.

Robert "Magyar" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces warned on July 4 that Russian Shahed drone strikes could escalate to 1,000 per day. 

Amid the increased risk of intensified Russian attacks, Freuding told the Bundeswehr podcast Nachgefragt, that Ukraine can indirectly counter anticipated drones attacks by targeting production sites with long-range missiles.

Ukraine regularly strikes military production facilities on Russian territory, but has called upon Western allies to supply more long-range weaponry for added capabilities.

Freuding announced earlier this month that Ukraine will begin receiving hundreds of domestically produced long-range weapon systems by the end of July under a German-financed agreement. The announcement came ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's agreement with NATO to supply additional weapons to Ukraine.

Amid Russia's attacks on Ukrainian cities, Ukraine's military appears to have intensified its own efforts in targeting Russia's capital. Ukraine's military has targeted Moscow for four straight nights, with fires breaking out in Moscow Oblast on July 20 amid the attacks.

In an effort to counter Russia's increasing drone production, Ukraine has also increased production of its own drones Ukraine's, using them heavily in attacks on various Russian regions as well as on the front line. 

Then-Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at a June 26 press briefing that Kyiv currently has the capacity to produce 4 million drones a year. President Volodymyr Zelensky also said that Kyiv has the capacity 8 million drones annually, but lacks the international financial backing to reach that potential.

"The main thing for us is to achieve our goals. Our goals are clear," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian-state media reporter on July 20.

The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 20 imposed sanctions on five individuals, three Ukrainians and two Russians.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian ambassadors will receive detailed instructions on July 21 on how to proceed with the recovery of the awarded funds. 

A fire broke out in Moscow Oblast overnight on July 20 as Ukraine reportedly launched a drone attack targeting the Russian capital, local Telegram channels reported.

According to Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service, WhatsApp, owned by Meta tech giant, is a likely target for blocking.

Ukrainian forces downed 18 out of the 57 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported.

An Embraer 190AR plane operated by Azarbaijan Airlines crashed in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, after coming under fire over Russia's Chechnya. Thirty-eight people were killed.

The number includes 1,040 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a railway in Russia's Tula Oblast, causing "serious disruptions" to Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on July 20.

The staggering figure described by German Major General Christian Freuding, who heads the Ukraine task force at the German Defense Ministry, comes as Russia continues to expand its drone production. 

Instead of being brought to the Ukrainian border, 56 Ukrainian deportees were taken to a basement facility in Georgia where they were being held in a transit zone, aid group Volunteers Tbilisi reported.

Oleksandr Usyk retained his heavyweight title and preserved his unbeaten record with a commanding fifth-round knockout of Daniel Dubois on July 19 at Wembley Stadium.

Ukrainian lawmakers are considering whether to allow men ages 18 to 24 to travel abroad, a move that would ease current wartime restrictions, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Ruslan Stefanchuk said on July 19.

Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin reports on the federal case of I.C.E. tactics on 'Special Report.'

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass repeatedly dodged answering directly on whether all illegal immigrants in the sanctuary city should be allowed to stay. 

In an interview with ABC's "This Week," Bass further criticized President Donald Trump's decision to federalize 4,000 National Guard troops and deploy about 700 Marines to Los Angeles amid anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots and protests. The Democratic mayor was questioned by ABC host Martha Raddatz on who she thinks should be deported – whether that should be just people convicted of crimes – given Los Angeles has about a million "undocumented workers." 

"What should happen to those people?" Raddatz asked. 

"Let me just say that, because we are a city of immigrants, we have entire sectors of our economy that are dependent on immigrant labor. We have to get the fire areas rebuilt. We're not going to get our city rebuilt without immigrant labor," Bass claimed. "And it's not just the deportations, it's the fear that sets in when raids occur, when people are snatched off the street. And I know you are aware that even people who are here legally, even people who are U.S. citizens, have been detained."

"So they should not be deported?" Raddatz pressed. 

Bass responded, "I don't think so. I think they should stay." 

The ABC host interjected, noting that the mayor was discussing "a million undocumented people." 

"No, let me just tell you, what I think we need is comprehensive immigration reform. I served in Congress for 12 years," Bass said.

Raddatz again interrupted the mayor, noting that Bass, as a congresswoman, did not ensure the passage of such immigration reform. 

"And why didn't we get it? I mean, after I left, there was an immigration reform bill that had bipartisan support," Bass said, attempting to blame Trump. "This was during the campaign. The president decided he didn't want to have it happen because he didn't want immigration reform to happen, where he didn't take credit for it." 

Noting the surge in border crossings under former President Joe Biden, Raddatz recalled asking a Border Patrol agent whether he felt badly for illegal immigrants. 

His response, Raddatz said, was yes, but "they're cutting in line in front of those people who want to do it legally in the right way."

"Let me just tell you that the people that make that trek, many of whom walk from Central America and even South America up to our border, risk their lives. I don't believe that all of these people are sitting at home dreaming of coming to Los Angeles," Bass said in response. "They're coming here out of desperation." 

4 ARRESTED IN ALLEGED BORDER PATROL OPERATION SABOTAGE ATTEMPT NEAR LA AS ATTACKS ON IMMIGRATION AGENTS SURGE

Raddatz noted that "hundreds of thousands" of people illegally crossed the border under the Biden administration. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) figures, however, recorded about 10.8 million border encounters and roughly two million more known "got-a-ways" during Biden's term. Trump, meanwhile, has reported record-low border crossings since he began his second term. 

When asked if there's "anything good" she thinks the Trump administration has done in these six months at the border, Bass said, "Well, I will keep praise on the administration for the first six months in Los Angeles with the fires. If you ask me, is there anything that they have done good in terms of immigration, I don't know. I don't think so. I think that the viewpoint has been punitive, has been, let's make it as miserable as possible so that these people don't come." 

Bass said she has not recently had conversations with the Trump administration regarding immigration despite the National Guard presence in the city.

"I have put in a request and I hope to. I will always be open to a conversation," the mayor said. "I want to work with the administration to solve this problem. We have the World Cup in 11 short months here. We have Olympics and Paralympics coming in three short years. I know that these games are very important to the president and I look forward to working with him, and we have an extreme difference on this issue, but there's many issues for us to work on, and I will continue trying to outreach to the administration and hope that at some point they'll be responsive." 

The mayor also responded to how she hopes the next six months to two years will be for immigrants in Los Angeles, taking a dig at what she deemed the Trump administration's "reign of terror." 

The Pentagon last week announced it was pulling 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, citing how the "lawlessness" seen in early June anti-ICE riots has subsided.

"Well, I am just hoping that this reign of terror ends. I'm hoping that the military leaves because they were never needed here to begin with," Bass said. "I hope that we can get back to normal."

            A man died last week after being pulled into an MRI machine by a “large metallic chain” police said he was wearing around his neck – highlighting the importance of checking for any metallic objects before going near the powerful magnets used in the medical imaging machines.
    


            The 61-year-old died Thursday, a day after Nassau County police said he was pulled into the MRI machine at Nassau Open MRI in Westbury, New York, on Long Island. The victim was wearing “a large metallic chain around his neck causing him to be drawn into the machine,” prompting an unspecified “medical episode,” police said in a news release.
    


            The man's entry to the room “while the scan was in progress” was not authorized, police said.
    


            He was taken to a hospital in critical condition before he was declared dead the following day. The investigation is ongoing, police said.
    


            Police have not identified the victim, but CNN affiliate News 12 Long Island reported his name was Keith McAllister, according to his wife, Adrienne Jones-McAllister. She told the station she was the one undergoing the MRI.
    


            “He went limp in my arms,” Jones-McAllister said through tears.
    


            A person who answered the phone at Nassau Open MRI on Sunday said it had no comment.
    


            Used often for disease detection and diagnosis, MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, according to the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. The technology relies in part on powerful magnets to stimulate protons within a patient, who is placed inside the machine, allowing doctors to capture detailed images of the patient's anatomy.
    


            That strong magnetic field, however, emanates beyond the MRI machine, posing a threat to those who might be wearing metallic objects or have them implanted. The magnets exert “very powerful forces on objects of iron, some steels, and other magnetizable objects,” the scientific institute notes, with enough strength “to fling a wheelchair across the room.”
    


            Jones-McAllister was getting an MRI on her knee, she told News 12, and needed help getting up afterwards. She said she asked the MRI technician to retrieve her husband for assistance.
    


            “I yelled out Keith's name, ‘Keith, Keith, come help me up,'” Jones-McAllister said. According to News 12, Jones-McAllister said her husband was wearing around his neck a 20-pound chain with a large lock he used for weight training.
    


            “At that instant, the machine switched him around, pulled him in, and he hit the MRI,” Jones-McAllister said. She said she and the technician tried to pry her husband away from the machine.
    


            “I'm saying, ‘Could you turn off the machine? Call 911. Do something. Turn this damn thing off!'”
    


            Because of the risks posed by an MRI machine's magnetic field, patients are urged to notify their doctors about any medical implants prior to an MRI, in case they contain any metallic materials. Pacemakers, insulin pumps and cochlear implants are all examples of implants that the NIBIB says should under no circumstances enter an MRI machine.
    


            But items outside the machine pose risks as well, as last week's tragedy in Westbury demonstrated. Anything magnetic – from something as small as keys, to something as large (or larger) than an oxygen tank – can become a projectile, threatening the safety of anyone nearby.
    


            “Metal in a room that has the magnet will fly across the room to the scanner, to this large magnet, and will really hit anything in its way,” Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiologist, told CNN in 2011.
    


            “So within radiology training, one learns very early that that's not OK, that you can't have external metal in the room, and you can't have metal in the patient,” she said. “That could lead to a problem.”
    


            These accidents have happened in the past: In 2001, a 6-year-old boy was killed during an MRI at a hospital in Valhalla, New York, after a metal oxygen tank flew across the room when the machine's electromagnet turned on.
    


            The magnetized tank struck the child, who died of blunt force trauma injuries.
    


            These events are rare, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. Still, “(c)areful screening of people and objects entering the MR environment is critical to ensure nothing enters the magnet area that may become a projectile,” the agency says.

CLEVELAND (AP) — President Donald Trump wants Washington's football franchise and Cleveland's baseball team to revert to their former names.

Trump said Sunday on his Truth Social site that “The Washington ‘Whatever's' should IMMEDIATELY change their name back to the Washington Redskins Football Team. There is a big clamoring for this. Likewise, the Cleveland Indians, one of the six original baseball teams, with a storied past. Our great Indian people, in massive numbers, want this to happen. Their heritage and prestige is systematically being taken away from them. Times are different now than they were three or four years ago. We are a Country of passion and common sense. OWNERS, GET IT DONE!!!”

Josh Harris, whose group bought the Commanders from former owner Dan Snyder in 2023, said earlier this year the name was here to stay. Not long after taking over, Harris quieted speculation about going back to Redskins, saying that would not happen.

Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti indicated before Sunday's game against the Athletics that there weren't any plans to revisit the name change.

“We understand there are different perspectives on the decision we made a few years ago, but obviously it's a decision we made. We've got the opportunity to build a brand as the Guardians over the last four years and are excited about the future that's in front of us,” he said.




Both teams have had their current names since the 2022 seasons. Washington dropped Redskins after the 2019 season and was known as the Washington Football Team for two years before moving to Commanders.

Cleveland announced in December 2020 it would drop Indians. It announced the switch to Guardians in July 2021. In 2018, the team phased out “Chief Wahoo” as its primary logo.

The name changes had their share of supporters and critics as part of national discussions about institutions and teams to drop logos and names considered racist.

The Guardians are the fifth name for Cleveland's baseball franchise. It joined the American League in 1901 as one of the eight charter franchises as the Blues. It switched to the Bronchos a year later and used the Naps from 1903 through 1914 before moving to the Indians in 1915.

Washington started in Boston as the Redskins in 1933 before moving to the nation's capital four years later.

Washington and Cleveland share another thing in common. David Blitzer is a member of Harris' ownership group with the Commanders and holds a minority stake in the Guardians.

            The Trump administration is preparing for a historic infusion of cash into the president's sweeping mass deportation campaign that is expected to supercharge immigration enforcement nationwide — and likely place additional pressure on the already-overwhelmed federal agency at the center of it all.
    


            Since receiving its mass deportation edict after President Donald Trump took office in January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has fielded criticism from people inside the administration who think they aren't doing enough, lawmakers and advocates who think they are doing too much, and an incensed public that in some cases is taking drastic action to impede immigration enforcement.
    


            Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have repeatedly touted the work of ICE and the agents on the ground making immigration arrests. “These are strong people — tough people — that love our country,” Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. “If they weren't tough, they wouldn't survive.”
    


            While the public messaging from the president and DHS leadership has been positive, the reality for officers is far more complicated, involving tense calls with the White House daily and working around the clock amid public backlash.
    


            ICE, a Homeland Security official told CNN, “keeps getting kicked in the teeth.”
    


            Now, ICE is set to receive $75 billion in funding from the president's sweeping agenda bill for detention expansion and enforcement and removal operations, including hiring new agents. It's an unprecedented amount of cash for an agency that's historically been underfunded, and Trump administration officials are preparing to make the most of it.
    


            “We're going to come harder and faster, and we're going to take these criminals down with even more strength than we ever have before,” Noem said this month, describing how the infusion of cash will bolster her agency's immigration-enforcement apparatus.
    


            ICE is charged with arresting and detaining immigrants in the United States. For years, current and former officials say, it has struggled with limited federal funds and personnel.
    


            In multiple interagency discussions, senior Trump administration officials have been drafting plans to hire thousands more agents and drastically expand immigrant detention. White House border czar Tom Homan told CNN he's been in regular calls with ICE and US Customs and Border Protection to check on progress with contracts, though he's largely recused himself from the process given previous work, and he's in discussions over how to bring on thousands more officers and bolster the academy where they're trained.
    


            But top of mind is bringing online thousands more detention beds to keep pace with arrests.
    


            “I think we'll have 100,000 beds by the end of the year. That's a priority,” Homan said. ICE was previously funded for around 41,000 beds. Homan said some of the new beds would be in permanent buildings, and others in temporary structures like tents.
    


            The cash comes at a critical time for ICE, which was maxed out on detention space and was grappling with fewer than 200 available beds on a daily basis, according to Homan. Around 57,000 people are currently in ICE custody, according to federal data obtained by CNN.
    


            The increase in detention has been fueled by an uptick in arrests. But numbers have still not met the goal of 3,000 daily arrests set by Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's immigration policy; instead, fluctuating between 1,000 and 2,000 arrests a day, the data shows. Deportations also continue to lag, not yet outpacing the Obama administration, which was able to quickly remove recent border crossers.
    


            The pressure to pivot to immigration enforcement has also extended to components of DHS that have not typically been responsible for arresting immigrants in the interior, including the Homeland Security Investigations arm, which focuses on a wide range of criminal activity, including human trafficking and cybercrime, among other threats to national security.
    


            Homan recognized the tension among federal agencies over the prioritization of immigration enforcement and within the ICE workforce over the daily arrest quotas.
    


            “It depends on who you talk to. The quotas are very doable. But I've heard that other agencies want to get back to their mission whenever we bring more people on board, hire more immigration people,” he said. “Some people like quotas, some don't, but we all work within the framework provided by the administration.”
    


            When Trump signed his agenda bill into law, it set up ICE to be the most well-funded police force in the federal government over the next four years.
    


            “They have now the blank check to do all these things,” a former Homeland Security official told CNN.
    


            ICE alone is set to receive nearly $75 billion through 2029, including about $45 billion that is being set aside specifically to increase capacity at immigration detention centers. The other nearly $30 billion is going toward enforcement and removal — a cash windfall that will be directed toward the front-line ICE operations that involve arresting immigrants and transporting them to detention centers.
    


            The agency has long been criticized for some of its practices, but that has intensified this year along with the new arrest quotas, souring the mood among agents tasked with executing the president's controversial immigration agenda.
    


            “There's a lot of brain drain going on,” a former Homeland Security official told CNN. “Every single day they have people out on the field, holidays, weekends be damned. They're expected to have people every day.”
    


            The administration plans to make a big push toward recruiting, bringing people back who have retired, hiring from other law enforcement agencies, and increasing the capability of the academy where agents train more quickly. Messages have already gone out to retired ICE officers, asking that they return and offering financial incentives such as bonuses.
    


            “You served the United States of America with distinction and honor,” reads an email addressed to former ICE officials from Deputy Director Madison Sheahan and obtained by CNN. “Now, your country calls upon you to serve once more.”
    


            The administration is trying to determine how many classes it can put through the ICE academy at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers in Georgia by the end of the year. Hiring and training is typically a monthslong process.
    


            “As we continue hiring, we'll have classes ready to go. We'll have people in place ready to attend classes. Recruiting, hiring, No. 1, get the academies as quickly as can, and throw those people we've hired through the academy,” Homan said. “It's really important they have a larger footprint.”
    


            Tens of billions of additional dollars will flow into other aspects of Trump's immigration agenda. More than $46 billion will be funneled toward the construction and maintenance of border barriers, helping Trump to fulfill a promise he made when he mounted his first presidential campaign a decade ago.
    


            “There are all kinds of plans when we have more money,” the Homeland Security official said. “It's honestly more boots on the ground to do enforcement. It's going to be more detention space.”
    


            As ICE detentions rise, the Trump administration has put in place a series of policies that have drastically curtailed opportunities for migrants to be released and paved the way for people to be swiftly deported to countries that are not their own.
    


            While the administration has said it's going after the “worst of the worst,” federal data reveals that the majority of immigrants taken into custody don't have serious criminal convictions. The White House and Department of Homeland Security maintain that those being targeted for arrest are public safety and national security threats.
    


            That's contributed to growing alarm among immigrant advocates and attorneys, especially on the heels of new guidance that will largely prevent people who are brought into ICE custody from being released.
    


In a recent memo, the acting director of ICE told agents that immigrants who arrived in the US illegally going back decades were no longer eligible for a bond hearing while they fight their deportations in immigration court.
    


            In other words, those previously allowed to remain out on bond as their case made its way through the immigration system, which can take years, now could be taken into custody and spend months in detention.
    


            “The Trump administration is doing a complete end-run around our court system with DHS now telling immigration judges what powers they have and what they don't have — most recently with the July 8 DHS memo that strips judges of the power they've exercised for decades to decide whether a person should be detained,” said Gregory Chen, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
    


            Legal orientation programs in detention facilities have also largely been dismantled after the federal government cut funding for those programs, leaving immigrants in detention with little to no resources to navigate the arduous immigration system in the moments before they're deported.
    


            “It's a coin toss now. It used to be if you had no criminal history, you had some ties, you had connections here, more often or not you had bond and that's because we lacked the bed space to keep people detained,” another former Homeland Security official told CNN.
    


            Now that there's more bed space, the official added, “there's no reason for ICE to want to get people released.”
    


            ICE has made a visible push to deploy officers nationwide and carry out sweeps in places that have generally been off-limits, like courthouses.
    


            The agency has also stepped up raids on farms and places where day laborers congregate, like Home Depot parking lots. Those tactics have fueled tension among Republicans, some of whom have expressed concern over enforcement actions on industries where immigrants remain a vital source of labor.
    


            “We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have — maybe not,” Trump said during a June news conference, acknowledging that tension.
    


            Democratic elected officials have also criticized the agency's tactics as heavy-handed and reminiscent of some of the darkest moments in modern history.
    


            Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has described ICE under Trump as a “modern-day Gestapo.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the agency's immigration sweeps in her city last month — the catalyst for days of protests — left her “deeply angered.” California Sen. Alex Padilla said the administration's push for higher arrest and deportation numbers is making the agency and its employees “more aggressive, more cruel [and] more extreme.”
    


            “Any violence against law enforcement is unacceptable,” Padilla said on CNN earlier this month. “Do I think heated rhetoric is part of what's causing this response? Sadly, yes, and we've seen this administration escalate and escalate and escalate.”
    


            Last month, Padilla was forced to the ground and briefly handcuffed after interrupting Noem during a press conference amid tensions in Los Angeles over the administration's crackdown.
    


            In New Jersey, Rep. LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, has been indicted on charges of assaulting and impeding law enforcement stemming from a clash outside of a Newark detention facility that also led to the arrest of the city's mayor, Ras Baraka. Baraka's charges were later dropped; McIver, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to face trial in November.
    


            The third prong of pressure has come from citizens who, in some cases, are adopting increasingly militant postures to oppose ICE and the administration's enforcement actions.
    


            In some instances, which have been widely publicized by the administration, people have pelted federal law enforcement or their vehicles with rocks, bricks and other solid objects.
    


            In at least three incidents, federal immigration law enforcement has been met with gunfire: On July 4, an officer was shot during an alleged attack on an ICE detention facility in Texas. Days later, a gunman was killed after opening fire on a Customs and Border Protection facility in Texas, injuring one officer.
    


            And on July 10, federal officers conducting enforcement on a marijuana farm in California were met with gunfire, though nobody was injured.
    


            These incidents have incensed Trump. “I am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself,” he said in a July 11 social media post, “just like they protect the Public.”

Shaniqua McClendon said during an appearance on MSNBC that former President Obama should be out there speaking out against President Trump more often.

An MSNBC panelist urged former President Barack Obama to speak out more often on Saturday after he urged members of his party to "toughen up" at a recent fundraiser. 

"I know he's done being president, and many will say he doesn't owe us anything else, but I think if we are in a moment of crisis, and you've ever led this country, you should still care about this country enough to be out there. I've had this crazy thought that if every time Donald Trump did something crazy or said something crazy, Barack Obama should have a press conference or something," Shaniqua McClendon, the vice president of political strategy at Crooked Media, said during MSNBC's "The Weekend."

McClendon agreed with Obama's recent suggestion that Democrats should "toughen up," but urged the former president to get out there more himself as someone who served as president.

"He is someone who can command attention. And so part of where I don't think it's fair is, most Democrats are not Barack Obama. They can't command attention the way he can. And we're in a media environment that even if you are fighting, if no one hears you, it's not worth anything. People listen to him. So I do think it's fair," McClendon continued.

Shaniqua McClendon suggested during an appearance on MSNBC that former President Obama should be doing more to counter President Trump. 

FORMER OBAMA SPEECHWRITER ADMITS SHUNNING CONSERVATIVE IN HIS FAMILY WAS A MISTAKE

During a July fundraiser, Obama suggested members of the party should stop complaining so much.

"I think it's going to require a little bit less navel-gazing and a little less whining and being in fetal positions. And it's going to require Democrats to just toughen up," Obama said at the fundraiser, according to excerpts obtained by CNN. "Don't tell me you're a Democrat, but you're kind of disappointed right now, so you're not doing anything. No, now is exactly the time that you get in there and do something."

MSNBC host Catherine Rampell wondered if Obama would be accused of sucking up all the oxygen if he was out there more.

"He probably would be accused of that. But those people are not pushing through right now," McClendon said. 

She suggested some Democrats, such as Reps. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., were breaking through, but most were not.

"The point now is that we are in a really dire situation… Our rights are being taken away every day. And if Barack Obama is someone who can push back on that and at least get people to pay attention to the fact that that's happening, it matters a lot. And so, yeah, I think that is not an argument, I wish that was the thing we had to worry about," she added.

            On the morning of July 4, an American marketing professor was walking towards his ex-wife's house in Athens to pick up their two young children. It should have been an unremarkable, if strained visit – the couple had apparently been disputing the terms of custody arrangements.
    


            But Przemyslaw Jeziorski never made it to the front door.
    


            In broad daylight, in this typically quiet, suburban neighborhood of Greece's capital, he was shot multiple times at close range, according to police. Jeziorski died where he fell, police said, his body riddled with gunshot wounds seen in grim photographs taken in the immediate aftermath.
    


            As eyewitnesses rushed to his aid, the masked gunman fled.
    


            The alleged perpetrator, arrested 12 days later for premeditated murder: His ex-wife's new partner. The motive, he told police – to prevent Jeziorski from taking away her children.
    


            “I did it all for (her) and our children so that we could have a normal life without problems,” he said, according to a transcript of a statement he made to police in the aftermath of his arrest.

            One of the most remarkable aspects of the case is that the statements made to police by the alleged perpetrators have been widely leaked to Greek media, including a CNN affiliate, CNN Greece. The statements, verified as authentic by a senior police source speaking to CNN, offer an insight into how the alleged murder plot was put together, why it was undertaken, and provide clues as to who may have known what, and when.  But there are key questions unresolved, too – not least the role, if any, of Jeziorski's ex-wife.
    


            According to Greek police, she is facing moral accomplice charges, which she denies, according to her lawyer, who spoke to CNN. Like all the suspects in this case, her identity is known to CNN but cannot be published due to Greek legal restrictions.
    


            The alleged perpetrator's confession, and other conflicting accounts from three alleged accomplices that were also leaked to the press, sets up what is likely to be a lengthy and high-profile trial.
    


            Meanwhile, the killing and the aftermath have shocked the friends and family of the victim, who say Jeziorski was a kind and introverted academic who loved his children.
    


            Jeziorski, 43, who went by the nickname Przemek or “PJ,” was an economist and tenured professor of marketing at the University of California Berkeley's Haas School of Business. He was born in Poland and moved to the United States in 2004 to study economics and math at the University of Arizona, and he went on to obtain his PhD from Stanford.
    


            “He was one of the sharpest people I've ever met,” said Robert Kowalski, the victim's friend from Stanford. “He was a great guy, a genius in many regards.”
    


UC Berkeley said in a statement that Jeziorski “had a passion for teaching” and during his 13 years at the California university, he taught data analytics skills to more than 1,500 graduate and PhD students. His research work centered on emerging markets, which took him around the world for field research, and Berkeley described him as “a leading expert in quantitative marketing, industrial organization, and the economics of digital markets.”
    


            The dean of UC Berkeley's business school, Jenny Chatman, said she was “heartbroken” by the death of Jeziorski, who she described as a “beloved member of our marketing faculty.”
    


            Jeziorski met his ex-wife – a Greek national – in San Francisco in 2013, and they got married the following year, according to Kowalski. The couple's twins were born shortly after.
    


            In 2015, the couple co-founded a start-up called Keybee, a short-term rental property management platform.
    


            It's unclear what led to their relationship falling apart, but Kowalski told CNN the couple broke up around 2020 after moving to Greece during the Covid pandemic.
    


            Their children are dual US and Polish citizens, according to a statement from the victim's brother. The children had applied for Greek citizenship and were awaiting a decision on that, according to the ex-wife's lawyer.
    


            Jeziorski filed for divorce in June 2021, according to California court records.
    


            It appears to be one element in a years-long custody battle for the children, who ultimately lived with their mother in Greece, with a provision that their father, Jeziorski, could take the children for one month every summer.
    


            According to Kowalski, Jeziorski asked during the custody battle that his children attend an American school in Greece, so that they could be able to attend high school or college in the US one day.
    


            But his ex-wife was afraid of losing the kids much sooner, according to the statement to police from the principal suspect, her boyfriend.
    


            “We were afraid that he (Jeziorski) would end up taking the kids completely. That would completely finish off (my girlfriend), who was overly fond of them. This summer Przemek wanted to take the children and take them to America. But (my girlfriend) did not agree and so she went back to court with Przemek,” the suspect said, according to the testimony transcript.
    


            On July 3, a custody judgement ruled that Jeziorski was indeed allowed to take the children for a month.
    


            “A month and a half ago I made the decision to end this torment we were experiencing once and for all,” the suspect told police, adding that it was a “good opportunity” given that Jeziorski was in Athens to attend the custody hearing.
    


            The statement details how the suspect says he bought a pistol more than a month ago and asked a friend, who is from Bulgaria, to help him “find Przemek and scare him so that he wouldn't take our children away from us.”
    


            He said it all began in Nafplio, a coastal city about two hours from Athens, “so that it would appear that I was there” and his cell phone would “leave traces.”
    


            The suspect said that that he, his friend and two others – a man and a teenager from Albania – he paid drove to Athens and waited on the same street as the ex-wife's house, where the suspect said he knew Jeziorski was coming that afternoon to pick up the kids. “I approached him and shot him a few times, but I don't remember how many times,” he said.
    


            According to the statement, the men had rented a gray Porsche Cayenne as a getaway car, but the murder suspect told police that his accomplices left him at the scene after they saw him shoot the victim.
    


            Police said Jeziorski died at the scene, where seven bullet casings were found after a masked gunman shot him in the neck and chest.
    


            The three unnamed men who allegedly helped, two Albanian nationals and a Bulgarian national, are facing accomplice charges, police announced Thursday. The suspected accomplices – one of whom is a minor – have confessed to their peripheral involvement in the killing, a Greek police source told CNN on Thursday. CNN has been unable to reach attorneys for those men.
    


            “My client has confessed his actions but as you can see from the simplicity of some of the things that took place this was not an organized plan. His accomplices only knew about a plan to scare him (the victim) so he would stay away from the children,” the main suspect's lawyer, Ermis Papoutsis, told CNN. “(The ex-wife), his partner, knew nothing about any of this.”
    


            “My client had come to me in the past to seek advice. He had said his partner's ex-husband had serious alcoholism issues and that he and the mother were worried about allowing access to the kids. He wanted to see if there was something he could legally do about limiting access,” the lawyer added. “Now he is completely devastated after what happened. We will ask for a psychiatric examination because he has had some issues in the past.”
    


            Jeziorski's friends have denied the allegations that he abused alcohol.
    


            On Friday, CNN Greece obtained the police testimony of the alleged accomplice from Bulgaria, which contradicts the account of the alleged gunman. In this account, the alleged accomplice claims the victim's ex-wife had “organized the whole thing.”
    


            He described his friend, the perpetrator, obtaining a gun and then asking “me to find some people to take him to Athens the next day to scare and threaten the Pole so that he would ‘back down' on custody of the children.”
    


            “In fact, from what he told me, (the ex-wife) made him do it because she didn't want to give the children to the Pole,” the accomplice said in the testimony,” adding that the perpetrator offered him thousands of euros after he “did something we hadn't agreed on.”
    


            As for the ex-wife – beyond the statement of her lawyer, denying all knowledge, there is no further information about her testimony. For reasons that unclear, nothing from her statements to police have made their way to the Greek media.
    


            These inconsistencies – and other unanswered questions – will all be dealt with at the trial.
    


            Meanwhile, the victim's family are dealing with the aftermath of an unimaginable tragedy. The victim's brother said in a statement that “our family is heartbroken,” but grateful to Greek police and security professionals who made the arrests.
    


            “Przemek's ten-year-old children, who are US and Polish citizens, are now under care in accordance with Greek child custody procedures,” the victim's brother Łukasz Jeziorski said in a statement. “Our primary concern is their safety and wellbeing, and helping them reconnect with their family to minimize the trauma they have already endured.”
    


            Jeziorski's family started an online fundraiser to repatriate his remains to his native Poland and pay for legal representation in Greece.
    


            A US State Department spokesperson told CNN the agency is providing consular assistance to the family.
    


            On Monday, the five people charged will appear in person in court for their plea, according to Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, the lawyer representing the victim's family. The court will determine whether the suspects will be remanded in custody pending the trial. A trial date will be set at a later stage, Dimitrakopoulos told CNN.
    


            “The victim's mother and brother will take sole custody of the children,” Dimitrakopoulos told Greek media on Friday. The lawyer said that “we've talked to the prosecutor for minors so that the victim's mom and brother can get full custody of the kids and live with them in Poland, where they are now.”
    


            “They have the opportunity to raise them in a loving environment, in a completely protective environment,” Dimitrakopoulos said, adding that “if the mother is acquitted, because we respect the presumption of innocence, then she has the right to request sole custody of her children.”

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who represents a slice of the Rio Grande Valley along the border with Mexico, won his last congressional election by just over 5,000 votes.

That makes him a tempting target for Republicans, who are poised to redraw the state's congressional maps this coming week and devise five new winnable seats for the GOP that would help the party avoid losing House control in the 2026 elections. Adjusting the lines of Gonzalez's district to bring in a few thousand more Republican voters, while shifting some Democratic ones out, could flip his seat.

Gonzalez said he is not worried. Those Democratic voters will have to end up in one of the Republican districts that flank Gonzalez's current one, making those districts more competitive — possibly enough so it could flip the seats to Democrats.

“Get ready for some pickup opportunities,” Gonzalez said, adding that his party is already recruiting challengers to Republicans whose districts they expect to be destabilized by the process. “We're talking to some veterans, we're talking to some former law enforcement.”

Texas has 38 seats in the House. Republicans now hold 25 and Democrats 12, with one seat vacant after Democrat Sylvester Turner, a former Houston mayor, died in March.

Gonzalez's district — and what happens to the neighboring GOP-held ones — is at the crux of President Donald Trump's high-risk, high-reward push to get Texas Republicans to redraw their political map. Trump is seeking to avoid the traditional midterm letdown that most incumbent presidents endure and hold onto the House, which the GOP narrowly controls.




Trump's push comes as there are numerous political danger signs for his presidency, both in the recent turmoil over his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and in new polling. Surveys from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show most U.S. adults think his policies have not helped them and that his tax cut and spending bill will help the wealthy.

The fear of accidentally creating unsafe seats is one reason Texas Republicans drew their lines cautiously in 2021, when the constitutionally mandated redistricting process kicked off in all 50 states. Mapmakers — in most states, it's the party that controls the legislature — must adjust congressional and state legislative lines after every 10-year census to ensure that districts have about the same number of residents.

That is a golden opportunity for one party to rig the map against the other, a tactic known as gerrymandering. But there is a term, too, for so aggressively redrawing a map that it puts that party's own seats at risk: a “dummymander.”

The Texas GOP knows the risk. In the 2010s, the Republican-controlled Legislature drew political lines that helped pad the GOP's House majority. That lasted until 2018, when a backlash against Trump in his first term led Democrats to flip two seats in Texas that Republicans had thought safe.

In 2021, with Republicans still comfortably in charge of the Texas Statehouse, the party was cautious, opting for a map that mainly shored up their incumbents rather than targeted Democrats.

Still, plenty of Republicans believe their Texas counterparts can safely go on offense.

“Smart map-drawing can yield pickup opportunities while not putting our incumbents in jeopardy,” said Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which helps coordinate mapmaking for the party nationally..

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature, which starts Monday, to comply with Trump's request to redraw the congressional maps and to address the flooding in Texas Hill Country that killed at least 135 people this month.

Democratic state lawmakers are talking about staying away from the Capitol to deny the Legislature the minimum number needed to convene. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton posted that any Democrats who did that should be arrested.

Lawmakers can be fined up to $500 a day for breaking a quorum after the House changed its rules when Democrats initiated a walkout in 2021. Despite the new penalties, state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, who led the walkout in 2021, left open the possibility of another.

“I don't think anybody should underestimate the will of Texas Democrats,” he said.

Texas is not the only Republican state engaged in mid-decade redistricting. After staving off a ballot measure to expand the power of a mapmaking commission last election, Ohio Republicans hope to redraw their congressional map from a 10-5 one favoring the GOP to one as lopsided as 13-2, in a state Trump won last year with 55% of the vote.

Some Democratic leaders have suggested that states where their party is in control should counter the expected redraw in Texas. “We have to be absolutely ruthless about getting back in power,” former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said Sunday on CNN.

But Democrats have fewer options. More of the states the party controls do not allow elected partisans to draw maps and entrust independent commissions to draw fair lines.

Among them is California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has floated the long shot idea of working around the state's commission.

The few Democratic-controlled states that do allow elected officials to draw the lines, such as Illinois, have already seen Democrats max out their advantages.

Trump and his allies have been rallying Texas Republicans to ignore whatever fears they may and to go big.

On Tuesday, the president posted on his social media site a reminder of his record in the state last November: “Won by one and a half million Votes, and almost 14%. Also, won all of the Border Counties along Mexico, something which has never happened before. I keep hearing about Texas ‘going Blue,' but it is just another Democrat LIE.”

Texas has long been eyed as a state trending Democratic because of its growing nonwhite population. But those communities swung right last year and helped Trump expand his margin to 14 percentage points, a significant improvement on his 6-point win in 2020.

Michael Li, a Texas native and longtime watcher of the state at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, said there's no way to know whether that trend will continue in next year's elections or whether the state will return to its blue-trending ways.

“Anyone who can tell you what the politics of Texas looks like for the balance of the decade has a better crystal ball than I do,” Li said.

One region of the state where Republican gains have been steady is the Rio Grande Valley, which runs from the Gulf of Mexico along much of the state's southern border. The heavily Hispanic region, where many Border Patrol officers live, has rallied around Trump's tough-on-immigration, populist message.

As a result, Gonzalez and the area's other Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, have seen their reelection campaigns get steadily tighter. They are widely speculated to be the two top targets of the new map.

The GOP is expected to look to the state's three biggest cities to find its other Democratic targets. If mapmakers scatter Democratic voters from districts in the Houston, Dallas and Austin areas, they could get to five additional seats.

But in doing so, Republicans face a legal risk on top of their electoral one: that they break up districts required by the Voting Rights Act to have a critical amount of certain minority groups. The goal of the federal law is to enable those communities to elect representatives of their choosing.

The Texas GOP already is facing a lawsuit from civil rights groups alleging its initial 2021 map did this. If this year's redistricting is too aggressive, it could trigger a second complaint.

“It's politically and legally risky,” Li said of the redistricting strategy. “It's throwing caution to the winds.”

As rounds of layoffs continue within a historically strong stock market and resilient economy, it is still uncommon for companies to link job cuts directly to AI replacement technology.  

IBM was an outlier when its CEO told the Wall Street Journal in May that 200 HR employees were let go and replaced with AI chatbots, while also stating that the company's overall headcount is up as it reinvests elsewhere. 

Fintech company Klarna has been among the most transparent in discussing how AI is transforming – and shrinking – its workforce. "The truth is, the company has shrunk from about 5,000 to now almost 3,000 employees," Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told CNBC's "Power Lunch" in May. "If you go to LinkedIn and look at the jobs, you'll see how we're shrinking."

But employment experts suspect that IBM and Klarna are not alone in AI-related purges. It's just that firms often limit their explanations to terms like reorganization, restructuring, and optimization, and that terminology could be AI in disguise.

"What we're likely seeing is AI-driven workforce reshaping, without the public acknowledgment," said Christine Inge, an instructor of professional and executive development at Harvard University. "Very few organizations are willing to say, 'We're replacing people with AI,' even when that's effectively what's happening."

"Many companies are relying on these euphemisms as a shield," said Jason Leverant, chief operating officer and president of AtWork Group, a national staffing franchise that provides over 40,000 workers to companies across a variety of sectors. Leverant says it is much easier to frame workforce reductions as a component of a broader operational strategy than admitting that they are tied directly to efficiencies found as a result of AI implementation. "Companies laying off as they embrace large-scale AI adoption is much too coincidental to ignore," Leverant said.

Candice Scarborough, director of cybersecurity and software engineering at Parsons Corporation, said it is clear from recent strong earnings that layoffs are not a response to financial struggles. "They align suspiciously well with the rollout of large AI systems. That suggests that jobs are being eliminated after AI tools are introduced, not before,"  Scarborough said. 

She added that the use of vaguer terms can be better messaging. Restructuring sounds proactive; business optimization sounds strategic; and a focus on cost structures feels impartial. "But the result is often the same: displacement by software. Sandbagging these cuts under bland language helps companies avoid 'AI backlash' while still moving ahead with automation," Scarborough said.

Many companies are cutting roles in content, operations, customer service, and HR — functions where generative AI and agentic tools are increasingly capable — while messaging the corporate decisions as "efficiency" moves despite healthy balance sheets.

"This silence is strategic," Inge said. "Being explicit about AI displacement invites blowback from employees, the public, and even regulators. Staying vague helps preserve morale and manage optics during the transition behind the scenes."

Inge and other experts say there is also a measure of risk management in decisions to de-emphasize AI in job elimination. Even companies eager to leverage AI to replace workers often realize they overestimated what the technology can do.

"There's absolutely an AI undercurrent behind many of today's 'efficiency' layoffs, especially in back-office and customer service roles," said Taylor Goucher, vice president of sales and marketing at Connext Global, an IT outsourcing firm. Companies are investing heavily in automation, Goucher says, but companies are sometimes forced to backpedal.

"AI might automate 70%–90% of a process, but the last mile still needs the human touch, especially for QA, judgment calls, and edge cases," Goucher said.

Sticking to a hybrid model of human plus AI would make more sense for the early adoption phase, but once the jobs are gone, companies are more likely to turn to third-party hiring firms or overseas markets before any U.S.-based jobs come back. "When the AI doesn't work out, they quietly outsource or rehire globally to bridge the gap," Goucher said.

Most firms will limit information about these labor market strategic shifts.

"They fear backlash from employees, customers, and investors skeptical of half-baked AI promises," Goucher said. Many companies tout their AI strategy publicly, while quietly hiring skilled offshore teams to handle what AI can't, he added. "It's a strategy, but not always a complete one. Leaders need to be more honest about where AI adds value, and where human expertise is still irreplaceable," he said.

Inge agrees that while AI can do a lot, it can't replace a whole human, yet.

"AI can do a lot of things 90%. AI writes better ad copy, but human judgment is still required. That 10% where human judgment is needed, we are not going to see that replaced in the near term.  Some companies are getting rid of 100% of it, but it will come back to bite them," Inge said.

Mike Sinoway, CEO of San Francisco software company LucidWorks, said the limitations with current AI — and a more pervasive lack of certainty in the C-suite about adoption — are reasons to believe AI has not been directly responsible for many layoffs yet. Rather than ducking the issue of where AI is already replacing workers, Sinoway said his firm's research suggests "higher-ups are panicking because their AI efforts aren't panning out."

Starting two to three years ago, freelancers were among the first employees that companies were direct with in discussing AI's role in job cuts. 

"Often, they are being told they are being replaced with an AI tool," Inge said. "People are willing to say that to a 1099 person," she added. 

Copywriting, graphic design, and video editing have borne the brunt of the changes, according to Inge, and now the labor shift has begun to work its way into the full-time force. Inge says that transparency is the best policy, but that may not be enough. She pointed to the backlash that language learning company Duolingo faced when CEO Luis von Ahn announced plans earlier this year to phase out contractors in favor of AI, and then was forced to walk back some of his comments.

"After the huge backlash that Duolingo faced, companies are afraid to say that is what they are doing.  People are going to get angry that AI is replacing jobs," Inge said.

For now, the job market is solid, if showing some signs of softening in the first half of the year. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in June 2025, which according to Trading Economics, signals broad labor market stability. But there is also general agreement that over time, the pace of AI-linked job change will accelerate. According to the World Economic Forum's 2025 Future of Jobs report, 41% of employers worldwide intend to reduce their workforce in the next five years due to AI automation. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently predicted generative AI like his firm's Claude large language model could wipe out up to half of entry-level officer worker jobs.

There will be a tipping point in the future when companies will be more uniformly transparent, but by that time, AI's role in the labor market will be obvious. 

"By then it won't matter," Inge said. "Job losses will be extremely large, the only thing we can do as individuals is adapt."

Start spreading the news: Retirees are moving out of New York City.

As well as other major cities, including Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Denver and San Diego, California, according to a June study by SmartAsset, which analyzed data from the Census Bureau's latest American Community Survey.

These cities experienced the highest net loss of residents aged 60 and over in 2023, meaning significantly more people in the age group moved out than moved in.

While larger cities could have higher net migration numbers because they have more people, what stands out about New York is the scale of retirees leaving: Nearly 24,000 seniors left the city in a single year — more than triple the number who moved in, and more than three times the net outflow of the next-highest city.

Four of the top 10 cities retirees left were in California, which had the highest net loss of residents aged 60 and over. The state lost 56,858 residents over 60 in 2023, according to the study.

Here are the top 10 U.S. cities retirees fled in 2023, ranked by the highest net outflow of people aged 60 and over.

Retirees may choose to move for various reasons, such as being closer to family, enjoying better weather or taking advantage of more favorable tax laws, but a high cost of living can also be a major factor in deciding to leave a city.

In September, WalletHub ranked New York City as the priciest city to retire in, and a majority of the top 10 cities that retirees are leaving are in states where you typically need over $1 million in savings to retire comfortably, according to an analysis by GOBankingRates earlier this year.

In New York state, you can expect to need around $1.3 million in savings to retire, while in California you'll need about $1.6 million, the analysis says.

As parents, we spend so much time helping our kids succeed on the outside — teaching them words, setting routines, and encouraging good behavior.

But there's one skill that quietly shapes whether they'll be successful in life: self-connection, or the ability to tune into one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice. When kids feel safe in who they are, they carry that sense of worth into every relationship, challenge, and decision. When they don't, it can unravel their self-esteem from the inside out.

I've spent years studying over 200 parent-child relationships, and I'm a mother myself. The No. 1 thing I tell other parents is that if they teach their kid just one skill in life, it needs to be self-connection.

The loss of self-connection happens in small, well-meaning interactions that send the wrong message. A toddler cries after a toy is taken away. A parent says, "You're okay. It's not a big deal." What the child hears is: "My feelings don't matter."

Or they might say they're scared at bedtime. The parent responds, "There's nothing to be scared of." To the child, it can feel like: "I shouldn't feel this way, so I guess I shouldn't trust my feelings."

Subtle messages like this, repeated over time, chip away at a child's ability to connect with themselves. They then become more anxious, reactive, insecure, or they'll shut down entirely. Even worse, they can carry those patterns into adulthood.

But here's how self-connection adds value to their lives:

The good news? You don't need to overhaul your parenting style to help your kids stay self-connected. Small shifts make a big difference.

Resist the urge to say, "You're fine." Instead, try: "That was upsetting, wasn't it? I'm here."

Validation doesn't mean agreement. It means showing your child that their emotional world is real and safe to express. This helps them develop trust in their feelings, which is a key component of self-connection.

Give spaces for messy emotions, hard questions, and quirky traits. When kids feel seen and accepted, even when they're angry or scared, they learn: "All of me is welcome."

This sense of belonging strengthens self-worth and emotional confidence well into adulthood.

Micromanaging chips away at self-trust. Give your child age-appropriate choices, whether it's picking their outfit, managing sibling dynamics, or deciding how to spend their afternoon.

Letting them experiment and recover in a safe space helps them build their inner voice and resilience.

Say things like: "I'm feeling overwhelmed. I need to take a deep breath."

When you name and regulate your own emotions, your child learns that feelings aren't something to fear or suppress — they're signals that can be acknowledged and handled.

Swap "Why did you do that?" for: "What were you feeling when that happened?"

A curious, compassionate tone invites introspection. And over time, your words become their internal dialogue.

When a child lashes out, it's easy to focus on the yelling or refusal. But behavior is often a message: Are they feeling disconnected? Powerless? Unheard?

Meeting the need behind the behavior helps your child understand they're not "bad," they're just human.

Yes, achievements matter. But also notice and name the qualities that often go unseen: "You're so thoughtful with your friends," or, "I love how curious you are."

These reminders reinforce the idea that they're loved for who they are, not just what they achieve.

A car slammed into a crowd outside a Los Angeles nightclub early Saturday morning, injuring at least 30 people, before the driver was assaulted by onlookers and shot, the city's police and fire departments said.

At least seven people were in critical condition and six others were seriously injured, the fire department said in an online statement.

The incident, which took place outside a club called The Vermont, occurred just before 2 a.m. local time (0900 GMT), the fire and police departments said.

Captain Adam VanGerpen, a fire department spokesperson, was quoted by ABC News as saying the car apparently first careened into a taco truck outside the club and then through a valet stand and into a large group of people.

The Los Angeles Police Department said on X it was still investigating why the driver slammed into the crowd.

Officers responding to a radio call of an assault with a deadly weapon found the driver had been shot while being assaulted by onlookers, the police said, adding that he was taken to a hospital and his condition was unknown.

A man suspected of shooting the driver fled the scene on foot and possibly was armed with a silver revolver, the police said.

Typhoon Wipha toppled trees and caused major flight disruptions Sunday in Hong Kong and at some nearby airports in China as it moved west off the southern coast of the country.

Airports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and the casino hub of Macao canceled or postponed flights for most of the day, according to their websites. Hong Kong grounded at least 400 flights, affecting around 80,000 passengers, broadcaster RTHK said. Some high-speed train services were also suspended.

The typhoon stayed just offshore until about 6 p.m., when it made landfall in a coastal area of Taishan city in Guangdong province, China's National Meteorological Center said. It then weakened to a severe tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 108 kph (67 mph).

Earlier Sunday, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a hurricane signal No. 10, its highest warning. The eye of the storm passed just south of the city around midday with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph (87 mph), the observatory said.

The high winds brought down trees in Zhuhai and other cities on China's southern coast.

In Hong Kong, vehicles weaved around branches strewn on the streets. The government said that it had received more than 450 reports of fallen trees and that 26 people had sought medical treatment at public hospitals. A statement didn't provide details on any injuries.

More than 250 people had sought refuge in public shelters, the statement said. Hong Kong Disneyland and other amusement parks were closed.

The storm, which reached typhoon strength overnight, later passed off Macao and was forecast to make landfall on China's coast late Sunday. It is expected to reach Vietnam later this week.

Wipha, which is a Thai name, passed over the Philippines at tropical storm strength and drenched parts of Taiwan on Saturday. Names for typhoons in the western Pacific are chosen by the countries in the region.

In the Philippines, the storm intensified seasonal monsoon rains, leaving at least one villager dead in floodwaters in northern Cagayan province.

More than 370,000 people have been affected by days of stormy weather, including 43,000 who fled to government-run emergency shelters or homes of relatives because of flooding, landslides and fierce winds. More than 400 houses were damaged, officials said.

Elsewhere in Asia, five days of torrential rain in South Korea has left 14 people dead and 12 others missing, the government said Sunday.

Next week, the CNBC teams are back on the road – and it's all about the banks and the ECB. From Frankfurt to Milan, and Paris to London, the financials are in focus.

The markets seem to be banking on the financial sector to keep up the positive earnings momentum this quarter. Citi described the first quarter as "remarkably resilient," with analysts now expecting Stoxx 600 earnings-per-share growth to turn positive year-on-year this quarter.

Much of that optimism is centered on the big banks, while other sectors like luxury, autos and energy have been plagued by earnings downgrades.

Unicredit kicks things off on Wednesday. The Italian banking giant will try to keep investors focused on the numbers, rather than its M&A ambitions. While its moves around Commerzbank have seen it increase its equity stake to 20%, Saxo Bank analysts highlight the uncertainty around its potential takeover of Banco BPM, after an Italian court blocked the move until further conditions are met. The stock is up over 50% so far this year, providing some cheer for CEO Andrea Orcel as he battles to keep his expansion plans on track.

French financial BNP Paribas — the euro zone's largest lender by assets — reports earnings on Thursday.

Last quarter, the bank soared past expectations driven by performance at its investment bank, but revised its profitability target slightly lower.

On the same day, attention will turn to Frankfurt for Deutsche Bank's latest set of numbers. The German lender logged its best profit in 14 years last quarter, benefiting from increased trading volumes around the market volatility. CEO Christian Sewing told CNBC in June that he sees an opportunity for Europe to invest more in its own defense sector as a key growth area.

For macro-watchers, the highlight of the week in Europe will come from the European Central Bank. President Christine Lagarde and her fellow policymakers are expected to keep rates on hold at 2% on Thursday. But there is a BIG catch…

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats are not expected to derail this meeting's outcome, according to Reuters, citing five ECB governing council member sources. But if Trump does push ahead with 30% tariffs on EU imports, there is a broad assumption the ECB will cut rates in response.

Investors will have until Sept. 11 to assess the impact, as the ECB breaks for the summer after this week's meeting.

In terms of the underlying economic conditions, Deutsche Bank warns that European inflation risks are "still being underestimated, with a remarkable complacency across key assets," with the tariff impact yet to fully trickle through.

The bank's macro strategist also told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe that the Aug. 1 tariff deadline for negotiations between the U.S. and EU sets the stage for a late outcome to trigger a "very sharp market reaction."

In the ultra-competitive world of artificial intelligence, dealmaking sometimes must be a frantic, around-the-clock affair.

The recent deal between AI startup Windsurf and Cognition, which took place over a single weekend sprint, was no exception.

To sum it up: The industry's most successful AI startup, OpenAI, was initially set to acquire Windsurf, which makes an AI coding assistant, in a $3 billion deal. But the deal fell through, and Google swooped in to hire away its CEO and some of its top executives. 

That left the company's remaining executives scrambling to figure out what to do next and to break the news to the company's 250 employees, who were anticipating a windfall from the OpenAI deal.

"It was my job to explain to the company our path forward," Windsurf's new CEO, Jeff Wang, wrote in a post on X. Wang was formerly the company's head of business. He had planned to discuss the options — fundraising from VCs, selling the company to someone else, distributing remaining cash, or just keeping it going.

"The mood was very bleak," Wang wrote. "Some people were upset about financial outcomes or colleagues leaving, while others were worried about the future. A few were in tears."

Later that day, a ray of light emerged. Wang said Cognition cofounder Scott Wu, and its president, Russell Kaplan, reached out. They wanted what was left of Windsurf.

Cognition makes the AI coding agent Devin, which it calls "the first AI software engineer." It is valued at $4 billion, coming off a $120 million funding round in March, according to PitchBook.

Wang saw the melding of the company's products as a potential win-win. 

"Devin would benefit from a foreground synchronous agent, while we needed a remote asynchronous agent," he wrote. Added to that, he was excited about both companies sharing talent.

The dealmaking kicked off immediately. They brought in lawyers and spent all weekend hashing it out.

In just over 24 hours, they had signed a letter of intent, the first step. A key part of the deal was prioritizing Windsurf employees — ensuring payouts, waiving cliffs, and accelerating equity vesting, Wang said.

Lawyers pored over the deal all day Sunday, and by Monday morning, it was finalized. One lawyer called the deal "one of the fastest" they had ever seen, Wang wrote.

When the deal was at last announced to Windsurf's employees Monday morning, Wang said they celebrated.

"The applause from our people seemed to last forever, and I was on the verge of tears myself," Wang said.

 Strategy continues accumulating Bitcoin as it hits all-time highs in July, and the total crypto market cap breaches the $4 trillion mark. 

Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor signaled an impending Bitcoin (BTC) purchase on Sunday, as the company's total holdings crossed $71 billion.

The treasury company's most recent purchase occurred on July 14, when it bought 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, bringing its total holdings to 601,550 BTC, valued at over $71.4 billion.

The company is up about 66.5% on its Bitcoin investment, accounting for over $28.5 billion in unrealized gains, according to SaylorTracker.

Bitcoin treasury companies, led by Strategy, continue to be one of the main drivers of Bitcoin demand in the current market cycle, alongside exchange-traded funds (ETFs), institutional investors, and centralized crypto exchanges.

The company's stock surged by about 21.52% in the last month, bringing Strategy's total valuation to over $118 billion. 

Strategy's stock rally came amid a rise in the crypto market, with the total crypto market capitalization crossing the $4 trillion mark in July and Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high.

In December 2024, the BTC treasury company entered the Nasdaq 100 stock market index as institutional demand for Strategy's stock grew.

Certain institutional investors want exposure to Bitcoin but cannot hold Bitcoin directly in their investment funds. These investors hold shares of Bitcoin treasury companies or purchase their corporate debt products as a proxy for holding BTC.

“There are trillions of dollars of managed capital, and some of that has strict mandates associated with it,” macroeconomist Lyn Alden wrote. 

“There are stock funds where the portfolio manager can only buy stocks. He or she cannot buy bonds, ETFs, or commodities,” Alden gave as an example of the types of restrictions placed on asset managers.

Vanguard, one of the biggest institutional investment firms, has long opposed holding Bitcoin or offering Bitcoin directly to clients, but now holds 20 million shares of Strategy, or about 8% of the company's outstanding stock.

The investment firm's indirect exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded company highlights Bitcoin's integration into traditional finance through legacy investment vehicles.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Cryptocurrency analysis company Alphractal has issued a cautionary report regarding the altcoin market, highlighting both the potential for higher returns and the risks associated with investing in these digital assets. The report notes that altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in recent days, with investors achieving higher returns by taking positions in altcoins instead of BTC, according to daily signals.

However, Alphractal's report also includes a warning signal: the Correlation Heatmap. This map indicates that the average correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin is rapidly declining, even turning negative in some cases. This suggests that altcoins are no longer tracking Bitcoin's price movements, which could be a precursor to high volatility and mass liquidations of long or short positions. According to Alphractal's analysis, this low correlation has historically been observed before periods of increased market volatility.

Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson emphasized the importance of Bitcoin's correlation with classic market indicators, such as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Wedson noted that Bitcoin's current low, even negative, correlation with the VIX suggests that BTC is moving more independently from the S&P 500. Historically, this has coincided with periods of increased volatility and often price rallies in the following year. Wedson advised investors to be cautious, stating that if the VIX is low, it could indicate an explosive move for Bitcoin, but if the VIX is high, it might be more prudent to monitor stocks due to potential market fear impacting BTC.

Prominent crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also issued a warning to beginners about the risks associated with altcoins. While altcoins have the potential for significant returns, they also come with amplified risks. Van de Poppe's caution is timely, given the current market conditions and the potential for increased volatility. The recent divergence in the correlation between Bitcoin and altcoins, as shown in a heatmap, could be a sign of increasing market volatility. This divergence suggests that altcoins may not follow Bitcoin's price movements as closely as they have in the past, which could lead to a severe price downturn for altcoins.

An on-chain analyst also noted the decoupling of Bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies or altcoins, which could lead to a severe price downturn within the altcoin market. This warning is based on on-chain metrics that signal overextension in the Bitcoin market, which could have a ripple effect on altcoins. Bitcoin's recent peak has triggered warnings of a potential local top as on-chain metrics signal overextension. The overall trend classification for the crypto market remains "weak bullish," but multiple technical indicators are flashing warning signs that suggest potential downward pressure.

Despite the warnings, some altcoins, such as Binance Coin and Ethereum, have shown impressive price action. Binance Coin has surpassed resistance levels as its ecosystem thrives, particularly in decentralized exchanges. Ethereum has also seen a significant price increase, reclaiming the $3,000 level. While this price action could be a sign of increased investor confidence, it also comes with its own set of risks and could indicate increased volatility in the altcoin market.

Elon Musk has also warned against excessive investment in cryptocurrencies, urging caution. His advice aligns with the warnings issued by other analysts about the risks associated with altcoins. Musk's role in the crypto market remains a topic of discussion, with some speculating that he could be an active player in the future.

In summary, the current warnings from analysts about the risks associated with altcoins are timely and relevant. The potential for increased volatility in the altcoin market, as well as the decoupling of Bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies, are factors that investors should consider. The recent price action of altcoins, such as Binance Coin and Ethereum, could be a sign of increased investor confidence, but it also comes with its own set of risks. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before investing in altcoins.

"This is not the age to offer new mechanics with each and every new game."

The director behind ICO and Shadow of the Colossus believes the days of creating new and innovative gameplay mechanics "has already passed".

In an interview with To a T and Karamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi earlier this year, Fumito Ueda praised To a T, commending Takahashi for "not relying on unique gameplay mechanics".

Talking to Denfaminicogamer, Ueda said he called up Takahashi when To a T was revealed, wanting to know if the unusual game involved any new or complicated mechanics to play. When Takahashi revealed it did not, he responded with a simple: "That's great!"

Reminded of this exchange during his interview with Takahashi, Ueda joked "ah, these are the words of a professional", but then expanded on the comment, explaining that what he meant was that contemporary games felt over-concerned with gameplay (thanks, Automaton).

"While I don't know why I replied with 'that's great' back then, I was most likely thinking – the age of gameplay mechanics had already passed," Ueda said. "I guess this is not the age to release new devices or offer new mechanics with each and every new game.

"Even if there's nothing novel about the mechanics, you can push the game further with a certain vibe or artwork, he added. "Personal preferences aside, what I'm saying is – I think it would be better to give already existing game mechanics more definition."

Ueda believes this is why he enjoyed To a T so much; rather than innovating or inventing complex control schemes and mechanics, it instead concentrated on its visuals and story to tell a tale about what it's like to live with a disability.

Interestingly, our Donlan took away a different take. "Over the five or six hours it takes to play To a T, I've had a series of revelations that in turn built to one giant revelation: I have had the wrong idea about pretty much everything here," Donlan wrote when he gave To a T a try.

"As a result, I've never played a game where I spent so much of the time simply trying to work out what it's doing. What's the intent, To a T? What do you want to be? It turns out I wouldn't truly understand any of this until the final credits had rolled. In fact, I'm still thinking about a lot of it."

Ethereum's ether (ETH) rose nearly 6% during the past 24-hour period, rising above $3,800, outperforming the CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader gauge of the digital assets market. 

The move comes as major financial institutions and treasury companies have started to pour capital into the digital asset, while Wall Street's heavyweights are starting to pay attention to ETH. Most recently, U.S.-listed spot ether ETFs saw record inflows of $2.18 billion over the past week, which was dubbed as "crypto week" as major crypto legislation was passed by the regulators. 

The rally also coincides with some whales moving a massive amount of ETH on-chain over the weekend. According to on-chain analyst EmberCN, over the weekend, one ETH whale seems to have accumulated around $50 million of the token, at an average price of $3,714. 

Meanwhile, some analysts are expecting ETH prices to surge much higher than current levels. Most recently, Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat, CIO of Fundstrat Capital, and Chairman of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), cited various analyses and said that the price could reach as high as $15,000. 

Before hitting the $3,800 levels, ETH traded within a $255.34 range between a session low of $3,534.57 and a high of $3,789.92 in the last 24 hours, representing 7.22% volatility, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. 

Key resistance levels formed at $3,760-$3,790, where trading activity consolidated following multiple upward attempts. The model showed that large buying support seems to have emerged around $3,590-$3,610 during early trading hours as transaction volumes surpassed the 24-hour average of 215,432 units. 

This consistent upward momentum with successive higher lows potentially indicates ongoing institutional capital allocation, positioning ETH for a possible rally beyond current resistance thresholds.

The Ethereum price has been renewed for a bullish run lately with its breakout above $3500 a few days ago. Following Ethereum price predictions from top analysts, we could see the coin hit $5000 this year as analysts debate the impact of the new breakout. However, a new factor experts are now looking into is the potential approval of the BlackRock Ethereum ETF staking proposal.

Is the Ethereum price prediction of $5000 still possible this year? Current realities and a projection of the staking ETF approval could play a major role for us to answer this question.

One area that has continued getting attention from analysts in the recently filed BlackRock ETF proposal is its effect on Ethereum liquidity. Analysts believe this could be a significant factor in boosting billions in fund inflow and institutional adoption. This has, in turn, given rise to different Ethereum price predictions, with some speculating a figure as high as $10,000.

The current market shows a strong bullish sentiment, which could validate an Ethereum price prediction of $5000. Furthermore, an approval at this moment could see a liquidity boost of up to $10B in inflow, taking the Bitcoin ETF direction.



The BlackRock ETH Staking ETF proposal could reshape the market, drastically reducing sell pressure towards a price breakout. While over 28% of ETH is already staked, the approval of the staking could help Ethereum price hold a firm grip on the $3500 support. This is because of the significant drop in sell pressure due to reduced liquid supply with a rise in staked ETH.

A drop in the selling pressure could offer good support to the Ethereum price prediction to actualise as the price moves to break the ATH towards $5,000.



As Ethereum price prediction draws in new interest, the Remittix token also shakes the whales' circle with an imminent price breakout. This year, Remittix hit a milestone that made analysts believe it could be the next Altcoin to 100x. Here's why Remittix is becoming a big deal among investors this year:

AIXA Miner




Denver, Colorado, July  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  As the global cryptocurrency infrastructure continues to mature, a growing divide has emerged between large-scale institutional blockchain adoption and the accessibility of underlying mining technologies. In response, leading cloud mining platforms are rethinking how to scale operations while maintaining inclusivity for a broader range of users.

AIXA Miner, a U.S.-based cloud mining operator, recently announced infrastructure updates aimed at addressing this industry-wide challenge—developments that coincide with a renewed wave of institutional interest in blockchain infrastructure and asset-backed mining contracts.

According to a 2025 report by Statista, the global cloud mining market is projected to exceed $7.3 billion by 2028, driven largely by enterprise blockchain deployment and passive-income investment models. These trends are reinforcing the need for platforms that can balance regulatory compliance, high-volume hash power, and usability for both corporations and individuals.

In a press release published on Yahoo Finance earlier this week, AIXA Miner outlined a suite of upgrades including integration with Gemini 2.5 Pro, a real-time AI engine used to optimize mining allocations based on transaction costs and network load. These updates also expanded backend support for large-scale contracts and institutional wallet integrations, timed alongside Bitcoin's recent surge past $117,000 per coin.

“What we're seeing now is a convergence of interest from traditional financial firms and DeFi-native institutions. Many are looking for mining solutions that don't require hardware investment but still offer performance transparency,” said Elina Chambers, Head of Infrastructure Strategy at AIXA Miner. “Our role is to enable that transition—without excluding individual participants who helped shape the ecosystem.”

This development reflects a broader industry trend: decentralized infrastructure as a service. As blockchain moves beyond tokenization into supply chains, finance, and data privacy, mining operations are becoming more than just reward generators; they're foundational compute layers. Institutional investors now demand verifiable uptime, audited compliance, and secure API access for treasury operations, all while being increasingly conscious of sustainability metrics.

AIXA Miner's hybrid model, combining contract-based mining for individuals with institutional-grade ASIC/GPU deployment—addresses these priorities through geographic dispersion, energy diversification, and encrypted reporting layers. Recent expansion efforts have centered on renewable-powered data centers across North America and Southeast Asia.

While these developments are relevant to institutional actors, the company maintains that everyday users remain core to its growth strategy. The platform retains smart contract–based daily payout structures and entry-level plans starting at $100, even as it integrates enterprise wallet compatibility and third-party custodial options.

From a regulatory standpoint, AIXA's infrastructure roadmap also appears aligned with the sector's current direction. In June 2025, the company completed an external audit of its asset verification and system redundancies, a move increasingly expected of platforms serving institutional clients.

Industry experts note that such dual-tier strategies are likely to become more common as cloud mining seeks to reposition itself from a speculative income source to a standardized financial product. “As cloud mining matures, platforms will need to meet very different requirements on the retail and institutional ends of the spectrum,” said Dr. Lena Moore, a blockchain infrastructure researcher at the University of California. “Scalability will no longer just mean processing power, it will mean operational flexibility, risk mitigation, and reporting transparency.”

That shift is underscored by developments elsewhere in the crypto sector. In Q2 2025, several exchanges expanded their DeFi analytics platforms to support mining-related metrics, indicating that mining is being folded into broader asset evaluation strategies. Similarly, asset managers are increasingly allocating to mining-yield derivatives and tokenised staking products mechanisms that parallel traditional bond structures.

In this context, AIXA Miner's recent platform adaptations represent a relevant case study in the evolution of cloud mining from a niche service into an enterprise-aligned infrastructure solution. Whether the future of mining lies in AI-optimized routing, renewable capacity expansions, or smart wallet integrations, one reality is becoming clear: cloud mining is no longer solely the domain of crypto-native retail users.

Instead, it is emerging as a structural component of blockchain's institutional future—one that demands both scale and accessibility in equal measure.

 Bitcoin and Ether traders are eyeing price milestones into the weekly close, with a resistance trend line keeping BTC bulls from heading to all-time highs. 

Key points:

Bitcoin market participants expect a resistance trend line breakout, with nearby targets including $125,000.

Attention continues to focus on altcoins while Bitcoin consolidates, with Ether reaching seven-month highs.

Upside potential across altcoins remains, with many not yet copying Ether's rebound, says the latest market commentary.

Bitcoin (BTC) circled $118,500 into Sunday's weekly close as traders waited for a new upside BTC price breakout.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD heading higher after a trip below $117,000 Friday.

The pair retained much of its gains through the week, still shy of new all-time highs as consolidation took over.

Now, traders say, a resistance trend line stands in the way of Bitcoin returning to price discovery above $123,000.

“BTC is getting ready for a big move,” popular trader Marcus Corvinus told X followers in a post on the day.

Uploading a chart showing the trend line in question, Corvinus said that a breakout would take BTC/USDT to $125,000 next.

“If it breaks below support, price may fall to $111,000 or lower,” he added. 

On daily time frames, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital eyed a similar structure.

“Bitcoin remains in the Range and the consolidation continues, facilitating further money flow into Altcoins,” he commented on his own chart.

As Cointelegraph reported, altcoins have returned to the radar this week as Bitcoin consolidates.

Of particular interest are largest altcoin Ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP), which are both fielding lofty price predictions.

“Ethereum has long ago resynchronised with its $2200-$3900 Macro Range,” summarized in part of an X post which included a chart stretching back to late 2023.

Crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe called the rebound on ETH/USD "absolutely phenomenal.”

“Ethereum is the first one to move and it has basically ran back to the highs of December '24. That means that there's still a lot of upside to come,” he argued at the weekend. 

On Sunday, ETH/USD traded above $3,750 for the first time since December 18, 2024.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Shiba Inu ($SHIB), a cryptocurrency that has positioned itself as a competitor to Dogecoin, has recently seen a surge in interest. With a current price of $0.00001338, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 7.05% increase over the past week, boasting a market capitalization of $5.63 billion. Analysts are optimistic about its potential, with some forecasting a 20x rally as the next crypto bull run approaches. This optimism is largely driven by Shibarium, Shiba Inu's Layer-2 network, which promises low fees, fast transactions, and enhanced scalability. Since its launch, transaction volume on the Shibarium testnet has surged, and the ecosystem has seen integrations with DeFi, NFT utilities, and token burns, making it more than just a meme coin.

However, a new player has entered the meme coin arena: Arctic Pablo Coin. This cryptocurrency has gained attention with its unique narrative and location-based presale model, which is redefining what meme finance can look like. Unlike other meme coins that focus on utility, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a storyline that engages users. With each presale drop unlocking fresh chapters and staking rewards as high as 66% APY, this cryptocurrency is not just another meme coin—it's a myth in motion, aiming for a 1951% ROI at launch. The presale model is gamified, with each week unlocking a new location, new mysteries, new artwork, and new price levels, making it a blend of crypto speculation and storytelling.

Another project that has caught the attention of investors is Rollblock. Unlike SHIB or Arctic Pablo Coin, Rollblock is not just a cryptocurrency—it is building a full-blown launch platform for play-to-earn gaming and NFT projects. The platform aims to host new tokens, offer staking-as-a-service, and onboard users into decentralized gaming economies. Rollblock's infrastructure-first approach sets it apart, as the development team is prioritizing UI, user onboarding, and token integrations. Early investors have already shown interest, and excitement is building in Telegram groups about what could be the next big breakout in the crypto world.

Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is making significant strides in the meme coin landscape. Currently in its 32nd presale location, Icebound Estates, the cryptocurrency's animated adventure is more than just storytelling. The presale is not a typical hype-fueled flash in the pan. At $0.0005 per token, with a listing price of $0.008, Arctic Pablo is offering a potential ROI of 1500%. Analysts think $APC might even reach $0.1 in this cycle, which is a blistering 19,900% gain. With over $3 million already raised and 66% APY staking in play, the project combines meme coin hype with long-term investor rewards. Each presale location lasts exactly one week, and at the end of each chapter, unsold tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply crunch. This approach ensures relentless forward motion and hype that snowballs like an avalanche.

For investors looking for the next big thing in the meme coin space, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out. It's not just a token—it's a time-sensitive ticket into a mythical journey that gets more valuable with every passing week. The cryptocurrency runs on Binance Smart Chain, ensuring quick, cheap transactions. The launchpad-like presale model feels gamified, and each week unlocks a new location with new mysteries, new artwork, and new price levels. It's a unique blend of crypto speculation and storytelling that appeals to a younger generation of investors.

In conclusion, Shiba Inu remains a strong contender with the potential for significant gains, especially with the traction gained by Shibarium. Arctic Pablo Coin, with its unique narrative and deflationary mechanics, is quickly becoming a standout in the meme coin space. Rollblock, on the other hand, is quietly building the infrastructure for the next phase of crypto's evolution, offering a launch platform for gaming and NFT tokens. Early adopters who get in on these projects could see substantial returns as the crypto market continues to evolve.

 Embedding human rights into crypto systems is a necessity. Self-custody, privacy-by-default, and censorship-resistant personhood must be core design principles for any technology. The future of digital freedom depends on it. 

Opinion by: Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Human.Tech

Beyond the hype of accelerationist and technophile circles, a quiet crisis of confidence is taking hold in emerging technologies.

Crypto and decentralized identity solutions still carry enormous potential to empower individuals and distribute power — but many builders and users are sounding the alarm. Their disillusionment stems from real concerns: surveillance overreach, centralization disguised as innovation and tools that serve power, not people.

This conversation is no longer theoretical. From deepfake scams and AI impersonation to state-backed biometric ID proposals and the EU AI Act, digital rights are being defined in real time, often without public consent.

In this climate, the question isn't whether to embed human rights into crypto systems, but how soon we must.

The root of the problem isn't technology itself, but the values embedded in its design. Crypto's future legitimacy depends on embedding human rights into its architecture. 

Principles like self-custody, universal personhood and privacy-by-default shouldn't be treated as optional features — they must be prerequisites for any system that claims to advance human freedom.

If we fail to embed ethical principles into protocols now, we risk recreating the same power dynamics Web3 was meant to disrupt. 

Self-custody has long been a cornerstone of crypto. The failures of centralized exchanges — like those that led to the collapse of FTX — and the usability challenges of many existing custody tools have revealed a critical gap: Most self-custody solutions aren't built for people; they're built for power users.

To be viable at scale, the next generation of custody must preserve user control without sacrificing accessibility. Lost keys, obscure interfaces and fragile backups are unacceptable if the goal is true user empowerment. The future of custody will depend on a design that balances safety, simplicity and sovereignty.

As bots grow more convincing and AI-generated interactions flood the web, proving you're human is becoming more complex and essential. We need methods to verify humanity without compromising privacy or individual autonomy.

State-run biometric IDs and corporate credentialing systems pose serious risks. Instead, decentralized and censorship-resistant systems of personhood must enable individuals to prove their humanity without surrendering it. This is the foundation for trust, integrity and inclusion in digital space.

Surveillance, data breaches and behavioral tracking are the legacy of Web2. Web3 has the opportunity, and the obligation, to break that pattern. Privacy is often treated as an add-on rather than a built-in right.Related: Crypto's true revolution is about humanity, not technology

Privacy-by-default means designing systems that minimize data collection, encrypt by design and preserve autonomy in storing and using data. Visibility should never be the default. Every system should begin from the premise that user protection is a feature, not a toggle.

Some critics argue that embedding values into systems can backfire and that ethical frameworks might be co-opted or politicized. That's a genuine concern. It's still not an excuse for inaction. Transparent system design, open governance and pluralistic alignment mechanisms can mitigate this risk and help ensure protocols remain accountable to users, not just founders or investors.

Web3 offers tools that, if built responsibly, can decentralize control, empower communities and resist misuse. This potential will only be realized if builders consciously embed rights into the protocol layer rather than try to retrofit ethics after launch.

We are at a turning point. Human rights can no longer be treated as external guardrails. They must become internal operating principles for digital infrastructure. That's not a philosophical luxury; it's imperative for design.

The window is open, but narrowing. If we want a digital future that serves humanity, the time to embed our values into code is now.

In a twist of fate, Vanguard has become the largest shareholder of the most established Bitcoin equity play.

The $10 trillion asset manager has famously refused to touch Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies while its peers have jumped headfirst in the past year.

Now Vanguard is the largest shareholder in MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), a firm whose value proposition is that it is the most established Bitcoin proxy in the stock market, Bloomberg reported on Monday.

Vanguard owns more than 20 million shares of all of MicroStrategy's outstanding class A shares, worth over $9 billion, the report said. Bloomberg said that the firm likely surpassed Capital Group in Q4 2024 to claim the top spot among the firm's shareholders. In comparison, MicroStrategy Chair Michael Saylor owns just under 20 million shares, according to an April company filing.

The disconnect between Vanguard's professed cryptocurrency stance and its financial holdings primarily comes from its passive index fund strategies through funds like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (NASDAQ:VITSX), Vanguard Extended Market Index (NASDAQ:VIEIX) and the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VUG).

But Vanguard also has exposure to MicroStrategy in some of its actively managed funds. Still, the firm maintains that this is not the result of conviction but the fact that those funds are comprised of stocks chosen by mathematical models.

“God has a sense of humor,” Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas told Bloomberg. “Vanguard chose this life. When you have an index fund, you have to own all the stocks, for better or worse, and that includes stocks that you may not like or approve of personally.”

NovaDius Wealth Management President Nate Geraci said Tuesday on X, “if you don't see the irony here, I don't know what to tell you.”

Meanwhile, VanEck Head of Digital Assets Research Matthew Sigel said, “Indexing into $9B of what you openly mock isn't strategy. It's institutional dementia.”

The views come as Vanguard now already offers its customers indirect cryptocurrency exposure through its funds, but refuses to offer customers access to products like Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform.

"What Vanguard is missing (*huge* miss IMO)... Is there are tons of investors who love Vanguard's low cost approach to stock & bond investing AND they want to own some btc & crypto,” Geraci said. “Vanguard is essentially making a *market call* on btc/crypto. And alienating a lot of investors.”

While Vanguard struggles to fight off the cryptocurrency wave, competitors like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity are divvying market share amid significant demand. For example, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT) has become the fastest ETF to hit $80 billion in assets under management. Also, IBIT now generates more revenue for BlackRock than its product tracking the S&P 500.

Vanguard's inability to avoid offering cryptocurrency exposure to customers despite its views on the asset class highlights how intertwined the asset class now is with traditional finance. Depending on who you ask, that can be a sign of progress or a looming financial disaster.

Oops, something went wrong

Wall Street has long mastered the creative art of turning complexity into a money-printing machine. How do they do it? Financial engineering — an art of structuring debt, equity, and derivatives to squeeze out returns in ways that often defy convention.

It's a playbook that made fortunes — and nearly broke the system in 2008. Now, this complex engineering of money has entered the crypto market.

With Wall Street's takeover of crypto, financial engineering is fast becoming a pillar of the crypto market. It is now at the center of the latest iteration of one of the hottest trends in the space: the crypto treasury strategy.

This trend is championed by Michael Saylor, whose company — MicroStrategy (MSTR), now rebranded simply as Strategy — began acquiring bitcoin as both a corporate reserve asset and a market signal.

But the real innovation wasn't just buying BTC and holding it. It was how the firm financed those purchases: issuing convertible notes and equity to raise capital, then cycling that capital into buying more bitcoin. Each announcement triggered a surge in Strategy's share price, which in turn made new capital raises easier and more lucrative.

Others took note.

What began as a bitcoin bet turned into a blueprint for a new kind of treasury management: announce crypto treasury strategy, stock pumps, raise funds, buy tokens, watch the share price pop more, repeat.

This is the new "Infinite Money Glitch," according to Animoca Brands Research.

"This financial engineering approach of utilizing debt and equity issuances, such as convertible notes and stock offerings, specifically to raise funds for continuous crypto asset acquisitions creates a “flywheel" effect," the firm said in a research note.

Obviously, this money printing machine didn't stop with bitcoin. Smaller firms started to apply this to other popular altcoins, including XRP, ETH and SOL.

But why altcoins? After all, the bitcoin market has matured, the cycle has been well defined, and the likes of Michael Saylor have shown that the returns serve the shareholders well while enabling firms to continue to raise funds.

It's the early-stage advantage, according to Animoca's research.

"Applying this 'flywheel' model to altcoins might offer a more extended runway for growth and profitability compared to bitcoin. While bitcoin's market is more mature and its price discovery has undergone several major cycles, the vast and diverse altcoin market is still, in many respects, in its nascent stages," the research noted.

A quick look at the return charts shows that in the short term, this altcoin treasury strategy has paid off for the firms and their shareholders.

"On the day of the [altcoin treasury] announcement, share prices saw an average increase of 161%. This upward trend persisted, with average gains of 150% one day after, 185% after seven days, and 226% after 30 days," the note said.

"This immediate market response also underscores the market's willingness to invest in publicly traded 'wrappers' for altcoin exposure."

Interestingly, launching these treasury strategies didn't impact the actual prices of the underlying tokens, Animoca's data shows. This perhaps makes a compelling case for investors to flock to these equity "wrappers" rather than to the actual tokens.

Also, the lack of altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) means that Wall Street has limited options but to buy into these strategy companies to capture the upside.

For investors, these massive short-term gains are hard to ignore, and as long as there is an appetite for such financial engineering, capital will continue to flow into them.

The only question is: Is this sustainable?

"Should market sentiment shift or altcoin prices experience a prolonged decline, the leveraged nature of some of these strategies that could be employed carries substantial inherent risks," Animoca Brands research analysts said.

"Nevertheless, the trend highlights a significant addressable market for structured products that bridge traditional finance with crypto," the report added.

So for now, the "Infinite Money Glitch" is here for the win.

 The GENIUS Act marks a turning point for crypto regulation, but experts say true integration with finance and identity systems is only beginning. 

The proclaimed Crypto Week has concluded with significant regulatory progress, including the passage of the much-anticipated GENIUS Act. However, industry experts claim the regulatory clarity is just the foundation for what lies ahead.

“Clarity is just a starting point, not an endpoint,” Leo Fan, co-founder of Cysic, told Cointelegraph. He pointed to the need for scalable blockchains, instant verification systems, and trusted custody for further integration.

Fan acknowledged that Crypto Week delivered “legal clarity,” with the GENIUS Act formally recognizing that not all crypto assets are securities. He called this a “foundational shift” that provides a “green light for developers, investors, and institutions to build and deploy with clearer legal guardrails.”

Fan said crypto is finally being recognized as foundational infrastructure, paving the way for real-world integration in finance, identity and privacy systems. “With the legal groundwork forming, the path is clearer for real-world integration,” he said.

Altan Tutar, co-founder and CEO of MoreMarkets, described the GENIUS Act as “the best sign yet that DeFi is here to stay,” noting the US is closing the gap with Asia in crypto adoption.

Tutar said the legislation would drive stablecoin adoption “in a meaningful way,” enabling traditional assets like gold or oil to be tokenized and bringing DeFi into new territories.

However, he cautioned that regulatory clarity benefits institutions more than everyday investors and stressed the importance of building payment systems, apps, and earning opportunities for retail investors to avoid crypto's own version of a “dot-com bubble.”

Likewise, Ryan Chow, CEO of Solv Protocol, said Crypto Week “laid the legal foundation for digital assets for legal clarity and structural legitimacy,” ending years of regulatory uncertainty that stalled institutional adoption.

He called the GENIUS Act's distinction between decentralized digital assets and traditional securities “monumental,” giving builders and investors confidence to innovate.

Looking ahead, he said, “clarity is necessary, but credibility is what builds markets,” urging the development of “Bitcoin-backed credit, tokenized treasuries, and yield tied to real assets” with transparent risk pricing and compliance built in from the start.

Will K, CEO of VOOI and co-founder of Symbiosis.Finance, also highlighted that regulation alone isn't enough. He pointed out the need for mature infrastructure, simplified user experiences, and AI-driven tools that level the playing field.

Without these, crypto risks remaining a niche ecosystem rather than a global financial standard, Will warned. “The industry needs to stop building for crypto natives and start building for everyone else.”

Passed last week with more than 300 House votes, including support from 102 Democrats, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, establishes the first federal framework for stablecoins.

Home - Reviews - Maple Finance Review: Where Blockchain Meets Real-World Borrowing Needs

Maple Finance pioneers institutional-grade lending within DeFi, bridging blockchain technology with traditional credit markets. This ecosystem connects vetted borrowers seeking capital with yield-focused lenders through a unique delegated pool structure. Its evolution includes migrating from MPL to the SYRUP governance token and expanding access via Syrup.fi.







Maple Finance functions as a decentralized lending platform that is based on blockchain technology. Its core purpose is to facilitate lending and borrowing within the crypto ecosystem, specifically targeting institutional participants. Instead of traditional banks, Maple leverages smart contracts deployed on networks like Ethereum and Solana to create a permissionless infrastructure for capital allocation, aiming to provide efficient and transparent access to credit.

The platform functions as a crucial link between institutional borrowers seeking capital (such as cryptocurrency trading firms, market makers, and fintech companies) and lenders looking for yield (typically accredited investors and decentralized autonomous organizations – DAOs). 

Maple Finance specializes in providing uncollateralized or undercollateralized loans, a significant offering within the often overcollateralized DeFi lending space, addressing a key need for established crypto businesses requiring working capital.



A defining feature of Maple Finance's structure is the use of Pool Delegates. These are professional entities or teams responsible for originating loans, performing due diligence and credit assessment on potential borrowers, setting loan terms (like interest rates), and actively managing the performance of specific lending pools on the platform. Lenders effectively delegate the critical task of credit risk evaluation and management to these designated experts.

Maple Finance positions itself as a capital-efficient solution for institutional crypto participants. It emphasizes transparency, with loan terms, borrower identities (often disclosed), and pool performance visible on-chain. By offering fixed-rate, term loans primarily in stablecoins like USDC, Maple aims to provide predictable yields for lenders and reliable funding for vetted institutional borrowers, differentiating itself within the broader decentralized finance landscape.







Maple Finance organizes capital through distinct lending pools created and managed by Pool Delegates. Lenders deposit funds, primarily stablecoins like USDC, directly into these specific pools. Each pool operates under predefined parameters set by its Delegate, including target borrower profiles, interest rate models, and fee structures. 

Lenders choose which pools to fund based on the Delegate's reputation, strategy, and the offered terms, effectively allocating their capital to specific credit strategies.

Institutional borrowers apply for loans through a specific Pool Delegate. The Delegate conducts rigorous due diligence, including assessing the borrower's financial health, track record, business model, and proposed loan purpose. This involves evaluating creditworthiness beyond just on-chain collateral. 

Based on this assessment, the Delegate negotiates loan terms (amount, interest rate, duration, covenants) and approves or rejects the application, acting as the underwriter and risk manager for their pool.

Once approved, the loan agreement is formalized on-chain via Maple's smart contracts. Funds are drawn from the chosen lending pool and transferred to the borrower's wallet. The contract automatically enforces the loan terms, including repayment schedules and interest accrual. Repayments made by the borrower (principal + interest) flow back into the lending pool's smart contract, ready for redistribution to lenders or reinvestment into new loans.







SYRUP serves as the foundational governance and utility token for Maple Finance and its Syrup.fi platform. Holders stake SYRUP (as stSYRUP) to participate in protocol governance, voting on upgrades, fee structures, and ecosystem enhancements. Stakers also earn rewards from protocol fee buybacks, directly tying token value to Maple's operational success. Additionally, SYRUP incentivizes lender participation in Syrup.fi pools through “Drips”, convertible rewards distributed in seasonal phases to boost user engagement.

SYRUP took the place of Maple's original MPL token through a community-approved migration (MIP-009/MIP-010) with a conversion ratio of 1:100. The migration window closed definitively in May 2025. Post-deadline, unconverted MPL and its staked variant (xMPL) lost all utility, governance rights, and staking benefits. 

Residual value from unclaimed MPL was allocated to the Syrup Strategic Fund for ecosystem development. Exchanges like Kraken facilitated automatic conversions, while others (e.g., Coinbase) required manual migration via Maple's portal.

SYRUP warrants consideration only within the speculative allocation of an investment portfolio, suitable exclusively for risk-tolerant participants with multi-year time horizons. Its investment case strengthens those bullish on specific megatrends: institutional blockchain adoption, the convergence of TradFi and DeFi, and the tokenization of real-world assets. 

Prospective investors should continuously monitor protocol metrics including TVL, loan origination volume, and treasury revenue, indicators that directly influence SYRUP's fundamental valuation. While the token offers compelling exposure to institutional DeFi's growth narrative, its ultimate success depends on Maple Finance's execution against an ambitious roadmap and ability to navigate an evolving regulatory landscape.

SYRUP's tokenomics emphasize aligned incentives and deflationary mechanisms. A circulating supply of 1.19B SYRUP supports governance, staking, and liquidity provisioning. Fee revenues from Maple's lending operations fund SYRUP buybacks, distributing value to stakers while countering inflation. 

The token further integrates into Syrup.fi via utility perks, including fee discounts for lenders and enhanced features for long-term depositors. This design positions SYRUP as both a governance lever and a reward engine for Maple's credit ecosystem.







Syrup.fi is a permissionless yield protocol powered by Maple Finance, designed to democratize access to institutional-grade yields for DeFi-native users. It enables anyone to deposit stablecoins like USDC and earn returns sourced from fixed-rate, overcollateralized loans to vetted crypto institutions, with all collateral verifiable on-chain in real-time. 

No KYC is required for lenders, contrasting with Maple's institutional focus. Users receive liquid LP tokens representing their deposits, which can be utilized across DeFi for additional yield opportunities.

Maple Finance pioneers institutional DeFi credit through its delegated lending pools and transparent on-chain infrastructure. The migration to the SYRUP token strengthened governance alignment while Syrup.fi expanded access to institutional yields. By balancing regulatory navigation with blockchain innovation, Maple carves a unique niche in crypto finance, offering scalable capital solutions while redefining trust in decentralized credit markets.

Babylon Protocol has introduced a groundbreaking innovation that transforms Bitcoin into a security layer for blockchain networks. This development challenges Ethereum's dominance in the decentralized security space and enhances the overall security of blockchain ecosystems. By leveraging Babylon Protocol, Bitcoin holders can contribute their BTC to secure blockchain networks in a non-custodial manner, earning yield in the process. This integration allows Bitcoin to actively participate in modular consensus mechanisms, rewarding users who restake their BTC through the protocol.

The protocol incentivizes users by rewarding them for restaking their BTC, thereby enhancing the security of the network. This approach not only secures the blockchain but also provides economic benefits to Bitcoin holders. The non-custodial nature of the protocol ensures that users maintain control over their assets while contributing to the network's security.

Babylon Protocol's integration with various blockchain networks, such as the Union network, further strengthens the security of these ecosystems. By enabling Bitcoin staking, Babylon Protocol introduces a new layer of consensus validation, making the network more robust and resilient against attacks. This innovation is particularly significant as it expands the utility of Bitcoin beyond its traditional role as a store of value and a medium of exchange.

The protocol's ability to handle the behind-the-scenes work, such as keeping track of staked assets and managing the staking process, ensures a seamless and secure experience for users. This technological advancement makes it possible for Bitcoin to be used as a security layer without the need for intermediaries, thereby enhancing the decentralization and security of the network.

SatLayer, a platform built on Babylon Protocol, further enhances this security integration by allowing direct restaking of Bitcoin and liquid staking tokens (LSTs). This eliminates the need for wrapped tokens, reducing the security risks associated with bridged or wrapped assets. SatLayer also offers safety slashing mechanisms, ensuring that applications developed on the platform are stable against threats. The platform recently raised 8 million in pre-seed funding, indicating strong investor confidence in Bitcoin's security capabilities.

This development is poised to have a profound impact on the future of decentralized security and the utility of Bitcoin. By enabling Bitcoin holders to contribute to network security in a non-custodial manner and earning yield in the process, Babylon Protocol challenges Ethereum's dominance and enhances the overall security of blockchain ecosystems. This innovation represents a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency space, opening up new possibilities for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, making it more secure and decentralized.

 Circle's Dante Disparte says the GENIUS Act ensures tech giants and banks can't dominate the stablecoin market without facing strict structural and regulatory hurdles. 

The GENIUS Act contains a little-noticed clause that prevents technology giants and Wall Street behemoths from dominating the stablecoin market, according to Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte.

“The GENIUS Act has what I'd like to call — just for my own legacy sake — a Libra clause,” Disparte told the Unchained podcast on Saturday. Any non-bank that wants to mint a dollar-pegged token must spin up “a standalone entity that looks more like Circle and less like a bank,” clear antitrust hurdles and face a Treasury Department committee with veto power over the launch.

Banks don't get a free pass either. Lenders that issue a stablecoin must house it in a legally separate subsidiary and keep the coins on a balance sheet that carries “no risk-taking, no leverage, no lending,” Disparte noted.

That structure is even “more conservative” than the deposit-token models JPMorgan and others have floated. “It creates clear rules that I think in the end the biggest winners are the US consumers and market participants and frankly the dollar itself,” he added.

Passed last week with more than 300 House votes, including support from 102 Democrats, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act gives the dollar “rules-based” firepower in the global digital-currency race, Disparte argued.

“Crypto is finally getting what it wanted: legitimization, a path for legal and regulatory clarity in the United States and an opportunity to compete,” he said.

The bill preserves the patchwork of state money-transmitter laws for issuers under a $10 billion threshold but demands a national trust-bank charter once assets breach that level.

Notably, the law bans interest-bearing stablecoins, pushes rigorous disclosure standards and introduces criminal penalties for unbacked “stable” tokens. Terra-style experiments are “gone,” Disparte said.

However, critics argue the ban on yield could stunt consumer adoption and hand an advantage to overseas issuers. Disparte claimed that yield “is a secondary-market innovation” better delivered by decentralized finance protocols once the base layer is rock-solid.

The GENIUS Act's ban on yield-bearing stablecoins could redirect investor demand toward Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

With no interest incentives left in stablecoins, DeFi becomes the primary option for generating passive income onchain, according to analysts like Nic Puckrin and CoinFund's Christopher Perkins, who predicted that “stablecoin summer” may now evolve into “DeFi summer.”

The ban is especially significant for institutional investors. Unlike retail users, financial institutions have fiduciary duties to generate returns, making yield opportunities essential. Analysts suggest this could lead to a surge in institutional capital flowing into DeFi, particularly on Ethereum, which dominates total value locked in the sector.

The transformation didn't happen by accident. It started in 2013 when South African entrepreneur Johann Gevers moved his crypto startup Monetas to Zug after researching locations worldwide. His vision was simple: create a "Silicon Valley" for blockchain technology in Switzerland.

In a small Swiss town of just 30,000 people, a financial revolution began that would reshape the global cryptocurrency landscape. Zug, Switzerland, now known as “Crypto Valley,” hosts over 700 blockchain companies worth a combined $382.93 billion – making it the world's largest cryptocurrency hub.

“We want to express our openness to new technologies,” said former Zug Mayor Dolfi Müller at the time. This openness would prove crucial as crypto companies flocked to the region.

The real breakthrough came in February 2014 when 20-year-old Vitalik Buterin chose Zug as the home for the Ethereum Foundation. Working from a modest house nicknamed “Das Raumschiff” (The Spaceship), Buterin and his team built what would become the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.

The Ethereum Foundation became the first blockchain foundation ever created, setting a legal precedent that nearly every major crypto project would follow. Today, nine cryptocurrency “unicorns” (companies worth over $1 billion) call Switzerland home, including Cardano, Polkadot, and Nexo.

Switzerland's tax structure offers something almost unheard of in the crypto world: zero capital gains tax for private investors. This means individuals can buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies without paying taxes on their profits as long as they meet specific criteria.

To qualify for tax-free gains, investors must:

However, there's a catch. Switzerland imposes a wealth tax on crypto holdings, ranging from 0.3% to 1% annually. In Zug, this rate is just 0.125% – among the lowest in the country. Investors must declare their crypto holdings each December 31st at market value.

According to Swiss Federal Tax Administration guidelines, this wealth tax applies to all crypto assets, treating them similar to stocks or real estate.

Unlike many countries that struggle with crypto regulation, Swiss authorities embraced the technology early. In July 2016, Zug became the first government worldwide to accept Bitcoin payments for municipal services up to 200 Swiss francs (about $210).

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) published clear cryptocurrency guidelines in 2018, categorizing digital assets into three types: payment tokens, utility tokens, and asset tokens. This regulatory clarity eliminated the legal uncertainty that plagued crypto companies in other countries.

Corporate taxes in Zug are equally attractive, with rates of just 11.85% – the lowest in Switzerland. This compares favorably to other major financial centers and has drawn companies like Bitcoin Suisse, which was founded in 2013 and now manages over 3 billion Swiss francs in client assets.

One advantage that sets Switzerland apart is its crypto-friendly banking sector. Traditional banks like UBS and Credit Suisse work alongside specialized crypto banks such as SEBA and Sygnum. These partnerships provide crucial services like custody, trading, and regulatory compliance that crypto companies need to operate professionally.

Bitcoin Suisse, Switzerland's oldest crypto company, helped facilitate the world's first cryptocurrency crowd-funding campaign for Ethereum in 2014. The company has since grown to employ over 300 people across offices in Zug, Copenhagen, and Slovakia.

The ecosystem's growth has been remarkable. In 2023 alone, Swiss crypto companies raised $283.5 million across 47 funding deals, showing strong recovery from the 2022 market downturn. The sector now employs over 3,000 people directly, with hundreds more in supporting industries.

The concentration of companies is striking: 512 blockchain companies operate in tiny Zug canton, compared to 289 in much larger Zurich. This density creates network effects where entrepreneurs, investors, and talent naturally connect.

Switzerland's crypto sector has matured significantly since its early days. “The more fringe side of crypto has kind of moved away,” noted Alexander Brunner, author of “Crypto Nation Switzerland.” “Crypto is growing up, in Switzerland.”

Subaru Telescope has made an exciting discovery: a small body beyond Pluto, with implications for the formation, evolution, and current structure of the outer Solar System.

The object was found as part of the survey project FOSSIL (Formation of the Outer Solar System: An Icy Legacy), which takes advantage of the Subaru Telescope's wide field of view. The object was discovered through observations taken in March, May, and August 2023 using the Subaru Telescope. The object is currently designated 2023 KQ14; a more classical name will be assigned later by the International Astronomical Union. After that, follow-up observations in July 2024 with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and a search for unrecognized sightings of the object in old data from other observatories allowed astronomers to track the object's orbit over 19 years. Due to its peculiar distant orbit, 2023 KQ14 has been classified as a "sednoid," making it only the fourth known example of this rare type of object.

Numerical simulations conducted by the FOSSIL team, some of which used the PC cluster operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, indicate that 2023 KQ14 has maintained a stable orbit for at least 4.5 billion years. Although its current orbit differs from those of the other sednoids, the simulations suggest that their orbits were remarkably similar around 4.2 billion years ago.

The fact that 2023 KQ14 now follows an orbit different from the other sednoids indicates that the outer Solar System is more diverse and complex than previously thought. This discovery also places new constraints on the hypothetical Planet Nine. If Planet Nine exists, its orbit must lie farther out than typically predicted.

Dr. Yukun Huang of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan who conducted simulations of the orbit comments, "The fact that 2023 KQ14's current orbit does not align with those of the other three sednoids lowers the likelihood of the Planet Nine hypothesis. It is possible that a planet once existed in the Solar System but was later ejected, causing the unusual orbits we see today."

Regarding the significance of this discovery, Dr. Fumi Yoshida states, "2023 KQ14 was found in a region far away where Neptune's gravity has little influence. The presence of objects with elongated orbits and large perihelion distances in this area implies that something extraordinary occurred during the ancient era when 2023 KQ14 formed. Understanding the orbital evolution and physical properties of these unique, distant objects is crucial for comprehending the full history of the Solar System. At present, the Subaru Telescope is among the few telescopes on Earth capable of making such discoveries. I would be happy if the FOSSIL team could make many more discoveries like this one and help draw a complete picture of the history of the Solar System."

An international team of astronomers has uncovered new evidence to explain how pulsing remnants of exploded stars interact with surrounding matter deep in the cosmos, using observations from NASA's IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer) and other telescopes.

Scientists based in the U.S., Italy, and Spain, set their sights on a mysterious cosmic duo called PSR J1023+0038, or J1023 for short. The J1023 system is comprised of a rapidly rotating neutron star feeding off of its low-mass companion star, which has created an accretion disk around the neutron star. This neutron star is also a pulsar, emitting powerful twin beams of light from its opposing magnetic poles as it rotates, spinning like a lighthouse beacon.

The J1023 system is rare and valuable to study because the pulsar transitions clearly between its active state, in which it feeds off its companion star, and a more dormant state, when it emits detectable pulsations as radio waves. This makes it a "transitional millisecond pulsar."

"Transitional millisecond pulsars are cosmic laboratories, helping us understand how neutron stars evolve in binary systems," said researcher Maria Cristina Baglio of the Italian National Institute of Astrophysics (INAF) Brera Observatory in Merate, Italy, and lead author of a paper in The Astrophysical Journal Letters illustrating the new findings.

The big question for scientists about this pulsar system was: Where do the X-rays originate? The answer would inform broader theories about particle acceleration, accretion physics, and the environments surrounding neutron stars across the universe.

The source surprised them: The X-rays came from the pulsar wind, a chaotic stew of gases, shock waves, magnetic fields, and particles accelerated near the speed of light, that hits the accretion disk.

To determine this, astronomers needed to measure the angle of polarization in both X-ray and optical light. Polarization is a measure of how organized light waves are. They looked at X-ray polarization with IXPE, the only telescope capable of making this measurement in space, and comparing it with optical polarization from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile. IXPE launched in Dec. 2021 and has made many observations of pulsars, but J1023 was the first system of its kind that it explored.

NASA's NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) and Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory provided valuable observations of the system in high-energy light. Other telescopes contributing data included the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in Magdalena, New Mexico.

The result: scientists found the same angle of polarization across the different wavelengths.

"That finding is compelling evidence that a single, coherent physical mechanism underpins the light we observe," said Francesco Coti Zelati of the Institute of Space Sciences in Barcelona, Spain, co-lead author of the findings.

This interpretation challenges the conventional wisdom about neutron star emissions of radiation in binary systems, the researchers said. Previous models had indicated that the X-rays come from the accretion disk, but this new study shows they originate with the pulsar wind.

"IXPE has observed many isolated pulsars and found that the pulsar wind powers the X-rays," said NASA Marshall astrophysicist Philip Kaaret, principal investigator for IXPE at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. "These new observations show that the pulsar wind powers most of the energy output of the system."

Astronomers continue to study transitional millisecond pulsars, assessing how observed physical mechanisms compare with those of other pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae. Insights from these observations could help refine theoretical models describing how pulsar winds generate radiation - and bring researchers one step closer, Baglio and Coti Zelati agreed, to fully understanding the physical mechanisms at work in these extraordinary cosmic systems.

More about IXPE

IXPE, which continues to provide unprecedented data enabling groundbreaking discoveries about celestial objects across the universe, is a joint NASA and Italian Space Agency mission with partners and science collaborators in 12 countries. IXPE is led by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. BAE Systems, Inc., headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, manages spacecraft operations together with the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics in Boulder.

Right down to the Holy Grail ... almost.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The sandstone cliff faces of the ancient city of Petra (one of the New Seven Wonders of the World) have long been in the archaeological limelight. They've even spent time in the Hollywood limelight as the location for several scenes in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But in their most recent on-screen appearance—and no offense to Harrison Ford's iconic professor—they were the site of a very real discovery.

Discovery Channel's popular show “Expedition Unknown” was on site to document the discovery of 12 human skeletons and artifacts dating back at least 2,000 years, which had all been long hidden beneath the famed Khazneh (or “Treasury”) in Petra. The colossal find was accomplished by a team lead by archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman.

It's a find that, were he real, Indiana Jones would certainly be proud of. 

“This is a hugely rare discovery,” said Josh Gates, host of the Discovery Channel's program, according to CNN. “In the two centuries that Petra has been investigated by archaeologists, nothing like this has been found before. Even in front of one of the most famous buildings in the world … there are still huge discoveries to be made.” 

Creasman, executive director of the American Center of Research, employed ground-penetrating radar to first see if it was possibile that additional tombs were located at the site. The gathered data matched up to data collected from areas where tombs had been found in the past, and the Jordan government gave the approval for excavation beneath the world-famous site. 

The team was beyond pleased to see an actual tomb materialize, and truly shocked by the fact that it was full of remains and artifacts—many of the tombs at the ancient city have been found empty, picked clean long ago. 

Along with the 12 sets of skeletal remains—several of the bones from which had mold, thanks to the porous sandstone allowing moisture into the space in the flood-prone area—the team found a mix of bronze, iron, and ceramic artifacts. This included one ceramic chalice tucked in the arms of one of the deceased, ironically reminiscent of the “Holy Grail” depicted in The Last Crusade. “It really was this awesome moment,” Gates said, “of history imitating art.” 

The Treasury, located near the main entrance to the city, is believed to be at least 2,000 years old. It is a striking mausoleum carved into the sandstone cliffs that has long attracted tourists aplenty, but dating this iconic monument has proven difficult because of the lack of finds within the tombs. 

“We were hopeful to find anything that might tell us more about the ancient people and place,” Creasman said. For instance, Gates believes that the individuals buried in the newly discovered tomb show must have been of very high status because of the prime real estate used for the burial place.“Human remains,” Creasman continued, “can be a really valuable tool in that regard. The burials in this tomb are articulated, so the bones haven't been rummaged around and moved, so that's exceedingly rare.” 

Delving deeper into the remains and artifacts found in the tomb could open additional information about the Khazneh, Petra, and the lives of the Nabataeans who once inhabited the area. “I think learning who they are,” Gates said, “is really going to help unlock part of the story of the Treasury.”

Research from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities gives new insight into a material that could make computer memory faster and more energy-efficient.

The study was recently published in Advanced Materials, a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The researchers also have a patent on the technology.

As technology continues to grow, so does the demand for emerging memory technology. Researchers are looking for alternatives and complements to existing memory solutions that can perform at high levels with low energy consumption to increase the functionality of everyday technology.

In this new research, the team demonstrated a more efficient way to control magnetization in tiny electronic devices using a material called Ni₄W-a combination of nickel and tungsten. The team found that this low-symmetry material produces powerful spin-orbit torque (SOT) -- a key mechanism for manipulating magnetism in next-generation memory and logic technologies.

"Ni₄W reduces power usage for writing data, potentially cutting energy use in electronics significantly," said Jian-Ping Wang, a senior author on the paper and a Distinguished McKnight Professor and Robert F. Hartmann Chair in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.

This technology could help reduce the electricity consumption of devices like smartphones and data centers making future electronics both smarter and more sustainable.

"Unlike conventional materials, Ni₄W can generate spin currents in multiple directions, enabling 'field-free' switching of magnetic states without the need for external magnetic fields. We observed high SOT efficiency with multi-direction in Ni₄W both on its own and when layered with tungsten, pointing to its strong potential for use in low-power, high-speed spintronic devices." said Yifei Yang, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Wang's group and a co-first author on the paper.

Ni₄W is made from common metals and can be manufactured using standard industrial processes. The low-cost material makes it very attractive to industry partners and soon could be implemented into technology we use everyday like smart watches, phones, and more.

"We are very excited to see that our calculations confirmed the choice of the material and the SOT experimental observation," said Seungjun Lee, a postdoctoral fellow in ECE and the co-first author on the paper.

The next steps are to grow these materials into a device that is even smaller from their previous work.

In addition to Wang, Yang and Lee, the ECE team included Paul Palmberg Professor Tony Low, another senior author on the paper, Yu-Chia Chen, Qi Jia, Brahmudutta Dixit, Duarte Sousa, Yihong Fan, Yu-Han Huang, Deyuan Lyu and Onri Jay Benally. This work was done with Michael Odlyzko, Javier Garcia-Barriocanal, Guichuan Yu and Greg Haugstad from the University of Minnesota Characterization Facility, along with Zach Cresswell and Shuang Liang from the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science.

This work was supported by SMART (Spintronic Materials for Advanced InforRmation Technologies), a world-leading research center that brings together experts from across the nation to develop technologies for spin-based computing and memory systems. SMART was one of the seven centers of nCORE, a Semiconductor Research Corporation program sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This work is being supported by the Global Research Collaboration Logic and Memory program. This study was done in collaboration with the University of Minnesota Characterization Facility and the Minnesota Nano Center.

Researchers are creating new moiré materials at the nanometer scale using advanced DNA nanotechnology: DNA moiré superlattices form when two periodic DNA lattices are overlaid with a slight rotational twist or positional offset. This creates a new, larger interference pattern with completely different physical properties. A new approach developed by researchers at the University of Stuttgart and the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research not only facilitates the complex construction of these superlattices; it also unlocks entirely new design possibilities at the nanoscale. The study has been published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.

Moiré superlattices have become central to modern condensed matter and photonic research. However, realizing such structures typically involves delicate and laborious fabrication steps, including precise alignment and transfer of pre-fabricated layers under highly controlled conditions. "Our approach bypasses traditional constraints of creating moiré superlattices," says Prof. Laura Na Liu, director of the 2nd Physics Institute at the University of Stuttgart.

New paradigm for the construction of moiré superlattices

"Unlike conventional methods that rely on mechanical stacking and twisting of two-dimensional materials, our platform leverages a bottom-up assembly process," explains Laura Na Liu. The assembly process refers to the linking of individual DNA strands to form larger, ordered structures. It is based on self-organization: The DNA strands join together without external intervention, solely through molecular interactions. The Stuttgart research team is taking advantage of this special feature. "We encode the geometric parameters of the superlattice -- such as rotation angle, sublattice spacing, and lattice symmetry -- directly into the molecular design of the initial structure, known as the nucleation seed. We then allow the entire architecture to self-assemble with nanometer precision." The seed acts as a structural blueprint, directing the hierarchical growth of 2D DNA lattices into precisely twisted bilayers or trilayers, all achieved within a single solution-phase assembly step.

Exploring Uncharted Territory: Moiré Structures on the Intermediate Nanometer Scale

While moiré superlattices have been widely explored at the atomic (angstrom) and photonic (submicron) scales, the intermediate nanometer regime, where both molecular programmability and material functionality converge, has remained largely inaccessible. The Stuttgart researchers have closed this gap with their current study. The team combines two powerful DNA nanotechniques: DNA origami and single-stranded tile (SST) assembly.

Using this hybrid strategy, the researchers constructed micrometer-scale superlattices with unit cell dimensions as small as 2.2 nanometers, featuring tunable twist angles and various lattice symmetries, including square, kagome, and honeycomb. They also demonstrated gradient moiré superlattices, in which the twist angle and hence moiré periodicity varies continuously across the structure. "These superlattices reveal well-defined moiré patterns under transmission electron microscopy, with observed twist angles closely matching those encoded in the DNA origami seed," notes co-author Prof. Peter A. van Aken from the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research.

The study also introduces a new growth process for moiré superlattices. The process is initiated by spatially defined capture strands on the DNA seed that act as molecular 'hooks' to precisely bind SSTs and direct their interlayer alignment. This enables the controlled formation of twisted bilayers or trilayers with accurately aligned SST sublattices.

Broad implications across molecular engineering, nanophotonics, spintronics, and materials science

Their high spatial resolution, precise addressability, and programmable symmetry endow the new moiré superlattices with significant potential for diverse applications in research and technology. For example, they are ideal scaffolds for nanoscale components -- such as fluorescent molecules, metallic nanoparticles or semiconductors in customized 2D and 3D architectures.

When chemically transformed into rigid frameworks, these lattices could be repurposed as phononic crystals or mechanical metamaterials with tunable vibrational responses. Their spatial gradient design also opens avenues for transformation optics and gradient-index photonic devices, where moiré periodicity could steer light or sound along controlled trajectories.

One particularly promising application lies in spin-selective electron transport. DNA has been shown to act as a spin filter, and these well-ordered superlattices with defined moiré symmetries could serve as a platform to explore topological spin transport phenomena in a highly programmable setting.

"This is not about mimicking quantum materials," says Laura Na Liu. "It's about expanding the design space and making it possible to build new types of structured matter from the bottom up, with geometric control embedded directly into the molecules."

Autonomous robotics startup Cartken, known for its four-wheeled robots that deliver food on college campuses and through Tokyo's bustling streets, has found a new area of focus: industrials. 

Cartken co-founder and CEO Christian Bersch told TechCrunch that applying its delivery robots to industrial settings was always in the back of his mind as they built the startup. When companies started reaching out about using their robots in factories and labs, Cartken took a closer look. 

“What we found is that actually there's a real big need in industrial and onsite use cases,” said Bersch, who co-founded the startup along with other former Google engineers behind the Bookbot project. “Sometimes there have even [been] more direct value to companies optimizing their material flows or their production flows.”

In 2023, the startup landed its first big industrial customer, German manufacturing company ZF Lifetec. Initially, ZF Lifetec used its existing delivery robots, called the Cartken Courier, which can hold 44 pounds and resembles an Igloo cooler on wheels. 

“Our food delivery robot started moving production samples around, and it's quickly turned into our busiest robot of all,” Bersch said. “That's when we said, hey, there's like real use cases and real market need behind it, and that's when we started targeting that segment more and more.”

At the time, Cartken was still pressing ahead on its delivery sidewalk business, including locking in partnerships with Uber Eats and GrubHub for its last-mile delivery operations across U.S. college campuses and in Japan. 

But that early success with ZF, encouraged the startup founders, which includes Jake Stelman, Jonas Witt and Anjali Naik, to expand its business model. Switching Cartken's robots from food delivery to an industrial setting, wasn't much of a challenge, Bersch said. The AI behind the robots is trained on years of food delivery data and the devices are designed to traverse various terrains and weather conditions. 

This means the robots can travel between indoor and outdoor settings. And thanks to data collected from delivering food on Tokyo streets, the robots are able to react and maneuver around obstacles. 

Cartken, which has raised more than $20 million from 468 Capital, Incubate Fund, Vela Partners, and other venture firms, has started to build out its robotic fleet to reflect its pivot to industrials. The company released the Cartken Hauler earlier this year, which is a larger version of the Cartken Courier and can hold up to 660 pounds. The company also released the Cartken Runner, designed for indoor deliveries, and is also working on something similar to a robotic forklift. 

“We have a navigation stack that is parameterizable for different robot sizes,” Bersch said. “All the AI and machine learning and training that went into that is like transferring directly to the other robots.”

Cartken recently announced that it was deepening its four-year relationship with Japanese automaker Mitsubishi, which originally helped the company get the needed certifications to operate their delivery robots on the streets of Tokyo. 

Melco Mobility Solutions, a company under the Mitsubishi umbrella, just announced that it will be buying nearly 100 Cartken Hauler robots for use in Japanese industrial facilities. 

“We're definitely seeing a lot of traction across various industrial and corporate sites, from automotive companies to pharmaceutical to chemical,” he said. “All these companies typically have people moving stuff from one building to another, whether it's being by hand, on a cart ,or a small forklift, and that is really what we're targeting.”

Cartken will still continue its food and consumer last-mile delivery business, but it won't be expanding it, Bersch said, adding they still do a lot of testing for new capabilities on these existing last-mile delivery routes.

FSR 4 the masses.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD has finally caught up to Nvidia's latest DLSS technologies with its recent FSR 4 update. For years, the Green Team have dominated upscaling, delivering near-native quality while boosting frame rates. Nvidia took the AI route from the start, training its neural networks on massive datasets, so each iteration improved automatically, even without manual intervention. FSR, by contrast, relied on traditional techniques — until this year, when FSR 4 finally made the jump to an AI-driven approach as well. Now, FSR 4 sits between the Transformer-based DLSS 4 and the older DLSS 3, which is to say, it's very good. Unfortunately, the strength of any upscaler depends on adoption, and the Red Team still lags behind.

Fortunately, third-party (and often open-source) solutions are abound, if you know your way around a few files and repositories. One such app is OptiScaler — previously known as CyberXeSS — and it works to replace upscalers in a game with a different one that might be better in certain scenarios. For instance, if the game supports FSR 2 and was never updated beyond that, OptiScaler can take that FSR 2 input and convert it to DLSS, XeSS, or upconvert it to a newer version of FSR. And now, it supports FSR 4... as long as the game isn't running on Vulkan API or needs an anti-cheat. Apart from replacing upscalers, OptiScaler can also, by extension, replace frame-gen tech and even handle anti-lag features like Nvidia Reflex.



This means that any game with older FSR or DLSS tech is now technically FSR 4-compatible. We use the word "compatible" here on purpose because "FSR 4-ready" is a bit of a stretch as there is no guarantee you'll have a stable experience. Firstly, it's not a simple toggle that you can enable in some GUI. You have to manually tweak files for every single game, and then further mess around with some settings in order to get the best experience possible. This is before installing FSR 4 in the game's directory, individually, which will be different for every game. It's certainly not convenient, but for a free solution that modernizes upscalers in a wide variety of games, it can be a worthwhile tradeoff for many.

There are only about 65 games that support FSR 4 natively, and most of them are obscure titles. In contrast, over 125 games have DLSS 4 (with frame gen) as of May 2025, alone. With OptiScaler, you can now take that number way higher on the AMD side. All you need is a game with FSR 2 and above, or DLSS 2 and above, and OptiScaler will do the magic to replace that with FSR 4. Of course, you need an RX 9000-series card in order to even get FSR 4 as only those GPUs have the necessary hardware (AI accelerators) for it. On top of that, the game must not need anti-cheat software to run in the background or use the Vulkan API, as FSR 4 does not support Vulkan yet.

As long as you meet those prerequisites, and you're comfortable configuring a few options yourself — moving around DLLs and such — FSR 4 can be all yours, ever before AMD seems to start caring about it on a serious level. It's funny because all the hard work is already behind them, they've made the upscaler we always wanted but stopped at the final step where you actually make the tech prevalent. If the community with barely any resources can do it, a billion-dollar corporation should certainly be able to as well. For now, though, this is our best bet, without spending money on alternatives like Lossless Scaling.

Sometimes you don't have to wait for Prime Day or Black Friday to score the lowest prices on Amazon. And actually, it just dropped a record low price on one of the most popular and easy-to-use outdoor cameras available: the eufy Security SoloCam S220. For a short while, this 2K solar-powered security camera can be yours for $69 which is a whopping 46% discount from its regular list price of $130.

See at Amazon

For outdoor security cameras, the SoloCam S220 is a low-maintenance choice that is easy to install and easier to maintain. With its solar panel built right in, you'll never again waste your time climbing up and down ladders to replace batteries or dealing with heavy power cables. Several hours of direct sun per day are enough to keep the camera running continuously, and it gives you total peace of mind with virtually no upkeep. Its compact and weather-resistant (IP67-rated) housing can tolerate snow, rain and scorching summer sun.

The SoloCam S220 delivers a crisp 2K video resolution and captures every detail with breathtaking clarity. Faces, license plates and even small movements are clearly visible during the day or night, thanks to built-in infrared night vision. The wide field of view covers a lot of area of your property: you can see driveways, entrance points, and backyards with equal ease, all through the eufy Security app on your phone for free.

If you're looking for an easy method for increasing the security of your home, capabilities like human detection make sure you get notified about what matters most and avoid unnecessary alerts due to pets or passing cars. Instant alerts appear on your smartphone and notify you what's happening outside your home the moment something gets detected. Two-way audio lets you hear and talk straight through the camera picture, so you can greet guests or deter unwanted visitors.

Among the most important advantages of the SoloCam S220 is its commitment to value and privacy: you don't need to pay recurring subscription fees. Unlike nearly all competition which has recurring subscription costs for cloud storage, eufy's SoloCam saves recorded events on board, which means you keep full ownership of your clips and can play back important ones at will.

The camera needs just a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connection to operate, quickly installing in seconds and with complete flexibility. The provided mounts provide seamless wall, eave or outdoor fixture installation, while the single-piece design becomes nearly imperceptible in most outdoor environments.

If you're looking to improve your home security, this record-low Amazon deal is a no-brainer.

Thingiverse is cracking down on gun-related models using a new automated system.

As much as we love 3D printing, there's no denying the dangerous potential that comes with something like a modern 3D printer. Creating a weapon is as easy as loading a print file in your print queue, which is why big companies like Thingiverse have taken action to make the file acquisition process as hard as possible on their part. According to ABC, Thingiverse is now implementing a new strategy to stop users from uploading things like gun-related files before they're openly distributed on the platform.

This effort comes in response to an investigation handled by the New York Police Department (NYPD). The NYPD came across hundreds of weapon-related files on Thingiverse that could be downloaded by users and presumably 3D printed. Thingiverse is one of the largest websites for downloading 3D printable model files. ABC argues its rapid growth and subsequent jump in scale made it harder for the team to regulate these types of files.

The lack of control made it difficult for the team to manage, which led to the results found in the NYPD investigation. Thingiverse is now responding with a new "automated technology" designed to block the upload of dangerous files, like guns and gun-related components, before they're published.

The powers behind the movement at the District Attorney's office in New York confirm that they do not expect this effort to eradicate ghost guns. They do, however, want to make the process of finding ghost gun files as hard as possible and have decided to address one of the biggest sources for 3D printable CAD files in their efforts to help make that happen.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg also contacted 3D printer companies like Bambu Lab, requesting they join in efforts to add hurdles to users who want to 3D print guns and gun-related components. Bragg requested Bambu Lab consider implementing an AI-driven system that checks CAD files against a model trained on gun blueprints to automatically detect gun-shaped parts.

Back to School is almost here and Amazon is offering some great deals on top laptop brands such as HP, Lenovo, and Dell. If you want a 17″ one to get the full benefit of a large screen, there is an incredible deal you should opt for now especially if you want decent performance, latest AI features and unbeatable value.

The HP 17-inch laptop (ntel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, AI Copilot Key, Windows 11 Pro, Office Pro Lifetime) is now available at an all-time low price of just $849, down from its premium list price of $2,599. That's a massive 67% off (and $1,750 off) and this laptop is one of the top bargains (if not the best) in Amazon's early Back to School sale.

The generous 17.3-inch HD+ display gives you lots of space for all your content so you can set out spreadsheets, have multiple browser windows open or view videos in greater ease. This makes it all the more convenient if you like to have plenty of space to get on with academic tasks or business projects.

Inside, the laptop comes with an Intel Core i3-N305 processor that keeps everything rolling along smoothly and responsively, whether you're drafting a research paper, working on a client report, or just keeping current with email. Among the most high-tech of its features is a Microsoft Copilot key with the potential for in-the-moment AI assistance just an inch away.

With its 32GB of RAM, you're able to have lots of apps and tabs open without slowing down so you can multitask as much as your job demands. The 1TB SSD has enough room for all your files plus fast boot times and fast access to data. If you love frustration-free computing and need the space to keep everything together in one place, this configuration has it all covered.

The lift-hinge ergonomic keyboard is designed for hours of typing and keeps fatigue at bay with long work or study marathons. The full numeric keypad makes it ideal for anyone who works with numbers or entering data occasionally, and brings a boost of productivity. Battery life is also excellent at up to 10 hours on a single charge so you can safely leave your charger at home.

One of the best things about the Nintendo Switch 2 is its versatility. The new console continues to balance on-the-go handheld gaming with big-screen TV play, remains backward compatible with most Switch games, and adds more retro games to its digital library with the arrival of classic GameCube games.

That variety makes for several ways to play. From the upgraded Joy-Con 2 grips that introduce point-and-click mouse controls alongside the familiar motion tracking features, to the dedicated Switch 2 Pro Controller for players who want a more traditional joypad to hand, there's already no shortage of controller options for Switch 2—but what's the best?

That depends on what you need—are you a couch gamer who wants the best pad for the big screen? Want to play retro titles in the most authentic way possible? Or do you just fancy making the most of the Switch 2's multiplayer features? It can be a confusing field, but fear not—here are the best ways to get the most out of the Switch 2, whatever and however you're playing. Read our Best Switch 2 Accessories guide for more.

Sure, you get a pair of these miniature marvels with the Switch 2 itself, but given that the new console remains as heavily focused on multiplayer as the original, you may want some extras. As of publication, there are no third-party Joy-Con 2s available, so Nintendo's official models are the way to go. While you're more likely to pick up Joy-Con 2s in pairs, Nintendo does sell them individually, useful for replacements.

The Joy-Con 2 controllers appear to be essentially the same as those on the first Switch, but they offer some notable upgrades. They're larger—an approximate 14 percent increase in size—making them more comfortable for larger hands, and their buttons are slightly bigger to match. When using one Joy-Con 2 as a single controller, the integrated SL and SR shoulder buttons are more prominent, while the gyroscopic motion detection and “HD Rumble 2” haptic motors are improved. Thumbsticks on both Joy-Con 2s feel smoother, although there's still no use of Hall effect or tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) to eliminate drift risk. This may be because the new Joy-Cons connect to the console using magnets, which may impact those technologies.

The biggest differences are the ability to use each controller as a mouse, which opens up a host of new play options for the Switch 2, although comfort is an issue. There's also the addition of the new C button to the right-hand Joy-Con 2, which brings up the GameChat communications menu. Overall, the new-gen Joy-Cons are solid improvements over the last, refining the play experience for Nintendo's latest hardware.

Don't throw out your original Switch Joy-Cons just yet, though, especially if you plan on keeping older games around. While the Switch 2's backwards compatibility is near-universal, there are a handful of titles that won't work with the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Thankfully, classic Joy-Cons will easily pair wirelessly with the new console, allowing you to keep playing the likes of Ring Fit Adventure, WarioWare: Move It!, and several Nintendo Labo kits well into the future.

The problem is that you won't be able to keep original Joy-Cons charged by connecting them to the Switch 2 console—they're smaller and lack the magnetic connectors. If you've gotten rid of your original Switch but want to keep some OG controllers around, pick up a separate charging dock, like PowerA's Joy-Con Charging Stand, which can keep up to four grips juiced up and ready to go.

Don't forget that these controllers were also notorious for stick drift, and while Nintendo hasn't assuaged concerns with the newer Joy-Con 2 controllers, it has specifically said that they've been redesigned from the ground up for better long-term durability.

Like the Joy-Con 2s, there's a sense of continuity from the original Switch to the new generation's Pro Controller. At a glance, it's essentially the same—a more conventional controller in the mold of those used on Xbox or PlayStation, perfect for Switch 2 games that don't require the unique features of the Joy-Cons. However, this is crammed with clever adjustments and design tweaks that make it feel substantially different from its predecessor.

Chiefly, it feels smaller in the hand thanks to slimmed-down grips that sit at a slightly tighter angle. It only weighs 11 grams less than its predecessor—235 versus 246—but seems much lighter. Subtler but still impactful tweaks include larger face buttons, and smoother, more responsive thumbsticks—although these still don't use Hall effect or TMR technology, meaning drift remains a risk. It feels great to hold, though, thanks to an almost seamless design, a choice that has the benefit of leaving few ridges or component joins where hand sweat can accumulate after long play sessions.

The big changes are the addition of a 3.5-mm audio jack at the base of the controller, allowing a headset or mic to be connected—tying in perfectly with Nintendo's social gaming push with its integrated GameChat feature, accessed through the new, central C button—and the addition of new GL and GR buttons on the underside. These inputs can be customized on a per-game basis—simply hold down the Home button, and they can be remapped on the fly. Modifications are remembered per user, per game, which puts the “pro” in Pro Controller. These upgrades come at a literal cost, but this is one of the best ways to play on Switch 2.

PowerA

Walmart (Mario Time)

This third-party offering from peripheral maker PowerA offers one big upgrade over Nintendo's controllers: Hall effect technology. Not only does that remove any risk of dreaded drifting on its thumbsticks, but it makes for better, more reliable performance, as the sensors can far more accurately track the degree of movement applied to the sticks.

Like the official Pro Controller, this features programmable buttons on the underside of the hand grips. It also features a 3.5-mm audio jack, but goes one better with onboard audio controls, allowing you to adjust headset volume, mute your microphone, and switch between three equalizer modes—standard, bass boost, and immersive (though overall audio quality will depend on your headset).

There are some compromises to consider, though. It's a wired-only controller and must be connected to the Switch 2 dock, and although it comes with a 3-meter (10-foot) cable, that still limits range. It also rearranges the Switch 2's system buttons—the Home, Capture, Plus (+), Minus (-), and C buttons—to a single row at the base of the pad. While that allows for some bold and colorful designs spotlighting Mario and pals, the different orientation and smaller design of these buttons are hard to get used to. It also lacks HD rumble or motion control features, and there's no NFC reader built in, meaning it can't read Amiibo figures. Still, for the performance boost thanks to that elusive Hall effect, this is a strong alternative to the Pro Controller—especially at this price.

The launch of Switch 2 brings with it a selection of retro GameCube games for subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online service. As it did for the NES, SNES, N64, and even Sega Genesis/Mega Drive when games from those platforms joined the library, Nintendo has released a perfect recreation of the original controller, allowing you to play those classic games as authentically as possible.

For anyone who was gaming when the GameCube was first around, it's slightly surreal to now have a perfect recreation of the original controller that's wireless but not the bulkier WaveBird model. It's no bad thing, though, and decades-old muscle memory will soon kick in. Younger players might find the unusually-shaped controller odd at first, with its tiny nub of a C-Stick and its chunky, rounded shoulder triggers, but after a few laps of F-Zero GX, you soon realize how perfectly tailored the controller was for its games.

For the modern update, Nintendo has tweaked the design slightly, incorporating controls specific to the Switch 2–namely the Home, screen capture, and C buttons—at the top of the pad, and added a tiny new ZL button on the left-hand shoulder. That helps make this GameCube pad broadly compatible with some modern Switch and Switch 2 games, though not a perfect match—the Start button here mimics the Switch 2's plus (+) button, there's nothing to replicate the minus (-) button, and it lacks newer features such as clickable thumbsticks.

However, availability is a problem for this controller. It's only available directly from Nintendo's online store, can only be purchased if you have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription, and is limited to one unit per account in the US, but two per account in the UK.

Not every Switch 2 game requires the motion controls of the Joy-Con 2s, which is why the console comes with a basic grip frame, allowing you to slot the two individual controllers into either side for one, more conventionally arranged, joypad. While that will do in a pinch if you want to play games sitting on the couch, with the console docked to your TV, the official Nintendo Charging Grip offers a few noteworthy upgrades.

One is simply the power delivery feature—connect a USB-C cable into the top of the Charging Grip and you can game for as long as you like, or leave the combined unit to charge when not playing. It comes with a 1.5-meter USB-A to USB-C cable, allowing you to connect this to the ports on the side of the Switch 2's dock for charging. It also incorporates the new GL and GR buttons on the underside, as found on the Switch 2 Pro Controller. As with that pad, they can be customized on a per-game basis, but in my tests, it doesn't seem to remember settings between play sessions. Still, it's a handy feature, and remapping controls is quick and easy. Being able to quickly attach and detach the Joy-Con 2s is also great for any games that switch between various control modes.

In terms of design and ergonomics, it has some weaknesses, though. A translucent shell is an odd decision given nothing else about Switch 2 takes that approach, while the front of the grips—where the base of your thumbs rest—is flat rather than rounded, with an edge that can dig in after a while. It also lacks the 3.5-mm audio jack of the Pro Controller, but given that this is less than half the price, it makes for a good halfway house.

Not strictly controllers in their own right, these shells allow you to slot in a single Joy-Con 2, turning them into miniature steering wheels. Sold in pairs, these are laser-focused on racing game fans—realistically, Mario Kart World, but sci-fi racer Fast Fusion will make good use of them too, and make the motion controls feel that bit more intuitive.

They're smartly designed—despite housing the larger Joy-Con 2s, the wheels aren't much larger than those for the original Switch, while chunky shoulder buttons on the rear of the wheel itself make the SL and SR buttons of each Joy-Con 2 even more accessible. That makes them comfortable enough for older players, but likely to be most appealing to younger players who will enjoy properly “driving” around with these.

They're undeniably a gimmicky purchase, and there's a paucity of games where you're likely to get much use from them, but the Joy-Con 2 Wheels are a nice addition to any living room racing tournament.

Tesla opened the doors to its first showroom in India this week, and among the first visitors was Vishal Gondal — a longtime Tesla and Elon Musk loyalist who pre-booked a Model 3 in April 2016, just hours after reservations went live. But despite showing up on day one, Gondal says he has no plans to buy a Tesla now.

“I felt a little bit underwhelmed,” said Gondal, founder and CEO of fitness-tech startup GOQii, after visiting the maiden Tesla showroom in Mumbai's Bandra-Kurla Complex.

Over the better part of a decade, Gondal held out hope for Tesla's debut in India. But his excitement soured when he had to chase the company for a refund in 2023 — sending multiple emails just to get his $1,000 reservation fee.

“Trying to get the money back was a problem,” he told TechCrunch. “And the joke was, had we invested that money in Tesla IPO stock, we would have made more money.”

Gondal is among the earliest backers of Tesla in India — someone who pre-booked a vehicle long before there were any guarantees. But nine years on, it seems many of those early believers are not celebrating the launch and have instead made up their mind not to go with Tesla, at least on its debut.

Those backers never got their Model 3s, for which they paid the reservation fee soon after Musk promised to launch the car in the country. And some, like Gondal, even waited and tried hard for years to get the refund, while some got it in May, just a couple of months before Tesla's formal debut.

“It is frustrating to see Tesla take so long. I mean, our government and processes and red carpet are hard, but it's hilarious that even Starlink has gotten approval in a shorter period,” said Varun Krishnan, who runs tech blog FoneArena from Chennai and is also one of Tesla's early backers in India.

Tesla did not invite these loyalists to visit its Mumbai showroom, nor did it give them an update on the launch.

The 6,000-square-foot Tesla showroom is located in Maker Maxity Mall, near Apple's first store in the country. Nonetheless, Gondal said Tesla's store was nowhere near similar to that of the Apple store launch.

“When Apple launched their showroom in the same place, the buzz that Apple was able to create versus the buzz that Tesla was able to create, there is a world of difference,” he said.

Gondal went to the Tesla showroom in his Audi e-Tron, which he had bought the previous year, after waiting a long time for the Model 3.

“This felt like the coldest launch,” said Amit Bhawani, founder of tech blog Phoneradar, who also pre-reserved the Model 3 in 2016.

Bhawani eventually got the $1,000 refund after criticizing Tesla in a video released on YouTube in 2020.

The video received comments from dozens of people who had also reserved the Model 3 in India and were waiting for a refund, he said.

“That's when I felt that the whole love for Tesla became a real hatred for Tesla,” he told TechCrunch.

“The least Tesla could have done was email all the people who reserved the car earlier and said, ‘Guys, we are going to have a special event for you',” Gondal said. “Those people really went out of their way, and even though let's say it's not a big amount, it was saying that we support Tesla.”

Some others, like Kawaljit Singh Bedi, said they have no regrets about supporting Tesla, although they received the refund just before the launch this year. Nevertheless, they are also not looking to buy a Tesla soon.

“After all these years I have waited, I'm in no hurry to buy it now and become the first one to have it, because what's the point? I waited nine years? I can wait nine years and six months more,” said Bedi, co-founder and CTO of Frammer AI.

“Most of them who had put in their early vote of confidence are disappointed, including, I know, Vishal and Vijay [Shekhar Sharma of Paytm],” said Krishnan. “People like Vishal or Vijay, they are taken with a lot of authority. So, if they are buying something, there would be 100 people going by their word.”

Sharma, founder and CEO of Indian fintech giant Paytm, echoed comments from other early backers, telling TechCrunch that he would not go with Tesla and would rather wait for a larger portfolio of cars.

“It may be a bit too late,” he said. “There are so many other options with price-value math more suited for India.”

The years-long delay in Tesla's launch — along with not being invited to the showroom opening — has left some of the brand's earliest Indian loyalists feeling let down, said Arun Bhatt, founder of Tesla Club India, who also pre-booked a Model 3 in 2016

“You paid something and you ardently waited for 10 years, and then out of the blue, they just tell you, we'll cancel it and we'll refund, then what happens — 10 years having waited for something, will we be given preferential treatment?” he questioned. “There's zero communication regarding that. So, eight out of 10 reservation holders are frustrated.”

Bhatt started the club with another Tesla enthusiast and Delhi University student, Nikhil Chaudhary, in 2019 as an informal group for people having an interest in the EV carmaker. However, he told TechCrunch that due to the delay in Tesla's launch in the country, the club has slowly changed from a Tesla awareness club to an EV and clean energy awareness club.

One of the concerns that many Tesla early backers have is the lack of clarity on how Tesla will set up the Supercharger network in the country and handle after-sales care. The company announced that it would establish eight charging stations, equally distributed across Delhi and Mumbai, before starting its deliveries in Q3. However, it is unclear whether these will be sufficient to provide enough backing to Tesla drivers in these two cities. Additionally, there are no announcements regarding how Tesla plans to handle after-sales service of its cars in India.

“Having gotten older in nine years, I've also gotten more prudent in my vehicle purchase process. I'm more worried about practical things than just the Tesla brand tag, which I fell in love with 10 years ago,” said Krishnan of FoneArena.

“There is no real excitement to own the first car, knowing that there is no Supercharger network also,” Bedi of Frammer AI said.

In recent months, Musk's public persona has undergone a shift — from a visionary entrepreneur running multiple companies to a polarizing political figure in the U.S. This transformation has impacted Tesla's stock and business not only in America but also in key international markets. India appears to be no exception.

“After the whole elections and the politics, and whatever is happening, I don't see Elon with the same colors as what I used to,” FoneArena's Krishnan said.

Kunal Khattar, an EV-focused investor in India and founder of VC firm AdvantEdge Founders, echoed Krishnan's sentiment, saying Tesla has lost “a little bit of its shine” due to several factors — including Musk's political involvement, his alignment with Trump, and the public fallout that followed.

“People used to think Tesla is saving the world, it's saving the climate, and this and that, it's no longer there,” he said.

Khattar was invited to the Tesla launch in Mumbai. Just like Gondal of GOQii and others, he also described it as “underwhelming” and “not like a typical vehicle launch.”

Tesla has launched the Model Y in India, starting at ₹59,89,000 (approximately $68,000). Some compare the India pricing with that of the Model Y in the U.S., which begins at $44,990 (₹38,71,000). However, the carmaker is importing the car from China — rather than manufacturing it locally in the country — something that the industry commonly refers to as a Completely Built-Up (CBU). This adds up to tariffs that Tesla is set to pay for some time, until it decides to set up a local factory, and thus, customers will have to pay an exorbitant price.

In India, the premium segment, which starts from ₹35,00,000 (approximately $40,700) and goes up to ₹1,00,00,000 (approximately $116,200), comprises just 1% of the total car sales in India, roughly 50,000 vehicles. However, in that 1%, electric cars have almost a 10% share so far, per Puneet Gupta, director, S&P Global Mobility.

“With Tesla coming in, and if Tesla really starts manufacturing in India, maybe two years down the line, there is no doubt about it that it will make a strong case for all these OEMs [original equipment manufacturers], including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi, to make a vehicle for our Indian customer for the first time,” he said. “The problem is that India has never been able to convince these OEMs that they can really make an India-centric product, and it will have sufficient volumes.”

Overall, electric car sales in India accounted for just 2.5% of the total market in 2024, per Counterpoint. But it was “almost negligible” in 2016, when Tesla initially announced its entry. This was also the reason why people showed a lot of interest in Tesla back then.

“These days, everyone can get a beautiful, amazing, super powerful electric vehicle in India. So, Tesla is not something ‘wow' worthy, except for 5-10 minutes, people should ask to just take a look inside it,” Bhawani of PhoneRadar said.

India's automobile giant Tata Motors has dominated the country's electric car market in recent years, though others — including China's MG Motor, which recently signed a joint venture with Indian conglomerate JSW Group — are starting to gain ground.

The premium segment remains niche in the country, though the increasing number of high-net-worth individuals has led to a 66 percent year-over-year rise in the sales of premium EVs during the first five months of 2025, Abhik Mukherjee, a research analyst for automotive and IoT at Counterpoint, told TechCrunch.

BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover, Volvo, and select models from Hyundai and Kia are sitting in the segment where Tesla has brought the Model Y to the country.

“Tesla's current price point is unlikely to cause any dent to the brands operating within that price range,” Mukherjee said.

Nonetheless, Tesla's debut is likely to draw some customer attention to electric cars in a market where two-wheelers dominate the EV space.

“People will at least put EVs in their consideration set. Will Tesla sell a lot of cars? I don't think so … Will Tesla increase the sales of other EV brands? I think so,” Khattar of AdvantEdge Founders said.

Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

There are more than enough smartphone chargers available on the market, yet true portable laptop chargers are few and far between. That's why the popular Anker laptop power bank is so popular among users looking for fast and reliable juice to their bigger gear. Anker is the one everyone's talking about when it comes to charging, and its 25,000mAh 100W power bank is a hot ticket right now – especially since it's currently discounted to an all-time low price on Amazon.

You can pick up this Anker power bank for $109, down from its typical $135 list price with a limited-time promotion that's discounted 19% from the regular price. This all-time low gets you a serious battery boost for a shockingly low price. And obviously, you can also charge your phones and tablets with that gadget.

See at Amazon

Its massive 25,000mAh capacity gives you enough to fully charge most laptops or provide multiple charges on phones and tablets before it needs to be replenished. For extended flights or working sessions away from the office, this high-capacity battery is a real game-changer as it allows you to work or stream for several hours without having to hunt for an outlet. Its power capacity is 90Wh (under the 100Wh regulation limit), so you can store it in your carry-on bag on virtually any airline.

This charger can also charge multiple devices at once: It includes three USB-C charging ports, each giving a maximum of 100W—more than enough to charge up the newest MacBook Pro, a Windows ultrabook, or USB-C charge tablets. If you must split power with colleagues, charge your phone and headphones and charge your laptop, this charger is more than ready to perform the job. Other than the USB-C ports, there is even a USB-A port so you're covered for legacy devices as well.

Two USB-C cables are provided one being retractable to a length of 2.3 feet and being put through more than 20,000 pulls, and the other being used as a stiff carry strap and tested to more than 20,000 bends. You won't need to fossick for other cords in the bottom of your bag and you'll have a cable on hand at all times.

Charging the power bank itself is also quick and easy with 100W ultra-fast input support: Fill the bank up by 30% in only 20 minutes so you can quickly get back to a functional level in a short time-out. Charging four devices at a time is another innovation and the energy management system makes sure every device plugged in is charged safely and efficiently.

If you're looking for a serious charging upgrade, this Anker charger checks all the boxes.

Microsoft has reportedly added a new feature to the latest Windows Insider build that lets you play its output across multiple devices or speakers. X (formerly Twitter) user phantomofearth shared screenshots that showed a new ‘Shared audio' button in the Quick Settings panel beside the ‘Project' button (that's already widely available on Windows 11 devices). When clicked, it reveals a selection of audio devices connected to your computer. You can then tick the checkboxes on the devices you want to listen to and click Share to start outputting sound across multiple speakers.

At the moment, Windows does not support a native way of outputting audio to multiple different devices. A workaround involving the built-in Stereo Mix feature often does not work and can result in unwanted audio feedback. There are some third-party apps you can download, like OBS, Voicemeeter, or Audio Router, but they can get complicated and a bit too difficult for most people who simply want to share their audio experience.

Unfortunately, this new feature remains undocumented by Microsoft — even in the latest Windows Insider Blog — meaning it's not yet an official or confirmed feature that is on the way to the wider Windows user base. We also don't know if it works with just physically connected speakers, or if it's also compatible with multiple Bluetooth devices. Nevertheless, we hope that this makes it through Beta testing and into mainstream release, as it's a great feature for laptops and gaming handhelds. While not quite useful for 5.1 surround sound effects and the like, the multi-speaker sharing option is great if you want to watch a movie with someone else in a public place, like a plane, without having to share a single pair of earbuds between you.

If you want to get your hands on this feature (and several more that Microsoft experiments with) in advance, you need to sign up for Windows Insider and join the Canary Channel. However, these are often the most unstable builds of Windows that haven't been thoroughly tested yet (remember, you're the one doing the testing), so you might run into unexpected issues if you have these updates turned on. It's also not a guarantee that you'll get the ‘Shared audio' feature or any other features you might find other Insiders people have, especially as Microsoft may push updates to different devices randomly.

Artificial intelligence is now more pervasive than ever in the apps and gadgets we use day to day, and that of course extends to smartphones: Google Gemini on Pixels and other Android handsets, Apple Intelligence (currently still rolling out) on iPhones, and Galaxy AI on Samsung smartphones.

These tools can help you refine text, generate images, and summarize documents, among other tricks, and you don't have to go far through your apps to find an AI feature ready and willing to help you with something.

With Samsung Galaxy AI, you have the option to disable the AI features you don't want to use, or switch off artificial intelligence altogether. If you're on one of the latest Galaxy S25 phones (with the fastest, AI-capable chips), you also get the option to keep most of the AI enabled but process it on your device, without transferring anything to the cloud.

Galaxy AI is spread right through the latest One UI 6 and One UI 7 software updates from Samsung. More recent additions include the Now Brief screen that aims to bring you the information you need the most at the right time, and the Audio Eraser tool for quickly removing background noise from videos.

There are generative AI editing tools for your photos, and generative AI writing options for your emails and messages. If you're not happy with the way a block of text reads or the way a picture is looking, you can deploy some Galaxy AI magic and make changes with a few well-chosen prompts.

Galaxy AI is only ever a few taps away.

This all requires some pretty deep access to your apps and to your data, which is one reason to carefully consider whether or not you want to use these tools. For example, Galaxy AI has to be able to read your email in order to rewrite it, and some of the data you're asking the AI to work with may be traveling to and from Samsung's servers for processing.

Samsung says that all Galaxy AI data is securely encrypted and protected from prying eyes, though of course no security protection can ever be guaranteed to be fully 100 percent effective all of the time. You can find the full Samsung privacy policy online.

Perhaps you're not sure about allowing Galaxy AI access to everything you're writing and editing, or maybe you just find the AI features a little too pushy. On Galaxy smartphones, you've got the option to turn off some or all of these features.

To see the AI features that are currently active, open up Settings, then choose Galaxy AI. You get a full list of what the AI can do on Samsung phones, and it might be more comprehensive than you realized: everything from transcribing voice recordings to giving you personalized insights into your fitness data.

You can access all the Galaxy AI features from the same menu.

Tap on any of these Galaxy AI features to make changes. The exact options you see will depend on the feature, and some of these features come with sub-features, but they all come with toggle switches for turning the tools on or off. You also get descriptions for how your data is managed.

Select Photo assist, for example, and there are three tools listed: Generative edit (using AI to remove and move objects in images), Sketch to image (for turning basic outlines into photos), and Portrait studio (for turning photos of people into cartoons and sketches). Use the toggle switch at the top to turn all these features on or off.

Open Galaxy AI from Settings on a Samsung Galaxy S25 phone, and you'll see a Process data only on device toggle switch at the bottom of the AI feature list. These phones have Snapdragon 8 Elite chipsets inside them, with powerful enough AI processing capabilities to take care of some jobs without transferring data to and from the cloud.

That's some jobs, not all jobs; you'll see that some of the features are no longer available when you flick the toggle switch for on-device processing. Samsung doesn't provide a definitive list of which features can work without the cloud, but automatic summaries and generative AI editing are among those mentioned as needing internet access.

On-device processing is more private, but limits some features.

There are also a few Process data only on device toggle switches available inside the Galaxy AI feature menus—there's one for Writing assist, for example. You can still use the feature without accessing the cloud, but the number of languages available to you for translations is reduced, because you're relying on local files.

Overall, there's a good amount of control here, letting you strike your preferred balance between Galaxy AI features, software bloat, and data privacy. No doubt there are more Galaxy AI features to come further down the line, so be sure to check this list regularly to see what you have access to on your device.

Filament—the future of forensics?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Tracing the source of 3D printing ghost guns has been a serious topic since the beginning of their existence. Those doing the printing want to keep the manufacturing source a secret, while forensic investigators like Kirk Garrison from the San Bernardino Sheriff's department are looking to find any sort of "fingerprints" left behind by nefarious manufacturers. An interview with Garrison shared by 404 Media suggests he may have found a way to link 3D printed objects, like ghost gun components, to specific printers.

In the interview, Garrison explained how he recently began looking for ways that forensics investigators might be able to identify printers by any traces left behind in the objects they print. So far, he's had success in identifying key signatures, also known as toolmarks, found consistently from specific 3D printers.

If you're not familiar with the term toolmark, it refers to a type of mark found on an object that's left by the maker and or one of the tools used in its manufacturing process. In this case, Garrison has discovered consistent toolmarks in the way in which filament is dispersed during the print process on certain lines.

Garisson has studied 3D printed objects, more specifically, 3D printed weapons, using a microscope. It was while studying the 3D printed component up close that he noticed scuff marks in a repeated pattern across the object. Using this, he was able to find matching characteristics in other objects, suggesting they were printed by the same printer and possibly even the same batch.

It's important to note that this information isn't enough to determine exactly what printer created what object. However, it can help narrow down information during investigations. There are also many factors like extruder size, nozzle temperature and bed type that can impact the look of the final object. It's also hard to determine when an object was printed using a different printer or if it was printed from the same one but in a different location on the print bed.

This type of forensic study is brand new and unexplored. Whether or not it turns into a useful foray has to be seen, but Garisson is for sure one of the brilliant minds asking questions and leading the way.

If you're interested in 3D printing but aren't sure where to start, we always suggest newcomers check out our list of the best 3D printers to get an idea of what's out there. Who knows, it could bring you one step closer to a career in forensics.

Amazon has barely had time to catch its breath with Prime Day, and already it is launching Back to School deals with a new wave of discounts. In all these deals, some of the small (but vital) pieces of hardware like Anker's chargers have caught our attention.

Right now, Amazon is featuring the Anker 2-Pack 20W fast USB-C charger at its lowest price ever: Normally $19, with a coupon applied at checkout, this set drops to only $12 which is a savings of over 32%. For less than the cost of a single charger from many brands, you're getting two high-quality blocks plus two 5-foot USB-C cables.

See at Amazon

These wall charger blocks give you a maximum of 20W fast charging power each, and that's precisely what you require for the latest iPhone models (like the iPhone 16, 16 Pro Max, and more) and really any other more recent Apple device. Fast charging allows you to charge your battery from flat to more than 50% in around 25 minutes so you never have to sit around waiting for your phone to come on. The blocks are also universal for a wide selection of other devices including the iPad Pro, AirPods, Android phones, tablets, and even some small laptops.

There's actually a dual-port feature: both adapters feature a USB-C and a USB-A port. You can charge two devices at once without slowing down which is perfect if you're working with a phone and a wireless earbud case for instance. Having both ports available to use simultaneously enables you to have your tech ready for the needs of all day, and it makes life a little bit easier where power outlets are limited.

Safety is of the highest concern with this Anker pack: Each charger has Anker's MultiProtect safe system which safeguards your devices using advanced temperature control, overcurrent protection, and short-circuit prevention. It is nice to have peace of mind and know your phone or tablet is safe to fast charge.

At $12 for a pair of chargers and cables, it's hard to find something better or more useful in your daily tech setup before the new term begins.

Since entering Jupiter's orbit in 2016, NASA's Juno spacecraft has been hard at work unveiling the many mysteries of our solar system's largest planet. And its latest discovery may be one of the most intriguing yet: an entirely new type of plasma wave near Jupiter's poles. 

In a paper published Wednesday in Physical Review Letters, astronomers describe an unusual pattern of plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere—a magnetic “bubble” shielding the planet from external radiation. Jupiter's exceptionally powerful magnetic field appears to be forcing two very different types of plasmas to jiggle in tandem, creating a unique flow of charged particles and atoms in its polar regions. 

Plasma is a key force in shaping Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere. As such, the researchers believe the new observations will further advance our understanding of not only Jupiter's weather events but also the magnetic properties of distant exoplanets. 

For the study, the researchers analyzed the behavior of plasma waves in Jupiter's magnetosphere containing highly magnetized, low-density plasma. The team, a collaboration between researchers from the University of Minnesota, the University of Iowa, and the Southwest Research Institute, Texas, found an unexpected oscillation between Alfvén waves and Langmuir waves, which reflect the movement of the plasma's atoms and the movement of the electrons in the plasma, respectively. 

Electrons are much lighter than charged atoms, meaning that, normally, the two wave types ripple at very different frequencies—which was clearly not the case for Jupiter's magnetosphere, prompting the researchers to take a closer look. The ensuing investigation unveiled a never-before-seen type of plasma oscillation near Jupiter's poles. 

“The observed plasma properties are really unusual, not found before and elsewhere in our solar system,” John Leif Jørgensen, a planetary scientist at the Technical University of Denmark who wasn't involved in the new work, told New Scientist. 

Unlike Earth's auroras, which are caused by solar storms, Jupiter's auroras—a barrage of frisky, superfast particles that are hundreds of times more energetic than auroras on Earth—sometimes emerge as a product of its powerful magnetic field. Getting a better grasp on how such phenomena work could be valuable information for future missions in the search for alien life on exoplanets, according to the study authors.

Detailed New Images of Jupiter's Aurora Reveal Strange and Unexplained Brightness

“While such conditions do not occur [on] Earth, it is possible that they apply in polar regions of the other giant planets and potentially in strongly magnetized exoplanets or stars,” the astronomers wrote in the paper.

“Jupiter is the Rosetta Stone of our solar system,” said Scott Bolton, Juno's principal investigator, in NASA's introductory page for the spacecraft. “Juno is going there as our emissary—to interpret what Jupiter has to say.”

Initially, NASA expected Juno's mission to conclude in 2017, when they would intentionally steer the spacecraft into Jupiter's atmosphere, a decision that adheres to NASA's planetary protection requirements. But Juno's flight path evolved over time, and NASA concluded that the spacecraft no longer posed a threat to Jupiter's moons. As a result, the agency authorized extensions to the mission. 

Heck Yes, NASA's Juno and InSight Missions Are Getting Bonus Time

That being said, the scientists do believe that, by September this year, Juno's orbit will degrade naturally, and it will be gobbled up by Jupiter's atmosphere. However, this by no means ends humanity's exploration of Jupiter; Europa Clipper is slated to reach Europa, Jupiter's moon, in 2030 (the last time we checked, it did some sightseeing near Mars). Of course, even after Jupiter consumes Juno, scientists will still have loads of invaluable data from the spacecraft that they'll continue to meticulously analyze for years to come.

In 1994, Commodore crashed and burned. Once a home computing giant across the US and Europe, the company was undone by mismanagement and misfires. The carcass was picked clean and the pieces resold so many times that it was hard to keep track, but with each new owner came the inevitable—an attempt to make a fast buck by slapping the famous C= logo on any old junk.

Fans watched in horror as the brand appeared on the mediocre Web.it all-in-one PC, the bizarrely named Gravel in Pocket media player, and the Commodore smartphone. There was even a Commodore-branded shredder. So when retro gaming YouTuber Christian “Perifractic” Simpson announced he wanted to buy what remained of Commodore and give it a new life, questions were asked. Chief among them: does the world still even need Commodore?

Commodore as a brand initially focused on typewriters and calculators, but its glory days arrived with the rise of home micros, causing a swift rebirth as Commodore International Computing.

Its biggest success was the Commodore 64, which hit the sweet spot between affordability and potential. While the CPU was sluggish, powerful graphics and a surprisingly capable sound chip (which remains revered today) spurred creativity on both sides of the Atlantic. Over 5,000 commercial games were released during the machine's heyday, and more than 15 million units were sold, making the C64 still one of the highest-selling single computer models ever.

It's this legacy Simpson aims to revive. Initially, he sought a licensing deal with the Commodore brand owners, imagining “official” boards and replacement components as part of an inclusive, community-friendly conglomerate. These plans snowballed during discussions, and Simpson found himself securing an agreement to buy Commodore outright for a “low seven-figure” sum. He now serves as Commodore CEO and promises to revive the company in a sustainable way—one that won't repeat the failures of the past.

But here's where things get tricky. Simpson doesn't actually own the original company because that company no longer exists. Commodore's 1990s dismemberment means the current iteration owns a number of trademarks, but essential parts of the ecosystem remain scattered. C64 ROMs and Amiga (Commodore's 16-bit micro) rights belong to Cloanto and Amiga Corporation. AmigaOS is controlled by Hyperion Entertainment. And aside from the odd mass-market flirtation from clone machines, like the C64DTV all-in-one joystick and the plug-and-play THEC64 Mini, major developments that mattered for the past 30 years have all come from the community, not the brand.

It's for these reasons Simpson finds himself walking multiple tightropes. He must avoid alienating enthusiasts that kept the Commodore flame alive, and not imply that only his new Commodore confers legitimacy. He must collaborate closely with owners of other key puzzle pieces and license the Commodore brand fairly to interested third parties. And to recoup that seven-figure sum, the new Commodore must sell enough new hardware, which means moving beyond a dwindling core fanbase.

For now, Simpson's initial play banks heavily on nostalgia—not solely for the C64, but for an entire era. The new Commodore website pitches the company as a “digital detox brand [that's] grounded in digital minimalism.” It rails against social media, glorifies the good old days of “techno optimism”—apparently, the 1980s through to the mid-1990s—and hints that Commodore can help users reclaim their childhoods. But the company also wants to be seen as an innovator with an eye on the future, and this results in a kind of branding whiplash. The new Commodore wants to be both reboot and original; past and future.

Fittingly, this iteration's debut product, the Commodore 64 Ultimate, embodies such tensions. The $500 gold-bling Founders Edition and $350 LED-laden disco case Starlight Edition don't exactly scream digital minimalism. But the $300 BASIC Beige is the spitting image of the original hardware. All models bridge authenticity and modernity by supporting original C64 peripherals and current connectivity, including 1080p HDMI output so you needn't hunt down a CRT TV. Inside, it's all FPGAS—field programmable gate arrays—which ultimately mean simulation rather than the less-accurate emulation found in Chinese retro handhelds and cheap plug-and-play TV devices.

Some critics nonetheless grumble that even this “new” machine is past and present in another way, effectively being an amalgamation of existing products, from the keycaps to the having the Ultimate64 board at its core. However, Ultimate64 creator Gideon Zweijtzer has publicly disagreed that Simpson is merely assembling other people's hard work and slapping on a logo. He believes the Commodore 64 Ultimate was a “joint effort between parties to create a cohesive package” and credits Simpson as someone with reach who can “bring people together.”

That reach will be essential because noble efforts, sentiment, and saying the right thing won't bring sustainability. Even pent-up demand for a new Commodore 64—at the time of writing, over 4000 units have been sold, amounting to $1.5 million in revenue—is a one-off trick that can't be repeated. History shows retro appeal can be short-lived. Outside the hardcore enthusiasts, fans tend to rapidly move beyond rose-tinted, wide-eyed nostalgia; the retro devices they've bought then gather dust. Few remain on sale for long because the market is finite and fickle.

And then, there's the question of games. A large slice of the annual retro gaming market—estimated to be around $2.5 billion, though no one has a great handle on the numbers—comes from software rather than hardware. The issue for Commodore here is that it never released any notable games of its own, so it can't mimic Atari's ability to remake the Atari 2600 with modern connectivity while also reimagining 1980s classics like Pong and Missile Command. And even if Commodore were to license games, nothing in the entire C64 catalog has the cultural clout of Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Sonic the Hedgehog, or Super Mario Bros.

The alternate mainstream option would be an attempt to reestablish Commodore's reputation as a brand that offers computing for the masses, not the classes, ringing in Simpson's desire for a “simpler, distraction-free computing experience.” But what would that mean in practice? Unplugging? Educational and creative tools? Commodore 64 BASIC is notoriously bad, and it's unclear whether enough newcomers will see value in a relatively expensive beige retro box when a Raspberry Pi costs a fraction of the price and can tap into a massive existing ecosystem. But an entirely new platform would be a colossally risky endeavor.

What is the endgame, then? Without hit games and obvious mainstream appeal, how does Commodore survive, let alone thrive? Is it even possible for this 1980s cultural icon to move beyond people who were there at the time and break out of its bubble? It's hard to say.

Perhaps it doesn't have to. Simpson envisions a “single, joined-up family of Commodore machines,” and that could be enough. Commodore would become a community-focused brand, presiding over a modest ecosystem, acting as a benevolent curator that elevates quality projects, brings just enough polish and legitimacy to help the scene flourish, and simply refuses to let the legacy fade. Although investors who've pumped in cash might see things differently.

A much worse scenario would be a repeat of the past: panic over income, leading to the brand again being stamped on unremarkable products, or the mismanagement and misfires that alienate partners and fans. There's also the very real possibility that Commodore might just discover the harsh reality of being a very niche, small player in an industry of giants. Any one of those could deal a final, fatal blow to the brand from which it would never recover, taking down swathes of the community with it.

Still, this time feels different. This revival doesn't come from cynicism but from genuine passion and love for the brand. Even so, the odds of success feel slim, whether that means sparking a new wave of computing optimism or returning the brand to cultural relevance. But for a while at least, fans can remain optimistic this might finally be the play that truly brings Commodore back to life.

I feel qualified to opine on this as both a former power user of Word and someone building a word processor for lawyers from scratch[1]. I've spent hours pouring over both the .doc and OOXML specs and implementing them. There's a pretty obvious journey visible in those specs from 1984 when computers were under powered with RAM rounding to zero through the 00's when XML was the hot idea to today when MSFT wants everyone on the cloud for life.
Unlike say an IDE or generic text editor where developers are excited to work on and dogfood the product via self-hosting, word processors are kind of boring and require separate testing/QA.It's not "artificial", it's just complex.MSFT has the deep pockets to fund that development and testing/QA.

As for complexity, an illustration-- while using M365 I recently was confounded by a stretch of text that had background highlighting that was neither highlight markup, not paragraph or style formatting. An AI turned me onto an obscure dialog for background shading at a text level which explained the mystery. I've been a sophisticated user of M365 for decades and never encountered such a thing, nor have a clear idea of why anyone would use text-level background formatting in preference of the more obvious choices. Yet, there it is. With that kind of complexity and obscurity in the actual product, it's inevitable the file format would be convoluted and complex.

Eggs have been a dietary staple since before humans evolved to be humans. Although they are packed with nutrients, relatively cost-effective, and easy to source, they have been the subject of much controversy in the health and wellness domain over the years.

A study whose results appear in The Journal of Nutrition, however, may help reestablish their good reputation. 

According to the authors, eating one egg per week was associated with a 47% reduction in Alzheimer's risk compared with eating eggs less than once each month. 

They also showed that those eating eggs had a reduced buildup of the toxic proteins associated with Alzheimer's.

Before we get into the details, we should mention that some of the authors received funding from the Egg Nutrition Center, “the science and nutrition education division of the American Egg Board.”

Are eggs good for you or bad for you? One hundred years ago, and for thousands of years before that, eggs were considered essential. Nutrient-dense and rich in protein and micronutrients, eggs were a staple throughout the world.

Then, a few decades ago, scientists found that high levels of cholesterol in the blood were a risk factor for heart disease, so high-cholesterol eggs were pushed to the naughty corner.

However, as nutrition science progressed, it became clear that dietary cholesterol did not significantly impact blood levels of cholesterol.

Thanks to this new understanding, and a healthy dose of research funding from the Egg Nutrition Center, eggs were edged slowly back into play.

Their saturated fat content, though, is still a concern, so eggs are still partially sidelined. Still, they are likely much healthier than many of the low-fat, highly processed snacks that have replaced eggs in modern kitchens. In fact, eggs contain all essential trace elements.

Today, most nutritionists and associated experts have a relatively neutral view of eggs. In general, the advice is that they can form a part of a healthy, well-balanced diet, but at the same time, eating multiple eggs per day could be unhealthy.

Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, and despite decades of research, there is no cure, and treatments that can slow the disease are severely lacking.

For that reason, understanding the lifestyle factors associated with increased risk is essential. In this vein, many scientists are focusing on dietary influences.

Previous research has shown that choline is important for cognitive function. It has also identified a potential link between moderate choline intake and a reduced risk of dementia. As the authors of the latest study explain, eggs are the “top food source” of choline, so they are worth investigating. 

Choline has many important functions; for instance, it is a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, plays a pivotal role in cell membranes, and has neuroprotective powers. 

Also, as the authors explain, “choline modulates the expression of key genes related to memory, learning, and cognitive functions via epigenetic mechanisms.”

Although our body can synthesise choline, it cannot synthesize enough to meet all the body's needs, so some must be taken in with our diet. 

Aside from choline, eggs contain essential omega-3 fatty acids, which support brain health as we age. Worryingly, studies show that the majority of adults in the United States do not consume enough of these essential fatty acids.

These facts led the authors of the new study to investigate links between egg consumption and Alzheimer's risk.

The recent study included data from 1,024 older adults with an average age of 81.4. All participants lived in retirement communities and residential facilities in Illinois. 

They attended yearly checkups and completed food frequency questionnaires, and the researchers followed them for an average of 6.7 years. 

During this time, a little over one-quarter of them developed Alzheimer's disease.

After analysis, the scientists found that individuals who consumed at least one egg per week had a 47% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's during follow-up compared with those eating one egg per month or fewer.

In the second part of their study, they looked at the post-mortem brains of 578 participants. They found that those who ate one or more eggs each week were more likely to have less Alzheimer's-associated protein buildup.

Overall, the authors suggest that consuming at least one egg per week may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's. They explain that the choline and omega-3s in eggs might have a “synergistic” effect, whereby they join forces to protect brain health during aging.

Medical News Today spoke to Christopher U. Missling, PhD, president and CEO of Anavex Life Sciences, who was not involved in the study. Missling explained that:

“About 39–40% of the protective effect was explained by higher dietary choline intake. Egg yolks also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have known neuroprotective properties. The combination of choline and omega-3s may be particularly beneficial for brain health.”

The study authors also point to previous research demonstrating that people with Alzheimer's are more likely to be deficient in omega-3s and choline.

Overall, the scientists conclude that, “once replicated in other prospective cohorts and confirmed by clinical trials, these findings may have important public health implications for reducing the population's risk of [Alzheimer's].”

If the results are replicated, this could be a very useful, low-cost intervention. MNT also spokle with Maddie Gallivan, RD, a registered dietitian who was likewise not involved in the recent study.

“Eggs are often a go-to food for older adults, as they're soft in texture, which can be helpful for those with dentures, quick to prepare, and packed with key nutrients,” Gallivan explained. “So it's great to see a study focussing on how they may support cognitive health in later life.”

However, the study does have certain limitations. For instance, they only had a relatively short follow-up — just 6.7 years. This, as the authors explain, increases the risk of reverse causality. 

“The study population consisted of older adults from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a specific U.S.-based cohort,” Missling told MNT. “The findings may not generalize to younger populations or those from different cultural or dietary backgrounds.”

He also reminded us that “dietary intake was assessed through self-reported food frequency questionnaires, which are subject to recall bias and inaccuracies.” So, participants may not have accurately reported or remembered their egg consumption.

“It's important to remember that no single food acts in isolation,” Gallivan told us, “and it's our overall dietary pattern that really counts. A varied, nutrient-dense diet rich in whole foods is key to supporting brain health and reducing dementia risk.”

For now, if you like eggs, enjoy them. They may reduce your dementia risk, but if not, they will certainly provide you with a good dose of protein and a healthy range of micronutrients.

Chelsea are reportedly set to face a US tax bill of approximately £10million following their Club World Cup victory.

The Blues' impressive 3-0 triumph over Paris Saint-Germain in New York last weekend means Chelsea will receive £85m in prize money from competition organiser FIFA. Of this, £39.7m is due to be paid immediately and £45.3m at the conclusion of next season, but the US authorities will classify it as taxable income, reports CityAM.

Despite FIFA securing exemptions from US taxes for the 2026 World Cup, they were unable to do the same for the Club World Cup a year earlier. Consequently, all participating clubs are required to pay a variety of city, state and ticket-sales taxes, with Chelsea facing the largest bill. 

State tax levels vary considerably across the country, but in New Jersey, where Chelsea earned £55m by winning the semi-finals and final at the MetLife Stadium, the rate is among the highest. 

The tax on ticket sales also fluctuates between four and seven per cent across the United States.

However, in more positive news for Chelsea, The Telegraph report that their success in America has handed them a significant boost when it comes to securing a potential new shirt sponsor. 

It is claimed that there were long-term deals on the table which were worth about £40 million-per-year.

But that figure is said to have risen to £60m-a-year, with the club reportedly in talks with seven-to-ten big global companies over a long-term front-of-shirt sponsorship.

Chelsea will now be eyeing a first Premier League title since 2017 when the new season begins in August. Enzo Maresca's team will start their season at home to FA Cup winners Crystal Palace on August 17.

INDIANAPOLIS — Some friendly advice for WNBA leaders as they negotiate with the players on a new contract:

Don't make the same mistake U.S. Soccer did in 2019 by underestimating the players' resolve. It will not go well for you, either in the negotiations or the court of public opinion.

The players and the WNBA had their first face-to-face meeting in months Thursday during All-Star weekend. To say it was lacking in substance is an understatement. “Wasted opportunity,” “disrespectful" and "frustration" were words used by players to describe it.

It did serve one purpose, however. With 40 players showing up — veterans and rookies, megastars and role players, the largest gathering outside the Wubble — it sent an unmistakable message to the league about their commitment.

“I hope it expedites the process so we're not going back and forth where they're trying to test us and see who flinches first. Because we're not going to,” Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier, a WNBPA vice president as well as this season's favorite for MVP, said Friday.

“We are always going to stand firm. Hopefully they just realize that earlier, so that we're not wasting time over things that we're not moving on.”

The W, like U.S. Soccer, seems to think players should be grateful just to be playing. That the money the NBA and some of its owners pumped into the league entitles them to gouge the players in perpetuity.

Funny how this is never an issue with men's teams, even the ones that are perennial money losers.

The W didn't respond to the players Friday. But on Thursday night, league commissioner Cathy Engelbert told The Associated Press the talks are “a process.”

“We're both in listening mode,” Engelbert told the AP. “We're going back and forth on issues. We know what's important to players. We know what's important to owners and striking the right balance.”

Does the W really, though? Because it's been nine months since the players opted out of the existing contract and five months since the players sent the league ideas for salary increases and pay structure. To show up Thursday unprepared or unwilling to negotiate is not the move of a league that understands the urgency and gravity of the moment.

“It was pretty shocking to see,” New York Liberty forward Breanna Stewart, also a union vice president, said. “Not many things did we both agree on. I think there were two bullet points where we were like, `OK, we can move forward with this.'”

But this is what happens when women aren't taken seriously.

When the U.S. women's national team sued U.S. Soccer for equal pay in 2019, three months before the World Cup, the federation failed to appreciate how determined the players were. This despite the fact the players had taken the drastic step of suing their employer, and every single member of the team had signed onto the lawsuit.

The federation assumed, wrongly, that the women would eventually give in, preferring to get something rather than holding out for everything they deserved. They didn't realize how knowledgeable the players and their advisers were about the economics.

U.S. Soccer's biggest miscalculation, however, was not recognizing the public support for the players. When fans serenaded the USWNT with chants of “Equal pay! Equal pay!” after they won the World Cup in France, it was a resounding rebuke to U.S. Soccer and everyone else who short-changed women.

Sound familiar?

This is a time of explosive growth for the WNBA. A monster media rights deal that will pay the league $200 million a year, more than triple what it gets now, begins next year. Franchise valuations are soaring, with the expansion Golden State Valkyries recently valued at $500 million and five other teams worth $250 million or more, according to Sportico. Sponsors are clamoring for any piece of the action they can get.

None of this is a secret. Nor is it a secret that W players are woefully undercompensated. Player salaries top out at $250,000 and revenue “sharing” is around 10%, compared to the 50% that is typical of almost every professional men's league.

The players, rightfully, want more. They know they deserve more. And, like the USWNT in 2019, they're no longer willing to accept less.

“We're not just players that run up and down the court and do amazing things. Some of us are business owners, some of us are foundation owners. So we know what it takes,” said Las Vegas Aces center A'ja Wilson, who, coincidentally, was wearing the latest version of her signature shoe released for the All-Star Game.

“When we see the revenue, when we see things flowing into our league, we want that. We are going to demand that because we see it and we see the growth,” Wilson said. “And when you see a business growing, obviously the people that are working for the business should have some say in that as well. So I think we know what we are talking about for sure.”

The public knows, too. Aside from the Neanderthals who parrot that misleading narrative of the W being propped up by the NBA, fans are going to be on the side of Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers, Wilson and Collier rather than rich owners and league officials.

So, too, will the sponsors. And when that happens, the league might regret its choices.

“We as players know what we're worth. The fans know what we're worth,” said Nneka Ogwumike, the longtime union president. “Now we need the league to know what we're worth."

The WNBA and its players will eventually come to an agreement. The league has a choice: Be seen as an equal partner that wanted to do right by the players or as an overlord that had to be dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing.

It might want to ask U.S. Soccer which one is better.

Newcastle United boss Eddie Howe has admitted to growing frustration in the transfer market after the Magpies missed out on multiple key targets to Premier League rivals, including Bryan Mbeumo, Liam Delap, Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike. While Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool have all been very active, Newcastle's transfer activity remains stifled due to financial restrictions.

The recently concluded FIFA Club World Cup in the United States offered a troubling preview of what players and fans may face during the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host with Mexico and Canada. With global temperatures on the rise, scientists are warning that summer tournaments in the Northern Hemisphere are becoming increasingly dangerous for everyone involved.

Some experts now suggest that FIFA should consider shifting the football calendar to mitigate the risks of heat-related illnesses. “As we move further into the decade, the risks will continue to grow unless we take drastic measures, such as moving competitions to winter months or cooler regions,” said Professor Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures in Leeds. “We're potentially one heatwave away from a major sports tragedy.”

From the inaugural 1930 World Cup onward, June and July have traditionally been reserved for international tournaments. But summers have warmed dramatically—up by 1.89°F globally and 3.26°F in Europe since the 1990s—raising red flags for outdoor, high-intensity sports like soccer.

During the expanded Club World Cup, held in 11 U.S. cities from June 14 to July 13, extreme heat and thunderstorms disrupted matches. FIFA responded with updated extreme heat protocols, including extra water breaks, sideline fans, and shaded benches. Still, Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernández said he felt dizzy from the heat and urged FIFA to avoid afternoon kickoffs during the World Cup.

FIFPRO, the global players' union, has flagged six of the 16 World Cup host cities as “extremely high risk” for heat stress. FIFA President Gianni Infantino recently assured that covered stadiums would host daytime matches in 2026.

Looking ahead, the 2030 World Cup—co-hosted by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco—may face even greater heat challenges, with temperatures already surpassing 104°F this summer. FIFA's internal reports have downplayed the threat, but climate experts disagree.

Playing 90 minutes under direct sunlight can trigger hyperthermia, cardiovascular strain, heat exhaustion, or even life-threatening heatstroke. “Athletes are now 28% more exposed to moderate or higher heat risks than in the 1990s,” said Professor Ollie Jay from the University of Sydney.

While adjusting match times to cooler hours is common in marathons or tennis, morning games are rare in soccer due to broadcasting demands. But with 48 teams in 2026, avoiding midday matches may be impossible.

FIFA's decision to shift the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to November was a rare exception. A similar move is expected for Saudi Arabia in 2034. Still, rescheduling tournaments disrupts European club seasons, making such changes logistically complex.

“The danger goes beyond discomfort,” said climate scientist Michael Mann. “It reflects how climate change is fundamentally reshaping our way of life—even the world's most popular sport.”

Chelsea were given a little something extra to fight for ahead of their Club World Cup final triumph over Paris Saint-Germain, a new report has revealed.

The Blues outclassed the European champions last week to win 3-0 and become the first side to lift the Club World Cup in its revamped 32-team format.

Enzo Maresca's side were relentless from the first whistle in New Jersey, scoring all three before half-time and putting the game well out of reach; PSG looked a far cry from their usual selves which saw them win the treble last season.

And now, it can be revealed what triggered that added motivation in the Chelsea camp.

On the eve of the final, at a FIFA-organised dinner involving both clubs, Chelsea's delegation noticed how occupied PSG's representatives were with discussing the logistics of their trophy celebration.

The Parisians were preoccupied with how and where they would collect the trophy, according to The Times. 

Maresca was informed of this over-confidence and passed the information onto the players, who seemingly took it to heart. 

But tensions between the clubs did not stop at full-time, with a heated post-match clash between following the result.

PSG boss Luis Enrique appeared to strike Chelsea striker Joao Pedro in the face during a confrontation.

Pedro was initially embroiled in a conflict with Gianluigi Donnarumma and Achraf Hakimi - with Andrey Santos also on the scene - before Enrique marched over towards the situation.

But rather than defusing the situation, the Spanish manager made it physical, laying his hands on Pedro before being held back by his own player Presnel Kimpembe.

Pedro fell to the floor in dramatic fashion, clutching at his face. 

Christopher Nkunku and Romeo Lavia stepped in to defend their team-mate, holding back a visibly frustrated Gianluigi Donnarumma, who appeared to berate Pedro for his animated reaction.

What followed was pandemonium, with around five Chelsea players swarming Donnarumma in the aftermath.

The PSG goalkeeper was shoved by Tosin Adarabioyo, as Kimpembe continued his attempts to defuse tensions alongside Chelsea's Filip Jorgensen.

Pedro eventually got back to his feet, only to find himself at the centre of a chaotic melee involving too many bodies to count.

On the touchline, a furious Enzo Maresca stormed in to drag his players away, shouting at those involved as he tried to restore order.

The Chelsea boss was also seen pulling Donnarumma aside, attempting to calm his fellow Italian in a bid to defuse the flare-up.

The chaotic scenes followed a match that saw six yellow cards shared between the two sides, and a red card for PSG midfielder Joao Neves, who was sent off in the 85th minute for violent conduct. 

Speaking on the incident, Enrique said: 'This was completely avoidable at the end, my goal was always to separate footballers, there was a lot of tension and pressure, there was a whole bunch of pushing that we should all try to avoid. My intention is to avoid it getting worse.'

Chelsea were given a little something extra to fight for ahead of their Club World Cup final triumph over Paris Saint-Germain, a new report has revealed.

The Blues outclassed the European champions last week to win 3-0 and become the first side to lift the Club World Cup in its revamped 32-team format.

Enzo Maresca's side were relentless from the first whistle in New Jersey, scoring all three before half-time and putting the game well out of reach; PSG looked a far cry from their usual selves which saw them win the treble last season.

And now, it can be revealed what triggered that added motivation in the Chelsea camp.

On the eve of the final, at a FIFA-organised dinner involving both clubs, Chelsea's delegation noticed how occupied PSG's representatives were with discussing the logistics of their trophy celebration.

The Parisians were preoccupied with how and where they would collect the trophy, according to The Times.

Manchester United could hijack Arsenal's transfer deal for Sporting CP star Viktor Gyokeres as the Red Devils are closing on an agreement to meet the Portuguese club's €70 million (£60.6m/$81.4m) valuation. Gyokeres is determined to leave Sporting CP this summer as he wants a move to the Premier League and as a result, he did not even turn up for the club's pre-season preparations.

Prior to Chelsea's 3–0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final, a harmless FIFA dinner can be said to have primed the pump, according to emerging reports from The Times. On the eve of the game, Chelsea's delegation noticed that PSG officials were preoccupied with how and where they'd receive the trophy. That information was quickly passed on to head coach Enzo Maresca, who shared it with his team.

The message was loud and clear: PSG already believed they had won. Maresca converted their overconfidence into fuel for his players, and they came back with a scorching first half that left the French giants stunned.

Maresca explained afterward:

“I think we won the game in the first 10 minutes and the message before the game was to make them understand that we are here to win the game. I think the first 10 minutes the team was there. It probably set a little bit the tone of the game.”

Chelsea's press suffocated PSG's midfield, and the psychological boost gained overnight was reflected in the increased energy levels.

Cole Palmer hit twice, and a third by João Pedro before the break put the game to bed in quick time. PSG, with players who had just achieved the treble, couldn't recover from the early assault. Although they had technical excellence on paper, they were tactically and mentally outplayed.

After the game, Pedro said:

“PSG have won the Champions League, they have a great team, but we know our power as well. We have a great team as well, and we just needed to play the game, and in the end, we're happy to win.”

The win was Chelsea's second Club World Cup win and their second trophy win under Maresca. What reportedly began as an overheard chat at a dinner gala concluded as victory for the Blues, who are preparing for next season's Premier League campaign.

Chelsea's dominant Club World Cup victory this summer has led to an unexpected snowball effect, with several Premier League clubs, including Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United, having their previous titles effectively downgraded.

Enzo Maresca's side cruised to a convincing 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the final at the MetLife Stadium, with Cole Palmer scoring twice and Joao Pedro adding a chipped finish to cap off a historic performance.

The win makes Chelsea the first English club to have won every major domestic and international title available. This landmark includes the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Super Cup, Europa League, and now, the new-format FIFA Club World Cup.

But it's not just a milestone moment for Chelsea, it's also one that has triggered a significant reclassification of footballing honours.

Following the final, FIFA shared an image of Chelsea lifting the trophy with the caption: "The first ever FIFA CWC Champions." That phrasing sparked confusion, particularly among fans of clubs that had previously won the tournament.

According to The Mail, FIFA will now recognise Chelsea as the first official winners of the new-format Club World Cup. 

In turn, all previous winners, including Real Madrid, Barcelona, and English clubs like Liverpool, Man City and Man United, will have their victories rebranded as "Intercontinental Champions" rather than Club World Cup winners.

Real Madrid have won the tournament a record five times. Chelsea, meanwhile, now officially hold one Club World Cup 'title' despite having previously lifted the trophy in 2021. That earlier win, like the others, has now been reclassified.

The change stems from the restructuring of the competition. Traditionally held every year since 2005, the Club World Cup has now become a quadrennial event, modelled more closely on the FIFA World Cup.

The 2025 edition, held in the United States, was the first under this new format. It featured an expanded roster of top teams from every continent and offering a larger global platform.

And while Chelsea celebrate becoming inaugural champions in FIFA's eyes, their triumph has also rewritten the modern honours list.

Wimbledon 2025 was, of course, a showcase of some tennis greats, but when folks weren't watching the ball, all eyes were on the royal family. 

Princess Catherine, Prince William, and the two eldest members of their royal brood made a few surprise appearances in the stands last week. And while the adorable Princess Charlotte no doubt stole the show, I couldn't help but notice Prince George's striking body language as he took in the tournament.

The direct heir to the throne, who is turning 12 years old on July 22, seemed to truly step into the role while attending the tennis championship with his fam on July 13. In contrast to his younger siblings, Charlotte, 10, and Louis, 7, who are always quite expressive, George appeared stoic and serious throughout his appearance, taking on the posture of a future king. 

Confident and considerate, George stood tall, applauded at the right times and was even seen shaking hands with the players, including Gentleman's Singles champ Jannik Sinner (who gifted George and his sister signed tennis balls).

At one point during the matches, the camera captured him looking rather regal, almost as if he were surveying his kingdom (in this case, a tennis court).

His grown-up manner was underscored by the fact that he stayed close by his father, Prince William, during the majority of the tournament. Not only did the younger match the older in appearance—donning a similar blue suit and tie—he also mimicked dad's body language at a number of points, even borrowing Will's signature move of crossing his hands in front of his body while chatting.

Though the young royal is still a ways away from taking the throne (and, of course, still just a kiddo), his air at Wimbledon certainly indicates a new level of maturity, suggesting that he's preparing to take on new responsibilities in his next phase as a public-facing member of the monarchy—and the future King of England. 

Now the question on everyone's mind: Will he attend Eton like his father, or Marlborough like mom?

Returning after 16 months away, Venus Williams didn't map out her full plan in D.C., but made it clear this comeback is more than ceremonial.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Venus Williams met the press Sunday in Washington, where she'll play her first match in more than a year. At 45, with a résumé that needs no embellishment, she's still finding reasons to compete, even if she's not spelling them out. She said more than once she likes to keep things close to the vest, and true to form, she didn't give away much.

Which leads to these lingering questions:

Venus didn't over-explain her decision to come back. She'd been practicing, she loves hard courts, and D.C. just made sense. Her connection to the city is long-standing, but the return seemed more about timing than sentiment.

Williams: “Most of the time I don't [take up the offer to play as a wild card, laughing]. But this time I had been hitting the ball. And of course I love the game and the hard courts, it's my favorite surface, what I feel comfortable on. So all those different factors.”

Williams was direct: Yes, she has a plan. No, she's not sharing it. She is focused on this week, not spelling out what's next, but she made it clear her return wasn't a whim.

Williams: “I think I know what I want to do, but I don't always want to talk about it. I'm just here for now, and who knows? Maybe there's more. Like I said, I hold my cards close, but at the moment, I'm focused just on this.”

After a 16-month layoff and a serious health scare last year, her definition of success is less about results and more about mindset, self-belief and simply getting back on court.

Williams: “My personal goal is to have fun I think right now and enjoy the moment, not put too much pressure on myself. I don't know if I define success at this moment in any sort of way other than believing in myself and sticking to my process.

“That's not easy to do, especially after a layoff. So those are my goals.”

Yes. The way she talks about her game -- the way she identifies as a “big hitter” -- suggests the competitive fire hasn't gone anywhere. The goal this week? Keep the ball in the court, but do it her way.

Williams: “I definitely feel I'll play well. I'm still the same player. I'm a big hitter. I hit big. This is my brand [smiling].

“So it's about hitting big and actually putting it in. So this will be my effort: put it in the court. That's my main goal.”

She didn't use the word “retirement,” but she acknowledged just how serious her health issues were last year, including preparing for surgery and not even having tennis on her mind. It adds weight to how far she's come to get back.

Williams: “Yeah, my health journey was very scary. You know, this time a year ago I was preparing to go to surgery. There was no way for me to play tennis or play the US Open. … I was just trying to get healthy.”

Williams didn't dwell on emotions or nostalgia, but she did reflect on the rush of Wimbledon, even as a visitor, and how much she still loves the battle.

Williams: “I think just the pure fun of playing the game, the fun of the challenge, overcoming -- when you play, you overcome so many challenges: your opponents, the conditions, a lot of times you have to overcome yourself. Those things are very exciting.”

She didn't reference legacy, but she did touch on her platform, especially when it comes to women's sports, and her sense of duty to represent, promote and show up.

Williams: “I always felt a big responsibility towards promoting tennis and also promoting women's sports. … I'm in love with tennis, so to have an opportunity to have this platform to promote the game even now is a great opportunity.”

Returning after 16 months away, Venus Williams didn't map out her full plan in D.C., but made it clear this comeback is more than ceremonial.

The former world No. 1 teased whether sister Serena may join her back on court.ByDavid KanePublished Jul 20, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 20, 2025

WASHINGTON, DC—One of the first questions to open Venus Williams' Mubadala Citi DC Open press conference boiled down to a single word: Why?Why, at 45 years old, was a former world No. 1 and seven-time Grand Slam champion mounting a comeback after almost a year and a half away from the game?“Why not?” Williams replied with a smile.The DC Open is as much a home tournament as any for Williams, who regularly competed in the nation's capital for World TeamTennis, leading the Washington Kastles to five of their six titles. Kastles owner Mark Ein has since become the Citi Open's tournament director, and Williams joked about the many years he's offered her a wild card to his WTA 500 event.“This time I had been hitting the ball,” said Williams, who last took the court for an official match at the 2024 Miami Open. “And of course I love the game, and the hard courts, it's my favorite surface, what I feel comfortable on. So, all those different factors.”

I loved the game so much, I didn't realize that it would be so much bigger than myself. And seeing these young women doing positive things with their life, winning tournaments, inspiring the next generation, too, it's like I could have never imagined that. So, it's like icing on the cake, cherries on top with the nuts and all the fixings. It's beautiful. Venus Williams

Williams is entered into both singles and doubles draws, set to face fellow American Peyton Stearns in the former and partnering DMV native Hailey Baptiste in the latter. Both Stearns and Baptiste were born in 2001, and have therefore never lived in a world where Venus Williams—who turned pro in 1994—was not playing professional tennis.“As a young person, I wanted to play the game, be a champion,” explained Williams, who is often loath to wax poetic about her legacy. “I loved the game so much, I didn't realize that it would be so much bigger than myself.“And seeing these young women doing positive things with their life, winning tournaments, inspiring the next generation, too, it's like I could have never imagined that.

After 17 months away from action, Williams has been circling the tennis world this summer, first as an analyst during this year's Roland Garros, and as a spectator at Wimbledon. Giving her first press conference in almost two years, the 2000 Olympic champion, who conceded to often “keeping her cards close” with maddeningly succinct quotes, admitted a newfound respect for the media after her own turn behind the mic.“I think it could be very easy to say the wrong thing, is what I realized when I was live on the air,” she said with a laugh. “I was, like, ‘Just be careful. Don't say the wrong thing. Don't be too opinionated,' because I have a lot of opinions, and many of them possibly unfounded.“So, I'm glad I got out of it without being canceled!”

“I think it could be very easy to say the wrong thing, is what I realized when I was live on the air,” she said with a laugh. “I was, like, ‘Just be careful. Don't say the wrong thing. Don't be too opinionated,' because I have a lot of opinions, and many of them possibly unfounded.“So, I'm glad I got out of it without being canceled!”

“So, I'm glad I got out of it without being canceled!”

Just as Williams was gearing up for her comeback, younger sister Serena, who retired (or evolved away) from the sport in 2022, turned heads with a practice video of her own. Though she remains on the International Tennis Federation's list of officially retired players, it makes it that much easier for fans to dream both Williams sisters back on the court in the near future.“She can take six months off and she clocks it clean,” Williams said of her younger sister, a 23-time Grand Slam champion and fellow Olympic gold medalist. “You can't teach that kind of talent. She's just so good. I don't know what she's going to do. I don't ask those questions. I think we always hit the ball, because that's who we are, we're always hitting.“Quite frankly, it's great cardio,” she jokingly added. “You get great legs and great arms from tennis, quiet as it's kept. So obviously that's part of her goal too is to stay in shape. I mean, I keep saying to my team, ‘The only thing that would make this better is if she was here,' like we always did everything together, so of course I miss her. But if she comes back, I'm sure she'll let y'all know.”

In the Mubadala Citi DC Open singles draw as a wild card, Williams will play her first match in almost a year and a half this week against fellow American Peyton Stearns.

Williams ended her press conference with a salute to her team, the people who supported her through her time away off the court and those who have helped shepherd her back to the stadiums on which she's played for over three decades.“You know, I believe in love and those around me, so my family, my friends. They keep me going and keep me grounded,” said Williams.“Those are the people that are there for you when the things are lowest. They're there for you also when the things are highest, because also it's hard too when you're high and trying to maintain that and trying to deal with what's happening when you're high and low.“So, the love always gets you through.”

Jack Draper has suffered an arm injury which will put him out of action for at least a month ahead of the US Open at the end of August.

Draper will miss the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Open, both live on Sky Sports Tennis, over the next three weeks, two events he planned to enter.

The British No 1 has not played since losing in the second round of Wimbledon earlier this month to Marin Cilic.

"After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season," he said.

"Unfortunately, I won't be able to compete in Toronto and Cincinnati.

Draper has dropped from fourth to fifth in the ATP rankings and could drop further before the final Grand Slam of the year in New York, live on Sky Sports, if players behind him perform well during the North American swing.

Alexander Bublik has secured his sixth ATP title after defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo in the Swiss Open final. 

Bublik beat Cerundolo in three sets, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 to hoist the trophy in Gstaad, claiming his second tour-level crown of the season. 

The Kazakh has been on a roll recently, winning 19 of his last 22 matches, and will now return to the world's top 30. 

With his triumph, Bublik has achieved something in tennis that only Roger Federer has managed before. 

Bublik has clinched two titles in less than a month, following his victory over Daniil Medvedev in the Halle Open final.

He is now the second player in the Open Era to win the Halle Open and the Swiss Open in the same season, following Federer in 2004. 

Federer's summer of 2004:

The feat comes during a hot run of form for the 28-year-old, who has come on leaps and bounds in recent months. 

After the Halle Open final, he spoke candidly about his struggles on and off the court and revealed he was close to quitting the sport after last year's Wimbledon championships.

Now, however, Bublik is producing some of the best tennis of his career and will look to carry forward his momentum into the hard-court swing. 

Bublik has now won an ATP title on hard-court, grass, and clay, becoming the 14th active player to do so.

Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and Jannik Sinner are among the names he joins, as well as veterans such as Grigor Dimitrov and Marin Cilic.

He has won three hard-court titles, having emerged victorious twice in Montpellier, and once in Antwerp. 

The two grass-court titles he has to his name both came in Halle, the first of which Bublik won in 2023.

A pair of tennis superstars won't suit up in Toronto after all.

Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner and 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic each withdrew from the National Bank Open presented by Rogers on Sunday.

Both players cited recovery following long runs at the All England Club earlier this month.

The 23-year-old Sinner won the National Bank Open in 2023. He injured his right elbow in the fourth round at Wimbledon.

“I'm really disappointed to be missing the National Bank Open in Toronto, especially as I have such fond memories of playing in Canada. Winning that title in Toronto two years ago was the start of a really special moment for me, but after speaking with my team, I have to recover,” Sinner said in a release.

Djokovic, 38, has won the Canada tournament four times in his career.

He reached the semifinals at Wimbledon before falling to Sinner in straight sets.

Meanwhile, world No. 5 Jack Draper and No. 38 Jordan Thompson also withdrew from the hard-court tournament, which runs from July 26 to Aug. 7.

This year's edition of the National Bank Open features an expanded 12-day, 96-player format.

The women's event runs concurrently with the men's in Montreal.

Loïs Boisson, recent Roland-Garros semi-finalist, defeated Anna Bondar in the final, (7-5, 6-3).

If you thought Loïs Boisson's early exit in the first round of Wimbledon qualifying was a harsh return to reality – think again. The Frenchwoman bounced back in style by winning the WTA 250 Hamburg tournament on Sunday. It was only her second appearance in a main draw at Tour level, the first being her stunning semi-final run at Roland-Garros just six weeks ago.

Boisson's meteoric rise in women's tennis is showing no signs of slowing down. To date, Coco Gauff remains the only player who has managed to neutralise her explosive forehand and fierce competitiveness. Aged 22, she will be in the Top 50 at the WTA rankings on Monday. She was No. 361 two months ago.

Seeded No. 5 in Hamburg, Boisson overcame No. 7 seed Anna Bondar of Hungary in a tense clay-court battle. After trailing 0-4 in the opening set, she found a way to shift the match's momentum in her favor, ultimately securing a 7-5, 6-3 victory in 111 minutes.

Down 5-2, the Frenchwoman raised her level, clawing back to 5-all with the help of some beautifully executed drop shots. She kept the momentum going and snatched the first set 7-5, though she appeared to be struggling physically. She has been playing in recent days with an apparent injury to her left thigh.

At the start of the second set, Loïs Boisson fell back into the same difficulties that had troubled her early in the match. Quickly trailing 3-1, she once again leveled the score before overtaking Anna Bondar on the scoreboard at 5-3. All that remained was to close out the match, which the Frenchwoman did calmly, converting her first match point.

The difference came down to break point conversion. Anna Bondar finished the match having converted just 4 of 13 break points (31%), while Loïs Boisson was far more efficient, converting 6 of 9 opportunities (67%).

After a hard-fought win (6-4, 6-7 [3], 6-4) in nearly three hours of play against Germany's Tamara Korpatsch (ranked 163rd) on Thursday, Loïs Boisson followed up with convincing victories over Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova (No. 105, 6-3, 6-3) and Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska (No. 39, 6-1, 7-6 [5]).

She's the first French player to win a WTA trophy on the main stage since Caroline Garcia in 2022. “Reaching this level so quickly is very impressive”, Bondar said on court, before breaking into tears. “It was not the trophy I was dreaming of.” Bondar had defeated the Top seed Ekatarina Alexandrova in the quarterfinals (6-7 [1], 6-3, 7-6 [4]).

Jack Draper will be looking to go one step further at the US Open this year, after enjoying his best Grand Slam campaign at Flushing Meadows in 2024. 

Draper advanced to the semi-finals last year without dropping a set throughout the tournament, before ultimately bowing out to eventual champion Jannik Sinner. 

The Briton will be even more determined to bounce back in New York following his disappointing Wimbledon run, which ended abruptly in the second round.

However, he'll now have to enter the US Open without featuring at a hard-court tune-up event, after he revealed an injury update on social media. 

Draper took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to say: “After Wimbledon, I picked up an injury in my left arm.

“Nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, I won't be able to compete in Toronto and Cincinnati. See you in NYC!”

After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, I won't be able to compete in Toronto and Cincinnati…. See you in NYC !

His run at the All England Club was short-lived, when after beating Sebastian Baez in the first round, he was knocked out by former finalist Marin Cilic in five sets.

It was yet another shocking result at the championships, which saw several seeded players bow out in the early rounds. 

Draper entered the US Open as the 25th seed last season and got off to the perfect start with comfortable wins over Zhang Zhizhen and Facundo Diaz Acosta. 

After beating Botic van de Zandschulp and Tomas Machac in rounds three and four, he came up against his first seeded opponent at the event. 

He played 10th seed Alex de Minaur in the quarter-final, whom Draper defeated 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 to advance to a maiden Grand Slam semi-final. 

In the final four, a red-hot sinner proved too much for the then-22-year-old, who lost in straight sets to the Italian.

Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic have been forced to withdraw from the upcoming National Bank Open in Canada. Both players were due to feature at the event, which was scheduled to have been their first tournament after Wimbledon. However, neither man will be involved when the competition gets underway next week.

The news was confirmed by National Bank Open organisers, who issued a brief statement on Sunday afternoon. They said: "Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic have been forced to withdraw from the 2025 National Bank Open in Toronto as they recover following Wimbledon. Jack Draper has also withdrawn due to injury."

Sinner recently secured his maiden Wimbledon triumph, beating Carlos Alcaraz in the final. Djokovic, meanwhile, made it to the semi-finals where he was comfortably dispatched by the young Italian.

In a release shortly after the official announcement, Sinner opened up on his decision to skip the National Bank Open. He won the tournament in 2023, beating Alex de Minaur in straight sets to claim the honours for the first time.

"I'm really disappointed to be missing the National Bank Open in Toronto, especially as I have such fond memories of playing in Canada," he said.



"Winning that title in Toronto two years ago was the start of a really special moment for me, but after speaking with my team, I have to recover."

Draper's withdrawal from the National Bank Open came as a surprise, with the 23-year-old explaining that he is nursing a minor injury. He is expected to return to action at the US Open, which will begin in the second half of August.

On X (formerly Twitter), Draper wrote: "After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, I won't be able to compete in Toronto and Cincinnati…. See you in NYC."

Alcaraz will be the favourite to claim the spoils in Toronto with former champion Alexander Zverev also topping the bill. They will be joined by the likes of Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti, Holger Rune, Denis Shapovalov and Felix Auger-Aliassime.

This year's edition of the National Bank Open features an expanded 12-day format with 96 players competing in the main draw. There is also a women's event, which runs concurrently with the men's tournament.

Several big-name players will not be involved, though, with Ons Jabeur, Paula Badosa and Aryna Sabalenkahaving already withdrawn from the competition.

Alexander Bublik's stellar 2025 campaign has continued after defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo to win the Gstaad Open.

The Kazakh star has stunned many with his form in 2025, reaching the quarter-finals of the French Open before beating Jannik Sinner and Daniil Medvedev on his way to a second Halle Open title.

Bublik's progress was halted briefly at Wimbledon. The Kazakh player came into the tournament as a potential dark horse for the title. However, he lost in the first round to Jaume Munar.

Despite this setback, Bublik has endeavoured to bounce back at the Gstaad Open in Switzerland. On Sunday, he defeated Juan Manuel Cerundolo to win his sixth ATP Tour title.

During the acceptance speech, Bublik was complimentary of his opponent, claiming the final was one of the toughest he had played.

Bublik said: “First of all, Juan, I told you at the net this was not tennis, it was complete ‘torturing.'

“This is my sixth title and I have played the greats of the game but this final I will remember as one of the toughest I ever played so good job to you, congrats to your team, that's really, really good.”

Bublik was made to fight for his victory in Gstaad. Cerundolo, ranked 109 in the world, performed admirably across the week, beating both David Goffin and Casper Ruud on his way to the final.

The Argentinian player made 73 per cent of his first serves, while also limiting Bublik to winning only 39 per cent of his second serve points.

However, Bublik's 13 aces helped carry him to victory against Cerundolo, winning 6-4 4-6 6-3.

The 28-year-old has returned to the top 30 on the ATP Tour with victory in Gstaad.

The Kazakh had dropped outside the top 30 following his shock loss to Jaume Munar in the Wimbledon first round.

However, his triumph in Switzerland has seen him move above Alex Michelsen, Sebastian Korda, Brandon Nakashima and Tallon Griekspoor. The achievement marked his first ever tour-level title on clay.

Now ranked 30 in the world, Bublik will be aiming to capture a seeded position at August's US Open.

Jack Draper's announced partnership in the U.S. Open's new-look mixed doubles event with Qinwen Zheng was one of the most unusual but now it appears it won't happen.

Zheng, the 2024 Olympic gold medalist at the Paris Games, said on social media on Saturday, July 19 that she had undergone successful surgery on her right elbow.

“During recent training sessions and competitions, I have been consistently bothered by pain in my right elbow,” Zheng wrote in a post on her Chinese social media account, according to Xinhua news service. “Although I persisted through interventions, the impact of the pain persisted. After diagnosis by elbow specialists, they recommended that complete minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery on the right elbow be performed as soon as possible to thoroughly resolve the issue.”

Recovery time for arthroscopic surgery is likely several months, but with the U.S. Open six weeks away – and the U.S. Open mixed doubles competition just five weeks away – it appears unlikely that Zheng will be able to compete.

Zheng also stated: “In the coming period, I will focus my efforts on rehabilitation training, striving to return to the court at 100 percent as soon as possible. This brief adjustment is for a stronger comeback in the future. Thanks, everyone, for your support and patience. Please wait for me to return to full strength, we will meet on the court.”

The U.S. Tennis Association announced in February that it will be re-imagining its mixed doubles competition, giving singles players priority in entry and hosting the event in the week before the main draw of singles and doubles starts – it's branded “Fan Week” as you can read about here: US Open To Host Mixed Doubles Championship During Its Lead-Up “Fan Week” Starting In 2025 – Tennis Grandstand

Zheng and Draper, the 2025 Indian Wells singles champion and a semifinalist at the 2024 U.S. Open, were among the interesting U.S. Open pairings announced by the USTA and can be read about here: https://worldtennismagazine.com/carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-novak-djokovic-aryna-sabalenka-iga-swiatek-madison-keys-among-early-u-s-open-mixed-doubles-entries/25150

Earlier this year, Zheng reached a career-high No. 4 in the WTA singles rankings. She was the runner-up at the Australian Open in 2024 and was also the runner-up at the season-ending WTA Tour Finals. Earlier this year, Zheng failed to replicate her success in the Australian Open and lost in the second round. She reached the semifinals of the Italian Open.

I really hope the US Open will ask Hsieh Su-Wei to take her place to play w/Draper as opposed to some popular non-doubles player. Hsieh consistently goes deep in mixed and ladies pro tournaments and has 35 doubles titles. Won the Australian mixed in 2024. The fact that Osaka even got in is a crime.

Wimbledon continues to be a big topic of conversation even a week after the event has concluded for another year.

Jannik Sinner won the men's singles title at Wimbledon for the first time this year, after beating his rival Carlos Alcaraz in a four set final.

The women's singles final was certainly less competitive, with Iga Swiatek brushing Amanda Anisimova aside to win her sixth Grand Slam title.

Like any tennis tournament, Wimbledon is not averse to criticism and they have now been called out by two players who were in qualifying this year.

All four of the Grand Slam tournaments have a qualifying draw, consisting of 128 players in both men's and women's singles.

These 128 players compete over three rounds, before being whittled down to 16 players from each draw who will all be granted a spot in the main draw.

The Australian Open, Roland Garros and the US Open all host their qualifying on the same site, but Wimbledon does not and instead holds it 3.7 miles away in Roehampton.

One of the players competing in Wimbledon qualifying this year was former world number 20 Daria Saville, who actually lost in the first round.

Her namesake and new Australian compatriot Daria Kasatkina spoke to Saville about what she thought of playing at Wimbledon qualifying this year for her YouTube channel.

Discussing a number of different topics, Saville called out the food, quality of the grass courts and the reason Wimbledon changed the prize money.

Saville: “I haven't eaten because it sucks here.”

Kasatkina: “Like sucks? We are comparing the main site to the qualies, what you can tell us about this?”

Saville: “…It's fine…To be fair I don't have appetite so…Main draw food, I mean it's still good food, but the worst out of all Slams.”

Kasatkina: “Worse than Paris?”

Saville: “Actually I think so. In Paris, well there's no sushi. The sushi in Paris is better.”

Kasatkina followed up with a question about the grass, “How are the courts here?”

Saville responded, “Hmm, I mean it's…the grass was high. I mean it's windy, it's slow, high.”

Wimbledon increased the combined singles prize pot for the main draw and qualifying this year by over 9%, but the most significant increase from this went to champions Sinner and Swiatek, who took home £3million each.

This is something that Saville appeared particularly passionate about, claiming that all players would want more of the increase in prize money to go to players in the first round.

“Did you know the prize money they increased by 7% or whatever, but it really is only five because they increase the winners prize money,” said Saville. “So only winner gets 7% increase. Because it's more about headlines, ‘Oh now our champion makes more prize money than every other Grand Slam winner'.

“Every tennis player would agree that you get more prize money in the lower rounds, every tennis player would sign up for it. I mean no-one is guaranteed to win it.”

Saville is not the only player who was frustrated by the way that players were treated in Wimbledon qualifying, with another Australian Arina Rodionova also criticising the event.

Rodionova, who was knocked out in the second round of qualifying, was also critical of the courts, and she also called out the general facilities and lack of equipment.

Rodionova said, “The grass is so slow here, everyone is like breaking each other oh my god.”

Kasatkina added: “It doesn't look bad, I mean the whole facilities looks pretty good actually.”

Rodionova: “The problem is that if you want to go to the WTA office it's about 10 minutes that way. Physio is like 500 metres, so you go that way there to the right and to the right (pointing). Gym, I don't know, I haven't seen but from what I heard it's there…Yeah, but it's so far like if you want to go grab ice also like that way. It's just like…”

Kasatkina: “Not convenient.”

Rodionova: “No, locker rooms also like that way kind of like the gym area…Food is the same. So there's been no changes for the past 15 years. So they like the traditions and consistency at Wimbledon, so they still use the same chickens I think from the same family for the past 15 years (laughs).”

Rodionova continued, “Also there's no f—— air conditioning anywhere. It's so, like on Saturday it was like 30 degrees (Celsius). I thought we're all going to die here, because you don't have a place where you can actually sit. Like locker rooms, oh my god. 

“But actually this place is pretty bad. And they run out of everything. They're like, ‘Oh we're like out of balls'. I'm like, ‘I'm sorry. Well you do know there's a Grand Slam going on right? I need to practice'. They're like water bottles, they're like, ‘Oh come back, we're waiting for a shipment it's not there yet'. I'm like, ‘Did you not know that you have a tournament going on?'.”

Kasatkina: “Are you allowed on the main site?”

Rodionova: “I feel like I'm not even allowed in half of the places here.”

The one thing that Rodionova did feel was an improvement was the electronic line calling, which was a big issue at Wimbledon this year.

Wimbledon still remains as the only major tournament not to have qualifying on site, with that begging the question as to why that is the case.

Grass being a live surface means that the courts need to be protected, and an extra week of tennis would be too damaging to the current courts at SW19.

However, Wimbledon are currently in the process of trying to expand and have revealed their hopes to have qualifying on the main site in the early 2030s.

Wimbledon's plans have been strongly contested, and it appears to be a long way off for players like Saville and Rodionova to get the changes they want.

38-year-old Novak Djokovic's career appears to be winding down after yet another semifinal exit at Wimbledon, marking a seventh consecutive Grand Slam where the Serbian great has failed to capture the title. 

After his three-set loss to Jannik Sinner, he emphatically explained that he's "not planning to finish my Wimbledon career today," hinting that he has at least four more Grand Slams in him. 

Legendary Australian player Rennae Stubbs doesn't think that's the case. Stubbs, a four-time Grand Slam doubles champion and former coach of Serena Williams, thinks Djokovic will retire sooner.

Speaking on the ‘Rennae Stubbs Tennis Podcast,' Stubbs — who is very tapped in with the Australian tennis circuit — thinks the 2026 Australian Open will be his final tournament.

“I think he has sort of hinted that the last Grand Slam will be the Australian Open,” she said. "....And I think the reason for that is because it has been his most successful, winning it [10] times."



"I thought his best chance was at Wimbledon, that has slipped away, but I think he probably almost feels that the Australian has been so mercurial in his life, he has had so many dramatic moments in his life, where he was treated very poorly by the Australian government," Stubbs continued, referencing when Djokovic was kicked out of the country during the 2022 tournament

“So it's an interesting dichotomy, but I think that is where he wants to finish his career, and that is where I think probably will be his last Grand Slam.”

Djokovic boasts the most career Australian Open wins with 10. It's the site where he won his first major title in 2008, when a then-gangly 20-year-old looked more like an outsider than a future member of tennis's coveted "big three."

Murray shares part of Djokovic coaching gig that left him 'uncomfortable'

He's fallen in the semifinals in each of the last two Australian Opens. In 2025, he was forced to retire against Alexander Zvarev in the second set. 

"I did everything I possibly could to basically manage the muscle tear that I had," Djokovic said post-match. "Medications and, I guess, the strap, and the physio work helped to some extent today. But towards the end of that first set I just started feeling more and more pain. It was too much, I guess, to handle for me at the moment."

The tropical area at the tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula is best known for its beaches, resorts and sport fishing.

Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., reeled in a big catch of his own Saturday with a victory in the men's singles final of the Mifel Tennis Open in one hour 11 minutes.

Shapovalov defeated seventh-seeded American Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-4, 6-2 to win the ATP 250 event at the Cabo Sports Complex. The first set took only 35 minutes to complete.

Shapovalov led most categories in the final. He had six aces, won 20 points while receiving, won three games in a row, and won nine service games. He had one less unforced error (23-22) than his opponent.

“We have been working for quite a few years now and it hasn't been easy coming back from injury," Shapovalov said in a Tennis Canada release. "But all the work we've done, it is really paying off."



Kovacevic had two aces, two double faults, and won six service games.

The 26-year-old Shapovalov won the Dallas Open in February, and now has four career ATP titles. He advanced to Saturday's championship match with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Australian Adam Walton in the semifinals.

All three of Shapovalov's previous career ATP Tour titles have came on indoor hard-courts. This was his first event of the summer hard-court season after capping a rough grass-court campaign with a first-round loss at Wimbledon.

Kovacevic upset the top-seeded Andrey Rublev of Russia 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 in the other semifinal.

Shapovalov will be one of the featured Canadians at the 2025 National Bank Open in Toronto, which gets underway on Saturday, July 26.

Venus Williams is set to make a jaw-dropping comeback on the WTA Tour, after accepting a wild card to play in the Washington Open.

Venus, a seven-time Grand Slam champion, is now aged 45 years old and is set to face compatriot Peyton Stearns in the first round.

The American, alongside her sister Serena, has lived a storied career, emerging from Compton, California to become one of the biggest names in tennis history.

In the summer of 2000, Venus claimed her first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, a place she would go on to win a further four times in the Ladies Singles competition.

After defeating her 18-year-old sister in the semi-final, Venus beat Lindsay Davenport 6-3 7-6 to claim her first Wimbledon crown. By doing so, Venus and Serena became the first sisters in the Open era to win Grand Slam titles, after Serena's US Open triumph in 1999.

Following her maiden victory at SW19, Venus spoke of ending a ‘nightmare.'

Venus' path to the final was not easy. Seeded fifth at the tournament, the American battled past top seed Martina Hingis in a three-set phenomenon during the quarter-finals, before defeating her sister in the semi-finals.

Venus also dethroned the reigning Wimbledon champion. Number two seed Lindsay Davenport won the Wimbledon Ladies Singles title in 1999.

Speaking on-court after the final, Venus said: “Yes it's really great because I've been working so hard all my life to be here.

“And you know it's strange because like I'll go to bed at night and I'll dream and I'll dream that I've won a Grand Slam.

“When I wake up, it's a nightmare! So now that I've done it I don't have to wake up like that anymore.”

Then 20 years old, the American captured two Grand Slams at the same tournament, winning a title with her sister, Serena Williams.

Serena and Venus defeated Julie Halard-Decugis and Ai Sugiyama in the final 6-3 6-2 to win the Ladies' Doubles tennis title at the 2000 Wimbledon Championships.

Venus Williams' last WTA Tour match was around 16 months ago.

Venus last played a WTA Tour match at the 2024 Miami Open, where she lost to Diana Shnaider 3-6 3-6 in the first round.

Venus' last tour-level victory came at the Cincinnati Open in 2023, where she beat 16th seed Veronika Kudermetova 6-4 7-5.

However, the seven-time Grand Slam champion could not defeat future Olympic champion Qinwen Zheng, going down 6-1 2-6 1-6.

The debate over Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek's positive doping tests continues to be a huge talking point in tennis, with comments from former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash on the subject sparking a big reaction on social media.

Sinner and Swiatek both posted positive doping tests last year, with both only handed moderate suspensions in what were viewed as controversial verdicts.

Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension at the back end of 2024 after successfully proving that a product she was using to help her sleep was contaminated, while Sinner's case was a little more complex and continues to be a point of conjecture for many.

The world No 1 claimed he had been contaminated after a member of his team applied a spray to treat a cut on his finger that contained an anabolic steroid.

Sinner's legal team argued contaminated when the team member gave him a massage, with a one-year suspension looking likely until he agreed a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to serve a three-month ban.

The timing of that suspension ensured he didn't miss any Grand Slam events and after missing match points against Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final last month, Sinner then won his first Wimbledon title with a win against Alcaraz.

Some high-profile ex-players and journalists were quick to suggest the triumphs for Sinner and Swiatek were a bad look for tennis, but former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash gave some pointed advice to the critics of the duo with a passionate Instagram post.

“Well done Jannik,” said Cash, in a post on his Instagram account.

“I'm happy for him and his team. I know his coach Darren Cahill very well, he is a good mate of mine.

“I have followed what has been going on over the last six months or so, especially around the drug bans.

“I've heard a lot of stuff pop up on social media about the ‘drug cheats' winning Wimbledon, but it's a little sad that this is still going on.

 

 

A post shared by Pat Cash (@thepatcash)



“Before you spout out some rubbish, I think people need to do a bit of homework. Even ten minutes of homework. Just check out what other champions are saying and know about the drug testing.

“Swiatek and Sinner were contaminated. It was not performance-enhancing. If you think WADA and the International Tennis Integrity Unit don't do their homework and check this out, then you are absolutely insane.

“So please stop this. It's misinformation. They are not drug cheats. They are the best players in the world for a reason.

“They are great players, they are determined and focused. Their mental capacity is incredible when you think of what Sinner has been through. I'm very happy for them and let's acknowledge and accept their greatness rather than taint them because your favourite player didn't win.”

Those comments proved to be a cue for critics of Sinner and Swiatek to voice their annoyance at Cash's views, with Tennis365's X post referencing his comments gaining huge interactions, with many of the comments negative.

This is a story that will continue to run and run, with the wins for Sinner and Swiatek coming at a time when many observers have suggested they could have been serving suspensions following their positive doping tests.

After a long and detailed examination of the circumstances surrounding their positive doping tests by the International Tennis Integrity Agency and the World Anti-Doping Agency, plenty of tennis fans have decided the time has come to move on from the debate.

Yet fans of players like Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka may not be keen to ensure these stories are never forgotten.

At Wimbledon's post-tournament party, ‘The Champions' Dinner', Iga Swiatek, the winner of women's title, bedazzled in a lilac Stella McCartney gown that was reportedly worth over $2000. Who dresses the Wimbledon champions? 

Town And Country magazine reports that the styling is done by Elisabeth Piner, the stylist and owner of ‘Having a ball dress hire', a company that rents out dresses for formal affairs. She sets up a full-service salon inside centre court in an empty space across the hall from the ladies' locker room. 

“We've got everything, we kit them out from top to toe,” Piner told Town And Country. She and her team reached the club at 8 am on the morning of the ball, “with a car full of hundreds of dresses in multiple sizes; 50 to 60 pairs of shoes; jewellery including diamonds and colored stones; and an assortment of handbags”, the magazine reported. The Champions' Dinner is held at the lavish Raffles London. 

“Because we don't know who will win the tournament we choose styles that perhaps can be flexible, perhaps they have a lace up back or are more or less an average size,” she says. “The jewellery is easier because it's one size. We try to choose items that are just glamorous and ready to compliment the dresses … Most of the footwear and accessories are carefully selected for comfort, elegance, and reliability under pressure,” she said. “The jewellery ranges from contemporary pieces to vintage-inspired.” The magazine noted that she ‘ also tries to guess which players are most likely to make it to the finals and gather looks that might suit their individual styles'.
 
“The room is totally transformed into a glamorous, lovely boutique with all these wonderful dresses,” Piner said. “It's a tennis locker room with rails of silk and sparkle.”

Wimbledon doesn't offer this kind of service to the men's winners, letting their individual sponsor attire them. Sinner had worn a custom dark Gucci suit, with signature loafers. 

Sinner and Iga would dance, though it wasn't initially part of the plan. “Yes I mean we were there and, in the beginning, they told us that because it was quite late that we don't have to do it and then Iga told me, no, no, let's do it and I was like OK,” said Sinner. “Its a tradition. So it's good to make that happen. And yea it was nice to share that moment with Iga. And it's yeah, a beautiful moment,” Sinner shared later with BBC Sport. 

On the ‘Nothing Major' podcast, the American tennis player Sam Querrey shared more details from the night. 

“It's in the city. At that hour, there is no traffic, so it's like 25 minutes. They have a cocktail party, and then you go down to the dinner, where it's set up beautifully. Laura Robson hosted, and she went up and gave a speech. You have some appetisers, and then Iga showed up at 10:30 pm.

“She came in, and you stand up. They made this cool video up on the Jumbotron. She holds up her trophy, and then you sit down.“Sinner came at 00:05. I did not care, but he was just in the back hammering drinks with his team, having a good time. He came out with the trophy, and at some point, Laura Robson brought them both on stage. She does a Q&A with Iga and Jannik pretty quickly. And there was a rumour they were not going to have to dance, and the crowd peer pressured them into dancing.“It was good, though. Jannik did a good job; he was feeling good and made it really fun. He started twirling Iga, and then 45 seconds in, they were done dancing and went back to the table … You had unbelievable food, wine,” Querrey shared.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have emerged as the heirs to the tennis throne as the Big 3 era fades, with only Novak Djokovic still clinging to his legacy. From Alcaraz's breathtaking comeback in Paris to Sinner's grass-court mastery at Wimbledon, these two are shaping the sport's future. But does Sinner's recent triumph truly tip the scales in his favor? Not quite. Despite the Italian's rise to No.1, ATP star Tallon Griekspoor has now delivered a harsh dose of truth, highlighting Alcaraz's edge. Curious much?

In the latest episode of The Changeover podcast, recorded in the afterglow of Wimbledon's final night, ATP pro Tallon Griekspoor joined hosts Justin Roberts and Jody Maginley to dissect the burning question fans can't stop debating: Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner: who's the true king of this next-gen era? 

Griekspoor, who holds a 0-6 record against Sinner and 0-5 against Alcaraz, didn't hesitate to dive deep into the technical trenches of both rivals' games.

“Well, for me personally, I've always had more chances against Sinner than I had against Alcaraz,” he revealed. “I feel like with Sinner you know what's coming. Like he does it unbelievably well, like he's the best player in the world.” It was respect, layered in cold analysis. But Griekspoor wasn't done.

He shifted the conversation toward the subtle shades that separate the two. “But at the same time he‌ doesn't have the net skills and the net game that Alcaraz has. He doesn't have the drop shot. He doesn't have the backhand slice. Like he has the sliding backhand. Like the things he does is unbelievable.”

The Dutchman dug further. “Unbelievable level. But I think Alcaraz has a bit more options,” he explained. “And I think what's holding why Alcaraz is also a little bit more up and down is because he maybe is not using the right options at the right time. But on the other hand, in trouble, I think Alcaraz can do much more.” It was a breakdown with surgical precision, less emotion, more craft.

And then came the final blow. “I think Alcaraz's peak can be higher than Sinner's peak. But Sinner, well, now after yesterday, I'm actually not sure if this is true,” Griekspoor admitted. “I just think that Alcaraz has more options. He's more complete than Sinner is. But whatever Sinner does, he's the best in the world in doing that.”

To give you an idea, the ‘three championship points': Jannik Sinner had stood here before. Just 35 days earlier, he watched Carlos Alcaraz snatch the French Open from his grasp. But recently at Wimbledon, he was different. Calm, composed, and unshakable, the 23-year-old Italian rose to claim his maiden Wimbledon crown, silencing Centre Court with triumph and redemption. As he knelt on the grass, emotions surged: this was more than a win; it was closure. 

Sinner or Alcaraz: Who's the real heir to the tennis throne after the Big 3 era?

Debate

Yet, despite the victory, whispers linger. Tallon Griekspoor boldly reignited the debate, drawing a sharp line between the two phenoms. And just like that, the rivalry deepened. And as the Dutchman draws a sharp line between the two, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have recently ignited a fresh debate with an ATP star's bold generational claim.

Just when tennis fans feared a void after the golden era of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray, the sport finds its next heartbeat. Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash couldn't have put it better. “We have just come out of one of the most incredible eras, and suddenly these two guys are stepping up,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I always say Andre Agassi saved men's tennis when he came back, and these guys are saving men's tennis now.” The torch, it seems, has been passed, straight into the blazing hands of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

Dubbed “Sincaraz” by fans, this duo hasn't just filled the shoes of legends, they're sprinting in them. With every slam final, every brutal rally, and every thunderous finish, they are shaping the modern tennis narrative. But is this new era truly comparable to the age of the Big 4? One man who knows both worlds well, Hubert Hurkacz, offered a take that dares to question everything.

Speaking at an Adidas event in London, Hurkacz told Tennis365, “It's difficult to say who wins when they are all playing their best tennis.” But then, with the calm of a truth bomb, he dropped the line that splits generations: “I feel like the level is growing every single year, and obviously, we can say the level is better than it was ten years ago, but that is not to say Roger, Rafa, Novak, and Andy could not get to where we are now.”

Yet, his respect for the past shone through. “That is not to say Roger, Rafa, Novak, and Andy could not get to where we are now. They also improved every year and raised the bar, so if they were playing now, they would still be improving.”

The honesty didn't stop there. “Jannik and Carlos are playing at an incredible level now, and it is up to the rest of us to work hard to keep up with them,” Hurkacz added. “That's why I wake up every morning and work so hard—to try and reach those levels.”

So, now that the torch burns bright again, between Sinner and Alcaraz, who do you crown as the superior one after their recent display of fire and fight?

About this rating 



As the annual Wimbledon tennis championships played out from June to July in 2025, social media users claimed that the thousands of tennis balls used at the tournament get second lives as homes for tiny mice facing habitat loss.

For example, one Instagram user shared an image (archived) with text that read: "55,000 tennis balls are turned into homes for harvest mice after Wimbledon."

The caption of the post, which had amassed nearly 20,000 likes as of this writing, claimed that the balls "are donated to conservation groups" that cut out small entrances for the mice to enter in "grassy meadows and hedgerows."

Similar iterations of the rumor appeared on Facebook (archived) and Reddit (archived).

 

 

A post shared by Vacations (@vacations)



In short, while Wimbledon has previously donated some of its tennis balls for conservation groups to use as homes for harvest mice, these donations appear to have been one-offs. For this reason, we have rated this claim as outdated.

The oldest source for the alleged donation appeared to come from a 2001 BBC article, which at the time stated that some of the tournament's 36,000 tennis balls were donated to The Wildlife Trusts — a British federation of wildlife conservation charities — to be recycled as homes for harvest mice. A 2003 BBC article featured a small follow-up note to that story, stating that Wimbledon had donated 350 tennis balls to The Wildlife Trusts two years earlier.

Snopes contacted The Wildlife Trusts and Wimbledon to confirm if the tournament has continued to make such donations and, if so, for details about what is included in them. A spokesperson for The Wildlife Trusts said: "Unfortunately, the tennis ball story is very out of date as we haven't worked with Wimbledon in this way for some time." Similarly, a Wimbledon spokesperson confirmed that the story about harvest mice was an old one.

In 2011, The Guardian newspaper reported that Wimbledon again donated tennis balls to house mice, this time at the request of an aquarium in northern England. The Guardian did not say how many tennis balls were donated at the time.

It was not possible to find more recent articles about the tournament making such donations, although other tennis clubs in the U.K. have reportedly gifted tennis balls for the same purpose.

While not endangered globally, harvest mice are considered "Near Threatened" in the U.K., according to the Mammal Society, a British charity. Harvest mice are Britain's smallest rodent, which means a tennis ball with a hole cut into it can be a place for the mice to rest safe from their predators.

During the tournament, Wimbledon sells its used tennis balls on-site, and the proceeds go to the Wimbledon Foundation, its charity organization. Wimbledon has been selling its used tennis balls for the last several years, according to the tournament's spokesperson.

Wimbledon's website did not include any information on the fate of unused and unsold tennis balls, but Keith Prowse, a sports hospitality company that partners with Wimbledon, said they are donated or recycled in the weeks and months after the tournament finishes. Keith Prowse's website added: "Previously, some of the balls have been donated to the UK Wildlife Trust who cut them up and used them to make homes for harvest mice!"

Ahead of 'Fantastic Four: First Steps,' the studio boss engaged in a free-wheeling conversation with journalists, where he spoke extensively about the stumbles of the post-'Endgame' content boom, why Miles Morales won't be coming to the MCU anytime soon, and what's going on with 'Blade.'



		By Borys Kit, Pamela McClintock 

	July 20, 2025 12:02pm	




	In a nondescript conference room on the very descript floor of Marvel Studios (full size Iron Man statues, superhero murals and movie props) is a padlocked door. Behind that padlocked door is a white board featuring a plan for Marvel movies spanning the next seven years.


	So teased Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige, the producer behind the most successful run of movies in Hollywood's history, as he welcomed a select group of journalists into the same room where he first met Doctor Strange star Benedict Cumberbatch and where filmmaker  Chloe Zhao pitched her take on Eternals.

	Marvel's run has been tested of late, this year especially with Thunderbolts* and Captain America: Brave New World, which grossed among the lowest totals for the company. But Feige isn't interested in your theories of superhero fatigue, which he doesn't buy as real. He pointed to DC Studios' Superman, which is doing strong at the box office, at least domestically.




			Popular on THR		







	Feige said he texted filmmaker James Gunn to let him know how much he liked it.


	“I love how you just jump right into it,” Fiege enthused of the film, which Gunn directed he helmed three Guardians of the Galaxy movies for Marvel before decamping to run DC Studios. “You don't know who Mr. Terrific is? Tough. You'll figure it out. You don't know what this is? Just go, go. This is a fully fleshed out world.”

	











	Even if he doesn't buy the idea of superhero fatigue, Feige and his team have done plenty of post-mortems on this year's underperforming movies, and on all their movies since the massive success of Avengers: Endgame.


	Right now, the company is prepping for the July 25 release of its latest movie, Fantastic Four: First Steps. It's the first time Marvel Studios is handling the characters, after a trio of movies of various quality and box office made by Twentieth Century Fox before its 2019 acquisition by Disney. There was also the never-released, 1994 feature produced low-budget king Roger Corman. (Fun fact: the four stars of that movie cameo in First Steps.)


	One thing that Feige seemed to relish is that this new movie is mostly self-contained and is in a fully-fleshed world that doesn't require that dreaded word “homework.”


	“We didn't want to have the Eternals issue of ‘Where were they, where have they been, how come they didn't help with Thanos?'” he explained. “We wanted them to be apart from our reality so that we didn't have to say, ‘Oh look, they were hiding over here.'”


	And highlighting a 1960s aesthetic that was more than just a period piece choice.  “It was a unique aesthetic that felt like it could absolutely be its own world, its own reality. And when we show it to audiences in the screening process that we do leading up to it, people just accept it right off the bat and feel liberated that they can just enjoy what's ahead of them.” He underscores, “it is no homework required.”

	











	In a free-wheeling discussion with the journalists, Feige, wearing a blue Fantastic Four hoodie and a Wonder Man cap, opened up on a range of topics, from what's going on with Blade, his future at Marvel, and the exit of Jonathan Majors from the MCU.


	Here is what The Hollywood Reporter learned.


Yes, Feige knows Marvel made too many movies and shows (and the other things they did wrong)


	From the first Iron Man in 2008 through Endgame in 2019, Marvel produced around 50 hours of screen storytelling. In the six years since Endgame, the number jumps to an astounding 102 hours of movies and television. 127 hours if you include animation. 


	“That's too much,” Feige said.


	He characterized the time period after Endgame as an era of experimentation, evolution and, unfortunately, expansion.  And while he's proud of the experimentation – he points to WandaVision and Loki as some of the best stories they've made – he admits “It's the expansion that is certainly what devalued” that output.


	Being high on success also may have pushed them to readily agree to try to deliver more programming at a time when Disney and the rest of Hollywood were engaged in the streaming wars.


	“It was a big company push, and it doesn't take too much to push us to go, ‘People have been asking for Ms. Marvel for years, and now we can do it? Do it! Oscar Isaac wants to be Moon Knight? Do it!' So there was a mandate that we were put in the middle of, but we also thought it'd be fun to bring these to life.”

	











	Marvel has already pulled back the amount of movies and shows it will make. Some years may even only have one movie. Certainly there will be years with only one show released. Also, Marvel has started “grinding down” on budgets, with movies costing up to a third cheaper than the films from 2022 or 2023.


Here's why Thunderbolts* failed (even though it's a “very, very good movie”)


	The massive expansion into television and focus on Disney+ led to the feeling that watching Marvel was becoming a type of homework.


	“It's that expansion that I think led people to say, ‘Do I have to see all of these? It used to be fun, but now do I have to know everything about all of these?' And I think The Marvels hit it hardest where people are like, ‘Okay, I recognize her from a billion dollar movie. But who are those other two? I guess they were in some TV show. I'll skip it.'” 


	Which had an effect on Thunderbolts*, which featured characters that were seen on various platforms, including some only on shows.


	“Some of them were still feeling the residual effects of that notion of, ‘I guess I had to have seen these other shows to understand who this is,” Feige explained. “ I think if you actually saw the movie, that wouldn't be the case, and we make the movie so that's not the case. But I think we still have to make sure the audience understands that.”


Feige is staying put at Marvel (for now)


	No Hollywood executive stays in their chair forever. Whether it's because of a change at the top or a bad run of movies, change is inevitable. And succession is a hot topic at Disney, and in Hollywood in general.

	











	Feige was a bit circumspect on long he would stay at the company, quietly admitting he has about “two years, a little less” on his contract.


	But regardless, he stated his desire is to keep making big movies for the widest possible audience.


	“Do I want to be making big movies for big audiences in 10 or 15 years from now? Yes, absolutely. That's all I want to do,” Feige said.  “Marvel's a great way to do that for me right now. But I hope to make big movies for lots of people forever more.”


Feige Addresses Jonathan Majors for the first time (without talking about Jonathan Majors)


	Marvel faced several curveballs in the last few years as it worked on its post-Endgame phases. Yes, there were real world issues of a pandemic and Hollywood strikes. There was the tragic loss of Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman. And there was the assault conviction of Jonathan Majors, the actor who was playing villain Kang and seemed to be teed up as the next big arch nemesis for years to come.


	Feige never mentioned Majors by name, instead calling him “Kang actor” at one point or “the actor” or just zeroing on Kang as a character. And, Feige said, Marvel was already preparing to pivot away from Kang before the Majors issue.


	“We had started even before what had happened to the actor happened, we had started to realize that Kang wasn't big enough, wasn't Thanos, and that there was only one character that could be that, because he was that in the comics for decades and decades,” said Feige. “Because of the Fox acquisition, we finally had it and it was Dr. Doom. So we had started talking about Dr. Doom even before we officially pivoted from Kang. And in fact, I had started talking with Robert [Downey Jr.] about this audacious idea before Ant-Man 3 even came out. It was a long plan that we had had to take one of our greatest characters and utilize one of our greatest actors.”

	











Don't expect a live-action Miles Morales any time soon (thanks a lot, Sony)


	Many fans have been for years clamoring for a live-action MCU appearance of Miles Morales, the Spider-Man who headlines the acclaimed Spider-Verse movies from Sony Animation. When asked where Marvel was in the development of a live-action version of the character, Feige responded, “That is nowhere.”


	And added that Morales' fate was in Sony's hands. 


	“Sony has their brilliant, genius, incredible Spider- Verse animated franchise going and until that finishes, we've been told to stay away,” said Feige.


Blade being sharpened (again)


	What's the hold up with Blade? Well…


	“The obstacle was Ryan Coogler called and said, ‘We'd love some costumes for Sinners.' And we said, ‘Take them, man.' He's our good friend, take our costumes. We'll hold off on the movie.”


	Feige was, of course, joking, connecting Sinners to a version of Blade that was recentlybeing  developed, one that was set in a Prohibition Era, just like Coogler's original hit earlier this year.


	Feige confirmed there had been four takes of Blade that been developed over recent times, two that were period, two that were not.


	Marvel has now “landed on modern day.” And yes, Mahershala Ali is still attached. 


	He didn't reveal a timeline for Blade but did say that he, and Coogler, have a timeline for Black Panther 3.


Tonal malleability is a key to Marvel's success (yes, there will be more R-rated stories coming)












Deadpool & Wolverine as well as the Daredevil TV show have shown that Marvel is becoming more and more comfortable with pushing stories that are adult-oriented.


	But its characters can also appear in age-appropriate settings when needed. It's all a way to keep audiences interested and invested. That is how, Feige pointed out, you can have the Green Goblin build snowmen in Disney+'s Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends but then kill Aunt May in Spider-Man: No Way Home.


	Punisher is another example. The violent vigilante played by Jon Bernthal is the subject of a special that just began shooting last week and will air on Disney+ next year. It is intended to be TV-MA.


	But “when Punisher is in the Spider-Man movie, it'll be a different tonality,” said Feige.


Feige still likes the flexibility of going into production without a set script


	The Marvel method of moviemaking has included ever-evolving scripts and heavy-lifting in post-production. Striking a contrarian position, Gunn, after working at Marvel, has publicly stated that his DC Studios won't begin a project without a locked script and a definite ending.


	Feige says Marvel has never started a movie without a full script but also added that he's never been satisfied with a script the company has had. “I've never been satisfied with a movie we've released,” he even added on top of that.


	What he and the company like to do is “plus-ing at every turn.”


	“There's plus-ing happening every day on the Avengers: Doomsday set right now, and it is amazing to watch because what those filmmakers, those actors, both the ones that are playing these characters for the first or second time and the one playing them for the 10th or 12th time are the best in the world at it, and know these characters so well,” said Feige. “So if they have an idea, you want to listen to it and you want to adjust to it and you want to improve it. I wouldn't want to change that.”

	











	Stephen McFeely is writing the script, but Feige revealed that Loki creator Michael Waldron is also helping.

Ever-outspoken standup, actor, talk show staple, and “WTF with Marc Maron” host Marc Maron talked about his “nemesis” Jon Stewart on the NPR series “Wild Card with Rachel Martin.” Way back in the '90s, Maron was one of Stewart's successors as host of Comedy Central's “Short Attention Span Theater,” which was canceled shortly after he took over. Maron, of course, went on to bigger and better things, as did Stewart, but Maron said that he needed a rivalry to keep going.

“I always have a nemesis… like most of that is fueled by resentment, insecurity, jealousy, or whatever,” he explained. “It's habit and it's the never ending sort of, you know, struggle against acting out of insecurity… or resentment, self-acceptance.”

For years, Maron continued, Stewart filled that role for Maron, since — as he recalls — “he had figured it out” when it came to being a comic. “I always used to think it was just 'cause he committed to a haircut and… a way of presenting. But like, he was just everywhere,” Maron said. “And he was a standup but… he was everywhere… He was the king of the thing… politics, satire, whatever.”

 










Maron said that he felt a lot of jealousy about Stewart's success, and that the two even had confrontations about it and “are not friends.” He said that Stewart “doesn't particularly like” him. But Maron seems to put the onus of the tension on himself. “It was resentment,” he explained. “It was me being kind of… small minded.”

Maron reached out to Stewart and attempted to mend the fences when he recorded an episode of his eponymous podcast with comedian Gallagher as a guest in 2011.

“I reached out to him, and I remember… he called me back. I was in a hotel room in Portland,” Maron recalled. “And he goes, ‘Hey, you know, it's, it's Jon Stewart.' I'm like, ‘Hey man, how you doing?'” Maron then proceeded to explain the podcast he was doing and invited him to participate. Stewart replied, “I'm not doing that.”

“He said, ‘Look, you know, it's like whatever you're doing… there's no love here.' And then he said… ‘I'm sure what you're doing is very creative, but… I'm just — there's no love here.' And I'm like, ‘Got it, dude.' And uh yeah… so, I guess it was pretty creative,” Maron said.

Maron currently is shopping a documentary a highly personal documentary feature, “Are We Good?” The film premiered at SXSW in March and played Tribeca in June.

 










Stewart, meanwhile, is still leading Comedy Central‘s “The Daily Show.” On July 17, he addressed the uncertain future of the series, just hours before the announcement of the cancellation of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which airs on Paramount sister network CBS — and currently the company is attempting a merger with Skydance.

 “Unfortunately, we haven't heard anything from them,” he said on his podcast “The Weekly Show With Jon Stewart.” “They haven't called me and said, ‘Don't get too comfortable in that office, Stewart.' But let me tell you something, I've been kicked out of shittier establishments than that. We'll land on our feet. I honestly don't know.”

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Justin Kroll 


	When it comes to the future of Marvel Studios, which has taken its licks this year with misfires Thunderbolts* and Captain America: Brave New World, the No. 1 superhero box office brand isn't letting up. 


	Marvel Studios Producer and President Kevin Feige in a sit down with the press at Marvel's Burbank HQ gestures toward a series of locked doors in a meeting room.   


	“It's a seven-year plan,” teases Feige, “I think it goes to 2032.”


	“It's on magnets, it can move around.”

					Summer Box Office Opening Forecasts For 'Fantastic Four', 'Weapons', 'Freakier Friday' & More		
			








	Feige is particularly chipper, for even though Marvel is skipping San Diego Comic-Con this year as they remain knee deep in production on the Russo Brothers' Avengers: Doomsday and in prep on Spider-Man: Brand New Day, the Marvel Boss and former X-Men associate producer, finally has his hands in The Fantastic Four thanks to the Disney-Fox merger. Having that subset of Marvel characters has liberated Feige to take even bigger swings with the MCU. The Fantastic Four: First Steps is looking to be Marvel Studios' biggest opening YTD with $100M-$110M stateside.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	While Fox had respectable success with 2005 and 2007 Fantastic Four movies (which starred Chris Evans as Johnny Storm pre-Captain America), the former studio saw a Josh Trank directed 2015 reboot completely tank after a full reshoot, grossing only $167M worldwide. This time, it's different, it's Feige's Fantastic Four. 


	“Why Fantastic Four?” explains Feige on the reasons for another redo. “Because it's Marvel's first family. It's in the history of our characters; they deserve to be A-listers. They were A-listers in the comics. Every crossover movie we've made in the Infinity saga, Civil War, leading to Infinity War and Endgame, which is really the Infinity saga from the comics, the Fantastic Four were huge players in those comics and obviously we couldn't do that then.”

	











	While several Marvel projects post Avengers: Endgame have dovetailed between TV series and films, for Feige, it was important to have the Fantastic Four be contained in their own world sans any callbacks to the Avengers‘ blip or other verse characters. 


	“It's a no homework required go-see-the movie. It's literally not connected to anything that was made before,” says Feige, “It kicks off phase six.”


	“There were a lot of left turns and surprises that happened over the last seven or eight years,” Feige continues, “A positive one was to finally have those characters back and the X-Men.” 


	Getting access to the Fox Marvel characters has enabled Feige to plus-up the next two Avengers movies with the most notorious antagonist in the comic-books: Dr. Doom. While the original plan for the Avengers movie announced at Comic-Con 2019 was to feature Jonathan Majors' Kang the Conqueror as the main baddie, the character's future was thrown into question after the actor's arrest for assaulting his then girlfriend in early 2023. 


	Feige says, “Even before what had happened to the actor, we had started to realize that Kang wasn't Thanos.” 


	“There was only one character that could be that because he was that in the comics for decades and decades, and because of the Fox acquisition, we finally had it, and that's Dr. Doom,” says the studio boss.  “We had started talking about Dr. Doom even before we officially pivoted from Kang,” he says, “In fact, I had started talking with Robert about this audacious idea before Ant-Man 3 even came out.”


	Already Patrick Stewart's X-Men papa Dr. Xavier has made a cameo in the Disney/Marvel Studios Universe Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, with a slew of X-Men characters, i.e. Channing Tatum's Gamit, and even Wesley Snipes' Blade making cameos in last year's Deadpool & Wolverine. 


	Speaking of Blade, despite being taken off the calendar, the project remains in development with 2x Oscar winner Mahershala Ali still attached. The movie with the actor was first announced at SDCC 2019 with Ali taking the Hall H stage in what was a then huge announcement of the MCU's plans across cinema and Disney+. 


	Feige revealed on Friday that while there were four versions of Blade in the works, two of them period (one of them set in the 1930s), “we landed on modern day and that's what we're focusing on.”


	On pausing Blade after the exit of two filmmakers, Yann Demange, exit and Bassam Tariq's departure, Feige says “We didn't want to put a leather outfit on him and have him start killing vampires.”


	“You can start and have a good script and make it a great script through production, but we didn't feel confident we could do that on Blade,” he continues, “We didn't want to do that to Mahershala and didn't want to do that to us.”


	In the wake of the success of his own vampire movie, Sinners, one reporter wondered whether Ryan Coogler would get to take a crack at directing Blade. Feige says there's no plans, rather the director remains committed to Black Panther 3. 


	Feige's next phase of the MCU are fewer, more quality movies, numbering anywhere from 1 to 3 movies annually with less connectivity between the movies and TV shows. Marvel learned the hard way that their over-reaching Disney+ series and theatrical movie plans were too much of a good thing for fans, evident in the bombing of The Marvels ($206.1M global box office) which fused together Brie Larson's Captain Marvel (who had her own $1 billion grossing film) with the lesser-known characters of Ms. Marvel and Monica Rambeau. The takeaway was that many fans and general moviegoers didn't buy tickets for The Marvels because they weren't caught up on Ms. Marvel on Disney+ 


	Still, while storylines won't crossover between series and film, characters will, read Jon Bernthal's The Punisher cameo in the upcoming Sony/Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Brand New Day. 












	“Where we have great actors playing great characters, I think it would be fun to see them in multiple places,” says Feige. 


	With Downey Jr. now playing Dr. Doom, are there plans to recast the core Iron Man, Captain America, etc on the big screen? Yes and no. Feige sees a star such as Chris Hemsworth still in his prime to play Thor, and even cherishes the return of thespians (i.e. Tim Blake Nelson's Samuel Stern in Captain America: Brave New World) who played Marvel characters years ago. But, yes, in the long-term like with many other storied movie franchises, Marvel classic superheros will get new faces. When exactly?  “X-Men is where that will happen,” promised Feige. 


	In addition, post Avengers: Secret Wars, there is a plan he says to “reset singular timelines” and reboot he MCU. Are there more R-rated MCU movies after making the highest grossing R-rated movie of all-time with Deadpool & Wolverine at $1.33 billion? Sure. “Where appropriate and where necessary,” says Feige. 


	In regard to Feige's future and whether there's more Marvel under him, he's not going anywhere. While his contract is up in two years, he tells us, “Do I want to be making big movies for big audiences in ten or 15 years from now? Yes, that's all I want to do. Marvel is great way to do that.” 


	Upcoming Marvel schedule according to Comscore:


Spider-Man: Brand New Day (Sony) – July 31, 2026 


Avengers Doomsday – Dec. 18, 2026


	Untitled Marvel – July 23, 2027


Avengers: Secret Wars – Dec. 17, 2027


	Untitled Marvel – Feb. 18, 2028


	Untitled Marvel – May 5, 2028


	Untitled Marvel – Nov. 10, 2028

If Fantastic Four can't crack $450m I think you have to tale a serious look at changing the studio's creative leadership. The misses are piling up and they let one of their key in-house directors go run the competition. How many more mulligans do you give Kevin?

FYI, “Thunderbolts” and “Captain America: Brave New World” weren't “misfires”! Just because they didn't make “Avengers: Endgame” type of money doesn't mean their flops! They both had great reviews, and they both still did very well at the B.O.!

John Oliver was in Erie, Pennsylvania over the weekend to rebrand the city's minor league baseball to the Moon Mammoths.


	The Last Week Tonight host revealed in May that he would help bring a new look to the Detroit Tigers Double-A affiliate team, which was previously known as the Erie SeaWolves.


	While he was in Erie, he paid tribute to his old friend Stephen Colbert, whose Late Show was axed earlier this week by CBS.


	“I love Stephen, I love his staff. I love that show. It's incredibly sad. I am partly excited to see what they're going to do for the next 10 months,” he reportedly said, per local news.

	“It's terrible, terrible news for the world of comedy. Late-night shows mean a lot to me, not just because I work in them, but because even growing up in England, I would watch [David] Letterman's show, which of course was Stephen's show, and think about what a glamorous world that was. So, to have got to be on Letterman's show and Stephen's show has been always one of the most fun things, so it's very, very, very sad news. I look forward to seeing what he's going to do next because that man will not stop,” he added.


	Oliver has appeared multiple times on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert as well as the earlier iteration with David Letterman in 2015.


	He is the latest comedian and television host to offer his support following comments from other late-night peers including Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers and Andy Cohen as well as the likes of Anderson Cooper.

The world of comedy is actually much better off now considering this show was anything but comedic. Comedy is actually the strongest it's been if you leave your bubble of Democrat approved comedians.

Comedy will be fine. We have the Bear.

The Bear is far from a comedy – a comedy is supposed to make you laugh!!

Refresh for latest…: It's been a busy weekend globally for Hollywood, with new milestones for two pictures, and as another pair close in on benchmarks amid strong holds. There was also new studio fare this frame while the latest Demon Slayer is a big hit in Japan, its first release market.


	Taking the major milestones first, and before digging into more detail, DC/Warner Bros' Superman topped the four-century mark in its sophomore session, flying to $406.8M global. In its 3rd weekend, Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth, after topping half a billion worldwide during its sophomore frame, roared past $600M global to reach $648M through Sunday.

	In holds, and near milestones, Apple Original Films's F1, via Warner Bros, keeps pushing the needle with increases in some markets again this session amid a mere 24% overseas drop from last weekend to top $300M ($307.2M) at the international box office and reach a $460.8M global cume to date, on its way to $500M. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Universal's How to Train Your Dragon is closing in on $600M worldwide with $589M through today.


	Notably, some of the above titles have yet to open in Japan, having dated out of the way of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba Infinity Castle which started local release on Friday. This is the massively anticipated latest in the Demon Slayer franchise. While getting reliable grosses out of Japan this early (particularly as this is a four-day weekend with Monday a holiday), we are hearing estimates as high as 5.9B yen ($39.7M) for the FSS. 

	











	We will update as clearer figures become available, but we do know that the movie (which will be released by Sony domestically in September) opened to an all-time Imax record in Japan of $3M. That's bigger than any Hollywood or local title and includes an Imax opening day Friday record. The estimated four-day total is $3.5M in Imax.


	Before we turn back to details on the above Hollywood holdovers, here's how the new movies fared. 


	Paramount Animation's Smurfs grossed $22.6M this session internationally, for $33.6M global. That's lower than where we saw it pre-open, but comes with the codicil of a crowded marketplace and not so family friendly weather in Europe. Including Australia, which started last weekend, the offshore cume is $25M.


	As expected, France was first up with $3.7M, followed by the UK at $1.7M, Brazil at $1.6M, Mexico with $1.5M and Germany at $1.5M. Including last weekend, Australia is at $3.3M.


	Major markets still  to release include Korea and Italy in August and Japan in September.


	Also new, Sony's I Know What You Did Last Summer hooked $11.6M from 58 overseas markets this session. That's on par with Happy Death Day 2U and 11% above Speak No Evil for the same group of markets at current rates. 


	Overall, there's not the same nostalgia for this property internationally as there is domestically.


	Returning to the toplines… Superman added an estimated $45.2M from 78 overseas markets, for a holdover drop of 44% (excluding China; that market has positively rejected this movie). The international running cume is now $171.8M.


	Weather, as noted earlier and as we always note during summer (and/or random phenomenon months), has been a factor. With a more favorable moviegoing climate, the UK dropped by 31% while other markets saw strong holds including France (-23%), Holland (-25%), Germany (-29%), and Italy (-38%).


	Latin America held to -39%, and a highlight in Asia Pacific was Australia where the drop was -32%.


	The Top 5 to date are: UK ($22.2M), Mexico ($16.6M), Brazil ($11.2M), Australia ($11M) and China ($8.5M).


	The global Imax total is $51.4M.


	After topping half a billion worldwide during its sophomore frame, Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth crossed another milestone during its third session, roaring past $600M global to reach $648M through Sunday.


	This makes the Scarlett Johansson-starrer the 4th biggest Hollywood film of 2025 worldwide (behind Ne Zha 2, Lilo & Stitch and A Minecraft Movie). It is the 6th Jurassic title to cross $600M global, and in China has become the biggest Hollywood movie of 2025 with $71.8M to date.`


	Overseas, Gareth Edwards' JWR dipped 44% across 82 markets for a $40.3M weekend. The international box office cume is $371.8M through Sunday.


	Looking at comps, excluding China, the offshore performance is in line with Jurassic World Dominion, just off Top Gun: Maverick and well above Universal's current How to Train Your Dragon (2025) and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.


	The Top 5 markets to date are: China ($71.8M), UK ($33.7M), Mexico ($28.7M), Germany ($20.3M) and France ($17.4M).


	Japan is still to release, on August 8.


	In another impressive performance, F1 is continuing to gain traction from great word of mouth. The Joseph Kosinski-directed movie added an estimated $29.5M in its 4th weekend in 78 overseas markets for a $307.2M offshore cume to date, with the global running tally at $460.8M.

	











	The holds here are impressive: Asia Pacific, excluding China, dipped just 11% while China, after increasing last weekend, slid just 37% while new local movies entered that market. Europe was off 25% from last weekend, and Latin America came in with a drop of -32%. 


	Very notably, Korea grew this session by 28%, that's freaky for a depressed market but speaks to the power of word of mouth (and some other alchemy we're still figuring out). Taiwan (+5%), UK (+2%), France (-5%), Holland (-18%), Saudi Arabia (-19%), India (-22%), Spain (-27%), Australia (-28%), Mexico (-29%),  Brazil (-35%), UAE (-36%), Germany (-37%) and Japan (-42%) are also among the impressive holds.


	Here are the Top 5 through Sunday: China ($45.5M), UK ($24.6M), France ($20.8M), Mexico ($17.4M) and Australia ($15.2M).


	The worlwide Imax cume is $79M.


How to Train Your Dragon for its part is closing in on $600M with $589M global through today. The international weekend was $8.6M in 82 markets, a 38% dip from the previous session. Overseas, the running cume is $338.2M. 


	Here are the Top 5: China ($38.7M), Mexico ($36.3M), UK ($27.8M), Brazil ($20.5M) and Australia ($18.5M).


	Japan releases on September 5.

"My review of Burlesque the Musical," the pop icon captioned a clip of herself at the show.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Christina Aguilera is gushing over Burlesque the Musical.


	On Saturday (July 19), the 44-year-old pop icon attended the stage adaptation of Steven Antin's 2010 film Burlesque, in which she starred as an aspiring performer opposite Cher, who played a glamorous nightclub owner.


	Xtina documented her experience at London's Savoy Theatre and shared her reaction on social media.


	“BLOWN AWAY!!!” she captioned an Instagram video of herself at the show, set to her track “Show Me How You Burlesque,” from the original Burlesque soundtrack.

	











	The short clip shows Aguilera — an executive producer of the musical — smiling and clapping during the performance, with scenes from the production spliced throughout. “My review of Burlesque the Musical,” the “Genie in a Bottle” singer wrote over the video, adding five stars.




			Trending on Billboard		







	After Saturday's show, Burlesque the Musical shared clips on Instagram of Aguilera arriving at the theater, waving to fans while wearing a sheer black outfit. “What it is like to have a goddess in your life,” Antin captioned one video on his Instagram Story. “Unbelievable night with @xtina [heart emoji] this queen so much for producing our show.”


Burlesque marked Aguilera's first leading film role and Cher's debut musical performance on screen. In the movie, Aguilera plays Alice Marilyn, an aspiring singer who leaves her small Iowa hometown to pursue her dreams in Los Angeles. She soon becomes a dancer and cocktail waitress at a struggling burlesque lounge owned by Tess Scali, played by Cher.


	The 10-song Burlesque soundtrack — featuring music written and produced by Diane Warren, Sia, Tricky Stewart, Ron Fair, Linda Perry and Aguilera — reached No. 18 on the Billboard 200 albums chart in 2010.

	











Burlesque the Musical made its world premiere in June at the Manchester Opera House and is now playing at London's Savoy Theatre through early September. Written and produced by Antin, the stage adaptation features songs by Aguilera and Sia, along with new music by Todrick Hall and Jess Folley.


	Earlier this year, Aguilera shared her excitement about the project. “I'm proud that Burlesque the Musical is coming to London's West End!” she said in a statement. “Our journey of making this film to bringing this show to the stage has been so special and exciting. Following our successful previews, having the show land in the West End later this year is a dream come true!”

David Corenswet as Superman was not an idea that just dropped out of thin air. In fact, that idea has been gestating for at least six years. The actor even told Men's Health writer Evan Romano at the time in 2020 that it was his “pie-in-the-sky” dream to play the ultimate comic book hero.

“I mean, the whole point of ‘pie-in-the-sky' is that it doesn't happen too often,” he previously said, adding, “I just always felt like Superman was both under-appreciated and over-simplified, and there was a lot of interesting stuff that could happen with it. But that's all just in my mind. There's nothing outside of that, at least that I know of.”

Romano told Corenswet that he could see him playing the role, to which the now-Superman, then-mortal replied, “Great to know… I'll take that in writing. Maybe we can start a petition.”

The ambition, obviously, was realized — and resulted in a so-far $400+ million box office bonanza, which includes the $125 million opening weekend “Superman” had domestically and another $57.2 million in North America this weekend. Much of the movie's success has been credited to Corenswet, whom writer/director James Gunn said he stumbled upon when watching the 2022 film “Pearl.”
 










“I actually was watching this movie, which is great. It's a great movie… and I saw a character whose name I think is just the Projectionist in the movie, and I'm like, ‘That guy looks like he could possibly be Superman,'” Gunn said on Konbini. “I looked up his name on IMDb and said, ‘Can you bring this guy in?' And so they brought David in. There were two people I asked to be brought in, maybe more, but one guy I thought was most likely to be Superman.”

But it turns out that other guy, Gunn recalled, “wasn't very good.” “And then David Corenswet, I watched him, and he was amazing,” Gunn said, adding he was particularly impressed with the actor's comedic chops. What Gunn might not have been prepared for is Corenswet's inquisitive nature. In an interview with GQ, Gunn talked about working on set with his Superman.

“Sometimes his questions are great, and I totally see where they make him better, and because they make him better, they make the movie better,” Gunn shared. “But every once in a while, it's just one question too many, and it's like, ‘Oh, my God, just, David, stop, stop, for a minute.' And the beautiful thing about me and David is that he knows that about himself and he knows where my limits are. And when I say, ‘David, shut the fuck up,' David totally gets it and does not take that personally.”

	While Donald Trump is focused on building a punishing and dangerous immigrant detention facility he named “Alligator Alcatraz,” he's losing ground on the issue with the public. The majority of Americans see through Trump's claims that his administration is deporting only the “worst of the worst” criminals and instead believe he is focusing “too much” on deportations and deporting more people than they expected, according to a new CBS News poll. The poll revealed that the president is losing ground on other matters too, such as the Epstein case and Trump's tariffs obsession.


	In just one month, the poll saw a nine percent shift in the portion of Americans who believe the administration is prioritizing “dangerous criminals” for deportation. While in June, 53 percent of Americans said criminals are being prioritized for deportation, now that number has dipped to 44 percent, and 56 percent of Americans said the administration is focusing on deporting “people who aren't dangerous criminals.” 

	











	Those public opinions appear to align with reality. As of last month, nearly 72 percent of people detained by ICE had no criminal convictions. And, as a Miami Herald analysis revealed, the majority of detainees at so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” do not have criminal convictions, despite Trump's promise it would hold “some of the most vicious people on the planet.”

	When asked whether the administration is deporting as many people as they had anticipated, 52 percent of Americans polled said they were deporting more people than they expected. A larger majority — 58 percent — oppose the way the administration is using detention facilities.

	











	But when it comes to the president's base, he's still holding onto strong support, with 85 percent of Republicans favoring the way he is using detention facilities and 91 percent approving of his deportation plans. Among all Americans, however, support for his deportation program has waned in recent months, from 59 percent in February to 54 percent in June to 49 percent in July.

	Most Americans also recognize the inherent racism in immigration enforcement, with 64 percent saying Hispanic people are subjected to more searches than others.


	On economic issues, like rising prices and inflation, Americans are growing frustrated. Seventy percent said he is not putting enough focus on lowering prices and putting too much focus on tariffs (61 percent). A similar number (60 percent) oppose new tariffs on imported goods. Just 36 percent of respondents approve of Trump's handling of inflation — down from 46 percent in March.


	Regarding the case against Jeffrey Epstein — the deceased billionaire financier, Trump “pal,” sex trafficker, and child sex offender — a vast majority (89 percent) want the Justice Department to release all information it has on the matter.

	The handling of the Epstein information has divided the DOJ and caused some of Trump's most vocal and radical supporters to publicly question his motives for not releasing the files. Meanwhile, Trump and those in his administration have tried to blame, believe it or not, Democrats.


	But that doesn't seem to be working, even among Trump's usually loyal base. Only 50 percent of Republican respondents said they were satisfied with the administration's handling of matters related to the case, while 49 percent said they are dissatisfied.

'The Daily Show' host's comments came shortly before it was announced that CBS has canceled 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.'


							By

Jon Stewart is uncertain about The Daily Show‘s future if the Skydance–Paramount merger goes through.


	The host of the Comedy Central program (which is owned by Paramount Global) was recently asked by a listener on his The Weekly Show With Jon Stewart podcast, “Do you think Skydance would get rid of The Daily Show after the merger goes through?” Stewart's response came shortly before The Late Show With Stephen Colbert‘s shocking cancellation at CBS.




	“Unfortunately, we haven't heard anything from them,” Stewart responded. “They haven't called me and said, ‘Don't get too comfortable in that office, Stewart.' But let me tell you something, I've been kicked out of shittier establishments than that. We'll land on our feet. I honestly don't know.”

	The host added that he “likes to believe that without The Daily Show, Comedy Central's kind of muzak at this point.”


	“I think we're the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park. But I'd like to think we bring enough value to the property, like if they're looking at it as purely a real estate transaction, I think we bring a lot of value,” Stewart continued. “But that may not be their consideration. I don't know, they may sell the whole fucking place for parts. I just don't know. We'll deal with it when we do, but I'm so happy and proud of everybody that works there. Like they want to do that, knock themselves out.”

	











	“We've all got a surmisal about who actually is owning it and what his ideology is. But ideology may not play a part,” he added, referencing Skydance Media CEO David Ellison, who has been praised by Trump.


The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Skydance for comment.


	Skydance is currently in the process of acquiring Paramount Global, which is the parent company of CBS and Comedy Central. However, the deal is still pending FCC approval, more than a year after the proposed merger was announced. Earlier this month, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Donald Trump, who sued over former Vice President Kamala Harris' 60 Minutes interview. Sources previously told The Hollywood Reporter that Paramount believes the lawsuit posed a threat to Skydance's deal to acquire the company, which requires regulatory approval, including the transfer of FCC licenses. Brendan Carr is the current chairman of the FCC after being nominated by Trump.


Both Colbert and Stewart have been critical of the settlement, with the latter calling it “shameful” earlier this month.

Jason Momoa is a father to two children whom he shares with his ex-wife, Lisa Bonnet. They have a daughter, Lola, born in 2007, and a son, Nakoa-Wolf, born in 2008. Momoa's kids are growing up fast, and when he stepped onto the red carpet to promote his latest film, “Chief of War,” he was joined by his teenagers. 

The family posed for photos on the red carpet at Ko Olina Beach Park in Kapolei, Hawaii, on Friday, July 18, 2025. The sweet moment not only showed that Momoa's kids are growing up fast and are gorgeous, but it also gave a glimpse into a more playful side of their personalities. 

The film, a story about a Hawaiian war chief, saw Momoa posing for photos in the same cape that he wore in the movie. Momoa, who has Hawaiian heritage, plays the role of Kaʻiana. His son and daughter also posed in outfits that complemented his, each with their own capes. 

Lola paired hers with a brown cutout dress, and Nakoa wore a black vest and matching black trousers. 

Momoa's heritage is important to him, and he has honored his roots in many different ways. This includes the names he chose for his children. His daughter Lola's middle name is Iolani, which means “royal hawk,” People reports. 

Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha's name is also an honor to Momoa's heritage. People reports that Nakoa means “warrior,” and Manakauapo is a comment on the “dark and rainy weather conditions when he was born.”

Fatherhood is a role that the “Aquaman” actor takes seriously. He has discussed what having children means to him in several interviews. In a 2020 chat with InStyle, Momoa discussed becoming a father and how he had learned to share his emotions. “I didn't know what it takes to be a dad,” he told InStyle. “And I don't want to just tell my son, ‘Because I said so.' I really want to connect, and I want him to be vulnerable and open.”

In March 2024, Momoa told People how he has prioritised spending time with his children. “I spent a lot of time with them when they were younger, which is super important. Then they traveled with me quite a bit. But now, going into high school, they've got their friends and stuff,” he said.

He continued, “They still like me, which is good. I'm probably losing cool factor daily.”

Since his first Hallmark movie in 2011, “Love Begins,” beloved actor Wes Brown has been paired with some of the network's top leading ladies, from Rachel Boston in 2019's “Check Inn at Christmas” to Lacey Chabert in the “Haul Out the Holly” franchise.

But even after appearing in nearly 20 Hallmark movies, there are still actresses Brown has yet to co-star with, he told Swooon on July 19, 2025. When asked which ones he'd love to star with next, three stars were top of mind for the Hallmark hunk.

“I would love to work with Nikki DeLoach,” Brown told the outlet, and then added, “Kimberley Sustad, I've never done one with her. Sarah Drew, actually. I know all of the ladies, so it's just the ones that I haven't (filmed with). I love them all, so each one that I haven't is on the list.”

A post shared by Wes Brown (@wesbrown225)

Brown and DeLoach just spent time together in Boston and New York, teaming up to promote Hallmark's Christmas in July programming slate. 

On July 1, they were among the six Hallmark stars who appeared at Fenway Park for the Boston Red Sox game to launch the monthlong slate of holiday films and shows. Brown got to throw out the first pitch while the others cheered him on, and his upcoming “A Newport Christmas” co-star Ginna Claire Mason sang the national anthem. 

After the baseball game, Brown and DeLoach headed to New York City for multiple joint interviews about Hallmark's unscripted show they're both part of, “Christmas at Sea.” 

The four-part series follows fans and 11 stars — including Sustad and Drew, too — aboard the second-ever Hallmark Christmas Cruise in November 2024. All four stars — Brown, DeLoach, Sustad, and Drew — will be aboard the next cruise in November 2025, which sold out in a day. Brown told New York Live the ship has a waiting list of 70,000 fans. 

Although Brown would love the chance to work with DeLoach, Sustad, or Drew in the future, he's had some great female co-stars in his Hallmark past. Here's a rundown of his movies and castmates, per IMDb (not including his great cameos in movies like “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story” and “A Biltmore Christmas.”

Tammy Slaton, 38, who rose to fame through the hit TLC series “1000-Lb Sisters,” has once again stunned fans! Tammy posted jaw-dropping new photos showcasing her ongoing weight loss journey. 

The reality star, who began sharing her health transformation in 2020, has now lost a staggering 500 pounds and undergone surgery to remove excess skin. 

On Saturday, July 20, Tammy posted a TikTok slideshow featuring new images of herself looking confident, radiant, and almost unrecognizable. 

Though she left the caption blank, she used the viral sound “I understood the assignment,” signaling just how far she's come.

The TikTok post quickly generated a wave of emotional and supportive comments. Fans were amazed by Tammy's glow-up, with one follower declaring, “Absolutely loving this era of Tammy.”

Another user wrote, “Ok Tammy! We see you 👀 happy looks good on you 💜,” while someone else gushed, “Looking amazing Tammy.”

@LuckySeven 🅱️  yall want to hear a great artist go check out my friend my Bestie I've known for years amazing person. I'm trying to help them make it big. and all I ask, is y'all to show them some love

The outpouring of love didn't stop there. One longtime fan commented, “I love your show soo much. I've been watching since day 1 and it's soo incredible to see how far you have come. Keep slaying queen 🥰.”

Perhaps the most touching message came from a follower who wrote, “Brought a tear to my eye. It's been honestly so inspiring and amazing to watch your journey. Never been prouder of a stranger in my life! Well done Tammy 👏.”

Tammy's update included both selfie-style and full-body shots, showing off her slimmer figure. The use of filters and her fresh appearance had fans calling her transformation “unreal.”

Her TikTok presence has evolved into a space of positivity, self-love, and resilience—qualities that have resonated with her audience since the beginning.

Together with a friend, Tammy has contributed to a collective weight loss of over 2,000 pounds. While she has made incredible strides, she has been candid about the challenges she continues to face.

A post shared by Dr. Eric Smith (@doctorericsmith_)

While Tammy isn't behind the wheel just yet, she's already envisioning her dream ride: a classic Ford Mustang GT, which she adorably referred to as a “vintage stang” during a recent podcast appearance.

She also shared exciting personal news—her engagement to longtime partner Andrea Dalton. After three years of dating, Tammy proudly revealed her engagement ring on a podcast hosted by Hunter Ezell. The couple has kept their relationship mostly private, but her recent posts suggest she's entering a joyful and confident new era.

Tammy's journey—from her early struggles on “1000-Lb Sisters” to her current state of empowerment- has inspired millions. Her latest social media drop isn't just a photo update; it's a celebration of progress and hope. And fans can't wait to see what she'll do next.

Christina Haack is making the best of her downtime after Christina on the Coast ended up on HGTV‘s chopping block.


	On Saturday, the real estate investor and TV personality commented on the cancellation of her reality show after five seasons, sharing recent photos with boyfriend Christopher Larocca and her children.


	“Summer so far. Basically just eating and laughing. Canceled looks good on me…. Only kidding only kidding,” Haack captioned the post.

	Deadline previously reported seven HGTV cancellations, including Christina on the Coast and The Flipping El Moussas, hosted by Haack's ex-husband Tarek and his wife Heather Rae El Moussa. Also canceled were Bargain Block, Married to Real Estate, Farmhouse Fixer, Izzy Does It and Battle on the Beach.

	











	The status of Haack's other HGTV show, Christina in the Country, is unknown after its second season debuted in November.


	Meanwhile, Haack's collaboration with Tarek and Heather Rae, The Flip Off, has been renewed for Season 2.


	Haack also recently revealed that she “informally” spoke with Bravo producers about potentially joining the cast of The Real Housewives of Orange County, but admitted she would be “so boring” to watch.

	Astronomer CEO Andy Byron has resigned after being seen embracing an employee on large video screens at a Coldplay concert.


	During Coldplay's show at Boston's Gillette Stadium on Wednesday (July 16), a jumbotron captured Byron with his arms around the IT company's chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot, during a kiss-cam segment. Upon realizing they were on the big screen, Byron quickly ducked out of view while Cabot turned away. Both individuals are married to other people.


	“Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy,” Coldplay frontman Chris Martin said from the stage.

	











	In the days that followed, the video went viral on social media, quickly sparking a wave of memes and jokes about the incident. Country singer Morgan Wallen even weighed in during his concert in Glendale, Ariz., on Friday (July 18), telling the crowd that anyone attending with their “side chick” was “safe here.”

	Astronomer has since released a statement noting that Byron is stepping down as CEO and that the company is searching for his replacement, according to The Associated Press.


	“Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding,” the company wrote in a statement on Saturday (July 19). “Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met. Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted. The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO.”


	The statement continued, “Before this week, we were known as a pioneer in the DataOps space, helping data teams power everything from modern analytics to production AI. While awareness of our company may have changed overnight, our product and our work for our customers have not. We're continuing to do what we do best: helping our customers with their toughest data and AI problems.”

	











	Coldplay had not released a statement about the situation at press time. But at the band's concert in Madison, Wis., on Saturday — their first Music of the Spheres World Tour show since the kiss-cam moment — a fan held up a sign that read, “He's not my CEO,” with an arrow pointing to the man beside her, prompting laughter from the crowd, according to TMZ.


	Martin also gave the crowd at Camp Randall Stadium a playful heads-up about the on-camera segment of the show. 


	“We'd like to say hello to some of you in the crowd,” he said, according to People. “How we're gonna do that is we're gonna use our cameras and put some of you on the big screen.” Flashing a grin, he added, “So please, if you haven't done your makeup, do your makeup now.”


	One fan at the Wisconsin concert later posted on X that “zero couples” were shown on the big screens during that part of Saturday's performance.

	Following his bombshell revelation about the abuse he endured at Nickelodeon, Drake Bell is shedding more light on their “evil, corrupt” practices.


	The Drake & Josh alum recently opened up about the “flawed” system used to protect child actors' earnings, dispelling misconceptions that his time at the kids' network was as profitable as it seemed.


	“That's the perception of the world, it's always been this way,” he explained on The Unplanned Podcast. “It's like, you know, ‘Oh, you made a Folgers Coffee commercial. You must live in a mansion in Hollywood. Like, I saw you on TV. You're rich.'”

	Bell added, “That's far from the case. And especially, which is the bummer for most of us on Nickelodeon, we don't get residuals for our shows.”


	After starring alongside Josh Peck in the sitcom for its four-season run from 2004 to '07, Bell noted that the goal for most TV actors is getting to 100 episodes so they can get to syndication, which pays residuals. “That's where you make your money,” he said.


	“It's a lot of evil, corrupt people,” said Bell of the studio execs who take advantage of child actors. “That's the only thing, that is the answer. There's no other answer.”


	Despite Drake & Josh now streaming on Netflix and running marathons on multiple networks with major sponsors, Bell said he doesn't receive any residuals.

	











	“Do everything that they do to us mentally and emotionally, and then throw us to the wolves. And we're like, okay, cool. I got rent this month,” he mused. “There are three channels doing Drake & Josh marathons. Netflix just bought it, it's top 10 on Netflix, and I gotta figure out how to pay my rent this month.”


	Bell added, “And some fat cat with a cigar is just sitting up at the top of Viacom just … getting high on child labor.”


	In ID's docuseries Quiet on Set, which debuted last March, Bell spoke for the first time about the abuse he suffered from his Nickelodeon dialogue coach/manager Brian Peck, which began during his time on The Amanda Show and continued into Drake & Josh‘s run.


	Brian Peck was arrested in 2003 on 11 charges, including sodomy, lewd act upon a child 14 or 15 by a person 10 years older and oral copulation by anesthesia or controlled substance, receiving 16 months and prison and being required to register as a sex offender. Bell was never publicly identified as the minor until the docuseries.

It has been almost 20 years since Isaac Hayes left his voice role of Chef in “South Park.” And it has also been 17 years since Hayes died at the age of 65. Now, the legendary performer's son Isaac Hayes III has addressed the long-held rumor as to why exactly his father Hayes left the popular Comedy Central series.

It should first be noted that Hayes quit following the controversy regarding an episode that skewered Scientology entitled “Trapped in the Closet” (Season 9, Episode 12), in which Stan joins Scientology after recruiters say he is the reincarnation of church founder L. Ron Hubbard. Scientology has long tentacles in the entertainment industry, even more publicly so in 2005 when the episode aired. Famous members like Tom Cruise and John Travolta were sent up in the episode. Years later, during the podcast “Basic!,” “South Park” co-creator Matt Stone explained why the writers chose to spoof Scientology.

“Everyone knew Scientology was so litigious,” Stone said. “People in Hollywood were scared of Scientology at the time because they would just sue you. I think that got us going. The Tom Cruise episode was really about getting sued. I mean, poking openly litigious people and seeing where the line is and what you can say. They picked a fight with us and we just went with it.”

“South Park” voice actor Hayes, though, was a scientologist in real life. The fallout from “Trapped in the Closet,” his son says, is indeed the reason he quit “South Park”…but it was not his dad's choice.

“For over 14 years, people have speculated about why my father left ‘South Park.' I'm here to set the record straight. My dad did not quit ‘South Park.' Scientology did,” Isaac Hayes III wrote on X. “After the episode ‘Trapped in the Closet' aired in 2005, my father suffered a stroke just a few months later that left him unable to speak or make decisions on his own. He was not in any condition to resign from anything. The truth is, someone else within his Scientology circle made that decision and quit the show for him.”

In a 2016 THR piece, Hayes' son — also known as Ike Dirty — said, “At the time, everybody around my father was involved in Scientology — his assistants, the core group of people. So someone quit South Park on Isaac Hayes' behalf. We don't know who.”

In his Twitter post, Hayes III said that his father “loved being the voice of Chef” and that he greatly enjoyed meeting fans. “The narrative that he quit because he was offended by the satire is not true,” he wrote. “That was a cover story created by others. My father never got to speak for himself because his health robbed him of that chance. So now I am speaking for him. He did not leave ‘South Park' willingly. He was forced out by illness and by people who did not have his best interest at heart. This is for anyone who loved Chef. This is for anyone who admired my father's work. This is the truth about what really happened.”

Elsewhere, 'Jurassic World Rebirth' celebrates crossing $600 million worldwide, while new offerings 'I know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Smurfs' open to meh numbers.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


Superman has transformed into a bonafide crowd pleaser at the box office in a much-needed inaugural win for the Warner Bros.-owned DC Studios, which is run together by James Gunn — also the film's director — and producer Peter Safran.


	The big-budget tentpole was all but assured of staying atop the domestic box office in its second weekend, but estimates were all over the place as to how it would hold up.




	But, buoyed by strong word-of-mouth and reviews, it declined a less-than-expected 54 percent to $57.2 million for a pleasing 10-day domestic tally of $235 million through Sunday. That's a narrow decline for the struggling superhero genre and the same as Marvel's summer 2024 billion-dollar blockbuster Deadpool & Wolverine. Overseas — where the franchise has always faced challenges because of the comic book character's pro-American traits — Superman earned another $45.2 million for an international tally of $171.8 million and $406.8 globally in a major win for DC and Warners, which has passed up Disney to rank No. 1 in domestic marketshare for the year to date.

	The male-skewing superhero pic is facing fierce competition internationally from Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth and Apple Original Film's first box office hit, F1: The Movie. In a double win for Warners — which is assisting Apple in marketing and distributing the Formula One action-drama — F1 zoomed past $460 million at the worldwide box office over the weekend after finishing Sunday with a domestic total of $153.6 million domestically and $307.2 million overseas.

	After years of rival Marvel Studios largely dominating the superhero landscape, DC is smiling. In only its second weekend, Superman has already passed up the entire lifetime run of Marvel's Thunderbolts*, which topped out at $383 million globally earlier this year. And it's only days away from overtaking Marvel's other 2025 entry, Captain America: Brave New World, which earned a meek $415 million worldwide. 


Superman stars David Corenswet in the titular role, Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor. Rounding out the cast are Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen, Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard, Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner, Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho and Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific.


	Marvel hopes to begin to turn its fortunes around when Fantastic Four: First Steps hits theaters a week from now, on July 25. That means Superman only has a few days left to itself before facing direct competition, in addition to losing Imax screens and other premium-large format auditoriums to Fantastic Four, which is tracking to open to $100 million to $110 million domestically.


	Elsewhere at the box office, holdover Jurassic World Rebirth remained a powerful competitor in its third weekend as it crossed the $600 million milestone globally. It stayed safely parked in second place domestically with an estimated $23.4 million for a North American total of $276.2 million. Overseas, it came close to matching Superman in adding another $40.3 million to its coffers for a dino-mite foreign cume of $371.8 million and $647 million globally.

	











	Columbia and Screen Gem's R-rated horror reboot I know What You Did Last Summer came in third with an estimated $13 million, in line with modest expectations. (Rivals think it will come in slightly lower when Monday's actuals are released). Overseas, it launched to $11.6 million for a global start of $24.6 million.


	While Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Brande and Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise their roles from the original film and subsequent sequel, the new installment is anchored around a host of franchise newcomers, including Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon and Gabbriette Bechtel.


	Set three decades after the 1997 original film of the same name, the storyline — much as the first movie — follows a group of friends who try to cover up an accidental death for which they were responsible, only to find themselves being pursued by a menacing killer one year later. Soon, they turn to two survivors of the legendary Southport Massacre of 1997, played by Hewitt and Prinze.


Critics haven't exactly embraced the reboot, which currently has a 38 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences gave the film a C+ CinemaScore, which isn't unusual for a horror title. Its audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes is 68 percent.


	Paramount's Smurfs opened in fourth place with $11 million, in line with tepid expectations. It started off with $22.6 million overseas for a global total of $36 million, including $2.4 million earned last weekend in Australia.

	











	The animated family film likewise hasn't impressed reviewers — its RT critics' score is an even-worse 22 percent, but it did earn a B+ CinemaScore from moviegoers. The voice cast features an all-star lineup led by Rihanna in her first turn as a Smurf, followed by Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, Sandra Oh, Alex Winter, Billie Lourd, Maya Erskine, John Goodman, Kurt Russell and Jimmy Kimmel.


	Directed by Chris Miller, Smurfs is the first installment in the theatrical franchise in eight years. The music-infused movie follows Smurfette, played by Rihanna, leading a mission that takes them into the real world, including Paris, Munich and the Australian Outback, where the Smurfs meet up with feathered, Minion-like creatures named Snooterpoots. Their leader is voiced by Natasha Lyonne.


F1: The Movie, directed by Joseph Kosinski and Jerry Bruckheimer, rounded out the top five chart domestically with $9.6 million. The pic dropped a mere 26 percent in its fourth outing. Overseas, it earned another $29.5 million for a worldwide total of $460.8 million — a number no one could have imagined considering that Formula One movies haven't historically been an easy sell in the U.S. (although that's changing).


	A24 and filmmaker Ari Aster's divisive Western Eddington opened in sixth place domestically with $4.3 million, slightly behind expectations despite plenty of buzz and an all-star cast led by Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal.

When it comes to Hallmark and holidays, the gifts just keep on coming. Fans were treated to another surprise on July 19, 2025, as the network revealed Hallmark Channel superstars Lacey Chabert and Andrew Walker will reunite onscreen during the 16th annual Countdown to Christmas programming lineup. 

Hallmark Media announced their surprise movie “She's Making a List,” with a special promo featuring Chabert and Walker, who last co-starred in 2018's “My Secret Valentine.” Here's everything you need to know! 

The promo for “She's Making a List,” which aired during Hallmark Channel's Christmas in July premiere of “Unwrapping Christmas: Lily's Destiny,” marked the second weekend in a row that Walker took fans by surprise with an unexpected movie reveal. 

One week earlier, Hallmark thrilled fans with the news that Walker, Tyler Hynes, and Paul Campbell will return with a third movie in their beloved “Three Wise Men” franchise, also slated to premiere during the 2025 holiday season. 

Walker will begin filming that movie in mid-August, but has spent part of July in Vancouver with Chabert filming “She's Making a List,” her 16th Hallmark Christmas movie and their first holiday title together. 

The duo had been hoping to reunite onscreen, even suggesting ideas to executives, Walker told EntertainmentNow, unaware that Hallmark was already working on finding the right script and timing for the two to come back together. 

According to the movie's logline, “When Naughty or Nice inspector Isabel Haynes (Chabert) is assigned to evaluate mischievous 11-year-old Charlie Duncan, she expects a routine case. But things get complicated when Isabel unexpectedly falls for Charlie's widowed father, Jason Duncan (Walker), and begins to question the rigid rules of her job. As Christmas approaches, Isabel must choose between following the holiday algorithm or following her heart.”

“This movie is really, really great,” Walker told EntertainmentNow. “It's an amazing concept — like ‘Men in Black' meets Christmas.” 

Jennifer Kramer, Vice President of Programming at Hallmark Media, said in a statement, “Bringing Lacey Chabert and Andrew Walker together for their first-ever Hallmark Christmas movie is a dream come true for our fans. ‘She's Making a List' captures the heart, humor, and holiday magic our viewers love, and we can't wait to share this unforgettable story with them this season.”

Although Walker and Chabert have remained friends, slipping back into work mode to film together after seven years has been a breeze, Walker told EntertainmentNow. 

Walker said that although Chabert is such a huge star and the undisputed “Queen of Christmas” at Hallmark, “She doesn't get affected by it at all. She's almost, like, innocent about it. Her whole life is her daughter and her family, and it's just a beautiful thing to be around.”

In a statement via Hallmark, Chabert said, “Reuniting with Andrew after all these years to do our first Christmas movie together is such a joy. Andrew brings so much heart, humor, and warmth to every role, and working with him again felt like coming home. I am thrilled to do this one together…finally.”

In addition to “She's Making a List,” Chabert also has several other Hallmark projects in the coming months, including a second season of her unscripted series “Celebrations With Lacey Chabert,” and “Haul Out the Halloween,” the third movie in her popular “Haul Out the Holly” franchise.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM WRITETHRU: DC Studios and Warner Bros' Superman has landed atop a second weekend of $57.2M, which catapults the Burbank, CA lot to the top of the studio domestic box office with $1.32 billion, higher than Disney/20th Century Studios' $1.27 billion for the period of Jan. 1-July 20. Again, Disney is bound to reclaim the top spot next weekend with the $100M-plus opening of Fantastic Four: First Steps, however, the works of Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy as Warner Bros Motion Picture Group Chairs, and the revamped DC Studios, are paying off. 


	Warners has also had six movies open to No. 1 more than any other studio this year with nine weekend at No. 1. They've also had five movies in a row bow to $45M+, a first for any studio. Also, Warner Bros. has had more $10M+ grossing days this year more than any other studio (as of today Warner Bros has 34 days of films grossing over $10). 

	











Superman‘s second weekend ease is -54%, a second weekend percentile decline on par with Deadpool & Wolverine, and better than the second weekend superhero holds we've seen YTD, Thunderbolts (-56%) and Captain America: Brave New World (-68%). Imax auditoriums delivered another $7.2M (13% of weekend 2) for a running cume of $32.8M. Running ten-day cume on Gunn's Superman is $235M. 


			Watch on Deadline		







	Word of mouth remains excellent with continued Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak polling showing a high definite recommend at 74%, with parents at 70% and kids under 12 at 65%. Warners is having a great weekend overall, the fourth weekend of Apple Original Films' F1 is only down -26%.


	Also, let's give props to Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth: The Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey, Mahershala Ali movie posted a 3rd weekend ease of -42%, the best third weekend hold for any Jurassic World movie with a 3-day of $23.4M. Previously, 2015's Jurassic World had a third weekend hold of -49%. 


	Overall weekend for all titles before Fantastic Four: First Steps gives the summer box office another bump is $135.2M, which is -9% off from a year ago when Twisters opened to $81.2M.

	











	The new stuff isn't really impressive…


	Despite any heralding of profit by Sony on I Know What You Did Last Summer with a net production cost of $18M, $13M opening isn't a win. It doesn't indicate any kind of revived interest in this '90s fave property. Some rivals are betting the movie comes in lower, like $12M, but the reboot 27 years later after its previous sequel is bound for the lowest opening in the theatrical pic franchise. That's not the grand B.O. plan when it comes to reviving these classic horror IPs. Sony was richer in their reboot of 28 Years Later debuting to $30M, and with a current running total of $68.7M. Snarked one film finance source about Summer, “It didn't feel like there was any stickiness in the marketing materials.” Overall social media universe reach was 196.8M, which was even below Sinners‘ 222M and under the original M3GAN‘s 330M reach. In regards to CinemaScore, I Know What You Did Last Summer gets a C+, the lowest in the series next to the 1997 original's B-, and the 1998 sequel's B. Sure, a sequel can be pulled off at a low cost, but with a depreciating scale of grosses.


	Says social media monitor RelishMix, “negative chatter on the new I Know What You Did Last Summer is filled with critiques and doubts. Since this feature-length revival comes not even four years after the television adaptation of the franchise, some are quick to judge its quality: ‘Looks like the TV series, which was awful,' and ‘This looks like a straight to streaming movie. It does not look like it was meant for the theater. It reminds me of the Scream TV show that aired on MTV.' Even the return of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. falls short of satisfying fans, ‘Bringing back aged old casts feels cliché. I just knew they would do this. Another movie that no one asked for. Original version always is better.'” 


	Low definite recommend on Summer at 43%. 50/50 male to female showed up. Demo breakdown is men over 25 (36%), female over 25 (30%), female under 25 (20%), and men under 25 (14%). Sixty-one percent 18-34 turnout. Even cash flow across the country, but South is the best. AMC Grove in LA is the highest cinema for the pic with $34K through Saturday. Few PLFs on Summer since they're staying with the Man of Steel.


	Paramount Animation's Smurfs is coming in lower at $11M. Though down from yesterday's $12M forecast, it's still better than expected as some feared the blue guys and gal would get crushed in the high single digits. Again, it's an international and consumer products play. No one was going into this thinking they were going to re-invent the wheel and soar these grosses into some rebooted stratosphere. It's a very old property (gosh, 1980s?) sans the coolness of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The first movie in pre-streaming 2011 opened to $35.6M (and finaled at north of $142M+) — because at that time there had never been a Smurfs movie before. The movie cost a net $58M before P&A. The Rihanna-starring Smurfs gets a B+, which is the lowest CinemaScore in the series of four films to date. The previous one, The Lost Village, received the franchise's only A grade. 


	How to make Smurfs cool again? That's the big question. It's hard to Dave Filoni this property. One could try to make it edgier for boys. Even in at their height in the 1980s, the Smurfs were embraced and then faced backlash like any other long-running it property. 

	











	There's a big reach on social with Smurfs at 309M across Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube with “Rihanna fully activated and cross-promoting her beauty brand, feeding 420M fans and pumping materials along with Nick Offerman at 3.4M fans with other cast not activated.” Rihanna has also been a trooper showing up to do extensive press at the pic's Belgian premiere and LA fan event.


	Definite recommend at 50% isn't a rush. Per Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak, 59% of the audience are parents with a child and mostly moms at 73%. Younger-skewing property for kids, as we told you and PostTrak shows that with 68% under 9 years old (47% between 7-9). Mostly girls here at 61%. Female leaning at 61%. Under 35 is 69%. Kids under 12 gave the movie an 80% positive, with a low 44% must-see right away. Grosses are evenly spread throughout the country but best in East, South and South Central. AMC MJ Harlem is the leading cinema stateside with $22K through Saturday.


	Diversity demos are 47% Caucasian, 29% Latino and Hispanic, 13% Black, and 4% Asian American.


	Ari Aster's Eddington gets a C+, which is the same grade as the director's Midsommar. Definite recommend on PostTrak is 39%. Aster loves being divisive. The opening per A24 $4.25M after a first day/previews of $1.88M. Midsommar, a genre movie, posted a 3-day of $6.5M in what was a $10.9M 5-day start. Hereditary with a D+ CinemaScore remains Aster's best opening at $13.5M. The wow here given Eddington‘s mash-up of two genres –70s Altman comedy and Rambo— is that it's guns-a-blazing ahead of Aster and Joaquin Phoenix's previous partnership, Beau Is Afraid which died with a $2.66M semi-wide break at 965 theaters, and $8.1M domestic gross. Seriously, coming away from the pic's premiere at Cannes, the sentiment felt Eddington was destined for the B.O. nightmares of Beau Is Afraid (that VFX filled movie carried at net production cost of $35M; we've heard gross is as high as $50M). The movie is playing on the coasts, which is no surprise, with AMC Burbank the highest grossing venue for the movie with just over $33K though last night. Demo breakdown is men over 25 (46%), women over 25 (27%), men under 25 (15%) and women under 25 (11%). 18-34 turnout is 60%. Who loves this movie? Per PostTrak 13-17 year olds (2% turnout, 80% grade) and 35-44 year olds (44% showed up, 79% positive grade). Diversity demos are 61% Caucasian, 18% Latino and Hispanic, 8% Black, and 8% Asian American.

FRIDAY PM: Not a gangbusters weekend, but solid enough to make exhibition content. Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman is looking at $16M, -71%, in its second Friday, for what's looking to be a $55M second weekend at 4,275 theaters, for a decline on the high-end that's in the -56% realm. Worldwide all in by Sunday is looking like $400M. 


	Matt Reeves' The Batman fell -50% in weekend 2 for a $66.5M take, while James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 eased -56% for a $65.2M second weekend. On the high side, Superman will stand at $232.7M by Sunday end of day. 


	Standing strong above the new stuff in second is Universal's third weekend of Jurassic World Rebirth with $21.5M at 3,854. The Gareth Edwards directed movie dips -47% with a running cume by Sunday of $274.2M. 


	Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems I Know What You Did Last Summer is seeing just under $6M today for what's hoped to be a $13M-$15M opening at 3,206 sites. Rivals believe it's in a fight for third with Paramount Animation's Smurfs which is seeing $4M today at 3,504 locations, and a $12M 3-day. The last one under Sony, 2017's Smurfs: The Lost Village opened to $13.2M. Smurfs is a much younger skewing movie among kids under 12. The IP always does better abroad, and the upside for those studios getting involved with the property is the share of the merchandise revs.  Paramount Global is handling the consumer products licensing for the Smurfs in most international territories including North America. 


I Know What You Did Last Summer 1 back in 1997 opened to $15.8M, while party 2 in 1998 debuted to $16.5M. That's unadjusted for inflation. 


	Apple Original Films' F1 is seeing a fourth Friday of $2.6M at 3,094 theaters, and 3-day of $9.4M, -28%, for a running cume of $153.4M. 


	A24's Eddington at 2,111 sites is looking at $1.9M today and $4.5M for the weekend. That's under what another Cannes premiere, Wes Anderson's Phoenician Scheme, did in its wide break at 1,678, $6.2M at 1,678. Eddington cost $25M net shot with New Mexico tax credits, which is under the reported $30M that Focus Features shelled out for Phoenician Scheme. 


FRIDAY AM: Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems' reboot of I Know What You Did Last Summer banked $2.2 million in previews from showtimes that began at 2 p.m. Thursday, while A24's Ari Aster socio-political Western Eddington did $625,000.


	Neither film, nor Paramount Animation's Smurfs, is expected to over swell with Warner Bros/DC Studios' Superman still a fortress atop the box office chart with an expected second weekend of $55M-$60M, after the James Gunn movie ended its first week with $177.7M. Superman is pacing ahead of the first week of Matt Reeves' The Batman by 3% ($172.5M, final domestic $369.3M), 16% ahead of Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($152.7M first week, $359M final domestic) and 3% behind the first week of GOTG Vol. 2 ($183.1M, final domestic $389.3M).


I Know What You Did Last Summer is eyeing around $13M+, while Smurfs is anywhere in the high single digits to low teens. Eddington is expected to land in the under-$5M range.


	The Jennifer Kaytin Robinson-directed I Know What You Did Last Summer counts previews that are higher than Blumhouse/Universal's Wolf Man ($1.4M previews, $10.8M opening) from earlier this year, and 62% less than Sony's reboot of 28 Years Later ($5.8M previews, $30M opening). Critics have settled at 38% Rotten on I Know What You Did Last Summer while the Rotten Tomatoes audience meter is at 69%. That latter score is the best in franchise, ahead of the original 1997 installment at 41% and the 1998 sequel at 29%.

	











	The 1997 movie, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and the late Anne Heche, opened to $15.8M and legged out to $72.5M domestic, $125.5M worldwide. The 1998 sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer debuted to $16.5M and ended its run at $40M. The movies made $165M combined. The third movie, I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer starring Brooke Nevin, went direct to home video in 2006. The new installment features the return of Hewitt and Prinze Jr alongside newcomers Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon and Gabbriette Bechtel.


Eddington‘s critical score stands at 66%, which is under the 90% certified fresh of Aster's horror opus Hereditary, and his Swedish solstice genre pic run amok Midsommar (83% certified fresh), and 2 points under his trippy Joaquin Phoenix pic Beau Is Afraid (68% fresh).


Smurfs didn't hold previews last night.


	The rest of the week:


	1.) Superman (WB) 4,135 theaters Thu $10.9M (-7% from Wed) Week $177.7M/Wk 1 


	2.) Jurassic World Rebirth (Uni) 4,324 theaters, Thu $4.2M (-6% from Wed), Week $60.6M  (-56%), Total $252.7M/Wk 2

Only 406 million worldwide for Superman and in a few days Fantastic Four will take over multiplexes worldwide.

This movie will top out sub 500 million.

No it won't, it had this weekend to achieve that and it fell short.

Exactly people were saying its gonna pass 500 by the second weekend and close with 1billion. I think all the negative spewed towards synder and MoS its gonna fall short of closing 600

Superman is certainly no bomb, but looks to be underperforming 

Decent hold but with no major new competition, it better.  JW had Superman launch in week 2, Disney decided to give Supes and FF a break in Supes week 2.   Next week likely a bigger decline and the movie starts to fade.Unless FF bombs after week 1.

I still can't believe that people think $600 million worldwide for Superman is a good thing.

Especially considering that Man of Steel made $670 million 12 years ago. Adjusted for inflation, it's around $900 million, meaning about 33% less people will see Superman in theaters than saw Man of Steel in theaters.

Let the Snyderverse go. It's dead and it ain't coming back.

Only people without arguments try to disqualify facts by bringing something that has no relation to the conversation.

I still can't believe how many posts you've made about SUPERMAN's box office. Why are you so obsessed with this?

They really do seem obsessed.

Says another obsessed guy.

The best analogy I've heard regarding Superman and what it ‘needs' to do is comparing it to Batman Begins.

A reboot coming off the heels of a franchise that flamed out in dramatic fashion, lost interest from movie goers, and some questioning if the whole thing could ever recover. Superman has to win back audiences after Black Adam, Shazaam 2, and The Flash were the collective final nails in the coffin for the DCEU. Batman Begins had to win back audiences after Batman and Robin, a movie to this day still considered by many to be one of the worst comic book movies of all time (debatable, but not without some merit).

Batman Begins was a modest success, but it was no blockbuster. Audience and critic reviews were glowing, however, so it's modest financial success combined with great reviews earned it the sequel that everyone threw all of their money at. I think WB/DC is trying to recapture that moment; Superman is damage control, just like Batman Begins was, and it's main job is to generate interest in a rebooted DCU. That, combined with a ‘good enough' box office, would achieve that, if history repeats itself.

Imagine comparing superman with batman begins, you are getting desperate trying to find ways to spin this flop into a success.

All you people are saying now are excuses, six months ago you said it was going to be the film of the year and now you're trying to spin this as a first step in the right direction, the truth is that you don't want to admit you were wrong.

James Gunn is no Christopher Nolan.

That's what Begins had. A good director, flanked by good actors.

And it was dark. And brooding.

This Superman reboot is literally a joke. I think Gunn did it on purpose. There's no way he actually thought it was good.

Yet, this is the third time they've unsuccessfully tried to reboot Superman…So there's that.

Yeah this is a solid base hit. It's well liked and will make money. It's not a home run, and to extend the baseball analogy to really score the follow up hitters will have to do their jobs. Are Supergirl and Clayface upto the task? We'll see.

Exactly.

Say it louder so the trolls in the comments section finally understand.

“Happy Gilmore 2,” set to drop on Netflix July 25, almost had one more cast member from the original film included: Carl Weathers — who played Derick “Chubbs” Peterson, the sage handless pro golfer who meets an unfortunate end. Weathers, though, died at the age of 76 on February 1, 2024. The movie did not begin shooting until later that year.

“We had a painful change. Carl Weathers had a massive part,” Sandler said in an interview with Collider. “I would talk to Carl, and we were excited, and then Carl passed away. We had to rewrite a lot of the stuff, and even what the story was. We made a lot of nice references to how great Chubbs was in the movie. That was the biggest change.”

In the initial drafts of the “Happy Gilmore 2” story, Chubbs played an integral role in the plot. “In the first version that we came up with, he had a son. He was coming back to me a lot in my dreams, and he had a son who was mad at Happy for causing the death of daddy,” Sandler explained.

 










When filming the first “Happy Gilmore” — released in 1996 — Weathers suffered a real-life injury, leading him to deal with back issues for the rest of his life.

“I didn't tell anyone because, you know, I'm tough, man,” the “Rocky” actor told GQ in 2020. “Yeah I hurt my back and actually, to this day, it still really bothers me, because it was right on the spine.”

Weathers said the accident happened during a “blind fall” stunt. “There are stunt bags, which, maybe are like two feet tall. But the bag wasn't pushed all the way against the wall, so when I went out backwards instead of hitting something flat, my body kind of got trapped, my head on the bags, and my tailbone at the wall, and so it just would crunch on the spine. I felt the pain and the burning sensation immediately,” he recalled. “But again, I'm an athlete, I'm tough, I'm an actor, let's keep going. And after about three or more of those, I said, ‘No more of that.'”

	The Erie Moon Mammoths, a minor league baseball team rebranded by John Oliver and his Last Week Tonight staff, made their debut Saturday to a record-setting crowd that included Oliver in attendance.


	Back in May, during a segment about minor league baseball teams and their frequent crowd-drawing promotions, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals about why they deserved a rebrand; nearly 50 teams sent in proposals, with Oliver ultimately opting for the Erie SeaWolves, as that Pennsylvania team and Detroit Tigers affiliate played nowhere near a sea. 


	“Erie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,” Oliver said Saturday during a pregame press conference (via The Associated Press) before serving as the game's bat boy and “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” singer. 


	“There was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.”

	Just over two months later, the Erie Moon Mammoths — named after George Moon, an Erie man who discovered mammoth bones while scuba diving in nearby Lake Pleasant in 1991 — played their first game Saturday to an attendance of 7,070 people, the largest crowd in UPMC Park's history.


	George Moon was also on hand to catch Oliver's ceremonial first pitch. “It's fun. I'm enjoying it,” Moon said. “From all those years ago to today, I would never have thought anything like this would've been possible. The newspaper did something on its 30th anniversary [in 2021]. Other than that, I haven't heard much.”

	











	SeaWolves president Greg Coleman told the AP that, in the three weeks since the Moon Mammoths' rebrand was announced, the team has sold four years' worth of merchandise in their online store, and lines formed at the on-site team store.

	Despite their popularity, the Moon Mammoths will revert back to the SeaWolves for most games — this is just a minor league promotion, after all — but the Oliver-branded team will play three more times this season, Aug. 19 and Sept. 12 and 13. Moon Mammoths games are also planned for the 2026 season.


	“I love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,” Oliver said. “It felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That's a bad decision, and it's that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.”

	On Friday morning, May 2, 2025, supporters of Washington Senate Bill 5375 were ushered through the massive concrete arches, and up the grand staircases of the Washington State Capitol — the veins of Alaskan Tokeen marble guiding them past oil portraits and century-old busts — to the governor's conference room on the second floor. 


	Inside, amid the dark wood paneling and gleaming seal of the state, Washington's new Governor and former Attorney General Bob Ferguson addressed the small crowd of advocates, lawmakers, and child abuse survivors who had gathered behind him. 


	“I'm a Catholic as some of you know. I'm aware of my upbringing,” he said, before adding plainly: “For me this is very clear legislation and important legislation.”


	Ferguson uncapped a blue felt-tip Paper Mate and, with the stroke of the pen, signed into law one of the most consequential child protection measures in recent memory, mandating the state's clergy — for the first time in 50 years — to report child abuse.

	











	“The room felt like it was buzzing,” recalls Sara Young, an advocate who was there that morning. She grew up one of Jehovah's Witnesses, surviving years of abuse she says congregation elders ignored. “None of us really knew what to expect, but being there felt like a weight finally lifted.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	For supporters like Young, it closed a loophole that let clergy across denominations keep abuse in the dark. For opponents, it was an attack on religious freedom with no exception for sacred rites like confession.

	











	In that moment, Ferguson closed the door on a battle two decades in the making — and opened another. When the room cleared that morning, no one — not even Ferguson — could have predicted just how quickly the law's challengers would mobilize.


	Within 72 hours, Trump's Justice Department, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, had launched a First Amendment probe into what it called an “anti-Catholic” law.


	The Archdiocese of Seattle, along with the dioceses of Yakima and Spokane, filed a federal lawsuit — Etienne v. Ferguson — claiming the new law was a punch thrown straight at the Catholic Church; that it forces priests to choose between obeying the state or violating a core religious duty.

	Then, on June 23, the U.S. Department of Justice formally threw its weight behind the Catholic Church, filing a formal motion to intervene in the case — a request that was granted on Tuesday.


	And on Friday, Judge David G.  Estudillo issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the new law “as to the Sacrament of Confession” for the Seattle, Yakima, and Spokane dioceses, days before its July 27 effective date.


	What began as a move to close a dangerous loophole exploded into a high-stakes national fight over the limits of religious liberty: whether the First Amendment allows church doctrine to overrule secular law when the two conflict. 


	At its core, this battle turns on a crucial question the courts — and now the country — are forced to confront: Where does religious freedom end and the duty to protect children begin?


	Under Washington's new child protection law, clergy of all denominations are on the hook, just like physicians, nurses, social workers, teachers, law enforcement officers, childcare providers, and others.

	The law does not force priests to testify in court, turn over notes, or violate attorney-client privilege. What it does is narrow but consequential: If clergy learn about child abuse — even during confession — they have to notify authorities within 48 hours.


	That single requirement closes a loophole most states still leave wide open. 


	Across the U.S., child abuse reporting laws are a fragmented patchwork shaped by decades of political compromise and religious lobbying. Over the past two decades, efforts in other states — such as Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, and Wisconsin — to remove the clergy-penitent exemption have routinely stalled long before any high-profile showdown.

	











	Technically, clergy in all 50 states, D.C., and Guam are mandatory reporters of child abuse. But 33 states carve out exemptions for what is learned in confession or spiritual counseling.


	Washington now joins just six other states — including some of the most religiously conservative in the country — that take exemptions for clergy off the table completely: New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, and West Virginia.


	But even where states have laws like this on paper, enforcement is often a dead end. That's because 36 states have either their own Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRAs) or constitutional provisions requiring “strict scrutiny” for laws that burden religious practice. In those states, mandatory reporting rules that reach the confessional are nearly impossible to enforce. In much of the country, that means a priest or pastor can legally keep abuse secret if it's disclosed in a privileged setting.


	Washington has no state-level RFRA, but its constitution has at times been interpreted to demand strict scrutiny for religious freedom claims. That lack of certainty around religious exemptions — and specifically, confession — is part of what has made Washington's new law so contested. 


	For Catholics, the confessional isn't just private counseling; it's a foundational sacrament. . Behind the screen, a parishioner quietly confesses what weighs on their soul: “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.” The priest listens, counsels, prescribes a penance, and offers absolution. Known as Reconciliation, the rite is essential for spiritual life: Without it, believers cannot receive the Eucharist, the Church's central act of worship.


	In a public statement titled “Clergy: Answerable to God or the State?” Seattle Archbishop Paul D. Etienne — the lead plaintiff in the Church's lawsuit against Washington — invoked canon law, the Church's legal code, which deems the confessional seal “inviolable” and makes breaking it a crime. He warned plainly that any priest who violated it to report child abuse would face expulsion from the Church.


	Unlike abusing a child, breaking the seal triggers latae sententiae: automatic excommunication. 


	“You know, Jesus talks about protecting children at Matthew 18:6,” says Hiram Sasser, executive general counsel at First Liberty Institute, the legal group representing the Archdiocese of Seattle. He cites the verse in which Jesus warns that anyone who causes a child to stumble should have a millstone hung around their neck and be thrown into the sea. “They're not seeking the same level of exemption that lawyers are provided in the law,” he says of the Catholic Church. “If they did, I would probably not want to participate in representing them, because I think those things are important. The only exception we're seeking is just for the Sacrament of Confession.”

	











	But not so for the Trump DOJ, who are advancing a far more sweeping argument that goes for the law's jugular. 


	By filing a formal complaint, the Department of Justice is effectively teaming up with Washington's Catholic bishops to overturn the state's mandatory reporting law, in one of the most aggressive federal moves to back organized religion in recent memory. 


	“Laws that explicitly target religious practices such as the Sacrament of Confession have no place in our society,” said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's civil rights division, in a June 23 press release. 


	It's a stark divide. The bishops frame this as a limited fight to protect the sacred Catholic rite of confession. The DOJ sees something much bigger: a sweeping threat to religious liberty for everyone. While the Church asks for a surgical carveout, the feds want the whole law gone, putting all clergy back in the clear with no duty to report abuse.


	In its complaint, the DOJ argues that Washington's law unfairly singles out clergy while letting secular professions, such as therapists and lawyers, keep similar confidentiality intact.


	But that comparison only goes so far.


	Attorney–client privilege is not a blanket of secrecy granted out of deference to the profession; it's a rule designed to protect the legal system. Clients must be able to speak freely with their lawyers to ensure fair trials — an instrumental privilege serving the public interest, not the lawyer's. Psychotherapist–patient privilege, likewise, is structured to encourage patients to disclose sensitive personal information essential for effective treatment. Moreover, in most states including Washington, licensed therapists are mandatory reporters, legally required to report suspected child abuse. Both privileges are regulated by the state, enforced through licensing boards, and bound by explicit ethical rules. 


	Clergy, by contrast, are unlicensed and unregulated. Their claim to absolute confidentiality has historically existed outside any formal system of oversight, creating a space where institutional interests can override the protection of children — and where intimate knowledge of parishioners can be abused by those in power.


	Still, beyond defending the confessional seal itself, the Catholic Church claims its internal reforms place it a step ahead of the state when it comes to protecting children, so they do not need more oversight.

	











	After The Boston Globe's 2002 “Spotlight” investigation, and other explosive reporting exposed widespread sexual abuse and cover-ups, the Catholic Church was forced to confront a crisis of its own making. In response, it rolled out a slate of reforms it argues are proof of serious change. 


	The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops now maintains the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People, which includes independent audits, lay oversight boards, and national policies requiring clergy and lay staff to report suspected abuse.


	Additionally, the dioceses of Seattle, Spokane, and Yakima emphasize that priests are instructed to counsel suspected abusers or victims to come forward outside of confession, where mandated reporting can occur. They note that all three dioceses have undergone third-party audits and have supported mandatory reporting laws, provided confession is off limits, according to court documents.


	But investigations show these self-imposed safeguards have repeatedly failed to prevent continued cover-up — not just in Washington, but nationwide.


	A 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury report found more than 300 Catholic priests abused over 1,000 identifiable children in six dioceses over 70 years, with thousands more likely uncounted. The grand jury documented church leaders persuading victims not to report, pressuring law enforcement to drop investigations, and systematically reassigning accused priests to new parishes without warning communities. Among the most egregious cases were a priest raping a girl in the hospital after a tonsillectomy, another impregnating a minor and arranging her abortion, and coordinated diocesan instructions to call rape “inappropriate contact” and conceal removals as “sick leave.” The investigation revealed diocesan “secret archives” tracking abuse allegations, internal church lawyers shielding records, and tactics explicitly designed to “avoid scandal,” while senior church officials who enabled cover-ups retained their posts or advanced in rank. 


	A 2019 Associated Press investigation found more than 900 clergy across the U.S. credibly accused of child sexual abuse who were missing from diocesan and religious order disclosure lists, exposing major gaps in the Church's promised transparency nationwide.

	











	The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' internal audits reveal serious gaps. Annual compliance reviews — funded and overseen by the bishops themselves — depend heavily on diocesan self-reporting and have repeatedly flagged failures to fully implement safeguards. Survivors and advocates argue the system prioritizes restoring public credibility over real accountability, leaving secular authorities sidelined. In their landmark 2004 report, the U.S. bishops' national review board acknowledged that “in the past, secrecy has created an atmosphere that has inhibited the healing process and, in some cases, enabled sexually abusive behavior to be repeated.”


	While the Catholic Church has made efforts at reform, its track record offers a case study in the limits of institutional self-regulation, especially when the institution in question controls its own transparency, discipline, and accountability.


	It's a problem that extends well beyond Catholicism, playing out across the broader faith landscape.


Etienne v. Ferguson hinges on the argument that Washington's law imposes special burdens on Catholic clergy that do not apply equally to other religions. “Because the Catholic Church is one of the few religious organizations with a doctrine of absolute confidentiality,” the complaint asserts, Washington's law “uniquely targets and burdens Catholic priests.” 


	But central to the push for reform as Washington's new mandatory reporting law moved through the legislature was evidence of how clergy-penitent privilege had been exploited in other faith communities.


	Advocates argued that scrapping the clergy reporting exemption wasn't about picking on any one faith, but leveling the playing field — making sure every religious institution, no matter how powerful, must play by the same rules when it comes to protecting children.


	Court records show Jehovah's Witnesses — who have insisted for decades that they maintain no clergy-laity distinction — have nevertheless invoked the Catholic-rooted exemption broadly to protect internal conversations related to abuse allegations challenged in court. Not just direct confessions, but discussions with congregation elders, legal advisors, and staff at their global headquarters. 


	“Even though Jehovah's Witnesses do not apply the term ‘clergy' to elders in a religious context, the legal definition of ‘clergy' is far more inclusive,” says Jarrod Lopes, national spokesman for Jehovah's Witnesses. He notes that elders routinely share information about abuse allegations among themselves and with the denomination's headquarters, arguing that this kind of internal communication is essential. “Nothing in the Bible or the beliefs and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses prevents elders from internally sharing those details confidentially to ensure that children are protected,” he adds. 

	











	The religious organization of more than 9 million works within a structured framework of policies that guide how abuse allegations are investigated and handled within the congregation. They are largely internal, even in cases involving serious misconduct.


	A striking example comes from Caekaert v. Watchtower, a 2020 case in Montana, where elders in congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses investigated allegations of child sexual abuse, interrogated the accused, documented his confession in detail, and sent those records to the denomination's New York headquarters. Plaintiffs argued the records shouldn't be protected as confidential clergy communication because several elders were involved and the details were sent to the church's headquarters, but the court disagreed. It ruled that under Montana law, such internal handling of abuse allegations — however extensive — fell within the scope of the church's established religious practice and thus remained protected by clergy privilege. 


	The decision effectively shielded even confessions of abuse from discovery, setting a precedent where institutional secrecy could be maintained so long as it was formalized as religious protocol. The Montana case ended in a settlement, but the organization's legal strategy hasn't escaped scrutiny: Philip Brumley, a longtime general counsel for Jehovah's Witnesses, was sanctioned over $150,000 for submitting affidavits that falsely claimed the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses had no role in Montana congregations during the years when abuse occurred. A federal judge called his declarations “reckless and misleading,” finding they delayed justice in child sexual abuse cases.


	Across the country, other faiths have invoked clergy privilege to keep abuse hidden behind closed doors.


	In Arizona, the state Supreme Court let LDS bishops withhold evidence after a man who'd confessed to abusing his daughters continued for years. In California, Scientology fought court orders to release thousands of internal records, arguing that narrow clergy-penitent laws unfairly favored Catholic-style confessions over its multi-minister approach.


	What began as a limited protection for the intimacy of confession has morphed into a sprawling legal shield used to protect the pulpit, not the pews. And the more deeply religious institutions embed confidentiality into their doctrine, the stronger their legal insulation becomes, even when abuse is undisputed and dozens of individuals are involved. 

	











	This mounting evidence — how other faith communities exploited clergy-penitent privilege to circumvent reporting child abuse — is what drove Washington toward reform. 


	In 2022, Seattle investigative journalist Wilson Criscione dug into allegations of child sexual abuse within Washington State congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses. The result was an incendiary exposé for InvestigateWest that uncovered not only a decades-long pattern of child sexual abuse, but a coordinated effort to conceal it. 


	Criscione's story revealed that in cases of alleged abuse, congregation elders follow an internal playbook; standard protocol baked into the organization's internal policies that often bypasses law enforcement. 


	“When an elder in a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses becomes aware of an allegation of abuse, he has been instructed to immediately contact Watchtower's Legal Department for advice regarding the law in the state where he lives,” says Lopes, the national spokesperson for Jehovah's Witnesses. “We consider obeying the laws of the land as an extension of obeying and worshipping God.” 


	Lopes says they monitor the most current versions of all mandatory reporting laws in the United States.


	But in many cases, Criscione found, elders were explicitly instructed to withhold reports unless secular law demanded it. In Washington, there was no such mandate. Decades earlier, lawmakers had quietly removed clergy from the list of mandatory reporters, creating a legal blind spot that allowed for decades of silence.


	Criscione's reporting caught the attention of Mary Lou Dickerson, a former Democratic state representative from Seattle. Two decades earlier, she had spent years trying to bridge the gap Criscione's article exposed. 


	In 2005, Dickerson had introduced legislation that would have required clergy to report suspected child abuse. A lapsed Catholic who left the church in the mid-1960s, Dickerson holds a Master's in social work and considered herself one of the few true child advocates in the legislature at the time. 


	Still, she felt she was no match for the political muscle of the Seattle Archdiocese.


	“It felt to me like the Catholic Church was using its political power — and really strongly — to oppose that bill,” she says. “They unloaded all they could against it, and they were instrumental in its defeat.”


	Years later, her determination was reignited. Though she'd been retired from state politics for more than a decade, she picked up the phone.

	











	“She called me and said, ‘Hey, you should know, I worked on this, and I'd love to see you take it up,'” says state Sen. Noel Frame, a survivor of child sexual abuse, who now represents the same district Dickerson once did.


	What followed was a three-year legislative battle to finish what Dickerson had started, and to pull Washington — long a national outlier — into the modern era of child protection. 


	Frame now found herself, like Dickerson decades before, squared off against one of Washington's — and in fact the nation's — most urgent constitutional tests: balancing the First Amendment with the state's secular mission to safeguard its most vulnerable. 


	Following the landmark 1962 Kempe Report on battered children, states rapidly passed child abuse reporting laws, often with federal nudges. The law that took shape in Washington was updated in 1971 to mandate reporting by clergy.


	But in 1975, lawmakers quietly cut clergy from the mandatory reporter list during a special session, burying it in a larger legislative overhaul without debate or notice. Why remains a legal ghost story of a critical safeguard undone in silence, but the change held for five decades.


	When attempts were made to update this law in 2023, Washington's framework had become not just an outlier, but among the most permissive in the country — the only state to go backward from clergy being mandated reporters (in 1971) to being removed (in 1975), and then never restored. 


	On paper, the law divided lawmakers along predictable party lines. But behind closed doors, it forced unexpected reckonings, especially for those caught between political identity, religious tradition, and the duty to protect children. 


	In 2023 and 2024, the bill bounced between chambers as lawmakers fought over clergy privilege. It first passed the Senate with a confession carveout, but the House removed it after abuse survivors and advocates highlighted the risks. The Senate rejected the change. Despite repeated negotiations, the two sides couldn't agree for over a year.


	That year, lawmakers attempted a sleight-of-hand fix, drafting a “limited” privilege that protected only Catholic confession while excluding other religions, such as Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons. 


	This version of the bill gained broad bipartisan support, and even a nod of approval from the Seattle Archdiocese itself.


	In an email obtained by Rolling Stone, Jean Welch Hill, the newly appointed head of the Washington State Catholic Conference, told amendment backers the Conference “would not oppose you moving forward with your amendments,” but added a caution: “please do not reference the WSCC or Archdiocese in any public statements regarding support or opposition.”

	











	Neither the WSCC nor Hill responded to requests for comment.


	But Catholic survivors who testified in the House torched it as a carveout designed to protect the very institution that had hurt them. 


	Facing no path to Senate concurrence, the bill died in committee. 


	Meanwhile, then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson opened a probe into the Archdiocese's handling of abuse allegations, suing to enforce subpoenas for internal records — a case still on appeal.


	This year, as lawmakers pushed again to make clergy mandatory reporters, Catholic lobbyists descended on Olympia, branding the bill a direct attack on the sacred seal of confession. They deployed their heaviest hitters — including Hill, prominent priests, and a small army of church lawyers — to pressure lawmakers in both chambers.


	At times, several Republicans appeared to use their roles to echo the institutional voice of the Church itself. 


	One lawmaker, Rep. Phil Fortunato, describes himself as the de facto leader of what he calls the ‘Catholic Caucus' — an informal group of Catholic Republican legislators who, by his account, view representing the Church's interests as part of their role in public office.


	“Every week we have mass in Olympia. We set it up. My office actually coordinates it,” says Fortunato. “And one of the things that we try to do is coordinate with the Catholic Conference. I keep track of all the Catholics that are in the house, in the Senate and how we vote on those particular things.” 


	Frame corroborates this, saying Fortunato sent emails to all lawmakers he believed to be Catholic urging them to band together to stop passage of her legislation. 


	Still, the Church's stance isn't monolithic among Catholic lawmakers. Several self-identifying Catholics in the state legislature gave full-throated support for the bill. 


	The opposition was met by a formidable, diverse coalition — former Jehovah's Witnesses, current and former Catholics, abuse survivors, faith leaders, and even schoolchildren, all united in a single demand: close every loophole.


	Among them was Mary Dispenza, a former nun, lifelong Catholic, and survivor of clergy abuse. On the morning of the bill signing, she stood behind Governor Ferguson with tears in her eyes to witness a moment she'd spent years fighting for.


	“We want the best of Catholicism, which is protecting children,” Dispenza says. “Secrecy is not the best of the Catholic church. Secrecy protects perpetrators.” 

	











Dispenza was nearly 50, working in pastoral care for the Seattle Archdiocese, when a mandatory workshop on sexual misconduct triggered her first flashback: a vision of her seven-year-old self being molested by a priest in a dark auditorium in 1947. That priest, the late Rev. George Neville Rucker, went on to serve for decades and would later be accused by more than 30 children. Dispenza confronted him, and joined a civil lawsuit. But she was later fired by the Church after coming out as a lesbian in the early ‘90s. In 2014, she released a book, Split, which recounts her experiences. 


	In 2003, Rucker's charges were dropped after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling struck down California's attempt to revive old abuse cases by extending the statute of limitations. Rucker, who had been living in a home for retired priests, walked free without trial. He died in 2014.


	“This is about power, I believe. Just fighting for the sake of power,” Dispenza says. “The Catholic Church is the largest and most powerful church in the world…But children have no voice. They have no power. And I don't know where this is going to go, but I know we're prepared for a fight here. If we need to, we will fight for the children.”


	Dispenza wasn't the only one standing behind the governor that day. 


	With her was Tim Law — an attorney and lifelong member of Holy Rosary Catholic Church in Seattle, where he was baptized 75 years ago and attended grade school; a parish he still calls home today.


	“My mother and her parents were members going back to 1920. My grandparents helped build the church during the Great Depression,” Law says. “This is my community.” 


	Law is a co-founder of Ending Clergy Abuse, an international network of survivors and advocates. And for the past year, Law worked with such non-profit groups as the Clergy Accountability Project to move the needle in the Washington State legislature.


	“I'm a great believer in the faith of the Church and the gospel of Jesus, and this is my way of living out that faith,” Law says. 


	He has spent the last decade pressuring Catholic leadership to reform from within. Five years ago, he and other local Catholics sought a meeting with Seattle Archbishop Etienne, lead plaintiff now in the Catholics' suit against Washington state, to propose a kind of truth and reconciliation process; one that would open the Church's abuse files to review and help chart a path forward.

	











	“He kept saying he wanted to cooperate. Tells the public he wants to cooperate,” Law says. “But when they get together in a room, they get nothing.”


	Law's advocacy has not come without consequence. 


	Just days after the bill signing, Law says he was barred from long-held duties at his parish — a directive he claims came directly from Seattle Archbishop Etienne after parishioners circulated a photo of Law standing with the governor at the event in May. The archdiocese denies Law's claims, stating in an email that it “does not have a policy regarding lay leaders who speak publicly on controversial legislative matters.” 


	Still, advocates like Law and Dispenza won over the House, which passed the bill out of committee before it stalled in the budget process. The Senate didn't flinch, pushing it across the finish line with a decisive 64–31 vote — finally delivering the words they'd spent years fighting to hear from the Speaker of the House:


	“Having received the constitutional majority, Senate Bill 5375 is declared passed.”


	Washington stepped into this battle at a uniquely combustible political moment: one shaped by a Trump-era conservative legal movement that aggressively champions religious liberty claims in court — even as the same DOJ faces backlash for keeping the Epstein files sealed, protecting evidence tied to one of the nation's most notorious pedophiles and sex traffickers. Conservative religious influence increasingly shapes American policy debates, transforming religious liberty into a defining front in the nation's culture wars. Under Donald Trump, the federal judiciary was reshaped with dozens of conservative judges sympathetic to expansive religious freedom arguments. And this DOJ — led by Trump appointees — has shown a pattern of ideologically charged litigation on behalf of religious interests, turning even local policy fights into national constitutional battles.


	Trump — himself found liable for sexual abuse — has steered clear of criticizing the Catholic Church over its own scandals, instead casting himself as a defender of religion against government overreach. But his relationship with the religious community has not been smooth sailing. The Catholic Church has openly clashed with Trump over his hardline immigration policies. In June, two dozen bishops joined an interfaith coalition to denounce his “Big Beautiful Bill” slashing Medicaid for low-income and disabled Americans, prompting the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to issue one of its sharpest rebukes of his social agenda.

	











	Still, the Trump-era DOJ and the Catholic Church have found common cause in attacking Washington state, even if they don't agree on where the line should be drawn, forming a rare alliance against one of the first laws in decades to strip away clergy's confessional shield in child abuse cases. It has turned into a national flashpoint, a constitutional test case watched across the country, poised to redefine the boundary between church and state.


	Just weeks before Washington's new clergy reporting law is set to take effect, Pope Leo XIV issued a rare public reproof of clerical secrecy. In a message read aloud in Lima, Peru — where he spent decades as a missionary — Leo called for a culture of “active vigilance” against all forms of abuse. “This culture,” he wrote, “will only be authentic if it is born of transparent processes and sincere listening to those who have been hurt. For this, we need journalists,” according to Vatican News.


	Yet even amid papal calls for a Church rooted in transparency and active vigilance, U.S. church officials are lawyering up to defend secrecy around abuse confessions.


	The legal muscle behind the Catholics' lawsuit makes it clear this is not a local skirmish.


	In addition to First Liberty Institute and Seattle-based Crowley Law Offices, the plaintiffs are represented by WilmerHale, a global D.C. firm with a deep bench of constitutional litigators, and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has successfully argued major religious freedom cases before the Supreme Court. The composition of this legal dream team signals intent: They're engineering a challenge destined to climb the federal judiciary. 


	Jehovah's Witnesses, for their part, say they have “closely monitored Washington's clergy reporting law,” but “have made no decision yet on whether the law should be challenged,” according to spokesman Jarrod Lopes.


	But on June 16, the battlefield widened further as a coalition of Orthodox churches filed their own federal lawsuit, arguing Washington's law forces priests to choose between breaking the confessional seal or facing criminal charges. Represented by the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom — the same organization behind the law that led to the Supreme Court's 2022 decision ending the federal right to abortion — they'll seek an injunction at a July 25 hearing, just two days before the law is set to take effect.


	In announcing their lawsuit, the Orthodox Church in America echoed the language of the Catholic bishops and the DOJ, calling Washington's law “rank religious discrimination.” 

	











	Whether this second lawsuit strengthens the broader constitutional challenge, or complicates the Catholic Church's claim that it is being uniquely targeted, remains to be seen. 


	What is clear: with two active federal lawsuits and the U.S. Department of Justice now formally intervening on constitutional grounds, the ultimate audience for this battle could well be the U.S. Supreme Court. And the Roberts Court, in 2025, is not the same court that shaped modern religious liberty doctrine. Religious conservatism no longer sits at the fringe; it now occupies the commanding heights of the U.S. judiciary. 


	As of June 2025, six of the nine justices on the Supreme Court are Catholic: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Neil Gorsuch was raised Catholic but attends an Episcopal church. The remaining two — Justices Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson — are Jewish and nondenominational Protestant, respectively. 


	If challenges to the Washington law wind their way to the highest court in the land, a victory for the plaintiffs could not only invalidate Washington's law; it could constitutionalize the clergy-penitent privilege, transforming what was once a statutory exemption into a hard limit on state power. That could slam the door on similar reform efforts nationwide, blocking other states from closing similar loopholes, even in the specific context of child abuse. It could use the First Amendment as a vehicle to enshrine a system of legal exceptionalism.


	Washington Attorney General Nick Brown's office did not make officials available for comment, but affirmed by email that it “would obviously defend any legal challenge to this law.”


	But the state knows it has a fight on its hands. Brown has privately acknowledged to supporters that the legal terrain is tricky. According to someone familiar with the conversation, Brown told advocates at a private event he wished lawmakers had worked more closely with his office before passing the bill, warning that its narrow focus on clergy could make it hard to defend. 


	The future of Washington's freshly minted mandatory reporting law became even more uncertain at a July 14 hearing, just two weeks before it was set to take effect, when Judge David G. Estudillo granted the Justice Department's request to join the lawsuit. 


	Four days later, Estudillo dropped the hammer, issuing a preliminary injunction that bars the state from enforcing the requirement that Catholic clergy in the Seattle, Yakima, and Spokane dioceses report child‑abuse disclosures made during confession. That order stays any penalties or prosecutions for priests who honor the confessional seal, leaving the law inoperative for those dioceses until Etienne v.  Ferguson plays out in court. (Orthodox churches sued separately and remain subject to Washington's new law unless they secure their own injunction at a July  25 hearing.)

	











	Together, the two lawsuits, along with the DOJ's involvement, have made Washington's law a high-stakes legal test. Whether its promise of ending clergy secrecy in abuse reporting holds, or collapses under constitutional challenge, now rests with the courts.

	“Children will continue to suffer because religious leaders they trust are not reporting when children tell them they are being hurt,” says Sen. Frame. “People keep asking me, ‘What happens now?' What happens is that children who are being abused continue to be abused. Full stop. Period.”

	There was a lot that filmmaker Dani Sloane was drawn to when she first read Matt Sullivan's 2022 Rolling Stone feature “Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,” about the death of Bianca Rudolph, allegedly at the hands of her husband, Larry. “It was before any verdict was issued,” she remembers. “I just immediately gravitated towards this world.” Larry Rudolph had been a prominent dentist in Pittsburgh, as well as an active member of the Safari Club, an international organization for wealthy and connected big-game hunters. But in 2016, when the couple were on safari in Zambia, Bianca was shot and killed while in their cabin. At first, Larry claimed it was an accident — the gun had gone off while she was packing it up. Then, the story changed to suicide. Larry moved his longtime mistress, Lori Milliron, into the couple's marital home within months, igniting a firestorm of gossip. Five years later, he was arrested for Bianca's murder, and Lori was arrested as an accessory.

	











	The story was too juicy for Sullivan — and later, Sloane — to pass up. “It felt so dynamic and rich in terms of all these different spaces that Larry and Lori occupied, this bizarre dental world, the Safari Club and their code of ethics and morals,” Sloane tells Rolling Stone. “It felt like it had all of these elements to it that I had never really seen before in one true crime story.”


	Sloane crafted a three-part docuseries based on the article, Trophy Wife, which is co-produced by ABC News Studios, XTR, and Rolling Stone Films, and set to premiere on Hulu July 21. The show isn't your standard true-crime fare, leaning into the abject ridiculousness of the worlds that Larry inhabited. It features interviews with business associates, employees, and Rudolph family friends from Pittsburgh; the guide who shepherded the couple through their last safari; the Zambian investigator who was first on the case; the FBI agents who brought the cold file back to life; the lawyers who prosecuted and defended the case; and the children of Larry and Lori, respectively, who are forced to reckon with the crimes of their parents. “We talked to dental assistants who were terrified of Larry,” says Sloane. “Seeing that visceral fear, and the power that they felt like he had over them, really paints a picture that is quite compelling and troubling.”

	Here, Sloane talks about what it took to bring the docuseries together, the eventual verdict in the case, and what really happened that morning in Zambia.


As you started to dig into the story of Larry Rudolph and Lori Milliron, what was it that surprised you about it?Every piece of the story, you can overturn over and over again and see it from a different vantage point, see something new. It's part this twisted love story between Larry and Lori. It's part this really dynamic family saga, and part this workplace drama, set against these really rich and dynamic worlds. Everything that was simmering beneath the surface, I found shocking and surprising. And then, of course, once the verdict came down some months later — the way that the physical evidence was presented, the way that the crime scene was examined, the way that it became this really dynamic cat and mouse game between Larry and Lori and the authorities. Ultimately you come away from it with answers to some questions, and new questions completely.


How did you get access to Larry and to Lori? And what are those relationships like?Matt Sullivan had established a relationship with Lori for his first article, so he was very helpful in making that intro. In terms of Lori's family and the dental assistants and the Safari Club members, it was really just picking up the incredible work that Matt did, and making sure that they understood that what we were hoping to do was to further what was in the article and to dig a little deeper, to really make sure that everyone had their say. And the same goes for Larry. When Matt was working on the article, access to Larry was a bit more challenging because he'd been in federal prison for the time leading up to the trial, whereas Lori was not. So once a verdict had been issued, Larry was able to speak to us, and that was obviously a huge, helpful piece of being able to tell this story.

What was it like to interview Larry and Lori's respective children?The Julian [Larry's son] interview was from a 20/20, piece. We reached out to Larry's kids. I think they were wanting to put this chapter behind them, understandably. But Lori's daughter we did speak to, and she had never spoken before. She was incredible. It really comes through in the series how much she loves her mom and how much she wants to fight for her and to fight for her mom's side of the story to be told. It was a really emotional interview. You could see how painful this was for her and her family. It was really the first time that she and her siblings and the rest of their family felt like they could tell the story of who their mom was that wasn't the story that existed in the tabloids.

	











One thing I think the documentary does well is leave it a little ambiguous as to what the real story is. Should we believe Larry, or should we believe the people who are saying Larry murdered his wife?Whenever it comes to telling a story like this, I always want to lean into the truth. And I think the truth in this story is that there were two people in that cabin in Zambia that morning. It was Larry and it was Bianca. And in terms of what happened, a lot of it is based on character and speculation and past actions, based on past behavior. But I think the thing that fascinates me so much about this story, and stories like this in general, is this is about what happened that day at the crime scene between these two people. It's not about how he acted in his business. It's not about how he acted as president of the Safari Club. And yet all of that gets brought into any case, right? Nothing exists fully in a vacuum. So how do we separate the character witness and the circumstantial evidence from the physical evidence? It creates such a puzzle and a conundrum. What kind of evidence are they looking at, what's admissible in a court versus in the court of public opinion, where you can look at all of his past actions and the fact that this affair had been going on for so long, and go, “Of course he did this.” That juxtaposition has always been so fascinating to me, and I think this is a case that highlights it so beautifully.


Were you surprised that he was found guilty?In the case of Larry, I wasn't necessarily surprised by the verdict — we all thought it could have gone either way. In the case of Lori, there was more surprise. Her side of the story, there's a lot more opaqueness and questions that exist around her sentence. Like, she was not in Zambia at the time of the murder — the accident, whichever way you view this — she was thousands of miles away. And a lot of that accessory-to-murder charge stems from hearing what Larry said to the bartender in 2020, years after Bianca died. So there's a lot of legal minutiae when it comes to Lori's case that's a lot less straightforward than Larry's, and takes a lot more analysis to really understand. In terms of the severity of the sentence that she got, that was definitely the surprise: 17 years.


Aside from this being a fascinating story, with all these interesting characters and all these backdrops, what's the bigger message that you want to get through with this series?When you look at Larry Rudolph — and all of the things he had done over the years in his business, with women, to his wife, to his family, in the Safari Club, in the big-game hunting world — by all accounts, he always just felt like everything was his for the taking. He did think he was untouchable. And there is something about watching someone take a step too far, ultimately facing the ramifications and the consequences for their actions, that I think is important to say, it's important to see. And to see justice being meted out. It matters to tell stories where the legal system — depending on how you feel about all the evidence that was presented — potentially does get it right.

	











	In the case of Lori, it's the way that we tell stories about women. Women are presented in such a one-sided, one-dimensional way. If you're a bitch at work, you're a bitch in every other aspect of your life. If you're a saint, you're a saint. We're often so reduced to one trope, one adjective. And we all know that's not true. Being able to represent women for who they really are, and to see all the sides of them — the good, the bad, the ugly, the complicated — is something that really matters. The stories that I'm interested in telling are ones where you're able to do that.


	This is why it's so crucial that we were able to talk to Lori's daughter and see that beautiful relationship, this single mother who worked so hard to provide for her kids, who fell in love with this guy, and fell into this world. Did she get carried away with it? Did she go too far? Was she a victim? Was she a villain? Was she an accomplice? Was she an innocent bystander?


The production team went to Zambia to visit the camp where Bianca was killed and interview the local guides and investigators. What was that trip like?It was incredible. I'd never been on safari. I'd never been anywhere so incredibly beautiful. Lions were walking by where we were sleeping at night, and elephants walking by while we were having breakfast. It was magical. You could understand why Larry loved being there, and why he would constantly return to this place. Zambia was such a special place to them. It made us all feel much more connected and closer to the story. And I think it was crucial to be there and to talk to all these people who were at the scene of the crime, because they were the ones that were closest to what happened. They were the eyewitnesses to everything that unfolded, and that very crucial two-day period after Bianca died. So it was really important for us to be there and to speak to them and to make sure that their views were presented in the series.


	All of this [last] trip that they went on was about hunting this leopard. These leopards are so elusive, you really have to track them. And our guides were telling us, sometimes you won't see a leopard for, you know, a month. The miracle of all this was, we had flown into Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, and drove six hours to get to where we were staying. We literally got there, put our bags down, and they were like, “We just happened to see a leopard in a tree about two or three miles away from camp. Let's go.” And that first two hours that we got there, we filmed that leopard footage. It was perfect. It just all came together.

The former ambassador to Zambia is in the film. He's such an interesting character. What was he like to work with?Oh, my God. We had so much fun with him. He is a character. I mean, you could do a multipart series on him alone, super dynamic. Just so much wound up on the cutting room floor. But he knew it all. He was a big part of this. And his love for the country of Zambia really came through. Everyone loves him, and we're so lucky that he was willing to participate, to talk to us, because I think he adds such a richness, and he is the consummate character. 


Was it tough to get folks to talk before the verdict came out?Larry loomed very large in their lives for a long time, so there was definitely a lot of bravery that people showed in coming forward to tell their truth. There was really a fear here. Whether it was real or perceived, I think people were afraid of this guy. And people had some trepidation about, you know — maybe they talked to Matt, but they didn't fully tell all, because there was always the chance that [Larry] was going to get out, and would want to exact vengeance, in their minds. Some people were more willing to come out of the woodwork after they knew that he was in jail, and he wasn't getting out.

T
HE GREATEST LOST CONCERT in American history almost never happened at all. It was Oct. 27, 1968, in Palo Alto, California. Outside of his high school, Danny Scher, a 16-year-old, bushy-haired, jazz-obsessed, self-described “weirdo,” was pacing the parking lot waiting for his hero, and music's most elusive and enigmatic genius, to show up: composer and pianist Thelonious Monk.


	To the disbelief of most everyone — including his mother and girlfriend waiting alongside him — Scher claimed to have booked the jazz legend for an afternoon gig, the modern equivalent of securing Kendrick Lamar for prom. Pulling this off at a nearly all-white school during his racially divided town's explosive Civil Rights battle — when the predominantly Black community of East Palo Alto was fighting to rename itself “Nairobi” — made it even more unlikely. But the mixed crowd in the parking lot proved how music could bring them together. “It was really the only time I ever remember seeing that many Black people,” Scher recalls. “Everyone was just there to see Monk.”

	











	During his 25 years working with famed concert promoter Bill Graham in San Francisco, Scher went on to book some of rock's most legendary shows and created the storied Shoreline Amphitheatre. But as the precocious 73-year-old with wispy gray hair and glasses tells me one afternoon in his apartment overlooking Manhattan, his ultimate — and unlikeliest — production happened before he was old enough to drive. And it carries a powerful untold story, revealed now for the first time: how the same establishment that marginalized one of music's most misunderstood virtuosos, Thelonious Monk, nearly silenced his greatest posthumous triumph.

	If it hadn't been for the high school custodian who taped Monk's show, it would have been lost forever. When the long-lost recording finally came out five years ago, it earned rave reviews (Rolling Stone picked the “remarkable show” as a top-10 reissue of 2020), shot to the top of the Billboard jazz charts, and seemed a shoo-in for a Grammy. But the battle behind the scenes went deeper than anyone knew. “Record companies are still taking advantage of musicians,” Scher says. Or, as Monk's 75-year-old son, drummer T.S. Monk, puts it, “They fucked him over.”

	But thanks to a dusty reel-to-reel tape, a teenage dream, and a family's fight for justice, Monk's music — and legacy — won in the end. And it all started the moment Monk arrived for the gig that afternoon long ago. With great relief, Scher watched as his big brother, Les, pulled up in their parents' car with Monk and the band. Larry Gales' double bass was sticking out the window. Monk looked sharp as ever in his dark suit, a white collared shirt, a checkered newsboy cap, and shades. It was time for this show to begin.


	ONE OTHER TIME THELONIOUS MONK had played a high school was to go to bat for T.S. It happened a few years earlier at the fancy boarding school in Connecticut where the musician had sent him. Monk didn't want his son, as one of the few Black kids on campus, getting hassled.


	One day, shortly after being hailed on the cover of Time, Monk showed up at the school in his limo and told his son, “‘Look, I'm gonna play a concert for the fucking school. They're never gonna fucking throw you out,'” T.S. says. Soon after, when T.S. showed up to school in an Afro, they made him cut it and suspended him. “But they didn't throw me out!” T.S. recalls with a laugh. We're talking in his bustling home in New Jersey, where his family has convened for lunch. T.S., bald with a gold earring and gray goatee, slaps the table in approval of his dad's deft moves. He says his father “knew the game!”


	By the time of the “Paly High” show in 1968, Monk had been on top of the jazz game for more than 20 years. Since his breakthrough debut, The Genius of Modern Music Vol. 1, his cubist compositions and percussive piano had garnered international acclaim. “There is hardly a jazz musician playing who is not in some way indebted to him,” as Time wrote. Musician, composer, and die-hard fan Jon Batiste considers Monk decades ahead of his time. “It's like somebody saying, ‘I'm going to take an engine from the 1930s and I'm going to do stuff to it that in 2025 is still considered state of the art,'” he tells me. “That's the type of artistic mind that is in the 0.1 percent of humanity.”

	But the “mad genius,” as Monk was often called, much to his chagrin, had a method behind him. Despite his off-kilter style, T.S. recalls, “he was very, very methodical. He really did his fucking work.” Few understood the grind behind the artistic brilliance: the obsessive repetition, the sleepless nights, the meticulous labor behind even a single bar of music. “I remember him going over this four-measure phrase all day and all night for weeks,” T.S. recalls. At the time, it sounded like nonsense to the boy. “I remember saying to myself, ‘What the hell is he writing?'” T.S. says. “‘This is going nowhere.'” But the bars became “Oska T.,” one of his standout tunes.


	Even Monk's theatricality was deliberate. He had handkerchiefs custom-made, four feet wide, that he'd stuff into his suit pocket and pull out halfway through a show like a magician. When he'd stand beside his piano and start spinning in circles, it wasn't some strange mania as some suspected. He was dancing, doing a series of moves rooted in African dance steps passed down from his family in North Carolina.


	His exaggerated movements at the piano — stabbing the keys and shuffling his feet — weren't bizarre quirks. They came from church. Monk had spent years as a boy playing at Pentecostal revivals, where people spoke in tongues and collapsed onstage. His disjointed, dissonant rhythms were his attempt to accompany the chaos — like providing a real-time soundtrack to a strange silent movie. His dancing feet came from playing the organ as a child and working the pedals, a rhythm he never lost. He played his favorite game, pool, like he played music: precise, propulsive, and without mercy. T.S. never won a single game. Neither did John Coltrane, who once lost 59 out of 60 ping-pong matches in a single night.


	But the same brilliance that elevated him isolated him. Monk's sensitivity ran deep, even if the world mistook it for madness. He had an unusually hard time with death — so hard, he couldn't bring himself to attend his own mother's funeral. The deaths of Coltrane and Bud Powell devastated him. He was becoming more and more silent. One night, T.S. found his father standing by the kitchen sink staring blankly at the ceiling. “He seemed like he was in another world,” T.S. recalls. “I didn't know what the fuck was going on. I was terrified.”


	Monk, the artist Coltrane had called “a musical architect of the highest order,” was struggling to keep his mind together. “Sometimes he doesn't know exactly what he's saying,” his wife Nellie told T.S. and his younger sister, Barbara, one day. “Sometimes he may not necessarily look like he recognizes you. We have to protect him. We have to look out for him, because if we don't, nobody else will.”

	











	“I got it all of a sudden,” T.S. recalls. “I realized that my mother was saying that Dad needs us and so don't take it to heart when he goes off the deep end.”


	The family didn't know at the time that Monk was suffering from undiagnosed bipolar disorder, which could have been eased with proper treatment. But they faced an impossible obstacle. “We're talking about America,” as T.S. puts it. “Mental illness among African Americans was not a priority.” One hospital wanted to give him shock treatment, until a friend intervened. Doctors overmedicated him on heavy sedatives such as Thorazine, dulling his faculties even further. The family feared what might come if they reached out again. “Their answer was lock him up, put him in a fucking straitjacket and sit his ass down,” T.S. says.


	As Monk's silent episodes mounted, so did his financial strains. With musical tastes changing, Monk's records hadn't been selling like they used to, and he had fallen into debt to his label, Columbia. In a pandering attempt to make Monk hip to the hippie generation, the label staged an elaborate cover shoot with him at a piano by a tied-up Nazi, bottles of wine, and what appeared to be a pirate. “They had a Sgt. Pepper's kind of outfit for him to wear,” T.S. recalls. “But when he got to the set for that, he basically said, ‘Fuck that. I got my Brooks Brothers shit. What the fuck y'all talking about?'” He posed in his own anachronous suit on the cover, a cigarette dangling from his lip.


	But Monk's family doesn't think he accepted Scher's invite for the money or the marketing. It was something simpler. “He had a soft spot,” T.S. says. “I wasn't surprised he agreed to play a concert for a kid.”


	FOR AS LONG AS DANNY SCHER could remember, Palo Alto had been divided. On the west side of Highway 101 was Palo Alto proper, leafy home to Stanford University, the early nerds of Silicon Valley, and largely white. On the east side of the 101 was East Palo Alto, which was predominately Black. The two sides seldom mixed. As Scher recalls, “People in Palo Alto did not go to East Palo Alto.” But from a young age, Scher refused to be one of them. When the white and Black high schools swapped students for two weeks to foster community, he volunteered to be in the program. “I was in the minority,” he said. “It was fine.”


	Best of all, there were more jazz fans in East Palo Alto like him. Scher had been listening to the music since his brother Les, a saxophone player, turned him on to it. Monk and Duke Ellington were his favorites. “It just spoke to me,” he says. “It was very accessible, but a little odd.” He adds, “I was a little off too.” While his classmates were listening to the Dead and the Stones, Scher was a jazzy percussionist in the marching band. At 15, he hitchhiked to the Monterey Jazz Festival, where he was among the only white kids. Too young to get into jazz clubs, he'd call them in advance and pretend to be a booking manager to get comped. “That way,” he says, “no one's ever going to ask for your ID.”

	











	One of six boys expected to follow his father into law practice, Scher chose music instead — despite his dad's warning: “There's no money in music. Go sell shoes.” After getting elected his high school's “commissioner of social activities,” Scher wanted to book more than just homecoming dances and teacher talent shows, he wanted to book Monk. So the wannabe Bill Graham hatched a plan.


	Monk was playing a residency at the Jazz Workshop, a club in San Francisco. The city was only 35 miles away. Maybe, Scher thought, Monk would be willing to come down for a Sunday-afternoon show. After tracking down the number of Monk's manager, Harry Colomby, and calling him with the outrageous offer, he got an even more surprising response: Monk was in. Scher was duly mind-blown. But now he faced a new challenge, pulling off the show.


	Using his student-activities funds and selling ads in the program to raise $500, Scher booked the gig for Sunday, Oct. 27, 1968. His principal signed the contract. But the question remained: Why would one of music's most acclaimed and elusive virtuosos take a high school gig from this kid at all?


	The kid promoting the Monk show, nonetheless, was having an unexpectedly hard time selling tickets. Despite Scher's booking, few people believed that the world's greatest jazz artist was really coming to town. To get the word out, Scher stuffed his newspaper-boy bag with rolled-up posters, and pedaled across Highway 101 to where he knew there were plenty of Monk fans like him: East Palo Alto.


	It was a busy week for postering. After the killing of Martin Luther King Jr. that spring, local leaders and activists, inspired by the Black Power and Pan-African movements of the time, moved to rename their town after Kenya's capital, Nairobi. With the vote scheduled for Nov. 5, the week after the Monk show, supporters and detractors had been plastering the area with flyers too. Tensions were high. Scher recalls a neighborhood cop seeing him taping up a poster. The cop warned him: “Hey, white boy, this isn't a safe place for you. You're going to get in trouble putting up posters.” Scher told him, “I'm going to be in bigger trouble if the show doesn't do well.”


	SCHER'S MOVE PAID OFF. With Black and white kids buying up the tickets, the show sold out. Two days before the gig, Scher called the jazz club where Monk was playing to go over details with his manager — only to hear Monk himself pick up the phone instead. There was just one thing more shocking than talking to his hero for the first time — realizing Monk didn't know about the gig at all. As he told this kid on the phone, “What are you talking about?”

	











	Scher's heart raced. He did his best to coolly fill in Monk, who'd either not been told about the gig by his manager or lost track. “How am I going to get there?” the piano great replied. Scher didn't have the budget for a limo, but he had something better: his older brother Les, who not only turned him on to Monk in the first place but also had a license. “My brother will pick you up!” Scher assured him. Yet without having received a fully executed contract back from Monk's manager, he didn't know if Monk would really show up at all.


	After his brother pulled up with Monk and his band, Scher tried to play it cool. “I realized from my very first show, when I'm producing a concert, it's not to be their friends,” he says.


	He asked Monk, “You hungry?”


	“I'm hungry,” Monk replied.


	Scher dispatched his mom to go across the street for food. With no greenroom, Monk and the band settled in off the stage. Scher checked the school's piano. One of the custodians, a Black man in his thirties, knew how to tune it and offered to set it up. A fan himself, he just wanted one thing in return. “If I tune the piano,” he said, “can I record the concert?” In all of Scher's meticulous planning, he hadn't thought about recording the show. But the custodian had access to a reel-to-reel tape recorder, and knew how to operate it, too. “Yeah, OK,” Scher told him.


	“I'll give you the tape when it's over,” the custodian promised.


	From the moment Monk and his band walked onstage, this wasn't like any gig before. T.S. Monk imagines his father would have been inspired by the mixed crowd and their placards for Nairobi. “He was always very aware of Civil Rights,” he says. “So I could see why that would be important to him.” Despite his own challenges, Monk didn't just show up — he unleashed an unusually incendiary and explosive 47-minute set, from the opening shot of “Ruby, My Dear,” to the last stab of “I Love You Sweetheart of All of My Dreams.” Scher could only stand and watch in awe. “Everyone was thrilled,” he says. Even better, the young promoter felt he'd done his job. “The sound was good, the lights were good,” he recalls. “And the piano was tuned.”


	Monk thanked the crowd, and said his only other words of the night: “We have another show to do.” Scher helped the band off the stage and make its way to his parents' car. Monk seemed to have a good time, and Scher allowed himself one moment to be a fan: asking his idol to sign the night's program. Monk wasn't fond of autographs. “I don't like to carry a pen on me,” he once said, “because somebody will say ‘Sign an autograph.'” But he made an exception for this bushy-haired kid. Then, just as magically as he arrived, he piled back into the car with the band, and with the bass sticking out a window, headed back to San Francisco.

	











	Scher stood there watching the car fade like a dream, clutching his autographed program. Though the vote to rename East Palo Alto as Nairobi was lost the following week, Monk's music had brought the town together. And Scher had the proof: the Ampex reel-to-reel tape the custodian had made of the show, handed over to Scher as promised. The 16-year-old went home and put it in a cardboard box. It would be 50 years before he heard it again.


	DESPITE HIS FATHER'S WARNINGS, Scher proved he could be happier, and more successful, promoting concerts than selling shoes. He followed up the Monk gig with another momentous feat: booking Duke Ellington to play his school. He ended up befriending the great composer and becoming his driver whenever he was in town. After studying music at Stanford, Scher hustled the biggest gig of all: working for the greatest booker in town himself, Bill Graham. Though Scher never again saw Monk, who died of a stroke in 1982 at age 64, he cherished the memories — the autographed program and a copy of the show's original poster. “This poster was always in my office,” he says.


	But he'd never heard the custodian's tape. The old reel-to-reel had been sitting in a box packed away until friends urged him to burn it onto a CD. When Scher popped it into his stereo, it was the first time he'd heard it since he was that bushy-haired 16-year-old listening from backstage. The custodian's raw tape captured Monk's performance in all its wonderful imperfections: the squeak of the piano bench as he shifted in his seat, the scratchy tap of his shoes swiping the piano pedals below. “It was really good,” Scher says. It had to come out.


	Though Scher had never been in touch with Monk's family, he figured they'd be as excited as him. But this time when he called, the Monk on the other end wasn't so receptive. T.S. Monk was so used to hustlers pestering him about dubious Monk recordings that he gave Scher his usual response. “I said, ‘I don't know who the fuck y'all are,'” he recalls with a laugh, “and we ain't releasing nothing.”


	When Scher brought the CD to T.S. Monk's house to let him hear it, he watched closely as the son listened closely to the man he knew so well — as a musician, and a dad. In Monk's later years, T.S. had backed him up as a drummer, too. After so long performing with his dad, and listening to countless live recordings, T.S. was the toughest critic of his father's work. “Most live performances suck,” he says. But from the first note, he could tell this was no ordinary gig. “My father was feeling good,” he told Scher.

	











	“How can you tell?” Scher asked.


	“Because everything's up, everything's a little faster,” he said, pointing out the urgency of his father's fingers, “and that's when he felt good.” He bobbed along as his father attacked “Don't Blame Me,” the 1932 pop standard. “He's playing the living shit out of this tune,” T.S. told Scher. “The band is rocking!” It wasn't just the performance that shook him. It was the story of the show, and how it humanized his father like nothing before. “I knew the story was as big as the record,” he recalls. “You got this 16-year-old white kid who picks up the phone and calls Thelonious Monk himself and says, ‘Mr. Monk, I want to hire you.' And Thelonious Monk says, ‘OK, kid.' I mean to me that was off the hook.” He knew his father would have wanted the world to hear it. “Hell yeah, no doubt,” T.S. says.


	With Impulse Records on board, Thelonious Monk: Live at Palo Alto was slated to come out in July 2020. Scher, T.S. Monk, and the label prepared a lavish package for the vinyl release, including copies of the original program and poster. Impulse submitted it for six Grammy nominations.


	But just as the advance raves were peaking two weeks before the release, they got a message from Monk's old sparring partner: his label. Sony, owners of Columbia, claimed the tape was contractually theirs. “They were saying that this recording was made during the period that Thelonious was on the contract to Columbia, and therefore they owned it,” T.S. Monk says. (A Sony Music spokesperson tells me, “We don't comment on confidential contractual details.”)


	This wasn't the first time the Monk estate had battled with Sony. In 2002, the estate conducted a forensic accounting of Monk's catalog and discovered it was owed hundreds of thousands of dollars from the label. A settlement was reached in 2023. But now Sony was threatening to sue if the Palo Alto concert got released. Faced with a legal battle, Impulse pulled the LP. The momentum crashed. And with no way of knowing when or if the record would get released, the hypothetical Grammy nominations went away, too.

	After searching through Monk's old paperwork, T.S. and the estate confirmed what they had known to be true: Monk's contract with Columbia had expired in 1967, a year before the Palo Alto High School show. Sony responded with another salvo: a contract extension through 1968 signed by Monk himself. But when his son eyed it 52 years later, he called bullshit. “That's not my father's signature,” he said. Scher— who had one of Monk's rare autographs on his Palo Alto program — agreed. A forensic handwriting analyst confirmed their assessment. Sony seems to have decided this was a losing battle. According to T.S., the company soon settled the matter. Thelonious Monk: Live at Palo Alto eventually came out in September 2020.

	











	Despite getting robbed of the momentum and the Grammy nominations, T.S. and Scher are happy the long-lost recording could finally be heard. “I know you think there's a bias because he's my father,” T.S. says with a smile, “but it's not because he's my father. It's because he's Monk. His music does the same thing to me as it does to everybody else.” For Scher, the legacy of the concert lives on, and so does his hero. He says, “I hear Monk every day.”

The enduringly popular Discovery Channel summertime TV event is back for its 37th year.


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	With the season's big holiday in the nation's rearview and the majority of the summer's blockbusters currently playing in cinemas, mid-July is now upon us. At this time of year, you'll notice certain sensory shifts: the smells of sizzling barbecues, the noise of children in the street and the record heat you've been cursing becomes less bothersome. Why? Because you are, or should be, inside enjoying Shark Week. 


Discovery Channel‘s enduringly popular summertime TV event is back, for its 37th year, starting on Sunday and featuring a slew of new shows. Expect another wildly entertaining and at times informative variety with plenty of personalities. Giddy gratification and gory glimpses of the ocean predators are plentiful this year, as is some frightening and fascinating footage of the summer season's seminal scallywag.

					How to Watch 'Shark Week' 2024 Without Cable		
			









	Here's a brief look at some of the highlights below, with the full viewing schedule here.


	This white-knuckle show provides practical knowledge for every ocean swimmer and Jaws fan's ultimate fear: facing down an apex predator in a real-life shark attack. Using three potential scenarios, the hour-long episode breaks down survival tactics that could mean the difference between life and death for an unlucky human shark bait. It's hosted by the affable Paul de Gelder, a former Australian Navy bomb disposal diver and Army paratrooper who survived a bull shark attack in 2009. Watch as sharks tear into his prosthetic limbs, squirm amid some gripping close calls, and allow the very macho commentary to wash over you and grimace (or giggle) at a shocking amount of fake blood. 

	











	An unusually aggressive and elusive shark terrorizes the California coast, prompting a deep-sea hunt to determine if it's a known species —or if it may be something far more mysterious. Producer, marine biologist and shark expert Kendyl Berna, who co-founded Beyond the Reef, teams up with researchers to deploy cutting-edge tech in pursuit of the so-called “black mako.” Ample sonar drama is afoot — and it comes with a side of speculative science — in an episode that's giving half-sci-fi thriller, half-documentary.


	The iconic great white leaping spectacle is known for stunning shots of breaches as it focuses on high-speed hunts and aerial acrobatics. This time on the Shark Week classic, a crack team of marine biologists and — let's face it, aqua adventure junkies — are on the hunt for Colossus, a legendary 20-foot Great White who disappeared off the coast of South Africa and has not been seen in 10 years. Could he be off the coast of New Zealand? Will the marine-loving crew of shark seekers find their “white whale”? Will they capture some of the most stunning shark breaches in Discovery's history? Anything is possible — it's Shark Week, after all…


	This episode compiles jaw-dropping footage of sharks turning the tables — biting cameras, boats and sometimes the people trying to film them. Hosted by incomparable adrenaline junkie Kinga Philipps, this highly entertianing episode blends viral clips with commentary from startled scientists and thrill-seeking divers. The jump-scare editing style keeps the pace moving, even if its at the cost of the insights into shark behavior we're here for. But that's for the other shows. Pass the Goldfish….

	











	 Legend meets biology in this deep dive into the myth of a monstrous shark blamed for the death of a man attacked in St. Martin. Again, an assembled team of cryptozoologists and shark researchers comes together, this time looking to draw a line between fiction and facts as they find an innovative way to draw the shark — and dozens of its closest pals — toward the underwater crew in what to most viewers is an absolute nightmare scenario. Sit in a deeper chair because this hour of television will redefine the edge of your seat. 


	In this beautifully shot special, we are invited to explore the unusual bond between humans and sharks as free divers interact with the ocean predators in choreographed underwater encounters. Featuring journalist and adventurer Kinga Philipps, the episode showcases some gorgeous and serene dives with tiger sharks and hammerheads. One may ask, should wild animals turn into dance partners? But one should also be certain to remember this piece of sage advice: “Live every week like it's Shark Week.”


Shark Week 2025 starts Sunday July 20 on Discovery.

	Eileen Fulton, the minister's daughter who spent the better part of 50 years portraying Lisa Miller, one of the first “bad girls” of daytime television, on the CBS soap opera As the World Turns, has died. She was 91. 


	Fulton died Monday in Asheville, North Carolina, after “a period of declining health,” her family announced.




	Four years into the run of As the World Turns, Fulton joined the No. 1 daytime drama in 1960 for what was originally supposed to be a three-month summer storyline. She exited the soap three times — once to headline her own primetime spinoff, 1965's Our Private World — but continued on through the final episode broadcast Sept. 17, 2010.

	Her Lisa had eight husbands, with Nicolas Coster portraying two of them. Three of her marriages ended in divorce, four ended in death and one was annulled. When As the World Turns was done, her character's full name was Lisa Miller Hughes Eldridge Shea Colman McColl Mitchell Grimaldi Chedwyn. She also had lots and lots of lovers.


	“She's a romantic, that's why she falls in love so much,” Fulton said in a 2005 conversation for the Television Academy Foundation website The Interviews.


	Inducted into the Soap Opera Hall of Fame in 1998 and given a lifetime achievement award from the Daytime Emmys in 2004, Fulton was one of the first soap actors to have her own publicist.

	











	She also employed a bodyguard to protect her from angry viewers who disapproved of what Lisa was up to. “They had a great love/hate thing [with me], it was amazing,” she said.


	And in the '70s, Fulton famously had a clause inserted into her contract that guaranteed she would never have to play a grandmother. “At that time, grandmothers had no romance at all — and I wasn't about to let that happen to me,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. She eventually became OK with that.


	The oldest of three kids, Margaret Elizabeth McLarty was born in Asheville on Sept. 13, 1933. Her mother, Peggy, was a schoolteacher and her father, James, a Methodist preacher. She said she knew by the third grade that she was going to be an actress.


	After graduating from Lee Edwards High School in her hometown and, in 1956, as a music and drama major from Greensboro College, she moved to New York and studied acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her classmates was Keir Dullea.


	Fulton had played a hooker in Girl of the Night (1960), starring Anne Francis, when someone from As the World Turns called her manager looking to see if one of his clients, East of Eden actress Lois Smith, was available to play Lisa. Smith was not, so he suggested Fulton.


	“I knew I was going to get that part. There were 250 other girls there [at the audition], but I just knew,” she said.

	











	Lisa “was supposed to be the sweet girl next door. I said, ‘I'm tired of being the sweet girl next door.' I can't change the lines, but I can change my intention once we're on the air. I just thought of little conniving things I could do to Bob.” That would be her first TV husband, played by Don Hastings.


	During one stretch in the early '60s, Fulton would work in the mornings on As the World Turns (when it aired lived), race to the Billy Rose Theater on Broadway to play Honey in matinee performances of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and then appear downtown at the Sullivan Street Playhouse in the evenings in The Fantasticks.


	Fulton quit As the World Turns for the first time in 1963 to “do other things,” which included an off-Broadway turn opposite Hal Holbrook in Abe Lincoln in Illinois. As she had trouble finding other work, viewers did not take to her replacement, Pamela King, and so she returned.


	She left again in 1965, this time to star in Our Private World, which aired Wednesday and Friday nights on CBS. Lisa had fled Oakdale after dumping Bob to move to Chicago, where she wed the wealthy John Eldridge. (Coster played Eldridge; decades later, he would portray Lisa's seventh husband, Eduardo Grimaldi.)


Our Private World, however, was canceled in September after just four months on the air, and Fulton was back on As the World Turns in 1966.


	In 1983, Fulton exited in a contract dispute, to be replaced by Betsy von Furstenberg. But when she heard the writers were thinking about killing off Lisa, she made another comeback. “I don't think anybody would believe Lisa is dead unless I do it,” she said.

	











	Fulton co-authored two autobiographies, 1970's How My World Turns and 1995's As My World Still Turns; several murder mysteries; and another book, 1999's Soap Opera: A Novel. She also was a cabaret performer and had her own clothing line at J.C. Penney.


	In real life, Fulton, unlike Lisa, was married (and divorced) only three times.


	Survivors include her brother, Charles, and her niece, Katherine.


	In a 2010 interview with NPR, the actress said she was well aware that many viewers despised her character. There was one in particular.


	“I was standing in front of Lord & Taylor. I'd only been on the show a few weeks,” she said. “And this beautifully dressed woman in a Chanel suit — in the days before there were knockoffs — came up to me and said, ‘Aren't you Lisa?' And I said, ‘Yes, that's the part I play.' And she said, ‘Well, I hate you!' And she hit me! And people looked at me like I was rotten and this woman was a heroine.


	“But I thought, ‘You know what? I've reached them.' Then a telegram came into the studio. It said, ‘If that bitch Lisa marries Bob I'll never watch As the World Turns again.' That is how the character was truly locked in.”

Southern Hospitality‘s Will Kulp will not appear in the Bravo reality series' forthcoming fourth season, slamming the show as a “horrible experience and a life lesson” as he announced his departure.


	The decision is perhaps unsurprising, given that the future lawyer and former Republic Garden & Lounge bartender was notably absent during Season 3's reunion episode, hosted by Andy Cohen in March. The January-premiering third season of the show — about a group of friends in Charleston, S.C. working at Leva Bonaparte's crown jewel nightclub on King Street — saw Kulp face allegations of a cheating scandal with now-fiancée Emmy Sharrett.

	Taking to his Instagram Stories yesterday, per Parade, Kulp wrote in full: “A little update: The new season has started filming, and unsurprisingly, I will not be a part of it this year. I will likely never film a second of reality TV ever again. It has been a horrible experience and a life lesson.”

	“A big thanks to some cast, some production, Andy Cohen and ALL of the crew for the seasons past. You know who you are. Your kindness and professionalism are rare occurrences in the industry.”


	“Best of luck to this new season. I hope it can be entertaining without a defamatory storyline or unwanted use of my name, image, and likeness,” Kulp continued. “When it is appropriate, I will talk more about experiences with production and the network which led to this decision.”


	He concluded, “I am happy to be moving on and I will be cheering Emmy on from the sidelines with the rest of you.”


	First premiering in 2022, Southern Hospitality saw recent ratings wins for the cable network, with Season 3 up 22% from its previous installment's overall audience average, becoming Bravo's first original series to grow in each of its first three seasons since 2018.

WNBA All-Star players got straight to the point on the court ahead of their All-Star game on Saturday: “Pay Us What You Owe Us” their T-shirts read as they warmed up. The players union and league management have been in ongoing collective bargaining agreement negotiations.


	On Thursday, more than 40 players attended a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) meeting, which apparently did not land on a mutually agreeable deal getting done. Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was at the meeting.


	“We should be paid more and hopefully that's the case moving forward as the league continues to grow,” Clark said in a video posted on social platform X. “I think that's something that's probably the most important thing that we're in the room advocating about.”


	Clark, who was present at the All-Star game on Saturday, was unable to play due to a right groin injury.


	Thursday's CBA meeting was the first time the league and the players union, the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA), have met in person since December. “We were disappointed for sure,” co-WNBA All-Star captain Napheesa Collier said on Friday, via ESPN. “What they came back with was just nowhere near what we asked for or even in the same conversation.”

	











	Ahead of the game, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert offered an optimistic viewpoint contrasting the players' apparent outlook on the negotiations. “We want the same things that the players want,” Engelbert said in a Saturday press conference prior to game time, via Sportico. “We want to significantly increase their salary and benefits while balancing with our owners their ability to have a path to profitability as well as continued investment.”

	The opposing viewpoints highlight how far apart the WNBPA and league management appear to be in negotiations. The labor fight is centered on the union's call for a revamp on revenue sharing, where players would receive a bigger percentage of league revenue. Englebert has said the next pass will be “much more lucrative.” However, players have said that what has been recently proposed was far from “equitable.”


	As the WNBA grapples with labor negotiations, it has also been expanding, with three new cities being added in the next five years. With its expansion, racial attacks against players have also been growing.

Tom Cruise was married to Katie Holmes from 2006 to 2012. Now, the “Wonder Boys” actress has seemingly weighed in on the flurry of media attention her former flame is receiving for spending a lot of time lately with actress Ana de Armas, who portrayed Marilyn Monroe in the 2022 film “Blonde.”

Eagle-eyed fans noticed the 46-year-old had reacted to the rumored pairing by “liking” a May 1 Instagram post by the Daily Mail which bore the headline, “Tom Cruise and Ana de Armas love affair confirmed.” The story suggested Cruise and the 37-year-old beauty had “confirmed their love affair is real” by flying into London together ahead of de Armas' birthday.

The outlet claims another of Cruise's exes, 51-year-old Penelope Cruz, is “happy her ex-boyfriend has found new love.” The Mail reported in May they were told by an unnamed source that “Ana has said that Penelope is happy for her, she approves.” The source also said, “They know each other from the movie and also they have friends in common in Madrid from when Ana lived there for a while,” according to the story.

On July 17, 2025, Page Six reported the performers had been photographed by Backgrid spending time together in Menorca. In the shots, the pair can be seen sitting on a boat across from each other. They both looked relaxed in lightweight summer wear as they shielded their faces from the sun under hats.

E! News called the excursion “an intimate yacht date” and reminded fans the pair is set to star across from each other in the upcoming nautical action film “Deeper,” to be directed by Doug Liman. The outlet also pointed out that de Armas appeared to rest her hand on Cruise's leg in one of the shots.

As you know, the “Mission Impossible” star and de Armas first sparked romance rumors around Valentine's Day 2025 after being spotted together at a dinner. However, Elle pointed out that the pair's agents were also at the dinner, and said a source told people that the two were simply “discussing potential collaborations down the line.”

Ana de Armas' John Wick film “Ballerina” dropped June 6, 2025 and Tom Cruise enthusiastically supported the movie. 

Discussing the project with the Associated Press, Cruise said, “I love John Wick and what those guys do. I know what it takes to create these kinds of stories. Now you have ‘Ballerina' coming out with Ana. That's outstanding.” He emphasized that the movie was on his list of summer films he was “really excited about” before giving more praise to de Armas. 

“She's gonna kill it. Really, really talented.”

	President Donald Trump said Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) should cancel the Senate's summer break and long weekends in order to confirm Trump's nominees, which include some controversial picks, more quickly in a Truth Social post Saturday. 


	“Hopefully the very talented John Thune, fresh off our many victories over the past two weeks and, indeed, 6 months, will cancel August recess (and long weekends!), in order to get my incredible nominees confirmed,” Trump wrote. “We need them badly!!!”


	The Senate is expected to go on recess from Aug. 4 to Sept. 1. It is one of 14 breaks or long weekends on the 2025 calendar. Their most recent break was June 30 to July 4, and then there is another break toward the end of September. Even when the Senate is in session, lawmakers are generally only in their Capitol Hill offices a few days a week, with ample time to travel back home. 


	Senators are scheduled to vote on six nominations on Monday, including Bradley Hansell for under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, and John Hurley for under secretary for terrorism and financial crimes. The Senate is also slated for a major vote on a funding bill.

	The Senate could soon vote on Emil Bove, a controversial nominee to become a judge on a federal appeals court. He served as one of Trump's personal lawyers before taking a role at the Justice Department. 


	A whistleblower said in June that Bove told lawyers at the Justice Department they “would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you' and ignore any such court order” that would block Trump from sending immigrants to prison in El Salvador. 

	











	The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced his nomination earlier this week, prompting Democrats to walk out. 


	“I have respect for you Mr. Chairman, but this is outrageous, this is unacceptable, this is wrong,” said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). “This is an abuse of power. It is an undermining of the wellbeing and the integrity of this Senate.”

	More than 75 former judges asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject Bove's nomination.


	“Mr. Bove's egregious record of mistreating law enforcement officers, abusing power, and disregarding the law itself disqualifies him for this position,” the group wrote.


	Another controversial nominee is former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, who is up for the role of U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C. Trump's first choice for the position was Republican lawyer Ed Martin, but he dropped the bid amid opposition. 


	The Senate Judiciary Committee also voted to advance Pirro's nomination. 


	Brian Christine, Trump's nominee for assistant health and human services secretary, is an Alabama urologist who said the issue of teen pregnancy should be left to “the purview of the parents.”


	He also said that “society works best when men and women are fulfilling their roles, when they are doing what they're supposed to do, raising children and propagating the species.”

	Dozens of people in Malaysia protested the possibility of “alpha male” influencer Nick Adams becoming U.S. ambassador to the country over his posts criticizing Islam and supporting the Israeli military.


	Another nomination drawing controversy is that of law professor Jennifer Mascott, Trump's nominee for a federal appeals court seat in Delaware. She is not licensed to practice law in the state.

Pee-wee Herman's original red bike has found a new home at the Alamo. 


	On Friday, the Alamo revealed in a celebratory Instagram post that the stunt bicycle featured in the original 1985 film Pee-wee's Big Adventure will be featured in the museum that is set to open in 2027.




	“In celebration of the 40th anniversary of Pee-wee's Big Adventure this summer, the Alamo has officially acquired the original screen-used stunt bike from the film,” the post read. “The bike will be permanently displayed in the future Alamo Visitor Center and Museum, opening in Fall 2027.”

	While there's still roughly two years until Pee-wee's iconic red bike will be available to view at the Alamo, they further announced that fans will be available to see the piece of movie magic in a limited-time showing inside the Ralston Family Collection Center. 


	“We'll also be hosting a free public screening of the film in the newly reopened Plaza de Valero. Until then, don't worry… the bike will be stored for safekeeping,” the post concluded. “Maybe in the basement!”


	In Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Paul Reubens‘ Pee-wee Herman heads out on quite a big adventure to get his stolen bike back. Early in May, People reported the bike had been sold at a memorabilia auction to a private collector for $125,000.

DALLAS — One year after the assassination attempt on President Donald Trump, one of the first major films delving into conspiracy theories around the shooting will premiere; not far from the home of one of the nation's biggest conspiracy theories.

The documentary “Who Shot Trump” is already streaming online and will have its theatrical premiere at the Angelika Film Center Dallas on Sunday, July 27. In the documentary, filmmaker J.D. Wilcox investigates the shooting that took place near Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024, and tries to find answers about what all took place that day.

Wilcox, who lives in the Dallas area, said he was instantly drawn to investigate the situation, as he watched the incident unfold live on TV that day. After all, given where he calls home these days, he said this isn't the first presidential shooting he's taken a closer look at.

“For an investigative reporter, this is sort of like Mecca,” said Wilcox as he stood on the Grassy Knoll at Dallas' Dealey Plaza. “You have to come here.”

Dealey Plaza is, of course, where President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963. In the 60-plus years since, some of the world's most prominent and well-known conspiracy theories have sprung up around the incident—hypotheses about additional shooters and government or organized crime involvements, just to name a few.

Wilcox said he's done his fair share of investigation into that incident as well, but instantly shifted his focus to the Trump shooting last year.

“There's absolutely been a cover-up,” said Wilcox.

In the year since then-candidate Trump was shot at while on stage at a campaign rally, several investigations into the incident have taken place concluding various issues and errors occurred that day but ultimately that the blame for the shooting lies on 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, who was shot and killed by the Secret Service that day.

Many continue to question the incident, including Wilcox.

“My crew and I went to Butler, Pennsylvania,” he said with skilled investigators and experts, “and during that process, we uncovered really, really substantial forensic evidence.”

Wilcox hopes his findings and thoughts on the incident will help lead to more clarity on that day, but as a North Texan, his thoughts go to that infamous conspiracy theory stemming from 1963 as well.

As Wilcox stood at Dealey Plaza, dozens of visitors toured the historic site around him, many of whom openly presented their own theories to one another about “who really shot JFK” and “what really happened that day.” Reflecting on his new documentary and the many other conspiracy theories he's heard online and in the community about the Trump assassination attempt, Wilcox ponders if that incident will have a similar legacy to the Kennedy one, drawing visitors to theorize in Butler decades later.

“My hope is that 60 years from now, we don't have the mystery that we have today,” said Wilcox.

Whether viewers agree with his take or dismiss it, he hopes it'll keep the conversation going and keep encouraging others to ask questions about this new moment in presidential history, just like they still do with the 60-year-old one in Dallas.

The Annabelle doll, a supposedly haunted relic, was found missing from paranormal investigator Dan Rivera's hotel room after his death in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, People reported.

The 54-year-old was found dead in his hotel room on July 13 after leading a sold-out ghost tour called "Devils on the Run" at the Soldiers National Orphanage, which featured the Annabelle doll.

The cause of death remains unknown, with autopsy results expected in eight to ten weeks. However, the authorities confirmed that Rivera's death didn't appear suspicious, and he was found alone in his hotel room. Adams County Coroner Francis Dutrow told People Friday that the doll wasn't in the room when first responders found Rivera.

The Annabelle doll is believed to be haunted and has been linked to a series of paranormal activities since the 1970s. According to the New England Society for Psychic Research's website, the doll was gifted to a student nurse. She brought it home, where she lived with her roommate in 1968.



"Almost immediately, the roommates noticed strange occurrences with the doll and they were introduced to a medium who told them the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle," the organisation wrote. "The two roommates tried to accept the doll's spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent."

Ed and Lorraine Warren, renowned paranormal investigators, claimed the doll was "demonically possessed".

The doll also inspired the horror film franchise The Conjuring.

Conspiracy theorists have linked Rivera's death to the Annabelle doll, despite police statements that nothing unusual or suspicious was found at the scene. Some fans and followers are also speculating about the doll's curse, while others are paying tribute to Rivera's work and legacy.

In a report shared on July 16, the Pennsylvania State Police said, "Members from PSP Gettysburg responded to a hotel in Straban Township, Adams County for a report of a deceased [man]."

"The decedent was discovered in his hotel room by workers. Nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene."

Despite Rivera's death, the New England Society for Psychic Research plans to continue their supernatural tour, honouring Rivera's memory.

If you're still missing Supernatural, you should check out this similar show that will give you plenty to binge watch. Following brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester as they travel around the country hunting monsters, Supernatural ran for an impressive fifteen seasons on the CW.

Supernatural brilliantly combined monster-of-the-week episodes with season-long storylines, developing a complex mythology throughout its fifteen seasons. There are a lot of shows out there with elements that could appeal to Supernatural fans, but perhaps no show feels as much like Supernatural as The X-Files.

With its stories of cross-country monster hunting, Supernatural was heavily influenced by The X-Files, and even referenced the show in its pilot episode. The X-Files follows FBI Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) as they handle the cases that are too strange for the regular FBI.

The best X-Files episodes include Monster of the Week and Alien mythology episodes, making it an iconic show.

Where many of Supernatural's monsters come from folklore, The X-Files skews more paranormal, diving into conspiracy theories involving UFOs and alien abductions. Both shows blend horror, drama, and humor in fascinating ways, and both feature unforgettable characters you cannot help but fall in love with.

Several actors have appeared in both shows, including Mark Sheppard and Mitch Pileggi. A few crew members worked on both shows as well, most notably Kim Manners, who served as both a director and producer.

Several Supernatural episodes borrow ideas from episodes of The X-Files, from the more frightening stories like "Family Remains" (The X-Files: "Home") to the hilarious ones like "Mystery Spot" (The X-Files: "Monday"). Like Supernatural, The X-Files combines standalone mysteries with season-long arcs, developing its own (sometimes convoluted) mythology.

Few shows run as long as Supernatural, and a sixteenth season remains a distinct possibility, but The X-Files has plenty of content to keep you busy in the meantime. The X-Files initially aired from 1993 to 2002, delivering nine seasons (and a movie) of alien shenanigans and a will-they-won't-they romance for the ages.

The X-Files season 9 is the lowest-rated out of any season of the acclaimed science fiction series so what exactly went so wrong with it?

The first X-Files movie, The X-Files: Fight the Future, premiered in theaters between seasons 5 and 6 and focused on the show's ongoing mythology. A second film, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, premiered in theaters in 2008, delivering a standalone story but ultimately ending the series on a lackluster note.

Although X-Files creator Chris Carter had plans for a third film, I Want to Believe did not perform well enough at the box office to warrant a sequel.

In 2016, Agents Mulder and Scully returned yet again for more alien adventures in a revival that lasted for two seasons on Fox network. While the mythology aspects of these seasons were met with mixed reviews, they nevertheless delivered some incredibly fun episodes that are well worth watching.

Another X-Files reboot is currently in the works from Sinners director Ryan Coogler, proving that just like Supernatural, The X-Files refuses to stay dead for long.

From "She's the One" to "The Canister," the very best episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond are still just as hilarious and relatable today.

TV comedy is a notoriously difficult art form to master, but these 20 must-watch sitcoms perfected it while blazing a trail for others to follow.

While Nintendo platforming fans will eat DK Bananza up, the open-ended nature of the game will appeal to a lot more than just a select niche.

Pokémon TCG's Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box comes with great collectible goodies, and the latest TCG set has some great cards inspired by Gen 5.

The choice-based game Truer than You succeeds in many areas that are vital for the success of any visual story. However, it falls short in key areas.

One of Netflix's most controversial cancellations of recent years has led to calls for a comeback from the show's cast and creators as well as fans.

Bosch: Legacy's cancellation was a huge disappointment for viewers, but luckily, the character has already returned in the new spinoff show.

On Sunday, July 27, from 7-9 p.m., you can take part in the first paranormal investigation at Playcrafters Barn Theatre in Moline, a news release says. 

QC Haunts & History, S&S Paranormal Investigations, and Haunted Maps will lead the investigations. Proceeds will go to directly to Playcrafters.

The theater's history dates back to 1929 with a group of “wandering” actors and crew who performed anywhere they could. In 1958, Dr. William Otis gave Playcrafters the dairy barn from the Deere Experimental Farm. The barn was built in 1914. It had been sitting unused since 1933 on the Otis property. On Oct. 5, 1960, Playcrafters performed its first production, “Born Yesterday,” in its new home. 

“People hear footsteps going up and down the stairs. My husband and I have heard people talking on the stage when no one's there. We've checked around to find out who it was, but we haven't found anyone in those cases. It's just been us,” said Jacque Cohoon, Playcrafters board president. “We're very curious about what we'll find during the paranormal investigation.”

The cost of the ghost hunt is $40 per person. Recommended age is 13 and up; children under 18 must be accompanied by an adult. To purchase tickets, contact Minda here or text 309-781-7083.

Participants will have access to equipment and will be joined by experienced paranormal investigators.

“While we enjoy guiding people during these events and discovering what we can about the history of the location and those who came before us, what's most important to us is to help local businesses—especially the arts. Whether you're a believer in the supernatural or not, I think we can all agree that supporting our community is important,” said Minda Powers-Douglas of QC Haunts & History.

QC Haunts also offers ghost tours in downtown Rock Island and the Village of East Davenport. Visit here for more information.

Everyone always roots for their favorite TV series to enjoy long runs, but when they do, there's always a chance that they will go downhill. Such is the case with some of the most popular series of all time, like Dexter or The Simpsons. And while there are cases of shows recovering after going downhill, like The Simpsons, more commonly, a good show turned bad is likely to only get worse the longer it goes on.

Far too often, the best TV shows will destroy their legacies by lasting far too long and failing to maintain their quality. They ruin their characters, confuse their lore, and pump out episodes endlessly without a point in sight. Not all of these series necessarily went on for a massively long time, but they all needed to end far sooner than they did.

Supernatural has become the poster child for TV series that needed to die far sooner than they did. In its early years, the urban fantasy was a fun spiritual successor to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, depicting the episodic adventures of demon hunters Sam and Dean Winchester, while also building out its interesting lore and dramatic central conflict. While the series' premise was strong enough to work initially, it did not have nearly enough fuel to keep the show going for the 15 seasons that it ended up running for.

Supernatural was originally intended to end with the conclusion of Season 5.

For 10 seasons and over 200 episodes, Supernatural is an unbearable, repetitive slog. The longest-running series to never win an Emmy, not once during its latter two-thirds, did it ever come close to being worthy of one. Not every season of Supernatural post-Season 5 is outright terrible, with some even being okay, but they're bereft of original ideas, the poor treatment of the supporting cast becomes increasingly inexcusable, and the main cast becomes downright annoying to follow.

 Nearly 20 years since it first premiered, How I Met Your Mother doesn't hold up at all, but there are still plenty of fun laughs and wholesome moments to be found in the traditional sitcom's early seasons. However, the core mystery of who Ted Mosby's future wife could be was not built to last for 9 seasons. As a result, the show becomes painfully boring and unfunny in its final seasons, and the series remains infamous for having one of the worst series finales of all time.

The ending of How I Met Your Mother Season 9 was scripted during Season 1.

How I Met Your Mother begins to get worse during Season 3, but it's Season 5 where it runs out of organic ideas and stops being funny. The switch in focus to Barney Stinson doesn't work at all, charming as Neil Patrick Harris may be, and all the time devoted to him and his romance with Robin Scherbatsky is rendered meaningless by Season 9. And, while its finale may overshadow everything else about it, Season 9 as a whole is still one of the weakest final seasons for any sitcom.

 While Dexter initially got continually worse with each season after its first outing, it blew fans away with the unmatched brilliance of Season 4. The conflict between serial killer Dexter Morgan and the even more monstrous Trinity Killer made for some of the best TV drama of the 2000s, and it seemed impossible that the show would ever be able to top itself. Sure enough, this proved to be the case, although no one could have predicted what a roller coaster of quality Dexter's final four seasons would be.

Since the airing of its finale, Dexter has received two sequel series, as well as a prequel series.

From Game of Thrones to Breaking Bad to The Sopranos, some of the best TV shows to date are those with mature audiences in mind.

Dexter Season 5 isn't bad, but it marks the biggest drop in quality in the series yet, and it kills all the momentum from Season 4. Season 6, meanwhile, is a boring, nonsensical mess that actively insults its audience's intelligence. Seasons 7 and 8 are better than Season 6, because they had to be, but still neither comes close to matching the quality of Dexter's earlier years.

Suits is a series about Mike Ross, a fake lawyer at a prestigious law firm who constantly works to make sure no one finds out he never actually went to law school. While not the series' only strong point, it was very much carried by the endlessly entertaining dynamic between Mike and his smarmy but charming mentor, Harvey Specter. Despite it being well-known that this was the main draw of the show, Suits continued on even after Mike left the series. 

Both of Suits' spin-off series, Pearson and Suits L.A., were canceled after only a single season.

Throughout its first five seasons, Suits burns through its premise as every major character learns Mike's secret one-by-one, before he's openly exposed as a fraud. The end of Season 5 is the series' high point, and Season 6 could have made for an effective epilogue, as it shows what Mike does next after losing everything. Instead, Suits trucked on for three more years, with Season 7 being underwhelming, Season 8 being a complete disaster due to Mike's total absence from it, and Season 9 only being marginally better, even with Mike's return.

Killing Eve may have only lasted four seasons, but the damage done by its final season is still worse than nearly any other in television history. For its first three seasons, its quality wasn't exactly consistent, but the series never came close to being bad, and the steamy drama between MI5 agent Eve Polastri and professional assassin Villanelle. Regardless of Season 3's many flaws, the two leads remained immensely deep and compelling, and there remained a strong desire among fans to receive pay-off for all the romantic and sexual tension between them.

Season 4 of Killing Eve is the only season with a rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Season 4 is so horrendously offensive that it defeats the point of even bothering with the first three seasons. What was previously hailed as one of the best LGBTQ+ dramas on television turns actively homophobic, leading to one of the worst endings in TV history. It's hard to say when Killing Eve should have ended, but Season 4 never should have been allowed to exist.

The first season of Elite is nothing short of iconic. Every member of the ensemble cast is well-developed, every episode is filled with memorable scenes, and the core mystery surrounding the murder of Marina Nunier is flawlessly constructed. Seasons 2 and 3 failed to be quite as legendary, but were still exceptional. The same cannot be said for the subsequent five seasons.

Along with its eight seasons, seven special Elite "Shorts" were released.

With so many streaming services for viewers to binge-watch TV shows like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad, the choices can be overwhelming.

With a change of writers and the loss of most of its best characters, Elite loses everything that made it great, beginning with Season 4. The show turns its focus away from interesting stories in favor of finding ways to include as many sex scenes as possible, and the stories it does tell range from boring to offensive. Season 8 is decent, but it is absolutely not worth sitting through Seasons 4-7 in order to get there.

You's first season was a competent thriller, but not one anyone would expect to lead to four more seasons, with it largely being carried by Penn Badgley's brilliant performance as the enigmatic and despicable Joe Goldberg. Season 2 is where the series became something truly special, thanks to its subversion of Season 1's formula and the introduction of the show's best character, Love Quinn. After peaking, however, You just continued to get worse with each of its following three seasons.

You began life as a Lifetime series, before finding a permanent home on Netflix, beginning with Season 2.

Season 3 is where Joe becomes insufferable, not just as a person, but as a protagonist, and the plot is the least interesting yet. Seasons 4 and 5, meanwhile, are complete nonsense that lack any of the atmosphere or effective twists of Seasons 1 and 2, and that lose track of who Joe is as a character. By the time Season 5 ends, Badgley's acting is far from enough to make the show bearable.

 With its first two parts, Money Heist tells a fantastic, complete story that's enjoyable from start to finish and that does justice to all its main characters. The show was about a group of masters in their field coming together to perform the ultimate robbery, as they grow as individuals and together as a found family, and it executed this premise to near perfection. But, due to Money Heist's popularity, it received an additional three parts that ruined the flawless ending of the first two.

Money Heist received a Korean remake in 2022.

The final three parts of Money Heist ask, "what if everything that went right from the robbers during the first heist went wrong?" and the result is genuinely compelling drama, with some great new characters being added to the mix as well. The problem is that they pointlessly rip away the happy endings of several fan-favorite characters, killing several of them off in cruel, borderline sexist ways, and it does this while feeling like it lacks any real point. Every season of Money Heist is perfectly watchable, but its latter three are noticeably weaker, and they retroactively make the first two parts worse.

No series with so much initial promise has ever wound up being as bad as Sliders. For its first two seasons, Sliders is an inconsistent series, but one with a lot of heart and passion behind it, that chronicles the adventures of a genius college student, his best friend, his professor, and a washed-up musician as they travel between different versions of Earth, where history played out differently, in an effort to get back to their own home. At its best, Sliders offers some of the greatest sci-fi stories of its era, but from Season 3 onwards, episodes of that level become few and far between.

Sliders was canceled by Fox after Season 3, but survived by moving to the Sci-Fi Channel.

From Scrubs to Futurama and everything in between, some TV show episodes have ripped audiences' heartstrings out.

Season 3 spends most of its time ripping off horror movies, and it marks the first of several instances of the series writing out its original cast members in horrible ways. Season 4 gets even worse, as the lore of the series is rewritten, and Sliders devolves into a generic and horribly executed sci-fi action series. By comparison, Season 5 is a bit better, but even it is mostly just boring, with each passing episode making a viewer question what they're even still doing here.

Gossip Girl Season 1 is one of the best and most influential seasons of television of the 21st Century. Depicting the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite, it was bold, controversial, witty, steamy, fun and, perhaps most importantly, satirical. The tragic downward spiral Gossip Girl goes on throughout its six-season run can almost entirely be attributed to it forgetting that it was mocking the millionaires and billionaires it focuses on, not taking them, their meaningless drama, and their ridiculous schemes seriously.

A Gossip Girl reboot was released on HBO Max in 2021 and ran for two seasons.

While there is fun to be had with the middle seasons of Gossip Girl, the lack of bite and self-awareness hurts the series immensely. And the longer it goes on, the less fun it gets, especially as the focus increasingly gets placed on Chuck Bass. Gossip Girl doesn't even manage to stick the landing when it comes to the mystery surrounding the identity of its eponymous blogger, with the answer being one of the few people it literally could not have been.

Dexter: Resurrection brings back Michael C. Hall in the Dexter sequel fans were waiting for, but now this overdue show feels unintentionally dated.

9-1-1 has a passionate fanbase, and Tommy Kinard is a massive sore spot for the show's vocal fans.

If all goes to plan, a new Star Trek series will be on the way soon.

The Season 3 premiere episodes of Strange New Worlds have big implications for Star Trek canon, but that's not the most important part of the show.

It's the 10th anniversary of the Wachowski's most ambitious and mind-bending project, even more than The Matrix films, Sense8 which aired on Netflix.

Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg's live-action adaptation of Uncharted is finding new streaming success three years after it bombed with critics.
