Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass repeatedly dodged answering directly on whether all illegal immigrants in the sanctuary city should be allowed to stay. In an interview with ABC's "This Week," Bass further criticized President Donald Trump's decision to federalize 4,000 National Guard troops and deploy about 700 Marines to Los Angeles amid anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots and protests. The Democratic mayor was questioned by ABC host Martha Raddatz on who she thinks should be deported – whether that should be just people convicted of crimes – given Los Angeles has about a million "undocumented workers." "Let me just say that, because we are a city of immigrants, we have entire sectors of our economy that are dependent on immigrant labor. We have to get the fire areas rebuilt. We're not going to get our city rebuilt without immigrant labor," Bass claimed. Mayor Karen Bass speaks on June 10, 2025, in Los Angles against the Trump administration sending National Guard troops to the city. "No, let me just tell you, what I think we need is comprehensive immigration reform. I served in Congress for 12 years," Bass said. Raddatz again interrupted the mayor, noting that Bass, as a congresswoman, did not ensure the passage of such immigration reform. "And why didn't we get it? I mean, after I left, there was an immigration reform bill that had bipartisan support," Bass said, attempting to blame Trump. The president decided he didn't want to have it happen because he didn't want immigration reform to happen, where he didn't take credit for it." Noting the surge in border crossings under former President Joe Biden, Raddatz recalled asking a Border Patrol agent whether he felt badly for illegal immigrants. U.S. Marines and National Guard troops protecting the entrance of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, California on July 4, 2025. "Let me just tell you that the people that make that trek, many of whom walk from Central America and even South America up to our border, risk their lives. I don't believe that all of these people are sitting at home dreaming of coming to Los Angeles," Bass said in response. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) figures, however, recorded about 10.8 million border encounters and roughly two million more known "got-a-ways" during Biden's term. Trump, meanwhile, has reported record-low border crossings since he began his second term. If you ask me, is there anything that they have done good in terms of immigration, I don't know. I think that the viewpoint has been punitive, has been, let's make it as miserable as possible so that these people don't come." U.S. Marines and National Guard in Los Angeles, California on July 4, 2025. I will always be open to a conversation," the mayor said. We have the World Cup in 11 short months here. We have Olympics and Paralympics coming in three short years. I know that these games are very important to the president and I look forward to working with him, and we have an extreme difference on this issue, but there's many issues for us to work on, and I will continue trying to outreach to the administration and hope that at some point they'll be responsive." The mayor also responded to how she hopes the next six months to two years will be for immigrants in Los Angeles, taking a dig at what she deemed the Trump administration's "reign of terror." The Pentagon last week announced it was pulling 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, citing how the "lawlessness" seen in early June anti-ICE riots has subsided. "Well, I am just hoping that this reign of terror ends. I'm hoping that the military leaves because they were never needed here to begin with," Bass said. "I hope that we can get back to normal."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A man died last week after being pulled into an MRI machine by a “large metallic chain” police said he was wearing around his neck – highlighting the importance of checking for any metallic objects before going near the powerful magnets used in the medical imaging machines. The 61-year-old died Thursday, a day after Nassau County police said he was pulled into the MRI machine at Nassau Open MRI in Westbury, New York, on Long Island. The victim was wearing “a large metallic chain around his neck causing him to be drawn into the machine,” prompting an unspecified “medical episode,” police said in a news release. He was taken to a hospital in critical condition before he was declared dead the following day. Police have not identified the victim, but CNN affiliate News 12 Long Island reported his name was Keith McAllister, according to his wife, Adrienne Jones-McAllister. “He went limp in my arms,” Jones-McAllister said through tears. A person who answered the phone at Nassau Open MRI on Sunday said it had no comment. Used often for disease detection and diagnosis, MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, according to the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. The technology relies in part on powerful magnets to stimulate protons within a patient, who is placed inside the machine, allowing doctors to capture detailed images of the patient's anatomy. That strong magnetic field, however, emanates beyond the MRI machine, posing a threat to those who might be wearing metallic objects or have them implanted. The magnets exert “very powerful forces on objects of iron, some steels, and other magnetizable objects,” the scientific institute notes, with enough strength “to fling a wheelchair across the room.” Jones-McAllister was getting an MRI on her knee, she told News 12, and needed help getting up afterwards. According to News 12, Jones-McAllister said her husband was wearing around his neck a 20-pound chain with a large lock he used for weight training. “At that instant, the machine switched him around, pulled him in, and he hit the MRI,” Jones-McAllister said. “I'm saying, ‘Could you turn off the machine? Because of the risks posed by an MRI machine's magnetic field, patients are urged to notify their doctors about any medical implants prior to an MRI, in case they contain any metallic materials. Pacemakers, insulin pumps and cochlear implants are all examples of implants that the NIBIB says should under no circumstances enter an MRI machine. Anything magnetic – from something as small as keys, to something as large (or larger) than an oxygen tank – can become a projectile, threatening the safety of anyone nearby. “Metal in a room that has the magnet will fly across the room to the scanner, to this large magnet, and will really hit anything in its way,” Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiologist, told CNN in 2011. “So within radiology training, one learns very early that that's not OK, that you can't have external metal in the room, and you can't have metal in the patient,” she said. These accidents have happened in the past: In 2001, a 6-year-old boy was killed during an MRI at a hospital in Valhalla, New York, after a metal oxygen tank flew across the room when the machine's electromagnet turned on. These events are rare, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. Still, “(c)areful screening of people and objects entering the MR environment is critical to ensure nothing enters the magnet area that may become a projectile,” the agency says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Workers finish installing the Cleveland Guardians sign above the scoreboard at Progressive Field, March 17, 2022, in Cleveland. Washington Commanders jerseys are displayed at an event to unveil the NFL football team's new identity, Feb. 2, 2022, in Landover, Md. CLEVELAND (AP) — President Donald Trump wants Washington's football franchise and Cleveland's baseball team to revert to their former names. Trump said Sunday on his Truth Social site that “The Washington ‘Whatever's' should IMMEDIATELY change their name back to the Washington Redskins Football Team. There is a big clamoring for this. Our great Indian people, in massive numbers, want this to happen. Their heritage and prestige is systematically being taken away from them. Times are different now than they were three or four years ago. We are a Country of passion and common sense. Josh Harris, whose group bought the Commanders from former owner Dan Snyder in 2023, said earlier this year the name was here to stay. Not long after taking over, Harris quieted speculation about going back to Redskins, saying that would not happen. Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti indicated before Sunday's game against the Athletics that there weren't any plans to revisit the name change. Both teams have had their current names since the 2022 seasons. Washington dropped Redskins after the 2019 season and was known as the Washington Football Team for two years before moving to Commanders. Cleveland announced in December 2020 it would drop Indians. It announced the switch to Guardians in July 2021. In 2018, the team phased out “Chief Wahoo” as its primary logo. Washington started in Boston as the Redskins in 1933 before moving to the nation's capital four years later. Washington and Cleveland share another thing in common. David Blitzer is a member of Harris' ownership group with the Commanders and holds a minority stake in the Guardians.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since receiving its mass deportation edict after President Donald Trump took office in January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has fielded criticism from people inside the administration who think they aren't doing enough, lawmakers and advocates who think they are doing too much, and an incensed public that in some cases is taking drastic action to impede immigration enforcement. ICE, a Homeland Security official told CNN, “keeps getting kicked in the teeth.” Now, ICE is set to receive $75 billion in funding from the president's sweeping agenda bill for detention expansion and enforcement and removal operations, including hiring new agents. It's an unprecedented amount of cash for an agency that's historically been underfunded, and Trump administration officials are preparing to make the most of it. “We're going to come harder and faster, and we're going to take these criminals down with even more strength than we ever have before,” Noem said this month, describing how the infusion of cash will bolster her agency's immigration-enforcement apparatus. ICE is charged with arresting and detaining immigrants in the United States. In multiple interagency discussions, senior Trump administration officials have been drafting plans to hire thousands more agents and drastically expand immigrant detention. White House border czar Tom Homan told CNN he's been in regular calls with ICE and US Customs and Border Protection to check on progress with contracts, though he's largely recused himself from the process given previous work, and he's in discussions over how to bring on thousands more officers and bolster the academy where they're trained. But top of mind is bringing online thousands more detention beds to keep pace with arrests. The cash comes at a critical time for ICE, which was maxed out on detention space and was grappling with fewer than 200 available beds on a daily basis, according to Homan. Around 57,000 people are currently in ICE custody, according to federal data obtained by CNN. The pressure to pivot to immigration enforcement has also extended to components of DHS that have not typically been responsible for arresting immigrants in the interior, including the Homeland Security Investigations arm, which focuses on a wide range of criminal activity, including human trafficking and cybercrime, among other threats to national security. But I've heard that other agencies want to get back to their mission whenever we bring more people on board, hire more immigration people,” he said. “They have now the blank check to do all these things,” a former Homeland Security official told CNN. ICE alone is set to receive nearly $75 billion through 2029, including about $45 billion that is being set aside specifically to increase capacity at immigration detention centers. The other nearly $30 billion is going toward enforcement and removal — a cash windfall that will be directed toward the front-line ICE operations that involve arresting immigrants and transporting them to detention centers. “Every single day they have people out on the field, holidays, weekends be damned. The administration plans to make a big push toward recruiting, bringing people back who have retired, hiring from other law enforcement agencies, and increasing the capability of the academy where agents train more quickly. Messages have already gone out to retired ICE officers, asking that they return and offering financial incentives such as bonuses. “You served the United States of America with distinction and honor,” reads an email addressed to former ICE officials from Deputy Director Madison Sheahan and obtained by CNN. “Now, your country calls upon you to serve once more.” We'll have people in place ready to attend classes. More than $46 billion will be funneled toward the construction and maintenance of border barriers, helping Trump to fulfill a promise he made when he mounted his first presidential campaign a decade ago. “There are all kinds of plans when we have more money,” the Homeland Security official said. “It's honestly more boots on the ground to do enforcement. As ICE detentions rise, the Trump administration has put in place a series of policies that have drastically curtailed opportunities for migrants to be released and paved the way for people to be swiftly deported to countries that are not their own. The White House and Department of Homeland Security maintain that those being targeted for arrest are public safety and national security threats. That's contributed to growing alarm among immigrant advocates and attorneys, especially on the heels of new guidance that will largely prevent people who are brought into ICE custody from being released. In a recent memo, the acting director of ICE told agents that immigrants who arrived in the US illegally going back decades were no longer eligible for a bond hearing while they fight their deportations in immigration court. In other words, those previously allowed to remain out on bond as their case made its way through the immigration system, which can take years, now could be taken into custody and spend months in detention. “The Trump administration is doing a complete end-run around our court system with DHS now telling immigration judges what powers they have and what they don't have — most recently with the July 8 DHS memo that strips judges of the power they've exercised for decades to decide whether a person should be detained,” said Gregory Chen, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Legal orientation programs in detention facilities have also largely been dismantled after the federal government cut funding for those programs, leaving immigrants in detention with little to no resources to navigate the arduous immigration system in the moments before they're deported. ICE has made a visible push to deploy officers nationwide and carry out sweeps in places that have generally been off-limits, like courthouses. The agency has also stepped up raids on farms and places where day laborers congregate, like Home Depot parking lots. Those tactics have fueled tension among Republicans, some of whom have expressed concern over enforcement actions on industries where immigrants remain a vital source of labor. “We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have — maybe not,” Trump said during a June news conference, acknowledging that tension. Democratic elected officials have also criticized the agency's tactics as heavy-handed and reminiscent of some of the darkest moments in modern history. Tim Walz has described ICE under Trump as a “modern-day Gestapo.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the agency's immigration sweeps in her city last month — the catalyst for days of protests — left her “deeply angered.” California Sen. Alex Padilla said the administration's push for higher arrest and deportation numbers is making the agency and its employees “more aggressive, more cruel [and] more extreme.” “Any violence against law enforcement is unacceptable,” Padilla said on CNN earlier this month. “Do I think heated rhetoric is part of what's causing this response? Last month, Padilla was forced to the ground and briefly handcuffed after interrupting Noem during a press conference amid tensions in Los Angeles over the administration's crackdown. In New Jersey, Rep. LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, has been indicted on charges of assaulting and impeding law enforcement stemming from a clash outside of a Newark detention facility that also led to the arrest of the city's mayor, Ras Baraka. Baraka's charges were later dropped; McIver, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to face trial in November. The third prong of pressure has come from citizens who, in some cases, are adopting increasingly militant postures to oppose ICE and the administration's enforcement actions. In some instances, which have been widely publicized by the administration, people have pelted federal law enforcement or their vehicles with rocks, bricks and other solid objects. Days later, a gunman was killed after opening fire on a Customs and Border Protection facility in Texas, injuring one officer. And on July 10, federal officers conducting enforcement on a marijuana farm in California were met with gunfire, though nobody was injured. “I am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself,” he said in a July 11 social media post, “just like they protect the Public.”</p>

Shaniqua McClendon said during an appearance on MSNBC that former President Obama should be out there speaking out against President Trump more often. An MSNBC panelist urged former President Barack Obama to speak out more often on Saturday after he urged members of his party to "toughen up" at a recent fundraiser. "I know he's done being president, and many will say he doesn't owe us anything else, but I think if we are in a moment of crisis, and you've ever led this country, you should still care about this country enough to be out there. I've had this crazy thought that if every time Donald Trump did something crazy or said something crazy, Barack Obama should have a press conference or something," Shaniqua McClendon, the vice president of political strategy at Crooked Media, said during MSNBC's "The Weekend." McClendon agreed with Obama's recent suggestion that Democrats should "toughen up," but urged the former president to get out there more himself as someone who served as president. And so part of where I don't think it's fair is, most Democrats are not Barack Obama. They can't command attention the way he can. And we're in a media environment that even if you are fighting, if no one hears you, it's not worth anything. So I do think it's fair," McClendon continued. Shaniqua McClendon suggested during an appearance on MSNBC that former President Obama should be doing more to counter President Trump. During a July fundraiser, Obama suggested members of the party should stop complaining so much. "I think it's going to require a little bit less navel-gazing and a little less whining and being in fetal positions. No, now is exactly the time that you get in there and do something." MSNBC host Catherine Rampell wondered if Obama would be accused of sucking up all the oxygen if he was out there more. But those people are not pushing through right now," McClendon said. She suggested some Democrats, such as Reps. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., were breaking through, but most were not. "The point now is that we are in a really dire situation… Our rights are being taken away every day. And if Barack Obama is someone who can push back on that and at least get people to pay attention to the fact that that's happening, it matters a lot. And so, yeah, I think that is not an argument, I wish that was the thing we had to worry about," she added. President Donald Trump listens during a meeting with Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, July 16, 2025, in Washington. Hosts of "The View" criticized Obama's advice, arguing that Democrats had been out there fighting against Trump. Hanna Panreck is an associate editor at Fox News.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the morning of July 4, an American marketing professor was walking towards his ex-wife's house in Athens to pick up their two young children. But Przemyslaw Jeziorski never made it to the front door. In broad daylight, in this typically quiet, suburban neighborhood of Greece's capital, he was shot multiple times at close range, according to police. Jeziorski died where he fell, police said, his body riddled with gunshot wounds seen in grim photographs taken in the immediate aftermath. As eyewitnesses rushed to his aid, the masked gunman fled. The alleged perpetrator, arrested 12 days later for premeditated murder: His ex-wife's new partner. The motive, he told police – to prevent Jeziorski from taking away her children. “I did it all for (her) and our children so that we could have a normal life without problems,” he said, according to a transcript of a statement he made to police in the aftermath of his arrest. Related article Greek police charge five people in murder case of UC Berkeley professor, including his ex-wife The statements, verified as authentic by a senior police source speaking to CNN, offer an insight into how the alleged murder plot was put together, why it was undertaken, and provide clues as to who may have known what, and when. But there are key questions unresolved, too – not least the role, if any, of Jeziorski's ex-wife. Like all the suspects in this case, her identity is known to CNN but cannot be published due to Greek legal restrictions. The alleged perpetrator's confession, and other conflicting accounts from three alleged accomplices that were also leaked to the press, sets up what is likely to be a lengthy and high-profile trial. UC Berkeley said in a statement that Jeziorski “had a passion for teaching” and during his 13 years at the California university, he taught data analytics skills to more than 1,500 graduate and PhD students. His research work centered on emerging markets, which took him around the world for field research, and Berkeley described him as “a leading expert in quantitative marketing, industrial organization, and the economics of digital markets.” It's unclear what led to their relationship falling apart, but Kowalski told CNN the couple broke up around 2020 after moving to Greece during the Covid pandemic. Their children are dual US and Polish citizens, according to a statement from the victim's brother. Jeziorski filed for divorce in June 2021, according to California court records. It appears to be one element in a years-long custody battle for the children, who ultimately lived with their mother in Greece, with a provision that their father, Jeziorski, could take the children for one month every summer. According to Kowalski, Jeziorski asked during the custody battle that his children attend an American school in Greece, so that they could be able to attend high school or college in the US one day. “We were afraid that he (Jeziorski) would end up taking the kids completely. That would completely finish off (my girlfriend), who was overly fond of them. But (my girlfriend) did not agree and so she went back to court with Przemek,” the suspect said, according to the testimony transcript. “A month and a half ago I made the decision to end this torment we were experiencing once and for all,” the suspect told police, adding that it was a “good opportunity” given that Jeziorski was in Athens to attend the custody hearing. The statement details how the suspect says he bought a pistol more than a month ago and asked a friend, who is from Bulgaria, to help him “find Przemek and scare him so that he wouldn't take our children away from us.” He said it all began in Nafplio, a coastal city about two hours from Athens, “so that it would appear that I was there” and his cell phone would “leave traces.” Police said Jeziorski died at the scene, where seven bullet casings were found after a masked gunman shot him in the neck and chest. The three unnamed men who allegedly helped, two Albanian nationals and a Bulgarian national, are facing accomplice charges, police announced Thursday. The suspected accomplices – one of whom is a minor – have confessed to their peripheral involvement in the killing, a Greek police source told CNN on Thursday. CNN has been unable to reach attorneys for those men. “My client has confessed his actions but as you can see from the simplicity of some of the things that took place this was not an organized plan. “(The ex-wife), his partner, knew nothing about any of this.” He had said his partner's ex-husband had serious alcoholism issues and that he and the mother were worried about allowing access to the kids. We will ask for a psychiatric examination because he has had some issues in the past.” Jeziorski's friends have denied the allegations that he abused alcohol. As for the ex-wife – beyond the statement of her lawyer, denying all knowledge, there is no further information about her testimony. These inconsistencies – and other unanswered questions – will all be dealt with at the trial. The victim's brother said in a statement that “our family is heartbroken,” but grateful to Greek police and security professionals who made the arrests. “Przemek's ten-year-old children, who are US and Polish citizens, are now under care in accordance with Greek child custody procedures,” the victim's brother Łukasz Jeziorski said in a statement. “Our primary concern is their safety and wellbeing, and helping them reconnect with their family to minimize the trauma they have already endured.” CNN's Amy Croffey and Chris Dos Santos contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas., speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill, Feb. 6, 2025, in Washington. Greg Abbott speaks as President Donald Trump listens during a roundtable discussion with first responders and local officials at Hill Country Youth Event Center in Kerrville, Texas, during a tour to observe flood damage, Friday, July 11, 2025. AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who represents a slice of the Rio Grande Valley along the border with Mexico, won his last congressional election by just over 5,000 votes. That makes him a tempting target for Republicans, who are poised to redraw the state's congressional maps this coming week and devise five new winnable seats for the GOP that would help the party avoid losing House control in the 2026 elections. Adjusting the lines of Gonzalez's district to bring in a few thousand more Republican voters, while shifting some Democratic ones out, could flip his seat. Those Democratic voters will have to end up in one of the Republican districts that flank Gonzalez's current one, making those districts more competitive — possibly enough so it could flip the seats to Democrats. “Get ready for some pickup opportunities,” Gonzalez said, adding that his party is already recruiting challengers to Republicans whose districts they expect to be destabilized by the process. Republicans now hold 25 and Democrats 12, with one seat vacant after Democrat Sylvester Turner, a former Houston mayor, died in March. Gonzalez's district — and what happens to the neighboring GOP-held ones — is at the crux of President Donald Trump's high-risk, high-reward push to get Texas Republicans to redraw their political map. Trump's push comes as there are numerous political danger signs for his presidency, both in the recent turmoil over his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and in new polling. Surveys from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research show most U.S. adults think his policies have not helped them and that his tax cut and spending bill will help the wealthy. The fear of accidentally creating unsafe seats is one reason Texas Republicans drew their lines cautiously in 2021, when the constitutionally mandated redistricting process kicked off in all 50 states. Mapmakers — in most states, it's the party that controls the legislature — must adjust congressional and state legislative lines after every 10-year census to ensure that districts have about the same number of residents. That is a golden opportunity for one party to rig the map against the other, a tactic known as gerrymandering. That lasted until 2018, when a backlash against Trump in his first term led Democrats to flip two seats in Texas that Republicans had thought safe. In 2021, with Republicans still comfortably in charge of the Texas Statehouse, the party was cautious, opting for a map that mainly shored up their incumbents rather than targeted Democrats. Still, plenty of Republicans believe their Texas counterparts can safely go on offense. “Smart map-drawing can yield pickup opportunities while not putting our incumbents in jeopardy,” said Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which helps coordinate mapmaking for the party nationally.. Greg Abbott called a special session of the Legislature, which starts Monday, to comply with Trump's request to redraw the congressional maps and to address the flooding in Texas Hill Country that killed at least 135 people this month. “I don't think anybody should underestimate the will of Texas Democrats,” he said. Texas is not the only Republican state engaged in mid-decade redistricting. After staving off a ballot measure to expand the power of a mapmaking commission last election, Ohio Republicans hope to redraw their congressional map from a 10-5 one favoring the GOP to one as lopsided as 13-2, in a state Trump won last year with 55% of the vote. Some Democratic leaders have suggested that states where their party is in control should counter the expected redraw in Texas. “We have to be absolutely ruthless about getting back in power,” former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said Sunday on CNN. More of the states the party controls do not allow elected partisans to draw maps and entrust independent commissions to draw fair lines. The few Democratic-controlled states that do allow elected officials to draw the lines, such as Illinois, have already seen Democrats max out their advantages. Trump and his allies have been rallying Texas Republicans to ignore whatever fears they may and to go big. On Tuesday, the president posted on his social media site a reminder of his record in the state last November: “Won by one and a half million Votes, and almost 14%. Also, won all of the Border Counties along Mexico, something which has never happened before. I keep hearing about Texas ‘going Blue,' but it is just another Democrat LIE.” Texas has long been eyed as a state trending Democratic because of its growing nonwhite population. But those communities swung right last year and helped Trump expand his margin to 14 percentage points, a significant improvement on his 6-point win in 2020. Michael Li, a Texas native and longtime watcher of the state at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, said there's no way to know whether that trend will continue in next year's elections or whether the state will return to its blue-trending ways. The heavily Hispanic region, where many Border Patrol officers live, has rallied around Trump's tough-on-immigration, populist message. As a result, Gonzalez and the area's other Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, have seen their reelection campaigns get steadily tighter. If mapmakers scatter Democratic voters from districts in the Houston, Dallas and Austin areas, they could get to five additional seats. But in doing so, Republicans face a legal risk on top of their electoral one: that they break up districts required by the Voting Rights Act to have a critical amount of certain minority groups. The Texas GOP already is facing a lawsuit from civil rights groups alleging its initial 2021 map did this. If this year's redistricting is too aggressive, it could trigger a second complaint. “It's politically and legally risky,” Li said of the redistricting strategy.</p>
