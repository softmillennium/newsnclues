                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy continues accumulating Bitcoin as it hits all-time highs in July, and the total crypto market cap breaches the $4 trillion mark. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor signaled an impending Bitcoin (BTC) purchase on Sunday, as the company's total holdings crossed $71 billion. The treasury company's most recent purchase occurred on July 14, when it bought 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, bringing its total holdings to 601,550 BTC, valued at over $71.4 billion. The company is up about 66.5% on its Bitcoin investment, accounting for over $28.5 billion in unrealized gains, according to SaylorTracker. Bitcoin treasury companies, led by Strategy, continue to be one of the main drivers of Bitcoin demand in the current market cycle, alongside exchange-traded funds (ETFs), institutional investors, and centralized crypto exchanges. Related: Lawsuits piling up against Strategy could take years, go nowhere, lawyer says These investors hold shares of Bitcoin treasury companies or purchase their corporate debt products as a proxy for holding BTC. “There are stock funds where the portfolio manager can only buy stocks. He or she cannot buy bonds, ETFs, or commodities,” Alden gave as an example of the types of restrictions placed on asset managers. Vanguard, one of the biggest institutional investment firms, has long opposed holding Bitcoin or offering Bitcoin directly to clients, but now holds 20 million shares of Strategy, or about 8% of the company's outstanding stock. The investment firm's indirect exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded company highlights Bitcoin's integration into traditional finance through legacy investment vehicles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins The report notes that altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in recent days, with investors achieving higher returns by taking positions in altcoins instead of BTC, according to daily signals. However, Alphractal's report also includes a warning signal: the Correlation Heatmap. This map indicates that the average correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin is rapidly declining, even turning negative in some cases. This suggests that altcoins are no longer tracking Bitcoin's price movements, which could be a precursor to high volatility and mass liquidations of long or short positions. According to Alphractal's analysis, this low correlation has historically been observed before periods of increased market volatility. Historically, this has coincided with periods of increased volatility and often price rallies in the following year. Wedson advised investors to be cautious, stating that if the VIX is low, it could indicate an explosive move for Bitcoin, but if the VIX is high, it might be more prudent to monitor stocks due to potential market fear impacting BTC. Prominent crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also issued a warning to beginners about the risks associated with altcoins. While altcoins have the potential for significant returns, they also come with amplified risks. This divergence suggests that altcoins may not follow Bitcoin's price movements as closely as they have in the past, which could lead to a severe price downturn for altcoins. An on-chain analyst also noted the decoupling of Bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies or altcoins, which could lead to a severe price downturn within the altcoin market. Bitcoin's recent peak has triggered warnings of a potential local top as on-chain metrics signal overextension. Despite the warnings, some altcoins, such as Binance Coin and Ethereum, have shown impressive price action. Binance Coin has surpassed resistance levels as its ecosystem thrives, particularly in decentralized exchanges. Ethereum has also seen a significant price increase, reclaiming the $3,000 level. While this price action could be a sign of increased investor confidence, it also comes with its own set of risks and could indicate increased volatility in the altcoin market. Elon Musk has also warned against excessive investment in cryptocurrencies, urging caution. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before investing in altcoins.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an interview with To a T and Karamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi earlier this year, Fumito Ueda praised To a T, commending Takahashi for "not relying on unique gameplay mechanics". When Takahashi revealed it did not, he responded with a simple: "That's great!" Reminded of this exchange during his interview with Takahashi, Ueda joked "ah, these are the words of a professional", but then expanded on the comment, explaining that what he meant was that contemporary games felt over-concerned with gameplay (thanks, Automaton). "Even if there's nothing novel about the mechanics, you can push the game further with a certain vibe or artwork, he added. "Personal preferences aside, what I'm saying is – I think it would be better to give already existing game mechanics more definition." Ueda believes this is why he enjoyed To a T so much; rather than innovating or inventing complex control schemes and mechanics, it instead concentrated on its visuals and story to tell a tale about what it's like to live with a disability. Interestingly, our Donlan took away a different take. "Over the five or six hours it takes to play To a T, I've had a series of revelations that in turn built to one giant revelation: I have had the wrong idea about pretty much everything here," Donlan wrote when he gave To a T a try. "As a result, I've never played a game where I spent so much of the time simply trying to work out what it's doing. It turns out I wouldn't truly understand any of this until the final credits had rolled. In fact, I'm still thinking about a lot of it." © 2025 Eurogamer.net  a brand of IGN Entertainment, Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is the Ethereum price prediction of $5000 still possible this year? Current realities and a projection of the staking ETF approval could play a major role for us to answer this question. One area that has continued getting attention from analysts in the recently filed BlackRock ETF proposal is its effect on Ethereum liquidity. The current market shows a strong bullish sentiment, which could validate an Ethereum price prediction of $5000. Furthermore, an approval at this moment could see a liquidity boost of up to $10B in inflow, taking the Bitcoin ETF direction. This is because of the significant drop in sell pressure due to reduced liquid supply with a rise in staked ETH. As Ethereum price prediction draws in new interest, the Remittix token also shakes the whales' circle with an imminent price breakout. This year, Remittix hit a milestone that made analysts believe it could be the next Altcoin to 100x. Here's why Remittix is becoming a big deal among investors this year: This is the best time to start investing in Remittix as it offers a high reward opportunity for early buyers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Denver, Colorado, July  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  As the global cryptocurrency infrastructure continues to mature, a growing divide has emerged between large-scale institutional blockchain adoption and the accessibility of underlying mining technologies. In response, leading cloud mining platforms are rethinking how to scale operations while maintaining inclusivity for a broader range of users. AIXA Miner, a U.S.-based cloud mining operator, recently announced infrastructure updates aimed at addressing this industry-wide challenge—developments that coincide with a renewed wave of institutional interest in blockchain infrastructure and asset-backed mining contracts. These updates also expanded backend support for large-scale contracts and institutional wallet integrations, timed alongside Bitcoin's recent surge past $117,000 per coin. “What we're seeing now is a convergence of interest from traditional financial firms and DeFi-native institutions. Many are looking for mining solutions that don't require hardware investment but still offer performance transparency,” said Elina Chambers, Head of Infrastructure Strategy at AIXA Miner. “Our role is to enable that transition—without excluding individual participants who helped shape the ecosystem.” As blockchain moves beyond tokenization into supply chains, finance, and data privacy, mining operations are becoming more than just reward generators; they're foundational compute layers. Institutional investors now demand verifiable uptime, audited compliance, and secure API access for treasury operations, all while being increasingly conscious of sustainability metrics. AIXA Miner's hybrid model, combining contract-based mining for individuals with institutional-grade ASIC/GPU deployment—addresses these priorities through geographic dispersion, energy diversification, and encrypted reporting layers. Recent expansion efforts have centered on renewable-powered data centers across North America and Southeast Asia. From a regulatory standpoint, AIXA's infrastructure roadmap also appears aligned with the sector's current direction. In Q2 2025, several exchanges expanded their DeFi analytics platforms to support mining-related metrics, indicating that mining is being folded into broader asset evaluation strategies. Similarly, asset managers are increasingly allocating to mining-yield derivatives and tokenised staking products mechanisms that parallel traditional bond structures. In this context, AIXA Miner's recent platform adaptations represent a relevant case study in the evolution of cloud mining from a niche service into an enterprise-aligned infrastructure solution. Whether the future of mining lies in AI-optimized routing, renewable capacity expansions, or smart wallet integrations, one reality is becoming clear: cloud mining is no longer solely the domain of crypto-native retail users. Instead, it is emerging as a structural component of blockchain's institutional future—one that demands both scale and accessibility in equal measure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and Ether traders are eyeing price milestones into the weekly close, with a resistance trend line keeping BTC bulls from heading to all-time highs. Bitcoin market participants expect a resistance trend line breakout, with nearby targets including $125,000. Attention continues to focus on altcoins while Bitcoin consolidates, with Ether reaching seven-month highs. Upside potential across altcoins remains, with many not yet copying Ether's rebound, says the latest market commentary. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD heading higher after a trip below $117,000 Friday. Now, traders say, a resistance trend line stands in the way of Bitcoin returning to price discovery above $123,000. “BTC is getting ready for a big move,” popular trader Marcus Corvinus told X followers in a post on the day. “If it breaks below support, price may fall to $111,000 or lower,” he added. On daily time frames, popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital eyed a similar structure. “Bitcoin remains in the Range and the consolidation continues, facilitating further money flow into Altcoins,” he commented on his own chart. These charts say ‘full bull' phase is still ahead “Ethereum has long ago resynchronised with its $2200-$3900 Macro Range,” summarized in part of an X post which included a chart stretching back to late 2023. Crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe called the rebound on ETH/USD "absolutely phenomenal.” What an absolutely phenomenal reversal is this on $ETH. On Sunday, ETH/USD traded above $3,750 for the first time since December 18, 2024. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins Analysts are optimistic about its potential, with some forecasting a 20x rally as the next crypto bull run approaches. This optimism is largely driven by Shibarium, Shiba Inu's Layer-2 network, which promises low fees, fast transactions, and enhanced scalability. Since its launch, transaction volume on the Shibarium testnet has surged, and the ecosystem has seen integrations with DeFi, NFT utilities, and token burns, making it more than just a meme coin. This cryptocurrency has gained attention with its unique narrative and location-based presale model, which is redefining what meme finance can look like. With each presale drop unlocking fresh chapters and staking rewards as high as 66% APY, this cryptocurrency is not just another meme coin—it's a myth in motion, aiming for a 1951% ROI at launch. Another project that has caught the attention of investors is Rollblock. Unlike SHIB or Arctic Pablo Coin, Rollblock is not just a cryptocurrency—it is building a full-blown launch platform for play-to-earn gaming and NFT projects. The platform aims to host new tokens, offer staking-as-a-service, and onboard users into decentralized gaming economies. Rollblock's infrastructure-first approach sets it apart, as the development team is prioritizing UI, user onboarding, and token integrations. Early investors have already shown interest, and excitement is building in Telegram groups about what could be the next big breakout in the crypto world. Currently in its 32nd presale location, Icebound Estates, the cryptocurrency's animated adventure is more than just storytelling. Analysts think $APC might even reach $0.1 in this cycle, which is a blistering 19,900% gain. With over $3 million already raised and 66% APY staking in play, the project combines meme coin hype with long-term investor rewards. Each presale location lasts exactly one week, and at the end of each chapter, unsold tokens are burned, creating a deflationary supply crunch. This approach ensures relentless forward motion and hype that snowballs like an avalanche. The cryptocurrency runs on Binance Smart Chain, ensuring quick, cheap transactions. In conclusion, Shiba Inu remains a strong contender with the potential for significant gains, especially with the traction gained by Shibarium. Arctic Pablo Coin, with its unique narrative and deflationary mechanics, is quickly becoming a standout in the meme coin space. Early adopters who get in on these projects could see substantial returns as the crypto market continues to evolve.</p>

In comparison, MicroStrategy Chair Michael Saylor owns just under 20 million shares, according to an April company filing. The disconnect between Vanguard's professed cryptocurrency stance and its financial holdings primarily comes from its passive index fund strategies through funds like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (NASDAQ:VITSX), Vanguard Extended Market Index (NASDAQ:VIEIX) and the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VUG). But Vanguard also has exposure to MicroStrategy in some of its actively managed funds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home - Reviews - Maple Finance Review: Where Blockchain Meets Real-World Borrowing Needs Maple Finance pioneers institutional-grade lending within DeFi, bridging blockchain technology with traditional credit markets. This ecosystem connects vetted borrowers seeking capital with yield-focused lenders through a unique delegated pool structure. Its evolution includes migrating from MPL to the SYRUP governance token and expanding access via Syrup.fi. Maple Finance functions as a decentralized lending platform that is based on blockchain technology. Its core purpose is to facilitate lending and borrowing within the crypto ecosystem, specifically targeting institutional participants. Maple Finance specializes in providing uncollateralized or undercollateralized loans, a significant offering within the often overcollateralized DeFi lending space, addressing a key need for established crypto businesses requiring working capital. These are professional entities or teams responsible for originating loans, performing due diligence and credit assessment on potential borrowers, setting loan terms (like interest rates), and actively managing the performance of specific lending pools on the platform. Lenders effectively delegate the critical task of credit risk evaluation and management to these designated experts. Maple Finance positions itself as a capital-efficient solution for institutional crypto participants. It emphasizes transparency, with loan terms, borrower identities (often disclosed), and pool performance visible on-chain. By offering fixed-rate, term loans primarily in stablecoins like USDC, Maple aims to provide predictable yields for lenders and reliable funding for vetted institutional borrowers, differentiating itself within the broader decentralized finance landscape. Maple Finance organizes capital through distinct lending pools created and managed by Pool Delegates. Lenders deposit funds, primarily stablecoins like USDC, directly into these specific pools. Each pool operates under predefined parameters set by its Delegate, including target borrower profiles, interest rate models, and fee structures. Once approved, the loan agreement is formalized on-chain via Maple's smart contracts. Holders stake SYRUP (as stSYRUP) to participate in protocol governance, voting on upgrades, fee structures, and ecosystem enhancements. Stakers also earn rewards from protocol fee buybacks, directly tying token value to Maple's operational success. Residual value from unclaimed MPL was allocated to the Syrup Strategic Fund for ecosystem development. Exchanges like Kraken facilitated automatic conversions, while others (e.g., Coinbase) required manual migration via Maple's portal. SYRUP warrants consideration only within the speculative allocation of an investment portfolio, suitable exclusively for risk-tolerant participants with multi-year time horizons. Prospective investors should continuously monitor protocol metrics including TVL, loan origination volume, and treasury revenue, indicators that directly influence SYRUP's fundamental valuation. While the token offers compelling exposure to institutional DeFi's growth narrative, its ultimate success depends on Maple Finance's execution against an ambitious roadmap and ability to navigate an evolving regulatory landscape. A circulating supply of 1.19B SYRUP supports governance, staking, and liquidity provisioning. Fee revenues from Maple's lending operations fund SYRUP buybacks, distributing value to stakers while countering inflation. It enables anyone to deposit stablecoins like USDC and earn returns sourced from fixed-rate, overcollateralized loans to vetted crypto institutions, with all collateral verifiable on-chain in real-time. No KYC is required for lenders, contrasting with Maple's institutional focus. Users receive liquid LP tokens representing their deposits, which can be utilized across DeFi for additional yield opportunities. Maple Finance pioneers institutional DeFi credit through its delegated lending pools and transparent on-chain infrastructure. By balancing regulatory navigation with blockchain innovation, Maple carves a unique niche in crypto finance, offering scalable capital solutions while redefining trust in decentralized credit markets. ‘Play to Own' Games: A Necessary Revolution for the Future of Blockchain Gaming As a native Layer 2 solution, it aims to unlock Bitcoin's full potential beyond simple transactions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It started in 2013 when South African entrepreneur Johann Gevers moved his crypto startup Monetas to Zug after researching locations worldwide. His vision was simple: create a "Silicon Valley" for blockchain technology in Switzerland. Zug, Switzerland, now known as “Crypto Valley,” hosts over 700 blockchain companies worth a combined $382.93 billion – making it the world's largest cryptocurrency hub. This openness would prove crucial as crypto companies flocked to the region. Working from a modest house nicknamed “Das Raumschiff” (The Spaceship), Buterin and his team built what would become the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. The Ethereum Foundation became the first blockchain foundation ever created, setting a legal precedent that nearly every major crypto project would follow. Today, nine cryptocurrency “unicorns” (companies worth over $1 billion) call Switzerland home, including Cardano, Polkadot, and Nexo. This means individuals can buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies without paying taxes on their profits as long as they meet specific criteria. Switzerland imposes a wealth tax on crypto holdings, ranging from 0.3% to 1% annually. Investors must declare their crypto holdings each December 31st at market value. Unlike many countries that struggle with crypto regulation, Swiss authorities embraced the technology early. In July 2016, Zug became the first government worldwide to accept Bitcoin payments for municipal services up to 200 Swiss francs (about $210). This regulatory clarity eliminated the legal uncertainty that plagued crypto companies in other countries. This compares favorably to other major financial centers and has drawn companies like Bitcoin Suisse, which was founded in 2013 and now manages over 3 billion Swiss francs in client assets. One advantage that sets Switzerland apart is its crypto-friendly banking sector. These partnerships provide crucial services like custody, trading, and regulatory compliance that crypto companies need to operate professionally. Bitcoin Suisse, Switzerland's oldest crypto company, helped facilitate the world's first cryptocurrency crowd-funding campaign for Ethereum in 2014. The company has since grown to employ over 300 people across offices in Zug, Copenhagen, and Slovakia. In 2023 alone, Swiss crypto companies raised $283.5 million across 47 funding deals, showing strong recovery from the 2022 market downturn. The sector now employs over 3,000 people directly, with hundreds more in supporting industries. This density creates network effects where entrepreneurs, investors, and talent naturally connect. Switzerland's crypto sector has matured significantly since its early days. Brave New Coin reaches 500,000+ engaged crypto enthusiasts a month through our website, podcast, newsletters, and YouTube.
