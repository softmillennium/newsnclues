                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter In a nondescript conference room on the very descript floor of Marvel Studios (full size Iron Man statues, superhero murals and movie props) is a padlocked door. So teased Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige, the producer behind the most successful run of movies in Hollywood's history, as he welcomed a select group of journalists into the same room where he first met Doctor Strange star Benedict Cumberbatch and where filmmaker  Chloe Zhao pitched her take on Eternals. Marvel's run has been tested of late, this year especially with Thunderbolts* and Captain America: Brave New World, which grossed among the lowest totals for the company. “I love how you just jump right into it,” Fiege enthused of the film, which Gunn directed he helmed three Guardians of the Galaxy movies for Marvel before decamping to run DC Studios. Even if he doesn't buy the idea of superhero fatigue, Feige and his team have done plenty of post-mortems on this year's underperforming movies, and on all their movies since the massive success of Avengers: Endgame. It's the first time Marvel Studios is handling the characters, after a trio of movies of various quality and box office made by Twentieth Century Fox before its 2019 acquisition by Disney. There was also the never-released, 1994 feature produced low-budget king Roger Corman. (Fun fact: the four stars of that movie cameo in First Steps.) “We wanted them to be apart from our reality so that we didn't have to say, ‘Oh look, they were hiding over here. And when we show it to audiences in the screening process that we do leading up to it, people just accept it right off the bat and feel liberated that they can just enjoy what's ahead of them.” He underscores, “it is no homework required.” In a free-wheeling discussion with the journalists, Feige, wearing a blue Fantastic Four hoodie and a Wonder Man cap, opened up on a range of topics, from what's going on with Blade, his future at Marvel, and the exit of Jonathan Majors from the MCU. He characterized the time period after Endgame as an era of experimentation, evolution and, unfortunately, expansion. And while he's proud of the experimentation – he points to WandaVision and Loki as some of the best stories they've made – he admits “It's the expansion that is certainly what devalued” that output. Being high on success also may have pushed them to readily agree to try to deliver more programming at a time when Disney and the rest of Hollywood were engaged in the streaming wars. “It was a big company push, and it doesn't take too much to push us to go, ‘People have been asking for Ms. Marvel for years, and now we can do it? So there was a mandate that we were put in the middle of, but we also thought it'd be fun to bring these to life.” Marvel has already pulled back the amount of movies and shows it will make. Certainly there will be years with only one show released. Also, Marvel has started “grinding down” on budgets, with movies costing up to a third cheaper than the films from 2022 or 2023. The massive expansion into television and focus on Disney+ led to the feeling that watching Marvel was becoming a type of homework. And I think The Marvels hit it hardest where people are like, ‘Okay, I recognize her from a billion dollar movie. But I think we still have to make sure the audience understands that.” Feige is staying put at Marvel (for now) No Hollywood executive stays in their chair forever. Feige was a bit circumspect on long he would stay at the company, quietly admitting he has about “two years, a little less” on his contract. But regardless, he stated his desire is to keep making big movies for the widest possible audience. That's all I want to do,” Feige said. “Marvel's a great way to do that for me right now. But I hope to make big movies for lots of people forever more.” Marvel faced several curveballs in the last few years as it worked on its post-Endgame phases. Yes, there were real world issues of a pandemic and Hollywood strikes. There was the tragic loss of Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman. And there was the assault conviction of Jonathan Majors, the actor who was playing villain Kang and seemed to be teed up as the next big arch nemesis for years to come. Feige never mentioned Majors by name, instead calling him “Kang actor” at one point or “the actor” or just zeroing on Kang as a character. And, Feige said, Marvel was already preparing to pivot away from Kang before the Majors issue. And in fact, I had started talking with Robert [Downey Jr.] about this audacious idea before Ant-Man 3 even came out. It was a long plan that we had had to take one of our greatest characters and utilize one of our greatest actors.” Many fans have been for years clamoring for a live-action MCU appearance of Miles Morales, the Spider-Man who headlines the acclaimed Spider-Verse movies from Sony Animation. When asked where Marvel was in the development of a live-action version of the character, Feige responded, “That is nowhere.” And added that Morales' fate was in Sony's hands. “Sony has their brilliant, genius, incredible Spider- Verse animated franchise going and until that finishes, we've been told to stay away,” said Feige. “The obstacle was Ryan Coogler called and said, ‘We'd love some costumes for Sinners.' Feige was, of course, joking, connecting Sinners to a version of Blade that was recentlybeing  developed, one that was set in a Prohibition Era, just like Coogler's original hit earlier this year. Marvel has now “landed on modern day.” And yes, Mahershala Ali is still attached. He didn't reveal a timeline for Blade but did say that he, and Coogler, have a timeline for Black Panther 3. Tonal malleability is a key to Marvel's success (yes, there will be more R-rated stories coming) Deadpool & Wolverine as well as the Daredevil TV show have shown that Marvel is becoming more and more comfortable with pushing stories that are adult-oriented. But its characters can also appear in age-appropriate settings when needed. It's all a way to keep audiences interested and invested. That is how, Feige pointed out, you can have the Green Goblin build snowmen in Disney+'s Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends but then kill Aunt May in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The violent vigilante played by Jon Bernthal is the subject of a special that just began shooting last week and will air on Disney+ next year. But “when Punisher is in the Spider-Man movie, it'll be a different tonality,” said Feige. Feige still likes the flexibility of going into production without a set script The Marvel method of moviemaking has included ever-evolving scripts and heavy-lifting in post-production. “I've never been satisfied with a movie we've released,” he even added on top of that. What he and the company like to do is “plus-ing at every turn.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter</p>

Ever-outspoken standup, actor, talk show staple, and “WTF with Marc Maron” host Marc Maron talked about his “nemesis” Jon Stewart on the NPR series “Wild Card with Rachel Martin.” Way back in the '90s, Maron was one of Stewart's successors as host of Comedy Central's “Short Attention Span Theater,” which was canceled shortly after he took over. Maron, of course, went on to bigger and better things, as did Stewart, but Maron said that he needed a rivalry to keep going. “I always have a nemesis… like most of that is fueled by resentment, insecurity, jealousy, or whatever,” he explained. “It's habit and it's the never ending sort of, you know, struggle against acting out of insecurity… or resentment, self-acceptance.” Related Stories Isaac Hayes Was Forced by Scientology Leaders to Quit ‘South Park,' Says Son The TV President's War on Democracy Comes for TV's Institutions For years, Maron continued, Stewart filled that role for Maron, since — as he recalls — “he had figured it out” when it came to being a comic. “I always used to think it was just 'cause he committed to a haircut and… a way of presenting. But like, he was just everywhere,” Maron said. Maron said that he felt a lot of jealousy about Stewart's success, and that the two even had confrontations about it and “are not friends.” He said that Stewart “doesn't particularly like” him. “It was me being kind of… small minded.” Maron reached out to Stewart and attempted to mend the fences when he recorded an episode of his eponymous podcast with comedian Gallagher as a guest in 2011. I'm like, ‘Hey man, how you doing? And uh yeah… so, I guess it was pretty creative,” Maron said. Maron currently is shopping a documentary a highly personal documentary feature, “Are We Good?” The film premiered at SXSW in March and played Tribeca in June. “Unfortunately, we haven't heard anything from them,” he said on his podcast “The Weekly Show With Jon Stewart.” “They haven't called me and said, ‘Don't get too comfortable in that office, Stewart.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to the future of Marvel Studios, which has taken its licks this year with misfires Thunderbolts* and Captain America: Brave New World, the No. 'Fantastic Four' First Reactions Praise "Immaculate" VFX & "Pitch-Perfect Script": "One Of The Best Things Marvel Has Ever Made" Summer Box Office Opening Forecasts For 'Fantastic Four', 'Weapons', 'Freakier Friday' & More Feige is particularly chipper, for even though Marvel is skipping San Diego Comic-Con this year as they remain knee deep in production on the Russo Brothers' Avengers: Doomsday and in prep on Spider-Man: Brand New Day, the Marvel Boss and former X-Men associate producer, finally has his hands in The Fantastic Four thanks to the Disney-Fox merger. Having that subset of Marvel characters has liberated Feige to take even bigger swings with the MCU. The Fantastic Four: First Steps is looking to be Marvel Studios' biggest opening YTD with $100M-$110M stateside. While Fox had respectable success with 2005 and 2007 Fantastic Four movies (which starred Chris Evans as Johnny Storm pre-Captain America), the former studio saw a Josh Trank directed 2015 reboot completely tank after a full reshoot, grossing only $167M worldwide. “Why Fantastic Four?” explains Feige on the reasons for another redo. It's in the history of our characters; they deserve to be A-listers. Every crossover movie we've made in the Infinity saga, Civil War, leading to Infinity War and Endgame, which is really the Infinity saga from the comics, the Fantastic Four were huge players in those comics and obviously we couldn't do that then.” While several Marvel projects post Avengers: Endgame have dovetailed between TV series and films, for Feige, it was important to have the Fantastic Four be contained in their own world sans any callbacks to the Avengers‘ blip or other verse characters. “There were a lot of left turns and surprises that happened over the last seven or eight years,” Feige continues, “A positive one was to finally have those characters back and the X-Men.” Feige says, “Even before what had happened to the actor, we had started to realize that Kang wasn't Thanos.” “We had started talking about Dr. Doom even before we officially pivoted from Kang,” he says, “In fact, I had started talking with Robert about this audacious idea before Ant-Man 3 even came out.” Already Patrick Stewart's X-Men papa Dr. Xavier has made a cameo in the Disney/Marvel Studios Universe Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, with a slew of X-Men characters, i.e. Channing Tatum's Gamit, and even Wesley Snipes' Blade making cameos in last year's Deadpool & Wolverine. Speaking of Blade, despite being taken off the calendar, the project remains in development with 2x Oscar winner Mahershala Ali still attached. Feige revealed on Friday that while there were four versions of Blade in the works, two of them period (one of them set in the 1930s), “we landed on modern day and that's what we're focusing on.” On pausing Blade after the exit of two filmmakers, Yann Demange, exit and Bassam Tariq's departure, Feige says “We didn't want to put a leather outfit on him and have him start killing vampires.” “You can start and have a good script and make it a great script through production, but we didn't feel confident we could do that on Blade,” he continues, “We didn't want to do that to Mahershala and didn't want to do that to us.” In the wake of the success of his own vampire movie, Sinners, one reporter wondered whether Ryan Coogler would get to take a crack at directing Blade. Feige says there's no plans, rather the director remains committed to Black Panther 3. Marvel learned the hard way that their over-reaching Disney+ series and theatrical movie plans were too much of a good thing for fans, evident in the bombing of The Marvels ($206.1M global box office) which fused together Brie Larson's Captain Marvel (who had her own $1 billion grossing film) with the lesser-known characters of Ms. Marvel and Monica Rambeau. The takeaway was that many fans and general moviegoers didn't buy tickets for The Marvels because they weren't caught up on Ms. Marvel on Disney+ Still, while storylines won't crossover between series and film, characters will, read Jon Bernthal's The Punisher cameo in the upcoming Sony/Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Brand New Day. “Where we have great actors playing great characters, I think it would be fun to see them in multiple places,” says Feige. With Downey Jr. now playing Dr. Doom, are there plans to recast the core Iron Man, Captain America, etc on the big screen? Feige sees a star such as Chris Hemsworth still in his prime to play Thor, and even cherishes the return of thespians (i.e. Tim Blake Nelson's Samuel Stern in Captain America: Brave New World) who played Marvel characters years ago. But, yes, in the long-term like with many other storied movie franchises, Marvel classic superheros will get new faces. In addition, post Avengers: Secret Wars, there is a plan he says to “reset singular timelines” and reboot he MCU. In regard to Feige's future and whether there's more Marvel under him, he's not going anywhere. While his contract is up in two years, he tells us, “Do I want to be making big movies for big audiences in ten or 15 years from now? Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Last Week Tonight host revealed in May that he would help bring a new look to the Detroit Tigers Double-A affiliate team, which was previously known as the Erie SeaWolves. While he was in Erie, he paid tribute to his old friend Stephen Colbert, whose Late Show was axed earlier this week by CBS. I am partly excited to see what they're going to do for the next 10 months,” he reportedly said, per local news. Late-night shows mean a lot to me, not just because I work in them, but because even growing up in England, I would watch [David] Letterman's show, which of course was Stephen's show, and think about what a glamorous world that was. So, to have got to be on Letterman's show and Stephen's show has been always one of the most fun things, so it's very, very, very sad news. I look forward to seeing what he's going to do next because that man will not stop,” he added. Oliver has appeared multiple times on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert as well as the earlier iteration with David Letterman in 2015. He is the latest comedian and television host to offer his support following comments from other late-night peers including Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers and Andy Cohen as well as the likes of Anderson Cooper.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was also new studio fare this frame while the latest Demon Slayer is a big hit in Japan, its first release market. Taking the major milestones first, and before digging into more detail, DC/Warner Bros' Superman topped the four-century mark in its sophomore session, flying to $406.8M global. In its 3rd weekend, Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth, after topping half a billion worldwide during its sophomore frame, roared past $600M global to reach $648M through Sunday. 'Superman's $57M Second Weekend Propels Warner Bros. To Top Of YTD Studio Marketshare With $1.32B James Gunn Recalls Henry Cavill's Reaction To 'Superman' Re-Casting News: "This Poor Guy" In holds, and near milestones, Apple Original Films's F1, via Warner Bros, keeps pushing the needle with increases in some markets again this session amid a mere 24% overseas drop from last weekend to top $300M ($307.2M) at the international box office and reach a $460.8M global cume to date, on its way to $500M. Universal's How to Train Your Dragon is closing in on $600M worldwide with $589M through today. Notably, some of the above titles have yet to open in Japan, having dated out of the way of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba Infinity Castle which started local release on Friday. We will update as clearer figures become available, but we do know that the movie (which will be released by Sony domestically in September) opened to an all-time Imax record in Japan of $3M. That's bigger than any Hollywood or local title and includes an Imax opening day Friday record. Paramount Animation's Smurfs grossed $22.6M this session internationally, for $33.6M global. That's lower than where we saw it pre-open, but comes with the codicil of a crowded marketplace and not so family friendly weather in Europe. Including Australia, which started last weekend, the offshore cume is $25M. Also new, Sony's I Know What You Did Last Summer hooked $11.6M from 58 overseas markets this session. That's on par with Happy Death Day 2U and 11% above Speak No Evil for the same group of markets at current rates. Returning to the toplines… Superman added an estimated $45.2M from 78 overseas markets, for a holdover drop of 44% (excluding China; that market has positively rejected this movie). With a more favorable moviegoing climate, the UK dropped by 31% while other markets saw strong holds including France (-23%), Holland (-25%), Germany (-29%), and Italy (-38%). The Top 5 to date are: UK ($22.2M), Mexico ($16.6M), Brazil ($11.2M), Australia ($11M) and China ($8.5M). After topping half a billion worldwide during its sophomore frame, Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth crossed another milestone during its third session, roaring past $600M global to reach $648M through Sunday. This makes the Scarlett Johansson-starrer the 4th biggest Hollywood film of 2025 worldwide (behind Ne Zha 2, Lilo & Stitch and A Minecraft Movie). It is the 6th Jurassic title to cross $600M global, and in China has become the biggest Hollywood movie of 2025 with $71.8M to date.` Overseas, Gareth Edwards' JWR dipped 44% across 82 markets for a $40.3M weekend. The international box office cume is $371.8M through Sunday. Looking at comps, excluding China, the offshore performance is in line with Jurassic World Dominion, just off Top Gun: Maverick and well above Universal's current How to Train Your Dragon (2025) and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning. The Top 5 markets to date are: China ($71.8M), UK ($33.7M), Mexico ($28.7M), Germany ($20.3M) and France ($17.4M). In another impressive performance, F1 is continuing to gain traction from great word of mouth. The Joseph Kosinski-directed movie added an estimated $29.5M in its 4th weekend in 78 overseas markets for a $307.2M offshore cume to date, with the global running tally at $460.8M. The holds here are impressive: Asia Pacific, excluding China, dipped just 11% while China, after increasing last weekend, slid just 37% while new local movies entered that market. Europe was off 25% from last weekend, and Latin America came in with a drop of -32%. Very notably, Korea grew this session by 28%, that's freaky for a depressed market but speaks to the power of word of mouth (and some other alchemy we're still figuring out). Taiwan (+5%), UK (+2%), France (-5%), Holland (-18%), Saudi Arabia (-19%), India (-22%), Spain (-27%), Australia (-28%), Mexico (-29%),  Brazil (-35%), UAE (-36%), Germany (-37%) and Japan (-42%) are also among the impressive holds. Here are the Top 5 through Sunday: China ($45.5M), UK ($24.6M), France ($20.8M), Mexico ($17.4M) and Australia ($15.2M). How to Train Your Dragon for its part is closing in on $600M with $589M global through today. Here are the Top 5: China ($38.7M), Mexico ($36.3M), UK ($27.8M), Brazil ($20.5M) and Australia ($18.5M).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Saturday (July 19), the 44-year-old pop icon attended the stage adaptation of Steven Antin's 2010 film Burlesque, in which she starred as an aspiring performer opposite Cher, who played a glamorous nightclub owner. !” she captioned an Instagram video of herself at the show, set to her track “Show Me How You Burlesque,” from the original Burlesque soundtrack. After Saturday's show, Burlesque the Musical shared clips on Instagram of Aguilera arriving at the theater, waving to fans while wearing a sheer black outfit. “What it is like to have a goddess in your life,” Antin captioned one video on his Instagram Story. “Unbelievable night with @xtina [heart emoji] this queen so much for producing our show.” Burlesque marked Aguilera's first leading film role and Cher's debut musical performance on screen. In the movie, Aguilera plays Alice Marilyn, an aspiring singer who leaves her small Iowa hometown to pursue her dreams in Los Angeles. She soon becomes a dancer and cocktail waitress at a struggling burlesque lounge owned by Tess Scali, played by Cher. The 10-song Burlesque soundtrack — featuring music written and produced by Diane Warren, Sia, Tricky Stewart, Ron Fair, Linda Perry and Aguilera — reached No. Burlesque the Musical made its world premiere in June at the Manchester Opera House and is now playing at London's Savoy Theatre through early September. Earlier this year, Aguilera shared her excitement about the project. “I'm proud that Burlesque the Musical is coming to London's West End!” she said in a statement. Following our successful previews, having the show land in the West End later this year is a dream come true!” Check out Aguilera's reaction to Burlesque the Musical on Instagram here.

David Corenswet as Superman was not an idea that just dropped out of thin air. In fact, that idea has been gestating for at least six years. “I mean, the whole point of ‘pie-in-the-sky' is that it doesn't happen too often,” he previously said, adding, “I just always felt like Superman was both under-appreciated and over-simplified, and there was a lot of interesting stuff that could happen with it. Related Stories Adam Sandler Says Carl Weathers Was Going to Return for ‘Happy Gilmore 2' Before His Death: It Was a ‘Painful Change' to the Script Billie Eilish Teases Possible James Cameron 3D Concert Film Romano told Corenswet that he could see him playing the role, to which the now-Superman, then-mortal replied, “Great to know… I'll take that in writing. “I actually was watching this movie, which is great. It's a great movie… and I saw a character whose name I think is just the Projectionist in the movie, and I'm like, ‘That guy looks like he could possibly be Superman,'” Gunn said on Konbini. “I looked up his name on IMDb and said, ‘Can you bring this guy in?' There were two people I asked to be brought in, maybe more, but one guy I thought was most likely to be Superman.” But it turns out that other guy, Gunn recalled, “wasn't very good.” “And then David Corenswet, I watched him, and he was amazing,” Gunn said, adding he was particularly impressed with the actor's comedic chops. What Gunn might not have been prepared for is Corenswet's inquisitive nature. “But every once in a while, it's just one question too many, and it's like, ‘Oh, my God, just, David, stop, stop, for a minute.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Donald Trump is focused on building a punishing and dangerous immigrant detention facility he named “Alligator Alcatraz,” he's losing ground on the issue with the public. The majority of Americans see through Trump's claims that his administration is deporting only the “worst of the worst” criminals and instead believe he is focusing “too much” on deportations and deporting more people than they expected, according to a new CBS News poll. While in June, 53 percent of Americans said criminals are being prioritized for deportation, now that number has dipped to 44 percent, and 56 percent of Americans said the administration is focusing on deporting “people who aren't dangerous criminals.” And, as a Miami Herald analysis revealed, the majority of detainees at so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” do not have criminal convictions, despite Trump's promise it would hold “some of the most vicious people on the planet.” But when it comes to the president's base, he's still holding onto strong support, with 85 percent of Republicans favoring the way he is using detention facilities and 91 percent approving of his deportation plans. Most Americans also recognize the inherent racism in immigration enforcement, with 64 percent saying Hispanic people are subjected to more searches than others. On economic issues, like rising prices and inflation, Americans are growing frustrated. Seventy percent said he is not putting enough focus on lowering prices and putting too much focus on tariffs (61 percent). A similar number (60 percent) oppose new tariffs on imported goods. Belgium's Tomorrowland Saved by Metallica After Fire Destroys Main Stage Trump and the Catholic Church Fight a Law Requiring Clergy to Report Child Abuse Meanwhile, Trump and those in his administration have tried to blame, believe it or not, Democrats. But that doesn't seem to be working, even among Trump's usually loyal base. Only 50 percent of Republican respondents said they were satisfied with the administration's handling of matters related to the case, while 49 percent said they are dissatisfied.

David Ellison Met With FCC Chairman in Push to Finalize Approval for Paramount Deal The host added that he “likes to believe that without The Daily Show, Comedy Central's kind of muzak at this point.” “I think we're the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park. But I'd like to think we bring enough value to the property, like if they're looking at it as purely a real estate transaction, I think we bring a lot of value,” Stewart continued. I don't know, they may sell the whole fucking place for parts. Like they want to do that, knock themselves out.” But ideology may not play a part,” he added, referencing Skydance Media CEO David Ellison, who has been praised by Trump. The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Skydance for comment. Skydance is currently in the process of acquiring Paramount Global, which is the parent company of CBS and Comedy Central. Earlier this month, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Donald Trump, who sued over former Vice President Kamala Harris' 60 Minutes interview.

Momoa's kids are growing up fast, and when he stepped onto the red carpet to promote his latest film, “Chief of War,” he was joined by his teenagers. The sweet moment not only showed that Momoa's kids are growing up fast and are gorgeous, but it also gave a glimpse into a more playful side of their personalities. Momoa, who has Hawaiian heritage, plays the role of Kaʻiana. Momoa's heritage is important to him, and he has honored his roots in many different ways. This includes the names he chose for his children. His daughter Lola's middle name is Iolani, which means “royal hawk,” People reports. Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha's name is also an honor to Momoa's heritage. Fatherhood is a role that the “Aquaman” actor takes seriously. He has discussed what having children means to him in several interviews. “I didn't know what it takes to be a dad,” he told InStyle. In March 2024, Momoa told People how he has prioritised spending time with his children. “I spent a lot of time with them when they were younger, which is super important. But now, going into high school, they've got their friends and stuff,” he said. He continued, “They still like me, which is good.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since his first Hallmark movie in 2011, “Love Begins,” beloved actor Wes Brown has been paired with some of the network's top leading ladies, from Rachel Boston in 2019's “Check Inn at Christmas” to Lacey Chabert in the “Haul Out the Holly” franchise. But even after appearing in nearly 20 Hallmark movies, there are still actresses Brown has yet to co-star with, he told Swooon on July 19, 2025. When asked which ones he'd love to star with next, three stars were top of mind for the Hallmark hunk. “I would love to work with Nikki DeLoach,” Brown told the outlet, and then added, “Kimberley Sustad, I've never done one with her. Brown and DeLoach just spent time together in Boston and New York, teaming up to promote Hallmark's Christmas in July programming slate. After the baseball game, Brown and DeLoach headed to New York City for multiple joint interviews about Hallmark's unscripted show they're both part of, “Christmas at Sea.” The four-part series follows fans and 11 stars — including Sustad and Drew, too — aboard the second-ever Hallmark Christmas Cruise in November 2024. All four stars — Brown, DeLoach, Sustad, and Drew — will be aboard the next cruise in November 2025, which sold out in a day. Brown told New York Live the ship has a waiting list of 70,000 fans. Although Brown would love the chance to work with DeLoach, Sustad, or Drew in the future, he's had some great female co-stars in his Hallmark past.</p>

She also shared exciting personal news—her engagement to longtime partner Andrea Dalton. After three years of dating, Tammy proudly revealed her engagement ring on a podcast hosted by Hunter Ezell. The couple has kept their relationship mostly private, but her recent posts suggest she's entering a joyful and confident new era. And fans can't wait to see what she'll do next.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met," the IT company wrote. Astronomer CEO Andy Byron has resigned after being seen embracing an employee on large video screens at a Coldplay concert. During Coldplay's show at Boston's Gillette Stadium on Wednesday (July 16), a jumbotron captured Byron with his arms around the IT company's chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot, during a kiss-cam segment. Upon realizing they were on the big screen, Byron quickly ducked out of view while Cabot turned away. Country singer Morgan Wallen even weighed in during his concert in Glendale, Ariz., on Friday (July 18), telling the crowd that anyone attending with their “side chick” was “safe here.” Astronomer has since released a statement noting that Byron is stepping down as CEO and that the company is searching for his replacement, according to The Associated Press. “Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding,” the company wrote in a statement on Saturday (July 19). The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO.” The statement continued, “Before this week, we were known as a pioneer in the DataOps space, helping data teams power everything from modern analytics to production AI. Coldplay had not released a statement about the situation at press time. “How we're gonna do that is we're gonna use our cameras and put some of you on the big screen.” Flashing a grin, he added, “So please, if you haven't done your makeup, do your makeup now.” One fan at the Wisconsin concert later posted on X that “zero couples” were shown on the big screens during that part of Saturday's performance.

It has been almost 20 years since Isaac Hayes left his voice role of Chef in “South Park.” And it has also been 17 years since Hayes died at the age of 65. It should first be noted that Hayes quit following the controversy regarding an episode that skewered Scientology entitled “Trapped in the Closet” (Season 9, Episode 12), in which Stan joins Scientology after recruiters say he is the reincarnation of church founder L. Ron Hubbard. Famous members like Tom Cruise and John Travolta were sent up in the episode. Years later, during the podcast “Basic!,” “South Park” co-creator Matt Stone explained why the writers chose to spoof Scientology.

The Tom Cruise episode was really about getting sued. “South Park” voice actor Hayes, though, was a scientologist in real life. “For over 14 years, people have speculated about why my father left ‘South Park.' Scientology did,” Isaac Hayes III wrote on X. “After the episode ‘Trapped in the Closet' aired in 2005, my father suffered a stroke just a few months later that left him unable to speak or make decisions on his own. He was not in any condition to resign from anything. In a 2016 THR piece, Hayes' son — also known as Ike Dirty — said, “At the time, everybody around my father was involved in Scientology — his assistants, the core group of people. So someone quit South Park on Isaac Hayes' behalf. In his Twitter post, Hayes III said that his father “loved being the voice of Chef” and that he greatly enjoyed meeting fans. “That was a cover story created by others. My father never got to speak for himself because his health robbed him of that chance. This is for anyone who admired my father's work.

Superman has transformed into a bonafide crowd pleaser at the box office in a much-needed inaugural win for the Warner Bros.-owned DC Studios, which is run together by James Gunn — also the film's director — and producer Peter Safran. The big-budget tentpole was all but assured of staying atop the domestic box office in its second weekend, but estimates were all over the place as to how it would hold up. But, buoyed by strong word-of-mouth and reviews, it declined a less-than-expected 54 percent to $57.2 million for a pleasing 10-day domestic tally of $235 million through Sunday. Overseas — where the franchise has always faced challenges because of the comic book character's pro-American traits — Superman earned another $45.2 million for an international tally of $171.8 million and $406.8 globally in a major win for DC and Warners, which has passed up Disney to rank No. 1 in domestic marketshare for the year to date. The male-skewing superhero pic is facing fierce competition internationally from Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth and Apple Original Film's first box office hit, F1: The Movie. In a double win for Warners — which is assisting Apple in marketing and distributing the Formula One action-drama — F1 zoomed past $460 million at the worldwide box office over the weekend after finishing Sunday with a domestic total of $153.6 million domestically and $307.2 million overseas. After years of rival Marvel Studios largely dominating the superhero landscape, DC is smiling. In only its second weekend, Superman has already passed up the entire lifetime run of Marvel's Thunderbolts*, which topped out at $383 million globally earlier this year. And it's only days away from overtaking Marvel's other 2025 entry, Captain America: Brave New World, which earned a meek $415 million worldwide. Marvel hopes to begin to turn its fortunes around when Fantastic Four: First Steps hits theaters a week from now, on July 25. Elsewhere at the box office, holdover Jurassic World Rebirth remained a powerful competitor in its third weekend as it crossed the $600 million milestone globally. Columbia and Screen Gem's R-rated horror reboot I know What You Did Last Summer came in third with an estimated $13 million, in line with modest expectations. (Rivals think it will come in slightly lower when Monday's actuals are released). While Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Brande and Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise their roles from the original film and subsequent sequel, the new installment is anchored around a host of franchise newcomers, including Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon and Gabbriette Bechtel. Set three decades after the 1997 original film of the same name, the storyline — much as the first movie — follows a group of friends who try to cover up an accidental death for which they were responsible, only to find themselves being pursued by a menacing killer one year later. Critics haven't exactly embraced the reboot, which currently has a 38 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Its audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes is 68 percent. The animated family film likewise hasn't impressed reviewers — its RT critics' score is an even-worse 22 percent, but it did earn a B+ CinemaScore from moviegoers. The voice cast features an all-star lineup led by Rihanna in her first turn as a Smurf, followed by Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, Sandra Oh, Alex Winter, Billie Lourd, Maya Erskine, John Goodman, Kurt Russell and Jimmy Kimmel. The pic dropped a mere 26 percent in its fourth outing. Overseas, it earned another $29.5 million for a worldwide total of $460.8 million — a number no one could have imagined considering that Formula One movies haven't historically been an easy sell in the U.S. (although that's changing).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Erie Moon Mammoths, a minor league baseball team rebranded by John Oliver and his Last Week Tonight staff, made their debut Saturday to a record-setting crowd that included Oliver in attendance. Back in May, during a segment about minor league baseball teams and their frequent crowd-drawing promotions, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals about why they deserved a rebrand; nearly 50 teams sent in proposals, with Oliver ultimately opting for the Erie SeaWolves, as that Pennsylvania team and Detroit Tigers affiliate played nowhere near a sea. “Erie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. “There was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.” Just over two months later, the Erie Moon Mammoths — named after George Moon, an Erie man who discovered mammoth bones while scuba diving in nearby Lake Pleasant in 1991 — played their first game Saturday to an attendance of 7,070 people, the largest crowd in UPMC Park's history. George Moon was also on hand to catch Oliver's ceremonial first pitch.

Moon Mammoths games are also planned for the 2026 season. “It felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inside, amid the dark wood paneling and gleaming seal of the state, Washington's new Governor and former Attorney General Bob Ferguson addressed the small crowd of advocates, lawmakers, and child abuse survivors who had gathered behind him. “None of us really knew what to expect, but being there felt like a weight finally lifted.” For supporters like Young, it closed a loophole that let clergy across denominations keep abuse in the dark. Within 72 hours, Trump's Justice Department, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, had launched a First Amendment probe into what it called an “anti-Catholic” law. What began as a move to close a dangerous loophole exploded into a high-stakes national fight over the limits of religious liberty: whether the First Amendment allows church doctrine to overrule secular law when the two conflict. Under Washington's new child protection law, clergy of all denominations are on the hook, just like physicians, nurses, social workers, teachers, law enforcement officers, childcare providers, and others. Tulsi Gabbard Helps Boost Trump's Russia Crusade, Calling for Prosecution of Obama Officials These Right-Wingers Won't Shut Up About Epstein, No Matter What Trump Says The law does not force priests to testify in court, turn over notes, or violate attorney-client privilege. What it does is narrow but consequential: If clergy learn about child abuse — even during confession — they have to notify authorities within 48 hours. That single requirement closes a loophole most states still leave wide open. Across the U.S., child abuse reporting laws are a fragmented patchwork shaped by decades of political compromise and religious lobbying. Over the past two decades, efforts in other states — such as Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, and Wisconsin — to remove the clergy-penitent exemption have routinely stalled long before any high-profile showdown. Technically, clergy in all 50 states, D.C., and Guam are mandatory reporters of child abuse. But 33 states carve out exemptions for what is learned in confession or spiritual counseling. But even where states have laws like this on paper, enforcement is often a dead end. That's because 36 states have either their own Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRAs) or constitutional provisions requiring “strict scrutiny” for laws that burden religious practice. In those states, mandatory reporting rules that reach the confessional are nearly impossible to enforce. In much of the country, that means a priest or pastor can legally keep abuse secret if it's disclosed in a privileged setting. For Catholics, the confessional isn't just private counseling; it's a foundational sacrament. Behind the screen, a parishioner quietly confesses what weighs on their soul: “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.” The priest listens, counsels, prescribes a penance, and offers absolution. He warned plainly that any priest who violated it to report child abuse would face expulsion from the Church. Unlike abusing a child, breaking the seal triggers latae sententiae: automatic excommunication. “You know, Jesus talks about protecting children at Matthew 18:6,” says Hiram Sasser, executive general counsel at First Liberty Institute, the legal group representing the Archdiocese of Seattle. He cites the verse in which Jesus warns that anyone who causes a child to stumble should have a millstone hung around their neck and be thrown into the sea. By filing a formal complaint, the Department of Justice is effectively teaming up with Washington's Catholic bishops to overturn the state's mandatory reporting law, in one of the most aggressive federal moves to back organized religion in recent memory. “Laws that explicitly target religious practices such as the Sacrament of Confession have no place in our society,” said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon, who heads the Justice Department's civil rights division, in a June 23 press release. The DOJ sees something much bigger: a sweeping threat to religious liberty for everyone. In its complaint, the DOJ argues that Washington's law unfairly singles out clergy while letting secular professions, such as therapists and lawyers, keep similar confidentiality intact. Attorney–client privilege is not a blanket of secrecy granted out of deference to the profession; it's a rule designed to protect the legal system. Clients must be able to speak freely with their lawyers to ensure fair trials — an instrumental privilege serving the public interest, not the lawyer's. Moreover, in most states including Washington, licensed therapists are mandatory reporters, legally required to report suspected child abuse. Their claim to absolute confidentiality has historically existed outside any formal system of oversight, creating a space where institutional interests can override the protection of children — and where intimate knowledge of parishioners can be abused by those in power. After The Boston Globe's 2002 “Spotlight” investigation, and other explosive reporting exposed widespread sexual abuse and cover-ups, the Catholic Church was forced to confront a crisis of its own making. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops now maintains the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People, which includes independent audits, lay oversight boards, and national policies requiring clergy and lay staff to report suspected abuse. Additionally, the dioceses of Seattle, Spokane, and Yakima emphasize that priests are instructed to counsel suspected abusers or victims to come forward outside of confession, where mandated reporting can occur. They note that all three dioceses have undergone third-party audits and have supported mandatory reporting laws, provided confession is off limits, according to court documents. A 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury report found more than 300 Catholic priests abused over 1,000 identifiable children in six dioceses over 70 years, with thousands more likely uncounted. Among the most egregious cases were a priest raping a girl in the hospital after a tonsillectomy, another impregnating a minor and arranging her abortion, and coordinated diocesan instructions to call rape “inappropriate contact” and conceal removals as “sick leave.” The investigation revealed diocesan “secret archives” tracking abuse allegations, internal church lawyers shielding records, and tactics explicitly designed to “avoid scandal,” while senior church officials who enabled cover-ups retained their posts or advanced in rank. A 2019 Associated Press investigation found more than 900 clergy across the U.S. credibly accused of child sexual abuse who were missing from diocesan and religious order disclosure lists, exposing major gaps in the Church's promised transparency nationwide. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' internal audits reveal serious gaps. Annual compliance reviews — funded and overseen by the bishops themselves — depend heavily on diocesan self-reporting and have repeatedly flagged failures to fully implement safeguards. Survivors and advocates argue the system prioritizes restoring public credibility over real accountability, leaving secular authorities sidelined. In their landmark 2004 report, the U.S. bishops' national review board acknowledged that “in the past, secrecy has created an atmosphere that has inhibited the healing process and, in some cases, enabled sexually abusive behavior to be repeated.” It's a problem that extends well beyond Catholicism, playing out across the broader faith landscape. Etienne v. Ferguson hinges on the argument that Washington's law imposes special burdens on Catholic clergy that do not apply equally to other religions. But central to the push for reform as Washington's new mandatory reporting law moved through the legislature was evidence of how clergy-penitent privilege had been exploited in other faith communities. Advocates argued that scrapping the clergy reporting exemption wasn't about picking on any one faith, but leveling the playing field — making sure every religious institution, no matter how powerful, must play by the same rules when it comes to protecting children. Court records show Jehovah's Witnesses — who have insisted for decades that they maintain no clergy-laity distinction — have nevertheless invoked the Catholic-rooted exemption broadly to protect internal conversations related to abuse allegations challenged in court. Not just direct confessions, but discussions with congregation elders, legal advisors, and staff at their global headquarters. “Even though Jehovah's Witnesses do not apply the term ‘clergy' to elders in a religious context, the legal definition of ‘clergy' is far more inclusive,” says Jarrod Lopes, national spokesman for Jehovah's Witnesses. He notes that elders routinely share information about abuse allegations among themselves and with the denomination's headquarters, arguing that this kind of internal communication is essential. “Nothing in the Bible or the beliefs and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses prevents elders from internally sharing those details confidentially to ensure that children are protected,” he adds. The religious organization of more than 9 million works within a structured framework of policies that guide how abuse allegations are investigated and handled within the congregation. They are largely internal, even in cases involving serious misconduct. A striking example comes from Caekaert v. Watchtower, a 2020 case in Montana, where elders in congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses investigated allegations of child sexual abuse, interrogated the accused, documented his confession in detail, and sent those records to the denomination's New York headquarters. It ruled that under Montana law, such internal handling of abuse allegations — however extensive — fell within the scope of the church's established religious practice and thus remained protected by clergy privilege. The decision effectively shielded even confessions of abuse from discovery, setting a precedent where institutional secrecy could be maintained so long as it was formalized as religious protocol. The Montana case ended in a settlement, but the organization's legal strategy hasn't escaped scrutiny: Philip Brumley, a longtime general counsel for Jehovah's Witnesses, was sanctioned over $150,000 for submitting affidavits that falsely claimed the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses had no role in Montana congregations during the years when abuse occurred. A federal judge called his declarations “reckless and misleading,” finding they delayed justice in child sexual abuse cases. Across the country, other faiths have invoked clergy privilege to keep abuse hidden behind closed doors. In Arizona, the state Supreme Court let LDS bishops withhold evidence after a man who'd confessed to abusing his daughters continued for years. In California, Scientology fought court orders to release thousands of internal records, arguing that narrow clergy-penitent laws unfairly favored Catholic-style confessions over its multi-minister approach. And the more deeply religious institutions embed confidentiality into their doctrine, the stronger their legal insulation becomes, even when abuse is undisputed and dozens of individuals are involved. This mounting evidence — how other faith communities exploited clergy-penitent privilege to circumvent reporting child abuse — is what drove Washington toward reform. The result was an incendiary exposé for InvestigateWest that uncovered not only a decades-long pattern of child sexual abuse, but a coordinated effort to conceal it. Criscione's story revealed that in cases of alleged abuse, congregation elders follow an internal playbook; standard protocol baked into the organization's internal policies that often bypasses law enforcement. “When an elder in a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses becomes aware of an allegation of abuse, he has been instructed to immediately contact Watchtower's Legal Department for advice regarding the law in the state where he lives,” says Lopes, the national spokesperson for Jehovah's Witnesses. But in many cases, Criscione found, elders were explicitly instructed to withhold reports unless secular law demanded it. Decades earlier, lawmakers had quietly removed clergy from the list of mandatory reporters, creating a legal blind spot that allowed for decades of silence. Criscione's reporting caught the attention of Mary Lou Dickerson, a former Democratic state representative from Seattle. Two decades earlier, she had spent years trying to bridge the gap Criscione's article exposed. In 2005, Dickerson had introduced legislation that would have required clergy to report suspected child abuse. “She called me and said, ‘Hey, you should know, I worked on this, and I'd love to see you take it up,'” says state Sen. Noel Frame, a survivor of child sexual abuse, who now represents the same district Dickerson once did. What followed was a three-year legislative battle to finish what Dickerson had started, and to pull Washington — long a national outlier — into the modern era of child protection. Following the landmark 1962 Kempe Report on battered children, states rapidly passed child abuse reporting laws, often with federal nudges. But in 1975, lawmakers quietly cut clergy from the mandatory reporter list during a special session, burying it in a larger legislative overhaul without debate or notice. On paper, the law divided lawmakers along predictable party lines. But behind closed doors, it forced unexpected reckonings, especially for those caught between political identity, religious tradition, and the duty to protect children. In 2023 and 2024, the bill bounced between chambers as lawmakers fought over clergy privilege. Despite repeated negotiations, the two sides couldn't agree for over a year. That year, lawmakers attempted a sleight-of-hand fix, drafting a “limited” privilege that protected only Catholic confession while excluding other religions, such as Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons. In an email obtained by Rolling Stone, Jean Welch Hill, the newly appointed head of the Washington State Catholic Conference, told amendment backers the Conference “would not oppose you moving forward with your amendments,” but added a caution: “please do not reference the WSCC or Archdiocese in any public statements regarding support or opposition.” Neither the WSCC nor Hill responded to requests for comment. Facing no path to Senate concurrence, the bill died in committee. Meanwhile, then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson opened a probe into the Archdiocese's handling of abuse allegations, suing to enforce subpoenas for internal records — a case still on appeal. This year, as lawmakers pushed again to make clergy mandatory reporters, Catholic lobbyists descended on Olympia, branding the bill a direct attack on the sacred seal of confession. They deployed their heaviest hitters — including Hill, prominent priests, and a small army of church lawyers — to pressure lawmakers in both chambers. One lawmaker, Rep. Phil Fortunato, describes himself as the de facto leader of what he calls the ‘Catholic Caucus' — an informal group of Catholic Republican legislators who, by his account, view representing the Church's interests as part of their role in public office. Still, the Church's stance isn't monolithic among Catholic lawmakers. The opposition was met by a formidable, diverse coalition — former Jehovah's Witnesses, current and former Catholics, abuse survivors, faith leaders, and even schoolchildren, all united in a single demand: close every loophole. Among them was Mary Dispenza, a former nun, lifelong Catholic, and survivor of clergy abuse. On the morning of the bill signing, she stood behind Governor Ferguson with tears in her eyes to witness a moment she'd spent years fighting for. “We want the best of Catholicism, which is protecting children,” Dispenza says. George Neville Rucker, went on to serve for decades and would later be accused by more than 30 children. In 2014, she released a book, Split, which recounts her experiences. In 2003, Rucker's charges were dropped after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling struck down California's attempt to revive old abuse cases by extending the statute of limitations. Rucker, who had been living in a home for retired priests, walked free without trial. With her was Tim Law — an attorney and lifelong member of Holy Rosary Catholic Church in Seattle, where he was baptized 75 years ago and attended grade school; a parish he still calls home today. “My mother and her parents were members going back to 1920. He has spent the last decade pressuring Catholic leadership to reform from within. Five years ago, he and other local Catholics sought a meeting with Seattle Archbishop Etienne, lead plaintiff now in the Catholics' suit against Washington state, to propose a kind of truth and reconciliation process; one that would open the Church's abuse files to review and help chart a path forward. Just days after the bill signing, Law says he was barred from long-held duties at his parish — a directive he claims came directly from Seattle Archbishop Etienne after parishioners circulated a photo of Law standing with the governor at the event in May. The archdiocese denies Law's claims, stating in an email that it “does not have a policy regarding lay leaders who speak publicly on controversial legislative matters.” “Having received the constitutional majority, Senate Bill 5375 is declared passed.” Washington stepped into this battle at a uniquely combustible political moment: one shaped by a Trump-era conservative legal movement that aggressively champions religious liberty claims in court — even as the same DOJ faces backlash for keeping the Epstein files sealed, protecting evidence tied to one of the nation's most notorious pedophiles and sex traffickers. Under Donald Trump, the federal judiciary was reshaped with dozens of conservative judges sympathetic to expansive religious freedom arguments. And this DOJ — led by Trump appointees — has shown a pattern of ideologically charged litigation on behalf of religious interests, turning even local policy fights into national constitutional battles. Trump — himself found liable for sexual abuse — has steered clear of criticizing the Catholic Church over its own scandals, instead casting himself as a defender of religion against government overreach. But his relationship with the religious community has not been smooth sailing. The Catholic Church has openly clashed with Trump over his hardline immigration policies. In June, two dozen bishops joined an interfaith coalition to denounce his “Big Beautiful Bill” slashing Medicaid for low-income and disabled Americans, prompting the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to issue one of its sharpest rebukes of his social agenda. It has turned into a national flashpoint, a constitutional test case watched across the country, poised to redefine the boundary between church and state. Just weeks before Washington's new clergy reporting law is set to take effect, Pope Leo XIV issued a rare public reproof of clerical secrecy. “This culture,” he wrote, “will only be authentic if it is born of transparent processes and sincere listening to those who have been hurt. Yet even amid papal calls for a Church rooted in transparency and active vigilance, U.S. church officials are lawyering up to defend secrecy around abuse confessions. In addition to First Liberty Institute and Seattle-based Crowley Law Offices, the plaintiffs are represented by WilmerHale, a global D.C. firm with a deep bench of constitutional litigators, and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has successfully argued major religious freedom cases before the Supreme Court. Jehovah's Witnesses, for their part, say they have “closely monitored Washington's clergy reporting law,” but “have made no decision yet on whether the law should be challenged,” according to spokesman Jarrod Lopes. But on June 16, the battlefield widened further as a coalition of Orthodox churches filed their own federal lawsuit, arguing Washington's law forces priests to choose between breaking the confessional seal or facing criminal charges. Whether this second lawsuit strengthens the broader constitutional challenge, or complicates the Catholic Church's claim that it is being uniquely targeted, remains to be seen. As of June 2025, six of the nine justices on the Supreme Court are Catholic: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Neil Gorsuch was raised Catholic but attends an Episcopal church. That could slam the door on similar reform efforts nationwide, blocking other states from closing similar loopholes, even in the specific context of child abuse. Washington Attorney General Nick Brown's office did not make officials available for comment, but affirmed by email that it “would obviously defend any legal challenge to this law.” But the state knows it has a fight on its hands. Brown has privately acknowledged to supporters that the legal terrain is tricky. According to someone familiar with the conversation, Brown told advocates at a private event he wished lawmakers had worked more closely with his office before passing the bill, warning that its narrow focus on clergy could make it hard to defend. The future of Washington's freshly minted mandatory reporting law became even more uncertain at a July 14 hearing, just two weeks before it was set to take effect, when Judge David G. Estudillo granted the Justice Department's request to join the lawsuit. That order stays any penalties or prosecutions for priests who honor the confessional seal, leaving the law inoperative for those dioceses until Etienne v.  Ferguson plays out in court. (Orthodox churches sued separately and remain subject to Washington's new law unless they secure their own injunction at a July  25 hearing.) Whether its promise of ending clergy secrecy in abuse reporting holds, or collapses under constitutional challenge, now rests with the courts.
