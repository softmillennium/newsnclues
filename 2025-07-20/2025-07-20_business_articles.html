                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo As rounds of layoffs continue within a historically strong stock market and resilient economy, it is still uncommon for companies to link job cuts directly to AI replacement technology. IBM was an outlier when its CEO told the Wall Street Journal in May that 200 HR employees were let go and replaced with AI chatbots, while also stating that the company's overall headcount is up as it reinvests elsewhere. Fintech company Klarna has been among the most transparent in discussing how AI is transforming – and shrinking – its workforce. "The truth is, the company has shrunk from about 5,000 to now almost 3,000 employees," Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told CNBC's "Power Lunch" in May. But employment experts suspect that IBM and Klarna are not alone in AI-related purges. It's just that firms often limit their explanations to terms like reorganization, restructuring, and optimization, and that terminology could be AI in disguise. "What we're likely seeing is AI-driven workforce reshaping, without the public acknowledgment," said Christine Inge, an instructor of professional and executive development at Harvard University. "Very few organizations are willing to say, 'We're replacing people with AI,' even when that's effectively what's happening." "Many companies are relying on these euphemisms as a shield," said Jason Leverant, chief operating officer and president of AtWork Group, a national staffing franchise that provides over 40,000 workers to companies across a variety of sectors. Leverant says it is much easier to frame workforce reductions as a component of a broader operational strategy than admitting that they are tied directly to efficiencies found as a result of AI implementation. "Companies laying off as they embrace large-scale AI adoption is much too coincidental to ignore," Leverant said. Candice Scarborough, director of cybersecurity and software engineering at Parsons Corporation, said it is clear from recent strong earnings that layoffs are not a response to financial struggles. "They align suspiciously well with the rollout of large AI systems. She added that the use of vaguer terms can be better messaging. Sandbagging these cuts under bland language helps companies avoid 'AI backlash' while still moving ahead with automation," Scarborough said. Many companies are cutting roles in content, operations, customer service, and HR — functions where generative AI and agentic tools are increasingly capable — while messaging the corporate decisions as "efficiency" moves despite healthy balance sheets. "Being explicit about AI displacement invites blowback from employees, the public, and even regulators. Inge and other experts say there is also a measure of risk management in decisions to de-emphasize AI in job elimination. "There's absolutely an AI undercurrent behind many of today's 'efficiency' layoffs, especially in back-office and customer service roles," said Taylor Goucher, vice president of sales and marketing at Connext Global, an IT outsourcing firm. "AI might automate 70%–90% of a process, but the last mile still needs the human touch, especially for QA, judgment calls, and edge cases," Goucher said. Sticking to a hybrid model of human plus AI would make more sense for the early adoption phase, but once the jobs are gone, companies are more likely to turn to third-party hiring firms or overseas markets before any U.S.-based jobs come back. "When the AI doesn't work out, they quietly outsource or rehire globally to bridge the gap," Goucher said. Most firms will limit information about these labor market strategic shifts. "They fear backlash from employees, customers, and investors skeptical of half-baked AI promises," Goucher said. Many companies tout their AI strategy publicly, while quietly hiring skilled offshore teams to handle what AI can't, he added. Leaders need to be more honest about where AI adds value, and where human expertise is still irreplaceable," he said. AI writes better ad copy, but human judgment is still required. Mike Sinoway, CEO of San Francisco software company LucidWorks, said the limitations with current AI — and a more pervasive lack of certainty in the C-suite about adoption — are reasons to believe AI has not been directly responsible for many layoffs yet. Rather than ducking the issue of where AI is already replacing workers, Sinoway said his firm's research suggests "higher-ups are panicking because their AI efforts aren't panning out." Starting two to three years ago, freelancers were among the first employees that companies were direct with in discussing AI's role in job cuts. She pointed to the backlash that language learning company Duolingo faced when CEO Luis von Ahn announced plans earlier this year to phase out contractors in favor of AI, and then was forced to walk back some of his comments. "After the huge backlash that Duolingo faced, companies are afraid to say that is what they are doing. People are going to get angry that AI is replacing jobs," Inge said. But there is also general agreement that over time, the pace of AI-linked job change will accelerate. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently predicted generative AI like his firm's Claude large language model could wipe out up to half of entry-level officer worker jobs. There will be a tipping point in the future when companies will be more uniformly transparent, but by that time, AI's role in the labor market will be obvious. "By then it won't matter," Inge said. "Job losses will be extremely large, the only thing we can do as individuals is adapt." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Start spreading the news: Retirees are moving out of New York City. As well as other major cities, including Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Denver and San Diego, California, according to a June study by SmartAsset, which analyzed data from the Census Bureau's latest American Community Survey. While larger cities could have higher net migration numbers because they have more people, what stands out about New York is the scale of retirees leaving: Nearly 24,000 seniors left the city in a single year — more than triple the number who moved in, and more than three times the net outflow of the next-highest city. Four of the top 10 cities retirees left were in California, which had the highest net loss of residents aged 60 and over. Here are the top 10 U.S. cities retirees fled in 2023, ranked by the highest net outflow of people aged 60 and over. Retirees may choose to move for various reasons, such as being closer to family, enjoying better weather or taking advantage of more favorable tax laws, but a high cost of living can also be a major factor in deciding to leave a city. In September, WalletHub ranked New York City as the priciest city to retire in, and a majority of the top 10 cities that retirees are leaving are in states where you typically need over $1 million in savings to retire comfortably, according to an analysis by GOBankingRates earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As parents, we spend so much time helping our kids succeed on the outside — teaching them words, setting routines, and encouraging good behavior. But there's one skill that quietly shapes whether they'll be successful in life: self-connection, or the ability to tune into one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice. When kids feel safe in who they are, they carry that sense of worth into every relationship, challenge, and decision. When they don't, it can unravel their self-esteem from the inside out. 1 thing I tell other parents is that if they teach their kid just one skill in life, it needs to be self-connection. What the child hears is: "My feelings don't matter." The parent responds, "There's nothing to be scared of." Subtle messages like this, repeated over time, chip away at a child's ability to connect with themselves. Even worse, they can carry those patterns into adulthood. But here's how self-connection adds value to their lives: You don't need to overhaul your parenting style to help your kids stay self-connected. Resist the urge to say, "You're fine." It means showing your child that their emotional world is real and safe to express. This helps them develop trust in their feelings, which is a key component of self-connection. Give spaces for messy emotions, hard questions, and quirky traits. When kids feel seen and accepted, even when they're angry or scared, they learn: "All of me is welcome." This sense of belonging strengthens self-worth and emotional confidence well into adulthood. Give your child age-appropriate choices, whether it's picking their outfit, managing sibling dynamics, or deciding how to spend their afternoon. Letting them experiment and recover in a safe space helps them build their inner voice and resilience. I need to take a deep breath." When you name and regulate your own emotions, your child learns that feelings aren't something to fear or suppress — they're signals that can be acknowledged and handled. for: "What were you feeling when that happened?" And over time, your words become their internal dialogue. When a child lashes out, it's easy to focus on the yelling or refusal. But behavior is often a message: Are they feeling disconnected? Meeting the need behind the behavior helps your child understand they're not "bad," they're just human. But also notice and name the qualities that often go unseen: "You're so thoughtful with your friends," or, "I love how curious you are." Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of two transformative journals — FOUNDATIONS, the step-by-step healing guide that transforms overwhelmed parents into emotionally safe ones, and BOUND, the connection journal that builds lifelong trust and strengthens the parent-child bond in just minutes a day. She is widely recognized for her expertise in children's emotional safety and for redefining what it means to raise emotionally healthy kids. Want to be a successful, confident communicator?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A car slammed into a crowd outside a Los Angeles nightclub early Saturday morning, injuring at least 30 people, before the driver was assaulted by onlookers and shot, the city's police and fire departments said. At least seven people were in critical condition and six others were seriously injured, the fire department said in an online statement. The incident, which took place outside a club called The Vermont, occurred just before 2 a.m. local time (0900 GMT), the fire and police departments said. Captain Adam VanGerpen, a fire department spokesperson, was quoted by ABC News as saying the car apparently first careened into a taco truck outside the club and then through a valet stand and into a large group of people. Officers responding to a radio call of an assault with a deadly weapon found the driver had been shot while being assaulted by onlookers, the police said, adding that he was taken to a hospital and his condition was unknown. A man suspected of shooting the driver fled the scene on foot and possibly was armed with a silver revolver, the police said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Typhoon Wipha toppled trees and caused major flight disruptions Sunday in Hong Kong and at some nearby airports in China as it moved west off the southern coast of the country. Airports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and the casino hub of Macao canceled or postponed flights for most of the day, according to their websites. Hong Kong grounded at least 400 flights, affecting around 80,000 passengers, broadcaster RTHK said. The typhoon stayed just offshore until about 6 p.m., when it made landfall in a coastal area of Taishan city in Guangdong province, China's National Meteorological Center said. It then weakened to a severe tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 108 kph (67 mph). Earlier Sunday, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a hurricane signal No. The high winds brought down trees in Zhuhai and other cities on China's southern coast. In Hong Kong, vehicles weaved around branches strewn on the streets. The government said that it had received more than 450 reports of fallen trees and that 26 people had sought medical treatment at public hospitals. A statement didn't provide details on any injuries. More than 250 people had sought refuge in public shelters, the statement said. Hong Kong Disneyland and other amusement parks were closed. The storm, which reached typhoon strength overnight, later passed off Macao and was forecast to make landfall on China's coast late Sunday. It is expected to reach Vietnam later this week. Wipha, which is a Thai name, passed over the Philippines at tropical storm strength and drenched parts of Taiwan on Saturday. More than 370,000 people have been affected by days of stormy weather, including 43,000 who fled to government-run emergency shelters or homes of relatives because of flooding, landslides and fierce winds. More than 400 houses were damaged, officials said. Elsewhere in Asia, five days of torrential rain in South Korea has left 14 people dead and 12 others missing, the government said Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Citi described the first quarter as "remarkably resilient," with analysts now expecting Stoxx 600 earnings-per-share growth to turn positive year-on-year this quarter. Much of that optimism is centered on the big banks, while other sectors like luxury, autos and energy have been plagued by earnings downgrades. Unicredit kicks things off on Wednesday. The Italian banking giant will try to keep investors focused on the numbers, rather than its M&A ambitions. While its moves around Commerzbank have seen it increase its equity stake to 20%, Saxo Bank analysts highlight the uncertainty around its potential takeover of Banco BPM, after an Italian court blocked the move until further conditions are met. The stock is up over 50% so far this year, providing some cheer for CEO Andrea Orcel as he battles to keep his expansion plans on track. French financial BNP Paribas — the euro zone's largest lender by assets — reports earnings on Thursday. Last quarter, the bank soared past expectations driven by performance at its investment bank, but revised its profitability target slightly lower. On the same day, attention will turn to Frankfurt for Deutsche Bank's latest set of numbers. The German lender logged its best profit in 14 years last quarter, benefiting from increased trading volumes around the market volatility. CEO Christian Sewing told CNBC in June that he sees an opportunity for Europe to invest more in its own defense sector as a key growth area. President Christine Lagarde and her fellow policymakers are expected to keep rates on hold at 2% on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats are not expected to derail this meeting's outcome, according to Reuters, citing five ECB governing council member sources. But if Trump does push ahead with 30% tariffs on EU imports, there is a broad assumption the ECB will cut rates in response. In terms of the underlying economic conditions, Deutsche Bank warns that European inflation risks are "still being underestimated, with a remarkable complacency across key assets," with the tariff impact yet to fully trickle through. The bank's macro strategist also told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe that the Aug. 1 tariff deadline for negotiations between the U.S. and EU sets the stage for a late outcome to trigger a "very sharp market reaction."

To sum it up: The industry's most successful AI startup, OpenAI, was initially set to acquire Windsurf, which makes an AI coding assistant, in a $3 billion deal. But the deal fell through, and Google swooped in to hire away its CEO and some of its top executives. "It was my job to explain to the company our path forward," Windsurf's new CEO, Jeff Wang, wrote in a post on X. Wang was formerly the company's head of business. He had planned to discuss the options — fundraising from VCs, selling the company to someone else, distributing remaining cash, or just keeping it going. Later that day, a ray of light emerged. Wang said Cognition cofounder Scott Wu, and its president, Russell Kaplan, reached out. It is valued at $4 billion, coming off a $120 million funding round in March, according to PitchBook. Added to that, he was excited about both companies sharing talent. They brought in lawyers and spent all weekend hashing it out. In just over 24 hours, they had signed a letter of intent, the first step. A key part of the deal was prioritizing Windsurf employees — ensuring payouts, waiving cliffs, and accelerating equity vesting, Wang said. Lawyers pored over the deal all day Sunday, and by Monday morning, it was finalized. When the deal was at last announced to Windsurf's employees Monday morning, Wang said they celebrated. "The applause from our people seemed to last forever, and I was on the verge of tears myself," Wang said.</p>
