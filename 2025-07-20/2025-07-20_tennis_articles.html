                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wimbledon 2025 was, of course, a showcase of some tennis greats, but when folks weren't watching the ball, all eyes were on the royal family. Princess Catherine, Prince William, and the two eldest members of their royal brood made a few surprise appearances in the stands last week. And while the adorable Princess Charlotte no doubt stole the show, I couldn't help but notice Prince George's striking body language as he took in the tournament. In contrast to his younger siblings, Charlotte, 10, and Louis, 7, who are always quite expressive, George appeared stoic and serious throughout his appearance, taking on the posture of a future king. Confident and considerate, George stood tall, applauded at the right times and was even seen shaking hands with the players, including Gentleman's Singles champ Jannik Sinner (who gifted George and his sister signed tennis balls). At one point during the matches, the camera captured him looking rather regal, almost as if he were surveying his kingdom (in this case, a tennis court). Not only did the younger match the older in appearance—donning a similar blue suit and tie—he also mimicked dad's body language at a number of points, even borrowing Will's signature move of crossing his hands in front of his body while chatting. Though the young royal is still a ways away from taking the throne (and, of course, still just a kiddo), his air at Wimbledon certainly indicates a new level of maturity, suggesting that he's preparing to take on new responsibilities in his next phase as a public-facing member of the monarchy—and the future King of England. Now the question on everyone's mind: Will he attend Eton like his father, or Marlborough like mom? Kate Middleton May Break Major Royal Rule When Prince George Turns 12 This Week</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Returning after 16 months away, Venus Williams didn't map out her full plan in D.C., but made it clear this comeback is more than ceremonial. WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Venus Williams met the press Sunday in Washington, where she'll play her first match in more than a year. At 45, with a résumé that needs no embellishment, she's still finding reasons to compete, even if she's not spelling them out. She said more than once she likes to keep things close to the vest, and true to form, she didn't give away much. Venus didn't over-explain her decision to come back. Her connection to the city is long-standing, but the return seemed more about timing than sentiment. Williams: “Most of the time I don't [take up the offer to play as a wild card, laughing]. But this time I had been hitting the ball. And of course I love the game and the hard courts, it's my favorite surface, what I feel comfortable on. Williams was direct: Yes, she has a plan. She is focused on this week, not spelling out what's next, but she made it clear her return wasn't a whim. I'm just here for now, and who knows? After a 16-month layoff and a serious health scare last year, her definition of success is less about results and more about mindset, self-belief and simply getting back on court. Williams: “My personal goal is to have fun I think right now and enjoy the moment, not put too much pressure on myself. I don't know if I define success at this moment in any sort of way other than believing in myself and sticking to my process. “That's not easy to do, especially after a layoff. So this will be my effort: put it in the court. She didn't use the word “retirement,” but she acknowledged just how serious her health issues were last year, including preparing for surgery and not even having tennis on her mind. Williams: “Yeah, my health journey was very scary. … I was just trying to get healthy.” Williams didn't dwell on emotions or nostalgia, but she did reflect on the rush of Wimbledon, even as a visitor, and how much she still loves the battle. She didn't reference legacy, but she did touch on her platform, especially when it comes to women's sports, and her sense of duty to represent, promote and show up. Williams: “I always felt a big responsibility towards promoting tennis and also promoting women's sports. … I'm in love with tennis, so to have an opportunity to have this platform to promote the game even now is a great opportunity.” Returning after 16 months away, Venus Williams didn't map out her full plan in D.C., but made it clear this comeback is more than ceremonial.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 teased whether sister Serena may join her back on court.ByDavid KanePublished Jul 20, 2025 copy_link WASHINGTON, DC—One of the first questions to open Venus Williams' Mubadala Citi DC Open press conference boiled down to a single word: Why?Why, at 45 years old, was a former world No. 1 and seven-time Grand Slam champion mounting a comeback after almost a year and a half away from the game?“Why not?” Williams replied with a smile.The DC Open is as much a home tournament as any for Williams, who regularly competed in the nation's capital for World TeamTennis, leading the Washington Kastles to five of their six titles. “And of course I love the game, and the hard courts, it's my favorite surface, what I feel comfortable on.

I loved the game so much, I didn't realize that it would be so much bigger than myself. And seeing these young women doing positive things with their life, winning tournaments, inspiring the next generation, too, it's like I could have never imagined that. Williams is entered into both singles and doubles draws, set to face fellow American Peyton Stearns in the former and partnering DMV native Hailey Baptiste in the latter. Both Stearns and Baptiste were born in 2001, and have therefore never lived in a world where Venus Williams—who turned pro in 1994—was not playing professional tennis.“As a young person, I wanted to play the game, be a champion,” explained Williams, who is often loath to wax poetic about her legacy. “I loved the game so much, I didn't realize that it would be so much bigger than myself.“And seeing these young women doing positive things with their life, winning tournaments, inspiring the next generation, too, it's like I could have never imagined that. “As a young person, I wanted to play the game, be a champion,” explained Williams, who is often loath to wax poetic about her legacy. “I loved the game so much, I didn't realize that it would be so much bigger than myself.“And seeing these young women doing positive things with their life, winning tournaments, inspiring the next generation, too, it's like I could have never imagined that. “And seeing these young women doing positive things with their life, winning tournaments, inspiring the next generation, too, it's like I could have never imagined that. A post shared by Mubadala Citi DC Open (@mubadalacitidcopen) After 17 months away from action, Williams has been circling the tennis world this summer, first as an analyst during this year's Roland Garros, and as a spectator at Wimbledon. Giving her first press conference in almost two years, the 2000 Olympic champion, who conceded to often “keeping her cards close” with maddeningly succinct quotes, admitted a newfound respect for the media after her own turn behind the mic.“I think it could be very easy to say the wrong thing, is what I realized when I was live on the air,” she said with a laugh. Just as Williams was gearing up for her comeback, younger sister Serena, who retired (or evolved away) from the sport in 2022, turned heads with a practice video of her own. Though she remains on the International Tennis Federation's list of officially retired players, it makes it that much easier for fans to dream both Williams sisters back on the court in the near future.“She can take six months off and she clocks it clean,” Williams said of her younger sister, a 23-time Grand Slam champion and fellow Olympic gold medalist. “You can't teach that kind of talent. So obviously that's part of her goal too is to stay in shape. I mean, I keep saying to my team, ‘The only thing that would make this better is if she was here,' like we always did everything together, so of course I miss her. “She can take six months off and she clocks it clean,” Williams said of her younger sister, a 23-time Grand Slam champion and fellow Olympic gold medalist. “You can't teach that kind of talent.

I mean, I keep saying to my team, ‘The only thing that would make this better is if she was here,' like we always did everything together, so of course I miss her. “Quite frankly, it's great cardio,” she jokingly added.

I mean, I keep saying to my team, ‘The only thing that would make this better is if she was here,' like we always did everything together, so of course I miss her. In the Mubadala Citi DC Open singles draw as a wild card, Williams will play her first match in almost a year and a half this week against fellow American Peyton Stearns. Williams ended her press conference with a salute to her team, the people who supported her through her time away off the court and those who have helped shepherd her back to the stadiums on which she's played for over three decades.“You know, I believe in love and those around me, so my family, my friends. They're there for you also when the things are highest, because also it's hard too when you're high and trying to maintain that and trying to deal with what's happening when you're high and low.“So, the love always gets you through.” They're there for you also when the things are highest, because also it's hard too when you're high and trying to maintain that and trying to deal with what's happening when you're high and low.“So, the love always gets you through.” They're there for you also when the things are highest, because also it's hard too when you're high and trying to maintain that and trying to deal with what's happening when you're high and low.“So, the love always gets you through.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Bublik has secured his sixth ATP title after defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo in the Swiss Open final. Bublik beat Cerundolo in three sets, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 to hoist the trophy in Gstaad, claiming his second tour-level crown of the season. The Kazakh has been on a roll recently, winning 19 of his last 22 matches, and will now return to the world's top 30. Bublik has clinched two titles in less than a month, following his victory over Daniil Medvedev in the Halle Open final. The feat comes during a hot run of form for the 28-year-old, who has come on leaps and bounds in recent months. After the Halle Open final, he spoke candidly about his struggles on and off the court and revealed he was close to quitting the sport after last year's Wimbledon championships. Now, however, Bublik is producing some of the best tennis of his career and will look to carry forward his momentum into the hard-court swing. Bublik has now won an ATP title on hard-court, grass, and clay, becoming the 14th active player to do so.

Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner and 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic each withdrew from the National Bank Open presented by Rogers on Sunday. Both players cited recovery following long runs at the All England Club earlier this month. He injured his right elbow in the fourth round at Wimbledon. Winning that title in Toronto two years ago was the start of a really special moment for me, but after speaking with my team, I have to recover,” Sinner said in a release. Djokovic, 38, has won the Canada tournament four times in his career. He reached the semifinals at Wimbledon before falling to Sinner in straight sets.

It was only her second appearance in a main draw at Tour level, the first being her stunning semi-final run at Roland-Garros just six weeks ago.

Down 5-2, the Frenchwoman raised her level, clawing back to 5-all with the help of some beautifully executed drop shots. She kept the momentum going and snatched the first set 7-5, though she appeared to be struggling physically. She has been playing in recent days with an apparent injury to her left thigh. Quickly trailing 3-1, she once again leveled the score before overtaking Anna Bondar on the scoreboard at 5-3. All that remained was to close out the match, which the Frenchwoman did calmly, converting her first match point. The difference came down to break point conversion. Anna Bondar finished the match having converted just 4 of 13 break points (31%), while Loïs Boisson was far more efficient, converting 6 of 9 opportunities (67%). After a hard-fought win (6-4, 6-7 [3], 6-4) in nearly three hours of play against Germany's Tamara Korpatsch (ranked 163rd) on Thursday, Loïs Boisson followed up with convincing victories over Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova (No. She's the first French player to win a WTA trophy on the main stage since Caroline Garcia in 2022. “Reaching this level so quickly is very impressive”, Bondar said on court, before breaking into tears.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic have been forced to withdraw from the upcoming National Bank Open in Canada. However, neither man will be involved when the competition gets underway next week. The news was confirmed by National Bank Open organisers, who issued a brief statement on Sunday afternoon. They said: "Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic have been forced to withdraw from the 2025 National Bank Open in Toronto as they recover following Wimbledon. Sinner recently secured his maiden Wimbledon triumph, beating Carlos Alcaraz in the final. "I'm really disappointed to be missing the National Bank Open in Toronto, especially as I have such fond memories of playing in Canada," he said. "Winning that title in Toronto two years ago was the start of a really special moment for me, but after speaking with my team, I have to recover." Draper's withdrawal from the National Bank Open came as a surprise, with the 23-year-old explaining that he is nursing a minor injury. On X (formerly Twitter), Draper wrote: "After Wimbledon I picked up an injury in my left arm, nothing serious, but I have to make sure it recovers fully for the rest of the season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Bublik's stellar 2025 campaign has continued after defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo to win the Gstaad Open. However, he lost in the first round to Jaume Munar. Despite this setback, Bublik has endeavoured to bounce back at the Gstaad Open in Switzerland. On Sunday, he defeated Juan Manuel Cerundolo to win his sixth ATP Tour title. “This is my sixth title and I have played the greats of the game but this final I will remember as one of the toughest I ever played so good job to you, congrats to your team, that's really, really good.” Bublik was made to fight for his victory in Gstaad. The Argentinian player made 73 per cent of his first serves, while also limiting Bublik to winning only 39 per cent of his second serve points. However, Bublik's 13 aces helped carry him to victory against Cerundolo, winning 6-4 4-6 6-3. However, his triumph in Switzerland has seen him move above Alex Michelsen, Sebastian Korda, Brandon Nakashima and Tallon Griekspoor. The achievement marked his first ever tour-level title on clay. Now ranked 30 in the world, Bublik will be aiming to capture a seeded position at August's US Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper's announced partnership in the U.S. Open's new-look mixed doubles event with Qinwen Zheng was one of the most unusual but now it appears it won't happen. “During recent training sessions and competitions, I have been consistently bothered by pain in my right elbow,” Zheng wrote in a post on her Chinese social media account, according to Xinhua news service. After diagnosis by elbow specialists, they recommended that complete minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery on the right elbow be performed as soon as possible to thoroughly resolve the issue.” Recovery time for arthroscopic surgery is likely several months, but with the U.S. Open six weeks away – and the U.S. Open mixed doubles competition just five weeks away – it appears unlikely that Zheng will be able to compete. Zheng also stated: “In the coming period, I will focus my efforts on rehabilitation training, striving to return to the court at 100 percent as soon as possible. This brief adjustment is for a stronger comeback in the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>38-year-old Novak Djokovic's career appears to be winding down after yet another semifinal exit at Wimbledon, marking a seventh consecutive Grand Slam where the Serbian great has failed to capture the title. Legendary Australian player Rennae Stubbs doesn't think that's the case. Stubbs, a four-time Grand Slam doubles champion and former coach of Serena Williams, thinks Djokovic will retire sooner. "I thought his best chance was at Wimbledon, that has slipped away, but I think he probably almost feels that the Australian has been so mercurial in his life, he has had so many dramatic moments in his life, where he was treated very poorly by the Australian government," Stubbs continued, referencing when Djokovic was kicked out of the country during the 2022 tournament “So it's an interesting dichotomy, but I think that is where he wants to finish his career, and that is where I think probably will be his last Grand Slam.” Djokovic boasts the most career Australian Open wins with 10. It's the site where he won his first major title in 2008, when a then-gangly 20-year-old looked more like an outsider than a future member of tennis's coveted "big three." Andy Murray recalls how Roger Federer brutally humbled him in 'awful' moment Murray shares part of Djokovic coaching gig that left him 'uncomfortable' It was too much, I guess, to handle for me at the moment."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The debate over Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek's positive doping tests continues to be a huge talking point in tennis, with comments from former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash on the subject sparking a big reaction on social media. Sinner and Swiatek both posted positive doping tests last year, with both only handed moderate suspensions in what were viewed as controversial verdicts. The timing of that suspension ensured he didn't miss any Grand Slam events and after missing match points against Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final last month, Sinner then won his first Wimbledon title with a win against Alcaraz. Jannik Sinner struggling to escape drug ban controversy after stunning Wimbledon win Jannik Sinner's Wimbledon prize money sees him overtake a legend in the all-time list Some high-profile ex-players and journalists were quick to suggest the triumphs for Sinner and Swiatek were a bad look for tennis, but former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash gave some pointed advice to the critics of the duo with a passionate Instagram post. “Well done Jannik,” said Cash, in a post on his Instagram account. I know his coach Darren Cahill very well, he is a good mate of mine. “I've heard a lot of stuff pop up on social media about the ‘drug cheats' winning Wimbledon, but it's a little sad that this is still going on. “Before you spout out some rubbish, I think people need to do a bit of homework. Just check out what other champions are saying and know about the drug testing. If you think WADA and the International Tennis Integrity Unit don't do their homework and check this out, then you are absolutely insane. Their mental capacity is incredible when you think of what Sinner has been through. I'm very happy for them and let's acknowledge and accept their greatness rather than taint them because your favourite player didn't win.” Those comments proved to be a cue for critics of Sinner and Swiatek to voice their annoyance at Cash's views, with Tennis365's X post referencing his comments gaining huge interactions, with many of the comments negative. This is a story that will continue to run and run, with the wins for Sinner and Swiatek coming at a time when many observers have suggested they could have been serving suspensions following their positive doping tests. Yet fans of players like Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka may not be keen to ensure these stories are never forgotten.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At Wimbledon's post-tournament party, ‘The Champions' Dinner', Iga Swiatek, the winner of women's title, bedazzled in a lilac Stella McCartney gown that was reportedly worth over $2000. Town And Country magazine reports that the styling is done by Elisabeth Piner, the stylist and owner of ‘Having a ball dress hire', a company that rents out dresses for formal affairs. She sets up a full-service salon inside centre court in an empty space across the hall from the ladies' locker room. “Because we don't know who will win the tournament we choose styles that perhaps can be flexible, perhaps they have a lace up back or are more or less an average size,” she says. “The room is totally transformed into a glamorous, lovely boutique with all these wonderful dresses,” Piner said. “It's a tennis locker room with rails of silk and sparkle.” Wimbledon doesn't offer this kind of service to the men's winners, letting their individual sponsor attire them. Sinner had worn a custom dark Gucci suit, with signature loafers. Sinner and Iga would dance, though it wasn't initially part of the plan. “Yes I mean we were there and, in the beginning, they told us that because it was quite late that we don't have to do it and then Iga told me, no, no, let's do it and I was like OK,” said Sinner. And yea it was nice to share that moment with Iga. And it's yeah, a beautiful moment,” Sinner shared later with BBC Sport. At that hour, there is no traffic, so it's like 25 minutes. They have a cocktail party, and then you go down to the dinner, where it's set up beautifully. You have some appetisers, and then Iga showed up at 10:30 pm. They made this cool video up on the Jumbotron. She holds up her trophy, and then you sit down.“Sinner came at 00:05. I did not care, but he was just in the back hammering drinks with his team, having a good time. He came out with the trophy, and at some point, Laura Robson brought them both on stage. And there was a rumour they were not going to have to dance, and the crowd peer pressured them into dancing.“It was good, though. He started twirling Iga, and then 45 seconds in, they were done dancing and went back to the table … You had unbelievable food, wine,” Querrey shared.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have emerged as the heirs to the tennis throne as the Big 3 era fades, with only Novak Djokovic still clinging to his legacy. From Alcaraz's breathtaking comeback in Paris to Sinner's grass-court mastery at Wimbledon, these two are shaping the sport's future. But does Sinner's recent triumph truly tip the scales in his favor? Despite the Italian's rise to No.1, ATP star Tallon Griekspoor has now delivered a harsh dose of truth, highlighting Alcaraz's edge. In the latest episode of The Changeover podcast, recorded in the afterglow of Wimbledon's final night, ATP pro Tallon Griekspoor joined hosts Justin Roberts and Jody Maginley to dissect the burning question fans can't stop debating: Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner: who's the true king of this next-gen era? Griekspoor, who holds a 0-6 record against Sinner and 0-5 against Alcaraz, didn't hesitate to dive deep into the technical trenches of both rivals' games. “Well, for me personally, I've always had more chances against Sinner than I had against Alcaraz,” he revealed. “I feel like with Sinner you know what's coming. Like he does it unbelievably well, like he's the best player in the world.” It was respect, layered in cold analysis. Jannik Sinner with the trophy after winning Wimbledon Wimbledon Tennis Championships, Day 14, The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, UK – 13 Jul 2025London The All England Lawn Tennis and United Kingdom PUBLICATIONxINxGERxSUIxAUTxHUNxGRExMLTxCYPxROUxBULxUAExKSAxCHNxDENxINDxITAxPORxESPxSWExTURxMEXxCOLxVENxPERxECUxBRAxARGxCHIxURUxPARxPANxONLY Copyright: xJavierxGarcia/Shutterstockx 15392297jc But I think Alcaraz has a bit more options,” he explained. “And I think what's holding why Alcaraz is also a little bit more up and down is because he maybe is not using the right options at the right time. But on the other hand, in trouble, I think Alcaraz can do much more.” It was a breakdown with surgical precision, less emotion, more craft. But Sinner, well, now after yesterday, I'm actually not sure if this is true,” Griekspoor admitted. “I just think that Alcaraz has more options. To give you an idea, the ‘three championship points': Jannik Sinner had stood here before. Just 35 days earlier, he watched Carlos Alcaraz snatch the French Open from his grasp. Calm, composed, and unshakable, the 23-year-old Italian rose to claim his maiden Wimbledon crown, silencing Centre Court with triumph and redemption. And as the Dutchman draws a sharp line between the two, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have recently ignited a fresh debate with an ATP star's bold generational claim. Just when tennis fans feared a void after the golden era of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray, the sport finds its next heartbeat. Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash couldn't have put it better. “We have just come out of one of the most incredible eras, and suddenly these two guys are stepping up,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I always say Andre Agassi saved men's tennis when he came back, and these guys are saving men's tennis now.” The torch, it seems, has been passed, straight into the blazing hands of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. Dubbed “Sincaraz” by fans, this duo hasn't just filled the shoes of legends, they're sprinting in them. One man who knows both worlds well, Hubert Hurkacz, offered a take that dares to question everything. Speaking at an Adidas event in London, Hurkacz told Tennis365, “It's difficult to say who wins when they are all playing their best tennis.” But then, with the calm of a truth bomb, he dropped the line that splits generations: “I feel like the level is growing every single year, and obviously, we can say the level is better than it was ten years ago, but that is not to say Roger, Rafa, Novak, and Andy could not get to where we are now.” Yet, his respect for the past shone through. “That is not to say Roger, Rafa, Novak, and Andy could not get to where we are now. “Jannik and Carlos are playing at an incredible level now, and it is up to the rest of us to work hard to keep up with them,” Hurkacz added. So, now that the torch burns bright again, between Sinner and Alcaraz, who do you crown as the superior one after their recent display of fire and fight?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the annual Wimbledon tennis championships played out from June to July in 2025, social media users claimed that the thousands of tennis balls used at the tournament get second lives as homes for tiny mice facing habitat loss. For example, one Instagram user shared an image (archived) with text that read: "55,000 tennis balls are turned into homes for harvest mice after Wimbledon." The caption of the post, which had amassed nearly 20,000 likes as of this writing, claimed that the balls "are donated to conservation groups" that cut out small entrances for the mice to enter in "grassy meadows and hedgerows." In short, while Wimbledon has previously donated some of its tennis balls for conservation groups to use as homes for harvest mice, these donations appear to have been one-offs. The oldest source for the alleged donation appeared to come from a 2001 BBC article, which at the time stated that some of the tournament's 36,000 tennis balls were donated to The Wildlife Trusts — a British federation of wildlife conservation charities — to be recycled as homes for harvest mice. A 2003 BBC article featured a small follow-up note to that story, stating that Wimbledon had donated 350 tennis balls to The Wildlife Trusts two years earlier. Snopes contacted The Wildlife Trusts and Wimbledon to confirm if the tournament has continued to make such donations and, if so, for details about what is included in them. A spokesperson for The Wildlife Trusts said: "Unfortunately, the tennis ball story is very out of date as we haven't worked with Wimbledon in this way for some time." Similarly, a Wimbledon spokesperson confirmed that the story about harvest mice was an old one. In 2011, The Guardian newspaper reported that Wimbledon again donated tennis balls to house mice, this time at the request of an aquarium in northern England. The Guardian did not say how many tennis balls were donated at the time. It was not possible to find more recent articles about the tournament making such donations, although other tennis clubs in the U.K. have reportedly gifted tennis balls for the same purpose. While not endangered globally, harvest mice are considered "Near Threatened" in the U.K., according to the Mammal Society, a British charity. Harvest mice are Britain's smallest rodent, which means a tennis ball with a hole cut into it can be a place for the mice to rest safe from their predators. During the tournament, Wimbledon sells its used tennis balls on-site, and the proceeds go to the Wimbledon Foundation, its charity organization. Wimbledon has been selling its used tennis balls for the last several years, according to the tournament's spokesperson. Wimbledon's website did not include any information on the fate of unused and unsold tennis balls, but Keith Prowse, a sports hospitality company that partners with Wimbledon, said they are donated or recycled in the weeks and months after the tournament finishes. Keith Prowse's website added: "Previously, some of the balls have been donated to the UK Wildlife Trust who cut them up and used them to make homes for harvest mice!" "Having a Ball at Wimbledon!" "'New Balls, Please' for Mice Homes." "The Championships, Wimbledon Facts and Figures." "What Happens to Wimbledon's Used Balls? "Watermead County Park Mice to Live in Tennis Balls."
