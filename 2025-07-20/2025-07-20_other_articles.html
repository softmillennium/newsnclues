Wilcox investigates the shooting that took place near Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024, and tries to find answers about what all took place that day. “For an investigative reporter, this is sort of like Mecca,” said Wilcox as he stood on the Grassy Knoll at Dallas' Dealey Plaza. Dealey Plaza is, of course, where President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963. In the 60-plus years since, some of the world's most prominent and well-known conspiracy theories have sprung up around the incident—hypotheses about additional shooters and government or organized crime involvements, just to name a few. Wilcox said he's done his fair share of investigation into that incident as well, but instantly shifted his focus to the Trump shooting last year. Many continue to question the incident, including Wilcox. Wilcox hopes his findings and thoughts on the incident will help lead to more clarity on that day, but as a North Texan, his thoughts go to that infamous conspiracy theory stemming from 1963 as well. As Wilcox stood at Dealey Plaza, dozens of visitors toured the historic site around him, many of whom openly presented their own theories to one another about “who really shot JFK” and “what really happened that day.” Reflecting on his new documentary and the many other conspiracy theories he's heard online and in the community about the Trump assassination attempt, Wilcox ponders if that incident will have a similar legacy to the Kennedy one, drawing visitors to theorize in Butler decades later. “My hope is that 60 years from now, we don't have the mystery that we have today,” said Wilcox. Whether viewers agree with his take or dismiss it, he hopes it'll keep the conversation going and keep encouraging others to ask questions about this new moment in presidential history, just like they still do with the 60-year-old one in Dallas.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Annabelle doll, a supposedly haunted relic, was found missing from paranormal investigator Dan Rivera's hotel room after his death in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, People reported. The cause of death remains unknown, with autopsy results expected in eight to ten weeks. However, the authorities confirmed that Rivera's death didn't appear suspicious, and he was found alone in his hotel room. Adams County Coroner Francis Dutrow told People Friday that the doll wasn't in the room when first responders found Rivera.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester as they travel around the country hunting monsters, Supernatural ran for an impressive fifteen seasons on the CW. Supernatural brilliantly combined monster-of-the-week episodes with season-long storylines, developing a complex mythology throughout its fifteen seasons. There are a lot of shows out there with elements that could appeal to Supernatural fans, but perhaps no show feels as much like Supernatural as The X-Files. With its stories of cross-country monster hunting, Supernatural was heavily influenced by The X-Files, and even referenced the show in its pilot episode. Where many of Supernatural's monsters come from folklore, The X-Files skews more paranormal, diving into conspiracy theories involving UFOs and alien abductions. Both shows blend horror, drama, and humor in fascinating ways, and both feature unforgettable characters you cannot help but fall in love with. Several actors have appeared in both shows, including Mark Sheppard and Mitch Pileggi. A few crew members worked on both shows as well, most notably Kim Manners, who served as both a director and producer. Like Supernatural, The X-Files combines standalone mysteries with season-long arcs, developing its own (sometimes convoluted) mythology. Few shows run as long as Supernatural, and a sixteenth season remains a distinct possibility, but The X-Files has plenty of content to keep you busy in the meantime. The X-Files initially aired from 1993 to 2002, delivering nine seasons (and a movie) of alien shenanigans and a will-they-won't-they romance for the ages. Although X-Files creator Chris Carter had plans for a third film, I Want to Believe did not perform well enough at the box office to warrant a sequel. In 2016, Agents Mulder and Scully returned yet again for more alien adventures in a revival that lasted for two seasons on Fox network. While the mythology aspects of these seasons were met with mixed reviews, they nevertheless delivered some incredibly fun episodes that are well worth watching. Another X-Files reboot is currently in the works from Sinners director Ryan Coogler, proving that just like Supernatural, The X-Files refuses to stay dead for long.

One of Netflix's most controversial cancellations of recent years has led to calls for a comeback from the show's cast and creators as well as fans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Sunday, July 27, from 7-9 p.m., you can take part in the first paranormal investigation at Playcrafters Barn Theatre in Moline, a news release says. The theater's history dates back to 1929 with a group of “wandering” actors and crew who performed anywhere they could. It had been sitting unused since 1933 on the Otis property. “People hear footsteps going up and down the stairs. My husband and I have heard people talking on the stage when no one's there. We've checked around to find out who it was, but we haven't found anyone in those cases. It's just been us,” said Jacque Cohoon, Playcrafters board president. Recommended age is 13 and up; children under 18 must be accompanied by an adult. To purchase tickets, contact Minda here or text 309-781-7083. “While we enjoy guiding people during these events and discovering what we can about the history of the location and those who came before us, what's most important to us is to help local businesses—especially the arts. Whether you're a believer in the supernatural or not, I think we can all agree that supporting our community is important,” said Minda Powers-Douglas of QC Haunts & History.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Everyone always roots for their favorite TV series to enjoy long runs, but when they do, there's always a chance that they will go downhill. And while there are cases of shows recovering after going downhill, like The Simpsons, more commonly, a good show turned bad is likely to only get worse the longer it goes on. Far too often, the best TV shows will destroy their legacies by lasting far too long and failing to maintain their quality. Not all of these series necessarily went on for a massively long time, but they all needed to end far sooner than they did. Supernatural has become the poster child for TV series that needed to die far sooner than they did. In its early years, the urban fantasy was a fun spiritual successor to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, depicting the episodic adventures of demon hunters Sam and Dean Winchester, while also building out its interesting lore and dramatic central conflict. While the series' premise was strong enough to work initially, it did not have nearly enough fuel to keep the show going for the 15 seasons that it ended up running for. Supernatural was originally intended to end with the conclusion of Season 5. For 10 seasons and over 200 episodes, Supernatural is an unbearable, repetitive slog. The longest-running series to never win an Emmy, not once during its latter two-thirds, did it ever come close to being worthy of one. Not every season of Supernatural post-Season 5 is outright terrible, with some even being okay, but they're bereft of original ideas, the poor treatment of the supporting cast becomes increasingly inexcusable, and the main cast becomes downright annoying to follow. Nearly 20 years since it first premiered, How I Met Your Mother doesn't hold up at all, but there are still plenty of fun laughs and wholesome moments to be found in the traditional sitcom's early seasons. However, the core mystery of who Ted Mosby's future wife could be was not built to last for 9 seasons. As a result, the show becomes painfully boring and unfunny in its final seasons, and the series remains infamous for having one of the worst series finales of all time. How I Met Your Mother begins to get worse during Season 3, but it's Season 5 where it runs out of organic ideas and stops being funny. The switch in focus to Barney Stinson doesn't work at all, charming as Neil Patrick Harris may be, and all the time devoted to him and his romance with Robin Scherbatsky is rendered meaningless by Season 9. And, while its finale may overshadow everything else about it, Season 9 as a whole is still one of the weakest final seasons for any sitcom. While Dexter initially got continually worse with each season after its first outing, it blew fans away with the unmatched brilliance of Season 4. Sure enough, this proved to be the case, although no one could have predicted what a roller coaster of quality Dexter's final four seasons would be. Season 6, meanwhile, is a boring, nonsensical mess that actively insults its audience's intelligence. Seasons 7 and 8 are better than Season 6, because they had to be, but still neither comes close to matching the quality of Dexter's earlier years. Suits is a series about Mike Ross, a fake lawyer at a prestigious law firm who constantly works to make sure no one finds out he never actually went to law school. While not the series' only strong point, it was very much carried by the endlessly entertaining dynamic between Mike and his smarmy but charming mentor, Harvey Specter. Throughout its first five seasons, Suits burns through its premise as every major character learns Mike's secret one-by-one, before he's openly exposed as a fraud. The end of Season 5 is the series' high point, and Season 6 could have made for an effective epilogue, as it shows what Mike does next after losing everything. Instead, Suits trucked on for three more years, with Season 7 being underwhelming, Season 8 being a complete disaster due to Mike's total absence from it, and Season 9 only being marginally better, even with Mike's return. Killing Eve may have only lasted four seasons, but the damage done by its final season is still worse than nearly any other in television history. For its first three seasons, its quality wasn't exactly consistent, but the series never came close to being bad, and the steamy drama between MI5 agent Eve Polastri and professional assassin Villanelle. Regardless of Season 3's many flaws, the two leads remained immensely deep and compelling, and there remained a strong desire among fans to receive pay-off for all the romantic and sexual tension between them. What was previously hailed as one of the best LGBTQ+ dramas on television turns actively homophobic, leading to one of the worst endings in TV history. It's hard to say when Killing Eve should have ended, but Season 4 never should have been allowed to exist. Seasons 2 and 3 failed to be quite as legendary, but were still exceptional. Along with its eight seasons, seven special Elite "Shorts" were released. With so many streaming services for viewers to binge-watch TV shows like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad, the choices can be overwhelming. The show turns its focus away from interesting stories in favor of finding ways to include as many sex scenes as possible, and the stories it does tell range from boring to offensive. You's first season was a competent thriller, but not one anyone would expect to lead to four more seasons, with it largely being carried by Penn Badgley's brilliant performance as the enigmatic and despicable Joe Goldberg. After peaking, however, You just continued to get worse with each of its following three seasons. Season 3 is where Joe becomes insufferable, not just as a person, but as a protagonist, and the plot is the least interesting yet. With its first two parts, Money Heist tells a fantastic, complete story that's enjoyable from start to finish and that does justice to all its main characters. The show was about a group of masters in their field coming together to perform the ultimate robbery, as they grow as individuals and together as a found family, and it executed this premise to near perfection. But, due to Money Heist's popularity, it received an additional three parts that ruined the flawless ending of the first two. and the result is genuinely compelling drama, with some great new characters being added to the mix as well. The problem is that they pointlessly rip away the happy endings of several fan-favorite characters, killing several of them off in cruel, borderline sexist ways, and it does this while feeling like it lacks any real point. Every season of Money Heist is perfectly watchable, but its latter three are noticeably weaker, and they retroactively make the first two parts worse. For its first two seasons, Sliders is an inconsistent series, but one with a lot of heart and passion behind it, that chronicles the adventures of a genius college student, his best friend, his professor, and a washed-up musician as they travel between different versions of Earth, where history played out differently, in an effort to get back to their own home. From Scrubs to Futurama and everything in between, some TV show episodes have ripped audiences' heartstrings out. Season 4 gets even worse, as the lore of the series is rewritten, and Sliders devolves into a generic and horribly executed sci-fi action series. By comparison, Season 5 is a bit better, but even it is mostly just boring, with each passing episode making a viewer question what they're even still doing here. Depicting the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite, it was bold, controversial, witty, steamy, fun and, perhaps most importantly, satirical. The tragic downward spiral Gossip Girl goes on throughout its six-season run can almost entirely be attributed to it forgetting that it was mocking the millionaires and billionaires it focuses on, not taking them, their meaningless drama, and their ridiculous schemes seriously. A Gossip Girl reboot was released on HBO Max in 2021 and ran for two seasons. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Dexter: Resurrection brings back Michael C. Hall in the Dexter sequel fans were waiting for, but now this overdue show feels unintentionally dated. If all goes to plan, a new Star Trek series will be on the way soon. Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg's live-action adaptation of Uncharted is finding new streaming success three years after it bombed with critics.</p>
