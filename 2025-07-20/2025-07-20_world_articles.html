                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the morning of July 4, an American marketing professor was walking towards his ex-wife's house in Athens to pick up their two young children. But Przemyslaw Jeziorski never made it to the front door. In broad daylight, in this typically quiet, suburban neighborhood of Greece's capital, he was shot multiple times at close range, according to police. Jeziorski died where he fell, police said, his body riddled with gunshot wounds seen in grim photographs taken in the immediate aftermath. As eyewitnesses rushed to his aid, the masked gunman fled. The alleged perpetrator, arrested 12 days later for premeditated murder: His ex-wife's new partner. The motive, he told police – to prevent Jeziorski from taking away her children. “I did it all for (her) and our children so that we could have a normal life without problems,” he said, according to a transcript of a statement he made to police in the aftermath of his arrest. Related article Greek police charge five people in murder case of UC Berkeley professor, including his ex-wife The statements, verified as authentic by a senior police source speaking to CNN, offer an insight into how the alleged murder plot was put together, why it was undertaken, and provide clues as to who may have known what, and when. But there are key questions unresolved, too – not least the role, if any, of Jeziorski's ex-wife. Like all the suspects in this case, her identity is known to CNN but cannot be published due to Greek legal restrictions. The alleged perpetrator's confession, and other conflicting accounts from three alleged accomplices that were also leaked to the press, sets up what is likely to be a lengthy and high-profile trial. UC Berkeley said in a statement that Jeziorski “had a passion for teaching” and during his 13 years at the California university, he taught data analytics skills to more than 1,500 graduate and PhD students. His research work centered on emerging markets, which took him around the world for field research, and Berkeley described him as “a leading expert in quantitative marketing, industrial organization, and the economics of digital markets.” It's unclear what led to their relationship falling apart, but Kowalski told CNN the couple broke up around 2020 after moving to Greece during the Covid pandemic. Their children are dual US and Polish citizens, according to a statement from the victim's brother. Jeziorski filed for divorce in June 2021, according to California court records. It appears to be one element in a years-long custody battle for the children, who ultimately lived with their mother in Greece, with a provision that their father, Jeziorski, could take the children for one month every summer. According to Kowalski, Jeziorski asked during the custody battle that his children attend an American school in Greece, so that they could be able to attend high school or college in the US one day. “We were afraid that he (Jeziorski) would end up taking the kids completely. That would completely finish off (my girlfriend), who was overly fond of them. But (my girlfriend) did not agree and so she went back to court with Przemek,” the suspect said, according to the testimony transcript. “A month and a half ago I made the decision to end this torment we were experiencing once and for all,” the suspect told police, adding that it was a “good opportunity” given that Jeziorski was in Athens to attend the custody hearing. The statement details how the suspect says he bought a pistol more than a month ago and asked a friend, who is from Bulgaria, to help him “find Przemek and scare him so that he wouldn't take our children away from us.” He said it all began in Nafplio, a coastal city about two hours from Athens, “so that it would appear that I was there” and his cell phone would “leave traces.” Police said Jeziorski died at the scene, where seven bullet casings were found after a masked gunman shot him in the neck and chest. The three unnamed men who allegedly helped, two Albanian nationals and a Bulgarian national, are facing accomplice charges, police announced Thursday. The suspected accomplices – one of whom is a minor – have confessed to their peripheral involvement in the killing, a Greek police source told CNN on Thursday. CNN has been unable to reach attorneys for those men. “My client has confessed his actions but as you can see from the simplicity of some of the things that took place this was not an organized plan. “(The ex-wife), his partner, knew nothing about any of this.” He had said his partner's ex-husband had serious alcoholism issues and that he and the mother were worried about allowing access to the kids. We will ask for a psychiatric examination because he has had some issues in the past.” Jeziorski's friends have denied the allegations that he abused alcohol. As for the ex-wife – beyond the statement of her lawyer, denying all knowledge, there is no further information about her testimony. These inconsistencies – and other unanswered questions – will all be dealt with at the trial. The victim's brother said in a statement that “our family is heartbroken,” but grateful to Greek police and security professionals who made the arrests. “Przemek's ten-year-old children, who are US and Polish citizens, are now under care in accordance with Greek child custody procedures,” the victim's brother Łukasz Jeziorski said in a statement. “Our primary concern is their safety and wellbeing, and helping them reconnect with their family to minimize the trauma they have already endured.” CNN's Amy Croffey and Chris Dos Santos contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ballot heaps pressure on Shigeru Ishiba's minority government after it lost control of lower house in October Japan's shaky ruling coalition is likely to lose control of the upper house, exit polls showed after Sunday's election, potentially heralding political turmoil as a tariff deadline with the US looms. Ishiba's Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and coalition partner Komeito need 50 seats to secure the 248-seat upper chamber in an election where half the seats are up for grabs. That comes on top of its worst showing in 15 years in October's lower house election, a vote that has left Ishiba's administration vulnerable to no-confidence motions and calls from within his own party for leadership change. Speaking to NHK two hours after polls closed, Ishiba, 68, said he “solemnly” accepted the “harsh result”. Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, faces a deadline of 1 August to strike a trade deal with the US or face punishing tariffs in its largest export market. The far-right Sanseito party, birthed on YouTube a few years ago, has been the surprise package with its “Japanese first” campaign and warnings about a “silent invasion” of foreigners. The LDP has been urging for fiscal restraint, with one eye on a very jittery government bond market, as investors worry about Japan's ability to refinance the world's largest debt pile. Sanseito, which first emerged during the Covid pandemic spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations and a cabal of global elites, has dragged once fringe political rhetoric into the mainstream and gained wider support among frustrated voters. It remains to be seen whether the party can follow the path of other far-right parties with which it has drawn comparisons, such as Germany's AfD and Reform UK. “I am attending graduate school but there are no Japanese around me. All of them are foreigners,” said Yu Nagai, a 25-year-old student who voted for Sanseito earlier on Sunday. “When I look at the way compensation and money are spent on foreigners, I think that Japanese people are a bit disrespected,” he said after casting his ballot at a polling station in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward. In Japan, which has the world's oldest population, foreign-born residents hit a record of about 3.8 million last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine intends to secured $6.9 billion in international arbitration rulings against Russian energy giant Gazprom, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on July 20, citing a report by Serhii Koretskyi, CEO of Ukraine's state-owned energy company. "These are absolutely fair decisions that demonstrate the responsibility of Russia and Gazprom and affirms the strength of international law," Zelensky said. A French court authorized this April the enforcement of a $5 billion arbitration award against Russia for damages caused to Ukraine's state-owned energy company Naftogaz during the occupation of Crimea. Under international law, arbitration awards can be enforced in multiple jurisdictions through domestic courts. Naftogaz, Ukraine's largest energy firm, lost critical infrastructure, natural gas reserves, and service networks in the region. Kateryna Denisova works as a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a news editor at the NV media outlet for four years, covering mainly Ukrainian and international politics. Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany. The Russian oil giant has been trying to sell its 49.13% stake in India's Nayara refinery, but the EU's latest sanctions package could make such a deal too risky for buyers. The 424th "Svarog" Battalion of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces (USF) published a video on July 20 showing Ukrainian drone operators successfully targeting and destroying an experimental "KOP-2" Russian electronic warfare system. "The main thing for us is to achieve our goals. Our goals are clear," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian-state media reporter on July 20. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian ambassadors will receive detailed instructions on July 21 on how to proceed with the recovery of the awarded funds. A fire broke out in Moscow Oblast overnight on July 20 as Ukraine reportedly launched a drone attack targeting the Russian capital, local Telegram channels reported. According to Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service, WhatsApp, owned by Meta tech giant, is a likely target for blocking. An Embraer 190AR plane operated by Azarbaijan Airlines crashed in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, after coming under fire over Russia's Chechnya. The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a railway in Russia's Tula Oblast, causing "serious disruptions" to Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on July 20.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flag held up during curtain call for Il Trovatore, with attempts to remove it resisted “During the curtain call for Il Trovatore one of the background artists came on stage waving a Palestine flag. Just stood there, no bowing or shouting. Another post on X from Stephen Ratcliffe, who was also watching the production, added: “Controversy at end of Trovatore @rbo_org tonight when an extra/chorus member unfurled a Palestinian flag. Off stage manager tried to grapple with him but he held his ground. Bet he won't be working there again.” A video of the incident, posted on social media, shows a man, thought to be a Royal Opera House staff member, appearing from the wings and attempting to forcibly wrest the flag off the protesting cast member. During the tussle, two other performers who are stood alongside the protester can be seen lurching to their side. Cast members further forward on the stage appeared oblivious what was happening behind them. Other officials standing in the wings can be seen shouting messages to the protesting cast member, who looks ahead and appears to ignore them. The plot, which has many twists and secrets, revolves around four main characters: Manrico, Azucena, Leonora and Count di Luna, each caught up in misunderstandings and dramatic confrontations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A boy survived the sinking of a tourist boat in Vietnam which killed dozens of people by sheltering in an air pocket of the overturned vessel, it has emerged. The 10-year-old had been traveling with his family in Vietnam's famed Ha Long Bay when the vessel they were sailing on became caught in a sudden storm. Trapped in the boat as it capsized, the boy found refuge in an underwater air pocket, where he stayed and waited for help. He was warmed up and transferred to a nearby hospital, local outlet VietnamNet reported. “Everything happened so fast,” the boy said. “I tried to get out, and then the soldiers rescued me.” Search and rescue efforts are continuing for missing passengers and crew after sightseeing ship the Wonder Sea capsized in a squall on Saturday but have been hampered by bad weather. At least 37 people are confirmed dead from the sinking, state media reported, revising down an earlier toll but warning that it could still rise further. Another survivor, a 36-year-old Vietnamese man, described escaping the overturned boat by dumping his life jacket and swimming through an underwater window. Fire extinguisher salesman Dang Anh Tuan described the moment the vessel suddenly capsized during bad weather, leaving little time for those on board to react. “It rained for about 15 minutes, and then the boat started to shake vigorously, tables and chairs were jostled around and seconds later the boat overturned,” Tuan told the Associated Press. I took a deep breath, got rid of my life vest and dove down. I saw a streak of light and followed it to swim out, escaping the boat, and then I climbed on the overturned boat to look for help,” he said. Tuan, along with several others who had been on board, clung onto the overturned boat and waited for another two hours in pouring rain until emergency crews arrived. He'd been holidaying in Vietnam's popular tourist bay with 11 university friends. VN Express reported that the Wonder Sea was caught in a storm around 1.30 p.m. local time (2.30 a.m. Over 20 children were on board, VNExpress said. Halong Bay is a popular tourist hotspot and a UNESCO world heritage site comprising about 1,600 limestone islands and islets. CNN's Eve Brennan, Max Saltman and TuAnh Dam contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran and the Eurotroika (France, Germany and the United Kingdom) have agreed to resume their negotiating process on Tehran's nuclear program, the Tasnim news agency said, citing sources. "The informed source told Tasnim that Tehran and the European troika have come to an agreement in principle on the resumption of the talks about Iran's nuclear program, but the timing and location of the negotiations are under debate," the news agency said. "The decision as to which country will be hosting the upcoming talks has not been finalized yet," the sources said. Iranian nuclear issue The five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany struck a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015 to address the crisis over its nuclear program. Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in 2018. Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, the US and France have been in talks with Iran in Vienna since April 2021, seeking to restore the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in its original form, without achieving any specific results. In response to Washington's withdrawal from the JCPOA, in 2020, the Iranian parliament passed a law outlining a strategic plan to remove sanctions and protect the Iranian people's interests. As part of this plan, Iran scaled back several obligations under the nuclear deal, particularly by suspending inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) beyond the safeguard agreement related to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and prohibiting the use of stringent monitoring measures. Earlier, Iran vowed to withdraw from the NPT if the snapback mechanism, allowing for the return of all UN Security Council sanctions against Tehran that were suspended under the JCPOA is activated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Embraer 190AR plane operated by Azarbaijan Airlines crashed in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, after coming under fire over Grozny, Chechnya. Azerbaijani authorities laid blame on Russia, with an investigation pointing to a Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system mistakenly targeting the plane amid a reported Ukrainian drone attack. Aliyev said that despite seven months having passed since the incident, Azerbaijan has yet to receive a clear response from the Russian authorities. In the Malaysian airline Boeing case, it took more than ten years. We are ready to wait ten years, but justice must be done," Aliyev said. Earlier this July, the European Court of Human Rights found Russia responsible for the downing of Flight MH17, a Malaysian airliner shot down by Russian-controlled forces over Ukraine in July 2014. Three hours into the flight, Boeing 777 was shot down by Russian militants using a Buk surface-to-air missile over Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast. All 283 passengers and 15 crew members on board, among them 196 Dutch citizens, were killed. Previously, Aliyev accused Moscow of suppressing evidence and criticized his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for not openly admitting guilt. Putin offered condolences for the incident, but stopped short of admitting Russian responsibility. "The main thing for us is to achieve our goals. Our goals are clear," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian-state media reporter on July 20. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian ambassadors will receive detailed instructions on July 21 on how to proceed with the recovery of the awarded funds. A fire broke out in Moscow Oblast overnight on July 20 as Ukraine reportedly launched a drone attack targeting the Russian capital, local Telegram channels reported. According to Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service, WhatsApp, owned by Meta tech giant, is a likely target for blocking.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a railway in Russia's Tula Oblast, causing "serious disruptions" to Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on July 20. Instead of being brought to the Ukrainian border, 56 Ukrainian deportees were taken to a basement facility in Georgia where they were being held in a transit zone, aid group Volunteers Tbilisi reported. Oleksandr Usyk retained his heavyweight title and preserved his unbeaten record with a commanding fifth-round knockout of Daniel Dubois on July 19 at Wembley Stadium.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a railway in Russia's Tula Oblast, causing "serious disruptions" to Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on July 20. Russian troops reportedly use the railroad to transport military personnel and supplies to troops on the Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts fronts. The sabotage operation disrupted Russian supply lines and led to delays in the delivery of ammunition, weapons, and dual-use components from Tula-based factories. The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks on Russian territory and in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. The region is home to several military industrial manufacturing facilities that power Russia's war machine along Ukraine's front line. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. "The main thing for us is to achieve our goals. Our goals are clear," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian-state media reporter on July 20. The cyberattack allegedly destroyed large volumes of data and installed custom software designed to further damage the company's information systems. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian ambassadors will receive detailed instructions on July 21 on how to proceed with the recovery of the awarded funds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CHISINAU, July 20. Moldova spoiled relations with Moscow under pressure from the West, which supports the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity, Russian Ambassador to Chisinau Oleg Ozerov told TASS in an interview. "It seems to me that the current policy, which is now being implemented by Moldova's ruling party, comes as a result of pressure exerted by European Union countries - first of all, by Brussels - on the Moldovan government. They claim this will guarantee prosperity. But if we look at the statistics, it is quite the opposite," the diplomat said. "The entire complex of measures undertaken by the Moldovan government under the pressure from Brussels and NATO countries, as we think, has seriously harmed our bilateral relations," he added. Relations between the two states began to deteriorate in 2021, when pro-European forces assumed power in Moldova. Following the 2023 decision to expel 45 Russian diplomats, Moldova has significantly restricted consular services, as well as cultural, educational, and business ties with Russia. These measures have primarily affected Moldovan citizens. The measures have been harshly criticized by the country's opposition.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump's decision to continue military aid to Ukraine, in many aspects, came as a result of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's efforts, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told Bild in an interview. "The entire Europe is on Ukraine's side. The United States is also ready to continue support. This is, to a significant extent, a result of the German chancellor's initiative," he said. "Friedrich Merz played a significant role in this, because he made it clear from the very outset that he defends Ukraine." "Friedrich Merz phoned Donald Trump and said there is a need for the United States now. We can only be glad that the chancellor has established a pragmatic relationship with the US president, and that the voice of Germany is heard in Washington again," Wadephul said. On July 14, Trump said that Washington will continue transferring weapons and military equipment to Kiev if Europe pays for the supplies. NATO will coordinate the process. The American leader also said that Washington would impose import duties of 100% on Russia and its trading partners if Moscow and Washington did not reach an agreement on resolving the conflict in Ukraine within 50 days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia aims to be able to launch 2,000 drones towards Ukraine simultaneously, German Major General Christian Freuding said in an interview published on July 19. Ukrainian Foreign Intelligence Service (SZRU) told Politico in June that the Kremlin plans to produce 2 million first-person-view (FPV) drones and 30,000 long-range and decoy drones in 2025, marking a critical expansion of Moscow's drone warfare program. Between Sept. 13, 2022, and Aug. 30, 2023, Russian forces fired nearly 2,000 Shaheds into Ukraine, according to Airwars, a London-based conflict monitoring organization. Freuding's comments come as Russia has continued to ramp up its Iranian-designed Shahed drone attacks on Ukrainian cities in recent weeks, including strikes on Ukraine's far-western regions. On July 9, Russia launched a record 728 Shahed-type drones and decoys across the country. Robert "Magyar" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces warned on July 4 that Russian Shahed drone strikes could escalate to 1,000 per day. Amid the increased risk of intensified Russian attacks, Freuding told the Bundeswehr podcast Nachgefragt, that Ukraine can indirectly counter anticipated drones attacks by targeting production sites with long-range missiles. Ukraine regularly strikes military production facilities on Russian territory, but has called upon Western allies to supply more long-range weaponry for added capabilities. Freuding announced earlier this month that Ukraine will begin receiving hundreds of domestically produced long-range weapon systems by the end of July under a German-financed agreement. In an effort to counter Russia's increasing drone production, Ukraine has also increased production of its own drones Ukraine's, using them heavily in attacks on various Russian regions as well as on the front line. Then-Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at a June 26 press briefing that Kyiv currently has the capacity to produce 4 million drones a year. President Volodymyr Zelensky also said that Kyiv has the capacity 8 million drones annually, but lacks the international financial backing to reach that potential. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. "The main thing for us is to achieve our goals. Our goals are clear," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian-state media reporter on July 20.
