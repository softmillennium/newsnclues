                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea are reportedly set to face a US tax bill of approximately £10million following their Club World Cup victory. The Blues' impressive 3-0 triumph over Paris Saint-Germain in New York last weekend means Chelsea will receive £85m in prize money from competition organiser FIFA. Of this, £39.7m is due to be paid immediately and £45.3m at the conclusion of next season, but the US authorities will classify it as taxable income, reports CityAM. Consequently, all participating clubs are required to pay a variety of city, state and ticket-sales taxes, with Chelsea facing the largest bill. However, in more positive news for Chelsea, The Telegraph report that their success in America has handed them a significant boost when it comes to securing a potential new shirt sponsor. But that figure is said to have risen to £60m-a-year, with the club reportedly in talks with seven-to-ten big global companies over a long-term front-of-shirt sponsorship. Chelsea will now be eyeing a first Premier League title since 2017 when the new season begins in August. Enzo Maresca's team will start their season at home to FA Cup winners Crystal Palace on August 17. Want to keep up to date with the breaking and important Chelsea stories whilst on the move?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>INDIANAPOLIS — Some friendly advice for WNBA leaders as they negotiate with the players on a new contract: It will not go well for you, either in the negotiations or the court of public opinion. To say it was lacking in substance is an understatement. “Wasted opportunity,” “disrespectful" and "frustration" were words used by players to describe it. With 40 players showing up — veterans and rookies, megastars and role players, the largest gathering outside the Wubble — it sent an unmistakable message to the league about their commitment. “I hope it expedites the process so we're not going back and forth where they're trying to test us and see who flinches first. Because we're not going to,” Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier, a WNBPA vice president as well as this season's favorite for MVP, said Friday. “We are always going to stand firm. Funny how this is never an issue with men's teams, even the ones that are perennial money losers. But on Thursday night, league commissioner Cathy Engelbert told The Associated Press the talks are “a process.” “We're both in listening mode,” Engelbert told the AP. “We're going back and forth on issues. We know what's important to owners and striking the right balance.” “It was pretty shocking to see,” New York Liberty forward Breanna Stewart, also a union vice president, said. “Not many things did we both agree on. I think there were two bullet points where we were like, `OK, we can move forward with this. But this is what happens when women aren't taken seriously. The federation assumed, wrongly, that the women would eventually give in, preferring to get something rather than holding out for everything they deserved. When fans serenaded the USWNT with chants of “Equal pay! Equal pay!” after they won the World Cup in France, it was a resounding rebuke to U.S. Soccer and everyone else who short-changed women. This is a time of explosive growth for the WNBA. A monster media rights deal that will pay the league $200 million a year, more than triple what it gets now, begins next year. Franchise valuations are soaring, with the expansion Golden State Valkyries recently valued at $500 million and five other teams worth $250 million or more, according to Sportico. Sponsors are clamoring for any piece of the action they can get. Nor is it a secret that W players are woefully undercompensated. Player salaries top out at $250,000 and revenue “sharing” is around 10%, compared to the 50% that is typical of almost every professional men's league. And, like the USWNT in 2019, they're no longer willing to accept less. So we know what it takes,” said Las Vegas Aces center A'ja Wilson, who, coincidentally, was wearing the latest version of her signature shoe released for the All-Star Game. “And when you see a business growing, obviously the people that are working for the business should have some say in that as well. Aside from the Neanderthals who parrot that misleading narrative of the W being propped up by the NBA, fans are going to be on the side of Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers, Wilson and Collier rather than rich owners and league officials. And when that happens, the league might regret its choices. The WNBA and its players will eventually come to an agreement. The league has a choice: Be seen as an equal partner that wanted to do right by the players or as an overlord that had to be dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing. It might want to ask U.S. Soccer which one is better. Follow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“As we move further into the decade, the risks will continue to grow unless we take drastic measures, such as moving competitions to winter months or cooler regions,” said Professor Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures in Leeds. “We're potentially one heatwave away from a major sports tragedy.” From the inaugural 1930 World Cup onward, June and July have traditionally been reserved for international tournaments. But summers have warmed dramatically—up by 1.89°F globally and 3.26°F in Europe since the 1990s—raising red flags for outdoor, high-intensity sports like soccer. During the expanded Club World Cup, held in 11 U.S. cities from June 14 to July 13, extreme heat and thunderstorms disrupted matches. FIFA responded with updated extreme heat protocols, including extra water breaks, sideline fans, and shaded benches. National Team could miss out on 2026 World Cup over several doping cases FIFA President Gianni Infantino recently assured that covered stadiums would host daytime matches in 2026. Looking ahead, the 2030 World Cup—co-hosted by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco—may face even greater heat challenges, with temperatures already surpassing 104°F this summer. FIFA's internal reports have downplayed the threat, but climate experts disagree. Playing 90 minutes under direct sunlight can trigger hyperthermia, cardiovascular strain, heat exhaustion, or even life-threatening heatstroke. But with 48 teams in 2026, avoiding midday matches may be impossible. Still, rescheduling tournaments disrupts European club seasons, making such changes logistically complex. “It reflects how climate change is fundamentally reshaping our way of life—even the world's most popular sport.” World Soccer Talk, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea were given a little something extra to fight for ahead of their Club World Cup final triumph over Paris Saint-Germain, a new report has revealed. Enzo Maresca's side were relentless from the first whistle in New Jersey, scoring all three before half-time and putting the game well out of reach; PSG looked a far cry from their usual selves which saw them win the treble last season. And now, it can be revealed what triggered that added motivation in the Chelsea camp. PSG boss Luis Enrique appeared to strike Chelsea striker Joao Pedro in the face during a confrontation. Pedro was initially embroiled in a conflict with Gianluigi Donnarumma and Achraf Hakimi - with Andrey Santos also on the scene - before Enrique marched over towards the situation. But rather than defusing the situation, the Spanish manager made it physical, laying his hands on Pedro before being held back by his own player Presnel Kimpembe. Pedro fell to the floor in dramatic fashion, clutching at his face. Christopher Nkunku and Romeo Lavia stepped in to defend their team-mate, holding back a visibly frustrated Gianluigi Donnarumma, who appeared to berate Pedro for his animated reaction. What followed was pandemonium, with around five Chelsea players swarming Donnarumma in the aftermath. The PSG goalkeeper was shoved by Tosin Adarabioyo, as Kimpembe continued his attempts to defuse tensions alongside Chelsea's Filip Jorgensen. On the touchline, a furious Enzo Maresca stormed in to drag his players away, shouting at those involved as he tried to restore order. The Chelsea boss was also seen pulling Donnarumma aside, attempting to calm his fellow Italian in a bid to defuse the flare-up. The chaotic scenes followed a match that saw six yellow cards shared between the two sides, and a red card for PSG midfielder Joao Neves, who was sent off in the 85th minute for violent conduct.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prior to Chelsea's 3–0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final, a harmless FIFA dinner can be said to have primed the pump, according to emerging reports from The Times. That information was quickly passed on to head coach Enzo Maresca, who shared it with his team. The message was loud and clear: PSG already believed they had won. Maresca converted their overconfidence into fuel for his players, and they came back with a scorching first half that left the French giants stunned. Chelsea's press suffocated PSG's midfield, and the psychological boost gained overnight was reflected in the increased energy levels. Cole Palmer hit twice, and a third by João Pedro before the break put the game to bed in quick time. What reportedly began as an overheard chat at a dinner gala concluded as victory for the Blues, who are preparing for next season's Premier League campaign.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea's dominant Club World Cup victory this summer has led to an unexpected snowball effect, with several Premier League clubs, including Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United, having their previous titles effectively downgraded. Enzo Maresca's side cruised to a convincing 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in the final at the MetLife Stadium, with Cole Palmer scoring twice and Joao Pedro adding a chipped finish to cap off a historic performance. But it's not just a milestone moment for Chelsea, it's also one that has triggered a significant reclassification of footballing honours. In turn, all previous winners, including Real Madrid, Barcelona, and English clubs like Liverpool, Man City and Man United, will have their victories rebranded as "Intercontinental Champions" rather than Club World Cup winners. Real Madrid have won the tournament a record five times. Chelsea, meanwhile, now officially hold one Club World Cup 'title' despite having previously lifted the trophy in 2021. That earlier win, like the others, has now been reclassified. Traditionally held every year since 2005, the Club World Cup has now become a quadrennial event, modelled more closely on the FIFA World Cup. It featured an expanded roster of top teams from every continent and offering a larger global platform. And while Chelsea celebrate becoming inaugural champions in FIFA's eyes, their triumph has also rewritten the modern honours list.</p>
