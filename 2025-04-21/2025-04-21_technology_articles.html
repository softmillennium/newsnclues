                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ChatGPT search, OpenAI's feature within ChatGPT that allows the chatbot to access and incorporate up-to-date information from the web into its responses, is growing at a fast clip in Europe. A report filed by one of OpenAI's EU corporate divisions, OpenAI Ireland Limited, reveals ChatGPT search had roughly 41.3 million average monthly active “recipients” for the six-month period ending March 31. That's up from approximately 11.2 million average monthly active recipients in the six-month period ending October 31, 2024. Interesting update in the OpenAI EU Digital Services Act (DSA) FAQ article ChatGPT search may soon be subject to these requirements, assuming the current growth trend holds. ChatGPT Search has made inroads against incumbents like Google since debuting last year. According to a poll published in September, 8% of people said they'd choose ChatGPT over Google as their primary search engine.

The situation did not look good for the contract chipmaker, and in its most recent annual report TSMC acknowledged difficulties in monitoring how its chips are used once they leave its fabs. "Our role in the semiconductor supply chain inherently limits our visibility and information available to us regarding the downstream use or user of final products that incorporate semiconductors manufactured by us," reads a statement by TSMC in its annual report. "This constraint impedes our ability to fully ensure that semiconductors manufactured by us will not be diverted to unintended end use or end-user, including potentially by our business partners, or by third parties with an intent of circumvention." When TSMC is contracted to produce a chip, it is supplied a GDS file that contains all the geometrical shapes, layers, and hierarchy information needed to fabricate that chip. TSMC (or any other foundry) validates the GDS file using various tools to ensure that it complies with process technology rules, and then generates photomasks to eventually make chips. At no point can TSMC determine developer of the chip, or its final destination. "In addition, if we or our business partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits or are found to have violated applicable export control or sanctions laws, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties resulting from relevant legal proceedings," TSMC stated.

If you're looking for a dramatized version of what the Catholic Church will be doing in wake of Pope Francis' death at 88, you'd be hard pressed to find one more current. Just one problem: Due to the frustrating and fluid nature of content licensing, you can't actually stream it via any subscription service right now. The movie, which stars Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, and John Lithgow as cardinals all hiding dirty secrets while vying to be pope, was available to stream on Peacock until very recently. Thanks to a deal between Universal and Amazon Prime Video, though, the title is moving to Prime video—a transition that was in progress right as news of Pope Francis' passing came out on Monday. Currently, you can rent the film for between $6 and $20 on Prime, or you can wait until 3 am Eastern time on Tuesday to watch it on the service for free if you're a Prime member. The deal, signed in 2021, means that following their theatrical releases, Universal Filmed Entertainment Group movies head to Peacock for four months before switching to Prime Video for 10 months, then migrating back to Peacock for the last four months of the “Pay-One” window—the period that follows a theater release. WIRED has reached out to Amazon to confirm Conclave will stream starting Tuesday and will update this post if we receive a response. Meanwhile, Bluesky, X, and TikTok are overflowing with bits about the movie—including jokes about how Pope Francis died soon after meeting US vice president JD Vance—and how a real-life conclave could work. But it's not the only good papal content out there. Streaming on Netflix, The Two Popes stars Anthony Hopkins as Pope Benedict XVI and follows his friendship with his eventual successor, Pope Francis. Starring Jude Law as the world's first American pope, this 10-episode miniseries focuses on a pope who bucks conventions and eschews the advice of Vatican stalwarts in favor of the guidance of Sister Mary, an American nun played by Diane Keaton.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This unconventional real-world tease comes days before Slate's April 24 launch event at Long Beach Airport, according to an invite viewed by TechCrunch. The Michigan-based startup, founded in 2022, has operated in relative secrecy until TechCrunch published a report revealing Bezos' financial involvement, as well as its plan to price its EV at around $25,000 while encouraging buyers to customize the vehicle to their liking. Similarly, Reddit users posted pictures over the weekend of yet another version of the truck made to look like a hatchback that almost resembles Rivian's forthcoming R3. The vehicle Tracy saw up close this past weekend looks just like the two-door pickup truck spotted by a Reddit user earlier this month in Long Beach, but with a hard cover over the bed that gives it more of an SUV shape. That makes three different silhouettes we've seen of Slate's truck so far — and that adaptability is something the company has privately touted as it locked down well over $100 million in funding, TechCrunch has learned. Slate's leadership focused heavily on the “Transformer” metaphor as it wooed investors to fill out its Series B funding round last year, according to a person familiar with the pitches. This involved showing prospective investors a generic version of the truck, and then leading them to another room while a team quickly customized the vehicle. Even still, Tracy wrote that the Slate truck “is unlike any new vehicle I've ever seen not just in my decade as a car journalist, but in my entire lifetime.” An AI doctoral candidate in California says they had their student visa revoked Tesla reportedly delays launch of new low-cost model by months OpenAI's o3 AI model scores lower on a benchmark than the company initially implied Uncovered emails showed how Meta struggled to keep Facebook culturally relevant Famed AI researcher launches controversial startup to replace all human workers everywhere</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Memory and fabric overclocking now covered by the warranty wrapper. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. According to documents shared with Tom's Hardware by a source, Intel will announce a new "Intel 200S Boost" feature for its Arrow Lake processors tomorrow that's designed to boost gaming performance by providing official warranty coverage for a subset of overclocking features, including memory overclocking. As you can see below, we have put the new feature through a battery of tests before its official launch and found the gains generally match our expectations for memory overclocking, with an average improvement of 7.5% over the officially supported memory speeds.It's no secret that Intel's Arrow Lake chips delivered disappointing gaming performance at launch — in fact, they are significantly slower than even Intel's own previous-gen models. The new approach aims to leverage several existing features and package them under the warranty protection umbrella, much like AMD introduced a 105W mode to boost performance for its underperforming 65W Ryzen 9000 models. However, Intel hasn't issued any official performance projections for the new feature yet.The Intel 200S Boost feature enhances the performance of Arrow Lake K-series processors by enabling a few overclocking features in an easy-to-use one-click BIOS profile, but the new settings don't impact CPU clock speeds or power settings above current warranty limitations. Instead, the tweaks optimize specific memory and fabric speeds, marking the first time Intel has offered official warranty coverage for potential chip damage resulting from XMP memory overclocking profiles or adjusting fabric speeds.There are, however, several caveats, and the tweaks are already well known to the enthusiast and overclocking community. Firstly, Intel now covers "up to" DDR5-8000 memory speeds within its warranty; however, not all chips will be able to reach that speed, and because the approach is still considered overclocking, Intel does not guarantee system stability with XMP profiles. As we demonstrate below, more affordable and easily supported DDR5-7200 kits offer nearly the same performance in most games and applications we tested. The 200S Boost feature will be integrated into BIOS revisions from major motherboard vendors, with BIOS updates expected to arrive tomorrow from at least a few OEMs. The feature will only be implemented on Z-Series motherboards, which is a curious limitation given that Intel now supports memory overclocking on B-Series boards. It's also only available on K- and KF-series SKUs.The 200S Boost profile also increases the speed of the Next Generation Uncore (NGU/SA Fabric), which enables communication between various chip elements, such as the CPU cores, memory controllers, and other components. Intel is also obviously wary of motherboard vendors pushing the limits with their BIOS settings (which they have been known to do) and thus creating another potential chip reliability issue. As such, the company has also instituted several guardrails around the feature, with strict limitations that prevent motherboard makers from altering any other features, such as CPU clock speeds or power thresholds, as part of the 200S Boost settings. Intel also has voltage ceilings for the System Agent and memory that cannot be exceeded. You cannot use XMP kits that exceed the DIMM voltage ratings. The limits are listed in the table above.The OEMs are allowed to tailor their voltage and speed settings within those constraints to optimize performance with their product. Any manual manipulation by the end user of clocks or other settings will automatically disable the 200S Boost profile, reverting you to manual overclocking. Finally, 200S Boost is entirely opt-in; it can't be enabled by default in the BIOS and requires users to turn it on.Intel 200S Boost is separate from the Intel Performance Optimization (IPO) program, a China-specific collaboration between Intel and System Integrators (SIs) that facilitates more robust overclocking, including clock speeds and power settings. The 200S Boost feature is built on firmware with an MR1 or newer revision. We merely recreated the correct settings for the feature in this BIOS, and sources close to the matter have confirmed that our results align with general expectations.We tested six configurations and three memory speeds across 16 games at 1080p. We also tested with a 32GB Patriot Extreme 5 DDR5-8000 kit to measure the peak supported XMP speeds. Naturally, performance increases vary by title, from as low as a 3.7% increase in A Plague Tale: Requiem to an 11.6% increase in Baldur's Gate 3. The titles that benefit most are simply the memory-sensitive titles, so there are no surprises here.We, like many other outlets, test with a DDR5-7200 XMP profile as our default memory configuration. We chose this speed because it is widely supported by most chips (you may encounter issues with DDR5-8000 UDIMMs on some chips or motherboards) and it is more affordable — 32GB DDR5-8000 kits typically carry a $45 to $60 (43 to 57%) premium, yet deliver precious little extra performance.We see that trend hold strong in our results, with the DDR5-8000 200S Boost configuration only being a mostly imperceptible 1.2% faster performance overall in 1080p gaming. As you can see, it did give at least some boost in performance, but the gains undoubtedly fall into the imperceptible range. Notably, we don't see as significant a gain because we test all processors with reasonable XMP settings applied as our stock configuration in reviews.The fact that Arrow Lake couldn't match the gaming performance of Intel's own prior-gen Raptor Lake Refresh chips was one of the most disappointing aspects for enthusiasts. Here, the much less expensive Ryzen 7 9800X3D and its premium counterpart, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, still hold a 30%+ lead in gaming, so it remains a no-contest if you're strictly focused on gaming performance.Despite the addition of new fabric tweaks and support for up to DDR5-8000, we still recommend that most users stick with DDR5-7200 — stepping up to DDR5-8000 incurs a significant cost for only about 1% more performance.Overall, the new 200S Boost feature doesn't alter the competitive landscape, but it does provide an easy-to-use option for less-advanced users to gain a few extra percentage points of performance. The addition of warranty coverage for damage associated with the limited XMP memory or fabric overclocking is nice, but moderate memory overclocking is typically fairly safe in either case.Intel is expected to officially announce the 200S Boost feature tomorrow, we'll follow up with further details as warranted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Companies are quietly raising prices and consumers have already taken notice. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. We knew it was only a matter of time before prices started creeping up in more obvious ways. Today, we're looking at evidence of price increases related to several Logitech products in particular. This applies to a handful of Logitech's flagship products. That said, when researching these price increases, it looks like some of them have been discounted over at Amazon, but the price they have been marked down from is definitely higher than the usual rate. It's also important to note that this isn't a blanket price increase. Similar hikes have been reported from Chinese company Anker. And whether or not the changes are directly due to tariffs or companies capitalizing on demand ahead of currently paused tariffs, these two companies are almost certainly not alone in their price increases.The best way to investigate price changes is to check price archiving tools like PC Part Picker or Camel Camel Camel for products listed over at Amazon. These are some of our favorite tools to use when researching deals and tracking price changes. The MX Master 3S mouse has risen 20%, going from $100 to $120. It's been selling for around $28 lately, but now has jumped up to $35. This is only an increase of $7, but percentage-wise, it's among the most significant increases. Again, since the release of Dougherty's video, Logitech has listed a few of these items on sale, but the new price floor for them is consistently higher across multiple vendors. It's unclear whether more of Logitech's hardware is destined to join the wave of increases, but it is very likely given the ongoing tariff situation.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 is just a driver update (or two) away from greatness. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. When it comes to the best gaming laptops, there's been a heavy focus on systems featuring Nvidia's GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for the past two years. Enter the ROG Strix Scar 16, a 16-inch class gaming laptop featuring an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of RAM, and an RTX 5080 GPU. While the RTX 5080 isn't the top entry in Nvidia's laptop GPU family, as you'll see, it still packs a punch. However, you will pay a significant price premium ($3,299 as reviewed) to enjoy the latest that Nvidia has to offer. Asus's ROG family of products is often infused with rather outlandish design touches that help them stand out from the crowded field of gaming laptops, and the ROG Strix Scar 16 is no exception. But that's not the only illumination on the aluminum lid – Asus also has included a diagonal strip of white LEDs that dance around with a scrolling effect when the laptop is in standby mode. Asus calls it AniMe Vision, which features an array of 810 LED lights that shine through the milled holes in the lid. When the laptop is turned on, flashes of light display “STRIX” branding by default. There are several premade animations you can select from, or you can import a GIF of your own to customize your laptop further. The ROG Strix Scar 16's lighting can be configured using Aura Sync in Armory Crate. The top bezel is thicker to accommodate the 1080p webcam and infrared sensors for Windows Hello that are front and center. The bottom bezel is larger still, roughly twice as wide as the top bezel, and incorporates ROG STRIX branding. Although I would have preferred an aluminum unibody at this price point, the plastic at least feels high quality. A massive touchpad sits below the keyboard and features Asus' virtual NumberPad feature. After pressing NUMLK on the top right-hand corner of the touchpad, it lights up with a full number pad that you can use to make quick entries in apps like Calculator or Microsoft Excel. It works well enough, and I find it a suitable alternative to including a full physical number pad on the keyboard, especially if it's a feature you won't use frequently. The ROG Strix Scar 16 is a big laptop, and Asus thankfully puts the space to use by incorporating a large assortment of ports for connectivity. You'll find just two USB 3.2 Type-A ports on the right side. However, the bulk of the connections are on the left side, which is home to a proprietary power connector, a full-size 2.5 GbE LAN port, an HDMI 2.1 port, another USB 3.2 Type-A port, two Thunderbolt 5 ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Regarding wireless connectivity, the ROG Strix Scar 16 has an Intel BE200 card, which combines Wi-Fi 7 with Bluetooth 5.4. Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 (16GB GDDR7, 1,500 MHz Boost Clock, 175 W Max TGP) 2x Thunderbolt 5, 3x USB 3.2 Type-A Gen 2, 1x HDMI 2.1, 3.5mm headphone jack, 2.5 Gbps Ethernet The ROG Strix Scar 16 features high-end hardware, including an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, a GeForce RTX 5080 laptop GPU, and 32GB of DDR5-5600 memory. I had time to play various games on the ROG Strix Scar 16, but I spent most of my time running and gunning in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The game is a visual masterpiece with its lush environment, high-quality textures, realistic reflections, and intricate detail of real-world objects. With the resolution set to 1440p and the detail setting cranked to “Ultra,” I averaged between 70 and 100 fps in the game, depending on how much action took place on-screen. The ROG Strix Scar 16 started strong in our Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest setting) benchmark, delivering 177 fps at 1080p. Performance at 1600p fell sharply to just 112 fps. The Aorus Master 16 (Core Ultra 9 275HX, RTX 5080) took the crown at 1080p (185 fps), and scored slightly more than Asus at 1600p (114 fps). However, we do have a showdown between the systems with Blackwell GPUs. The Blade 16 performed more in line with the x16 at 1080p (each hitting 97 fps), while its 94 fps at 1600p was enough to earn second place. Red Dead Redemption 2 (Medium settings) proved to be a challenge for the ROG Strix Scar 16, and is a testament to the early driver issues that have plagued Nvidia's RTX 50 Series laptops GPUs (as we noted in our Blade 16 review). The Aorus Master 16 fared even worse, managing just 54 fps at 1600p. The Aorus Master 16 won the Borderlands 3 (Badass settings) benchmark showdown by default — our Blade 16 couldn't even run the benchmark, achieving a heady 172 fps at 1080p and 121 fps at 1600p. We use Metro Exodus for our stress testing, running the in-game benchmark 10 consecutive times using the RTX preset. During the test, the ROG Strix Scar 16's efficiency and performance cores averaged 3.11 GHz and 4.61 GHz, respectively, with a CPU temperature of 74 degrees Celsius. The RTX 5080 averaged 1.845 GHz with a core temperature of 72 degrees C. Thanks to its use of a Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of DDR5-5600, and a fast Western Digital SN8000S PCIe 4.0 SSD, the ROG Strix Scar 16 proved to be a top performer in our productivity suite. This put it slightly ahead of the Aorus Master 16 with the same processor, which came in at 3,049 and 19,175, respectively. Switching gears to our file transfer test, which involves copying 25GB of mixed-media files, the ROG Strix Scar 16 delivered a speedy 1,841.40 MBps. The Aorus Master 16 was dead last at 665.26 MBps. We use our Handbrake benchmark to transcode a 4K video file to 1080p, with the Aorus Master 16 and ROG Strix Scar 16 handily besting the competition — it wasn't even close. Given its gaming aspirations, the panel refreshes at up to 240 Hz, which makes it a great dance partner for the RTX 5080. The Mini LED backlighting allowed the laptop to stand far above its peers in brightness, as we saw 457.2 nits with SDR content. I played several games on the display, including Forza Horizon 5, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Action was smooth and tear-free, with vibrant colors all around. Asus outfitted the ROG Strix Scar 16 with a full-size keyboard, offering 2mm of key travel. Four media keys are tacked on to the right side of the keyboard: Play, Pause, Previous Track, and Next Track. There are also five programmable “M” keys at the top of the keyboard deck that correspond with volume up/down, microphone off, power mode (which cycles through Silent, Performance, and Turbo), and a shortcut for Armoury Crate. The function of each button can be configured using Armoury Crate. It's not my best performance with a laptop keyboard, as my fingers had to stretch a bit more than I'm used to, which slowed me down a bit. You'll find a rather large glass trackpad below the keyboard, which I found to operate smoothly, with a satisfying click response. As previously mentioned, the touchpad includes Asus' nifty NumberPad feature, which instantly displays a touch-enabled number pad when you tap the NUMLK. I found the audio quite good, with loud and clear volume (I didn't go past 80 percent to save my hearing) and adequate bass. I played some tunes with the laptop, including “Something in My Heart” by Röyksopp. I still prefer to opt for one of the best gaming headsets when listening to music or gaming, but you won't be disappointed by the audio system in the ROG Strix Scar 16. I started poking around at the rubber feet to see if those needed to be removed, but they wouldn't budge. This red indicator signified that the bottom panel was unlatched. It's a simple system, and I'm surprised that more manufacturers haven't integrated something similar. Unlike more compact ultraportables that have RAM soldered onto the motherboard, the ROG Strix Scar 16 has two SO-DIMM slots — our review unit had both slots occupied with 16GB DDR5-5600 SO-DIMMs. In addition, two M.2 slots accommodate full-length 2280 SSDs (only one was populated on our review unit). Even better, the ROG Strix Scar 16 supports the PCIe 5.0 interface, although our review unit was equipped with a Western Digital SN8000S 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD. The ROG Strix Scar 16 uses a 90 Whr battery. To see how long the laptop can operate on a charge, we ran it through our usual endurance benchmark — our test browses the web, streams videos, and runs light OpenGL tests with the brightness set to 150 nits. That put it in second place behind the Blade 16, which lasted 7 hours and 21 minutes. The ROG Strix Scar 16 does an excellent job of exhausting heat generated by its top-shelf hardware components with its twin internal fans. Like most new laptops arriving on the market these days, Asus has outfitted the ROG Strix Scar 16 with a 1080p webcam. Given the $3,300 price tag, it would have been nice to have seen some more impressive hardware – video and images came out slightly grainy, although overall colors and skin tones were accurate. The camera is more than adequate for videoconferencing, but I'd look for a third-party setup if you're into game streaming. Armoury Crate is an all-in-one software utility for controlling performance profiles to adjust RGB effects for the chassis and keyboard (with Aura Sync). AniMe Vision allows you to upload your own GIFs to customize the LED display on the lid. Other apps preinstalled include MyAsus, which allows you to register your device, perform system upgrades, and run hardware diagnostics. The most annoying preinstalled app, however, is McAfee. The app continually bombards you with pop-ups and warns that your trial period will soon end. The ROG Strix Scar 16 comes with a one-year warranty from Asus. The ROG Strix Scar 16 is available in two configurations from Asus, with our review unit being the cheapest offering. The system features an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB DDR5 memory, 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, RTX 5080, and a 16-inch 2560 x 1600 Mini LED 240Hz display. As configured, this system costs a staggering $3,299.99. Both systems are only available directly from the Asus online store. While overall performance was strong, lingering driver issues still prevent consistent playback with some popular video games. However, if you're spending over $3,000 on a new gaming laptop, you don't want any barriers to entry in whatever game may be in your library. Brandon Hill is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware.

A perfect storm of newly imposed tariffs is quickly driving costs upward as tariffs on Chinese-made goods, which include popular 3D printers from Bambu Lab, Creality, Elegoo, and Anycubic, have hit a record high of 145%.Bambu Lab's newest printer, the H2D, was launched on March 25 with a starting price tag of $1,899 for the two-color, non-laser unit. This is $500 to $900 more than its intended price — a 20% increase. Tracking the rising cost of 3D printers is a difficult task. Some Chinese manufacturers have not raised their prices, but their goods are also not in stock, making availability another issue 3D printer hobbyists and business owners are dealing with. But it is also listed as a “pre-order” that will only become available in late July. The Creality K2 Plus Combo, which we reviewed in January, is still holding its original price tag of $1,499, and is listed as shipping from a U.S. warehouse. Tariffs are only applied to items at the time of shipping. While no one wanted to be named, several company representatives at this year's Rapid + TCT event told me they had rushed shipments to U.S. warehouses before the tariffs took effect and are hoping to hold prices down for as long as possible.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I can't believe they did it. Even before season one of The Last of Us was released, anyone who had played both Last of Us video games looked at a singular event in the second game as a major TV question mark. Surely, it would be changed in some manner because there was simply no way. Well, Sunday's second episode of The Last of Us season two not only had that moment in it, it had it happen at the same time as the game, which is almost as shocking as the moment itself. Yes, we're sorry to inform you, but that actually happened. You thought you were watching a Pedro Pascal show and now Pedro Pascal's character is dead. It's an event that's going to set the stage for everything that follows this season and next. Joel's death came at the end of an already incredible episode featuring the biggest and scariest action scenes to date in The Last of Us. You don't want to forget all that simply because of the ending. So let's get back to Joel in a bit. She's in a hospital, terrified, when she sees herself and tells the other her not to go into the room. She and her team found a cabin outside of Jackson and now, in the daylight, notice just how big it is. They realize that infiltrating the city, as well as finding Joel, will be all but impossible. Down in Jackson, Jesse wakes up Ellie to go on patrol and razzes her about kissing his ex the night before. It's a tense morning because someone discovered that the infected have a new trick where they put a handful of bodies on top of the snow, hiding dozens below it. That means the whole town is on alert and Tommy holds a meeting to go over their elaborate emergency plans. It's a good piece of story and a nice bit of exposition because, well, they're going to need it. After all but ignoring an apology from Seth, the homophobic commenter from the party, Ellie says she wants to go out on patrol with Joel. This is odd because last we saw them, they weren't talking. Now though, she implies they've buried the hatchet and are sick of everyone prying into their business. Unfortunately, Jesse says Joel has already left with Dina. And so it's Jesse and Ellie heading out together as the people of Jackson make preparations for the worst. There's also a huge storm cloud on the horizon too but Jesse says he's not worried about it. That changes quickly, though, and Jackson calls everyone out on patrol back to the city. There, we learn more about Gail's husband Eugene, who Joel killed, and he seems like he was a pretty cool guy. She goes down to investigate but slips and falls down the side of a mountain. She winds up in a field exactly like the one Jesse described earlier, except much, much bigger. Jesse said seven bodies were hiding another 30. Here, there are probably 70 bodies on the surface so, yeah. Abby isn't aware of this though so is terrified when the ground starts to collapse and infected start to pour out. But the race is on and even though Abby is clearly a villain at this point on the show, we find ourselves cheering for her to get away. This whole chase is wildly entertaining and intense as Abby narrowly avoids capture a few times, before eventually finding herself stuck between a building and a chain-link fence littered with infected. She's about to be eaten, crushed, or both when someone comes out of nowhere and saves her. Here's a good moment to say: really? What are the odds of this happening? Jackson has so many citizens and for Abby to be out in the surrounding area and just so happen to run into the one person she has traveled across the country for feels way too easy. Or, if you look at it another way, maybe this was karma finally coming for Joel. Joel saves Abby, and as they and Dina try to figure out a place to go, Abby suggests the nearby cabin where her friends are. Eventually, another horde joins the chase and things look bleak. But that's when things cut to Jackson and people working on the pipes. This is also about when Tommy realizes Joel and Dina haven't radioed back in so Jesse and Ellie, who have been in Eugene's 7-11, decide to set off into the storm like Han Solo on Hoth, desperate to find their friends at whatever the cost. It's time to take emergency measures as everything bad that could happen all happens at exactly the same time. What follows is, without a doubt, the biggest action scene in The Last of Us history. (Which, we admit, isn't a long history, but this is still a huge step above everything else.) Thousands of infected hammer on the walls of Jackson as people shoot them, drop barrels of gasoline that become bombs, and just try to survive. I'm not going to get into every detail, but it's an incredible scene, especially Tommy's fight with the Bloater when he unleashes an entire flame thrower on it. On a normal show, you wouldn't be able to top a scene like that. But, on The Last of Us, as epic as the invasion scene is, it's about to be eclipsed by what happens once Joel and Dina got back to Abby's cabin. Her friends take her and the strangers in and everything is nice… until Abby reveals the man's name is Joel. The switch goes from “kind” to “evil,” and the group starts to carry out a plan they have clearly been talking about for years. They put Dina to sleep and Abby starts in. She's given this speech a million times in her head and it shows. It gets taken up a notch when she shoots him in the leg and has him wrapped in a tourniquet. She doesn't want him to bleed too much. As she goes on, Joel slowly starts to realize there's no way out of this. She beats him with a golf club, just like in the game. Yes, Joel saved Ellie, but at what cost? Millions more if they made a cure? Since he's the star of the show, we're supposed to feel sympathy for him, but step back and think about the other point of view for a minute. It's a classic Last of Us moral dilemma. Inside, she quickly realizes what's happening and tries to intervene. She gets a slash or two in before she's restrained and forced to look at the bloody mess on the floor she knows is Joel. She screams at him to get up but he can't. Then, Abby takes the golf club that she snapped in two after beating him so badly and stabs him in the neck. Ellie vows she's going to kill everyone there but they leave her alive anyway. Back in Jackson, the horde has been defeated, but the destruction and casualties are beyond measure. We see the people of Jackson start to regroup. If you didn't play the game, you probably still don't believe that it actually happened. What does that mean for Ellie, the people of Jackson, Abby, and others?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta is using AI technology to search for kids who are lying about their age on Instagram in order to bypass safeguards, the company announced on Monday. Teen Accounts, which launched on Instagram last year, enroll young users into an app experience with built-in protections. Instagram has been using AI to determine age for quite some time, but now the social network confirms it's using the technology to ensure that teens are accessing Instagram via a Teen Account rather than an adult one. The company told TechCrunch last year that it had planned to do this, and noted that some of the ways it would find accounts that belong to teens who entered a fake adult birthday is by detecting happy birthday posts and receiving reports from other users. Instagram also announced that it's going to begin sending notifications to parents that include information about how they can discuss the importance of providing the correct age online with their teens. Today's announcement comes two weeks after Meta introduced Teen Accounts to Facebook and Messenger. Prior to joining the publication in 2021, she was a telecom reporter at MobileSyrup.

We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. We're kind of in a no-mans-zone for big deals days. We're well past the winter holiday season and still have over a month before Memorial Day comes up. The good news is that even those these sales events are well off in the distance, you can still find some great deals and discounts on consumer tech if you look hard enough. This hefty discount brings the price down by 32% to a measly $130—saving you $60. For gamers, you won't be getting ridiculously high detail and frame rates, but what you are getting is a size-able display that does its job for just over $100. It does have AMD FreeSync which can allows for smooth and consistent frame rates at least. For non-gamers, this is a great option for someone who deals in spreadsheets that just needs a larger screen than they're laptop has so they can view more at once—or someone who likes to have multiple windows in view at once. The bezel is nice and thin, so you can experience a near-borderless display. You'll be looking at more picture and less plastic while hanging out on the computer. As far as ports, on the back you'll find the AC power along with a DisplayPort and two HDMI ports so you can have multiple devices hooked up at once and switch between inputs with ease.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Panasonic-owned hi-fi brand Technics scored a surprise hit with 2023's fantastic EAH-AZ80 wireless earbuds (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The premium pair quickly became a top pick for me, thanks to their stylish looks, great fit and features, and stellar sound quality. It's always tough to follow a chart topper, but the AZ100 successfully succeed their predecessor in most ways that count, led by richer and more vivid sound from their new magnetic ferro-fluid drivers and revamped acoustic housings. They also bring advanced features like support for Spatial Audio and Bluetooth LE Audio, and stealthier yet still suitably flashy style. The new fit, while more compact, feels less ergonomic to my ears, and I wish Technics had stepped up the noise canceling more to close in on leaders like Bose's QuietComfort Ultra. Those points aside, the AZ100 are another Technics hit thanks to premium digs and sound quality that stands tall among the very best wireless earbuds you can buy. The signature sparkling accents that recall Technics turntables return, now with even more metallic floss around the rims and smaller, less obtrusive endcaps. At 6 grams per side, they've lost a gram of heft, but their new shape doesn't slip into my ears with the driving-glove fit of the AZ80, tending to wear a bit more over time. There are also fewer ear tips to try (five compared to seven), but the Technics app assisted me in finding a stable and relatively comfy fit. That's more than you'll get from buds like Bose's QC Ultra or Apple's AirPods Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends), and it's a noticeable upgrade over the older pair. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Technics is no slouch in the feature department, and the latest pair offers just about every modern feature you could want. You'll find all the basics like auto-pause sensors, a multiband EQ, Google Fast Pair, and an Earbuds Finder, with customization available in the Technics app. In fact, virtually everything is customizable for an almost dizzying array of options. If there's something you don't like, from how the buds relay video sync to how your voice sounds on calls, there's likely an adjustment available. Multitaskers will be pleased to see the return of three-device multipoint pairing, letting you easily swap between your computer, tablet, and phone over Bluetooth, with no brand loyalty required. The AZ100's touch controls are responsive, customizable, and comprehensive, with default options for playback, calling, volume, and ambient audio at the ready. The layout is a tad confusing at first, but I appreciate the ability to accomplish just about any task without grabbing your phone. Like most hi-fi buds, they provide a slow and steady revelation of their skills. When I first fired them up, I was surprised by the sound signature's warm and almost thick flavor, seeming more reliant on the bass and lower mids than expected. That said, I generally prefer a smoother touch in my hi-fi over sharp and zingy, and it didn't take long to find that the AZ100's warm entrance acts almost like a velvet backdrop on which instrumental textures and effects glitter like jewels in the light. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Not everything steps up to a revelatory level, but well-recorded tracks are elevated. One example is St. Vincent's Digital Witness, which sounded almost like an alternative mix with the AZ100. The AZ100's new drivers deliver on their promise of cutting distortion, which leaves instruments brilliantly separated and fully exposed. Little moments like an extra breath or the click before a guitar strum surface effortlessly. All instruments sound great, but percussion is particularly lovely, arriving in sandpaper pulses and loads of colors that sneak out from little pockets along the height and width of each mix. Only Sennheiser's Momentum 4 TW (7/10, WIRED Recommends) keep up for the money. After nearly two years between releases, a weightier upgrade would have been nice, but even middle-rung in this competitive segment is enough to fulfill most needs. In my AZ80 review, I called their noise canceling powerful enough to have folks sneaking up on you with light music playing, and the AZ100's Adaptive ANC is a skosh better. It satisfyingly silences HVAC hums and other annoyances in your home or office and quickly quells outdoor interruptions like construction work or landscaping. In A/B testing in my acoustically treated studio with airplane drone effects, the AZ100 fared well against premium contenders like Sony's WF-1000XM5 (7/10, WIRED Recommends), though like the Momentum 4, they're less effective in higher frequencies like keystrokes and voices. The Momentum held an edge over the Technics for lower frequencies, while Beats' new Powerbeats Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) did better with voices and keystrokes. All these models are obliterated by Bose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra, so if you have to have the best, it's an easy choice. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Exterior sounds are slightly muddled and some higher frequencies are over-accentuated, but it's enough to keep you aware of your surroundings and carry on a conversation with soft music playing. I was pleased to find advanced transparency features like wind buffering and a limiter to suppress sudden loud noises like Apple's and Bose's flagship pairs. For those who put sound quality first, Technics' AZ100 have few rivals in their class, with the sale-priced AZ80 perhaps the most enticing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An early February 2024 game between English Premier League contenders Liverpool and Arsenal was set to be a vital clash that would help determine the eventual league champion. Liverpool held a narrow lead in the league, but an Arsenal victory would draw them within just two points of overtaking their rivals in the standings. He was jealous, naturally, and also probably a bit confused at why a limited soccer fan like myself would be flying thousands of miles from my home in the western US all the way to the UK to watch a match between two clubs I have no connection to. I was just 20 minutes from my home in Salt Lake City at the Cosm Experience Center, a facility on the University of Utah campus with a 65-foot, 8K screen. My silly little trick isn't remotely novel, whether at this smaller SLC venue or one of Cosm's two larger locations in Los Angeles and Dallas, where the company showcases its “shared reality” immersive experiences. Cosm represents a growing trend in live sports experiences. I recently went back to the SLC facility for another demo. What I saw was a window into an immersive future—in sports, entertainment, and education—which can be accessed through any screen, from a towering Cosm dome to the phone in your pocket. Cosm's history is fascinating, and it touches on the earliest days of immersive projection systems. Cosm proved its abilities in the immersive space through streaming feeds for VR coverage of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games and the 2022 FIFA World Cup, then opened its first official venues with large screens in LA and Dallas in 2024. Those venues hold around 1,400 people, according to Cosm; the SLC venue I visited is much smaller, but has a similar setup. A lobby with huge LED screens welcomes visitors; classic stadium concessions are readily available, including seat-side delivery; like a real arena, seating is split into multiple levels. Once I got inside, in front of me was that massive 8K screen—other Cosm venues use screens with even higher resolutions, including up to 12K—that took up my entire field of view and then some, wrapping around the sides of the venue and up over my head. The picture quality was insane; Cosm tells me its venues are the first true “black domes” in the industry, a design which minimizes issues like cross-reflection (an effect where light bounces off a display's surface in unpredictable ways, causing diminished clarity and brightness) and allows for incredibly rich visuals. “The system contrast is 10 times that of what you can achieve with any projector,” Cosm chief operations officer Kirk Johnson tells me. For sound, Cosm uses an array of speakers—16 speakers plus four subwoofers at the SLC facility; 38 speakers and 15 subwoofers at the LA and Dallas locations—affixed at various points directly behind the LED displays, which are permeable to allow sound through them. This allows Cosm to make noises and effects sound like they're coming from any part of the room, even seemingly behind me. During hockey games, Cosm's camera angles can virtually put you right on the ice. Cosm can put you courtside for NBA games, both at center court and on either baseline. The NHL program feels a touch more immersive than that, even, particularly a corner view that's technically from outside the glass, but truly makes you feel like you're standing on the rink itself. “We had a few fights where there was blood on the lenses,” Cosm president and CEO Jeb Terry tells me. There are other views for UFC events as well, including octagon-side. Between bouts, it pans back to a wide shot in the stands. “I feel like I have a seat in the crowd,” says Alon Cohen, UFC senior VP of research and development, of what it's like to watch a match at a Cosm venue. They do such different things, even if both are enabled by incredible visual technology. “We both believe in an amazing human experience powered by technology, something that will wow you,” Terry says. The non-sports experiences I sat through were just as impressive, including beautiful views of a performance of Cirque du Soleil's “O” stage show. First, Cosm brought me inside a true-life rendering of the Sistine Chapel. An engineer floated around the chapel using nothing but an Xbox controller; it felt like I was inside a drone flying around the room. Cosm then showed me a bird's-eye rendering of the building we were sitting in and its surroundings; think Google Maps, but on steroids. All of this is brought to life on Cosm's giant screen using a software platform called Digistar. It was originally developed to power computer graphics projections for planetariums in the 1980s and has evolved into a fully modern digital animation platform. The system engineers tell me the Digistar software accurately maps every piece of space debris over one meter in size, including billions of stars and data points. Cosm folks tell me kids love this exercise of flying around the universe; it left my head spinning a bit. When a UFC fight ends in a knockout, everyone jumps out of their seat like they would if they were actually there. Even as it has expanded into sports and other forms of entertainment, Cosm has maintained a strong foothold in planetariums and similar educational venues. Europe's first ever LED dome, the Prague Planetarium, integrates Cosm's CX System backend technology. Among its most recent ventures was at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, where in December 2024 Cosm helped convert the Texas museum's decommissioned Omni IMAX theater into a 360-degree immersive dome, complete with 12,000 LED panels. This dome hosts all sorts of content, from Cosm-produced films to various educational programs for all ages; that same zoom-out-to-the-entire-universe feature I saw at my demo is a regular part of programming, for instance. “It doesn't just function as a regular screen. It can sort of be anything and do anything,” says Nikki Diller, VP of collections, interpretations, and programs for the museum. The museum and various other Cosm partners have tried a number of approaches, from live orchestra performances to trivia and karaoke. Cosm has also positioned itself as a central hub in the growing immersive entertainment space, one that some refer to broadly as “180 video”—a bit of a misnomer, as many of Cosm's programs take up much more than 180 degrees in the field of view. Cosm can easily port its experiences over to VR, for instance. It can also provide ready-made content for smartphone-based “immersive” experiences where users move their devices around to engage with a 3D space. Fans take in an immersive basketball game at a Cosm venue. Many of the NBA's courtside VR game experiences, which place viewers right at court level with viewpoints on both baselines and at the center-court scorer's table, are produced by Cosm. On the combat side, the company is involved with VR and phone-based experiences efforts for both UFC and WWE alike. Those who have worked with Cosm tend to be extremely optimistic about the company's potential. “That's at least how many Cosms there ought to be. These things have a much smaller footprint, they fit in more places.
