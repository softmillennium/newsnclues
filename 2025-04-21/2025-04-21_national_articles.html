                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? If you wrote a novel in which the first Latin American pope died on Easter Monday — which happened to fall on April 21, the traditional anniversary of the founding of the city of Rome — it would be rejected by any decent editor. The apostolic throne of St. Peter is now empty. Shortly after the nine-day period, after funeral rites for the recently deceased pope have been concluded, the Catholic Church's leading cardinals will meet privately to elect a new pope in a conclave. As frustration grew, it was decided to lock the cardinals away, providing them with only bread and water until they came to a decision. Even though the conclave has not begun, in our anxious times many are already starting to consider who might be the next Bishop of Rome. This divide is not unique to the Catholic Church and can now be seen in nearly every religious tradition. But while this conflict will likely dominate the conclave and coverage of it, there are also other factors at play. In trying to forecast the next papacy, it is also crucial to focus on the question of national — or more accurately, regional — origin. Christianity is on the decline in North America and western Europe, even if that decline seems to have slowed in the United States, at least recently. But in Latin America, Asia, and Africa (a region some call the “Global South,” though the term hits a colonialist note), Christianity is growing, both because of higher birth rates and conversions. African Christianity, in particular, has experienced tremendous growth, with data suggesting that by 2050, 40 percent of the world's Christians will live in Africa. No African or Asian leader has been elected head of a major global Christian denomination since Late Antiquity. And though Pope Francis was indeed the first pope from Latin America, as the son of Italian immigrants to Argentina, he came firmly within the cultural framework and historical trajectory of southern European Catholicism. It is difficult to see him entirely as a “Pope from the Global South.” One might assume that progressives within the Catholic Church would be championing the rise of leaders from outside Europe. Yet an uncomfortable truth for many of these progressives is that the Global South, and particularly Africa, has become a significant power center for traditionalists in the fierce cultural debates that have rocked Christianity over the past four decades. This has been true not just for Catholics, but Anglicans, Methodists, and others. Of course, it is important to note that millions of dollars have been spent pushing a conservative social agenda in Africa and that African Christians are far from a monolith. But in broad demographic terms, a betting progressive Catholic would likely prefer a European pope over an African one. There are only a few realistic African contenders at the moment, both deeply traditionalist. There is Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, 76. Brought to the Vatican by Pope Francis's conservative predecessor, Turkson is best known outside of Vatican circles for his anti-gay attitudes, including endorsing Ghana's draconian anti-homosexuality law. He is joined by Cardinal Robert Sarah, 79, from Guinea, who once positioned himself as a “parallel authority” to Pope Francis. He has defended clerical celibacy, denounced “gender ideology,” and argued that there can be “no theological dialogue” with Islam. There is Cardinal José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça from Portugal. His relatively liberal views on same-sex relationships as well as his sympathies with a pro-choice Benedictine nun who favors women's ordination put him firmly in the progressive camp. Largely in the theological and pastoral image of Pope Francis, Zuppi would in some ways be the most “Eurocentric” choice, having spent time as the Vatican's peace envoy to Ukraine and Russia and seen as largely focused on the European church. Given the demographic realities facing the Catholic Church, a progressive European cardinal seems highly unlikely, even though a progressive, at least on issues of gender and sexuality, is likely needed to stem the bleeding in Europe in particular. Even a traditionalist European cardinal, of which there are many, might be seen as out of step with where Catholicism is headed. All this puts the coming conclave in a seemingly impossible situation. The man who might offer a way around this impasse comes from the traditionally Catholic, Asian country of the Philippines, a progressive candidate from outside Europe (and this time with no European immigrant parents): Cardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle. Cardinal Tagle has been dubbed the “Asian Francis” in some circles because of his commitment to social justice. (It is possible, even likely, that the three African-born popes of Late Antiquity were Black.) His election would pacify Western progressives, who have proven all too ready to jump ship should the church maintain too conservative of a position on key social issues, while offering the Global South — and the new Christian majority — a leader who looks and has lived more like his flock. It seems a clear way forward for a church increasingly divided not just along ideological lines, but geographic ones as well. And, for what it's worth, Tagle currently leads the Vegas betting odds — as good an indication as any about who will step out onto the balcony in St. Peter's Square after the white smoke rises. Whoever appears before the crowd that day will be a compromise, a man who in his life and theology must satisfy, to some degree, the varying factions of a changing Catholic Church that is increasingly divided by geography and politics — a reflection of the wider world. The Oklahoma charter school case is one of two April cases seeking to remake schools in the religious right's image. Although there are unanswered questions about how far the Court will go. Catholic Charities v. Wisconsin risks giving employers a sweeping new power to ignore laws protecting their workers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration plans to take action to remove artificial food dyes from the nation's food supply, according to a media advisory sent by the US Department of Health and Human Services on Monday. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary will share more about the administration's plans on Tuesday, the advisory said. Related article Over half of US states are trying to eliminate food dyes. In January, when former President Joe Biden was still in office, the FDA announced that it had banned the use of red dye No. The move came more than 30 years after scientists discovered links to cancer in animals. The Trump administration appears poised to take action on a broader set of petroleum-based synthetic dyes that are used to make food and beverages brightly colored and more appealing to consumers. In March, Kennedy joined West Virginia Gov. The state was the first to institute a sweeping ban on synthetic food dyes, which have been tied to issues with learning and behavior in some children and of which Kennedy has been an outspoken critic. Lawmakers in more than half of states – both Republican- and Democrat-led – are pushing to restrict access, according to a tracker by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental health organization, reflecting a bipartisan push toward a safer food system. Artificial food dyes are not explicitly mentioned in president's order forming the commission to “Make America Healthy Again,” but some Republican legislators have invoked Kennedy's “MAHA” motto in their proposals. The National Confectioners Association said in March that there is a role for state legislators to play in the US food system, but that the FDA is the “rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety.” Some of the association's member companies sell products containing artificial dyes. Here's what studies show about more common dyes “Food safety is the number one priority for U.S. confectionery companies, and we will continue to follow and comply with FDA's guidance and safety standards,” the association added via email. John Hewitt, senior vice president of state affairs at the Consumer Brands Association, echoed this sentiment earlier this year, saying it's why the trade association has urged the FDA to “aggressively acknowledge its responsibility as the nation's food safety regulator.” Governments, researchers and nonprofit organizations have long raised concerns about artificial dyes. 3 all have been linked with cancer or tumors in animals. 6 contain or may be contaminated with known carcinogens. 6 may also be toxic to some human cells. 5 may cause irritability, restlessness and sleep disturbances for sensitive children. Related article Top NIH nutrition researcher studying ultraprocessed foods departs, citing censorship under Kennedy “It's been obvious from RFK Jr's statements that this was going to happen. Non-petroleum substitute dyes are available and used widely in other countries by the same companies that sell products here. Companies have been promising to get rid of the petroleum dyes for years. The time has come,” said Marion Nestle, a prominent food policy researcher. “In public health terms, this is low-hanging fruit. I want to see RFK Jr. take on ultra-processed foods, a much tougher problem and a far more important one.” Food dyes are most commonly used in foods of low nutritional value such as candy and soft drinks, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Consumers who want to avoid artificial dyes can check ingredient lists on food and beverage products. CNN's Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.</p>

Former Denver ICE field office director John Fabricatore discusses the arrests of Tren de Aragua members and other criminals on 'The Story.' A New Mexico judge resigned from the bench after an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member was arrested at his home. Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano's resignation letter is dated March 3, but a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) told Fox News Digital it was not received by the Supreme Court and 3rd Judicial District Court until March 31. Back in January, Homeland Security Investigations Las Cruces began looking into Venezuelan native Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, "an illegal alien from Venezuela and a suspected member of a criminal gang" who was "residing with other illegal aliens" and "in possession of firearms," according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. On Feb. 28, two search warrants were executed at a home investigators identified as owned by Cano's wife, Nancy Cano. April Cano is the daughter of Nancy and Joel, court documents state. Alleged Tren de Aragua gang member Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, pictured in a social media account found by investigators. Ortega-Lopez was found by investigators posing with weapons in social media posts, some of which he said were owned by April Cano, who "allowed him to hold and sometimes shoot various firearms." A look at the Doña Ana County Magistrate Court in Las Cruces, New Mexico. "He continued to do a few jobs for Nancy Cano, and after being evicted from the apartment in April, 2024, Nancy Cano offered her ‘casita' in the back of the residence she shared with her husband Joel Cano," court documents state. The suspect made his first appearance in a Las Cruces court on March 3. During a detention hearing on March 14, U.S. Magistrate Judge Damian L. Martinez "asked Assistant United States Attorney ('AUSA') Maria Armijo if she knew Judge Cano." When Armijo said she did not, Judge Martinez said he had met him outside the courtroom "several times," adding, "I don't think he would just let anybody live in his property." Martinez ruled Ortega-Lopez "was not a flight risk or danger to the community" and ordered him to be released. On April 8, a motion was filed by an assistant U.S. attorney to reconsider Ortega-Lopez's pretrial release order. Records from Doña Ana County Assessor's Office say the home Ortega-Lopez was arrested at is owned by both Nancy and Jose Cano, who goes by Joel. Cano's resignation letter stated his last day on the job was March 21. "All the best to everyone of you," Joel Cano wrote. Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano resigned in March, according to his resignation letter obtained by Fox News Digital. The AOC spokesman told Fox News Digital via email that Democratic Gov. "The Supreme Court has scheduled an oral argument on April 24, which is public and will be live streamed, concerning Judge Cano," spokesman Barry Massey said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thursday stood out as her last day of class before graduation but by noon, the Florida State University senior had to grapple with the chilling reality of a gunman opening fire on the sprawling campus. Bannister had been practicing active shooter drills since she was in fourth grade and had heard the horror stories from her friends who experienced the 2018 Parkland high school massacre. So, when they heard the shots, she and her classmates from all different states knew exactly what to do as the school went on lockdown. It's so sad that everyone knew how to act,” Bannister told CNN. Students all over campus hid under desks, barricaded doors and texted loved ones as emergency sirens wailed in the background. Within four minutes after the first shot was fired, the suspected gunman, FSU student Phoenix Ikner, 20, was shot by police and taken into custody, authorities said. Two men working   near the student union were killed and five   others were wounded in the shooting. Another person was injured while trying to run away, police said. The hospital declined to say whether Ikner was one of their patients. University officials, along with law enforcement and school safety preparedness experts credit the rapid response from police and timely messages through the school's emergency alert system for preventing an even greater tragedy. Related article ‘It's all about what was known and when': Will the mother of FSU shooting suspect face charges? The student who was standing at the door said in response: “These doors don't lock,” she said. Any external person had access to that room,” Bannister said. “During a lockdown situation, like on April 17, doors in the HCB Building lock immediately as they are part of our electronic locking system that is centrally managed,” FSU spokesperson Amy Farnum-Patronis said in an email to CNN. “During normal operations, the doors in HCB are on card-swipe access, so the rooms remain locked at all times, unless there is a scheduled class,” she wrote. Before the university inspected the locks and clarified how they work, Walker and Bannister organized a petition signed by nearly 30,000 people calling for working locks on all classroom doors. Related article US School Violence Fast Facts “No one should have to be in a classroom feeling unprotected during what was the most terrifying moment of our lives. This is a basic safety measure that can no longer be overlooked,” the petition says. FSU students in support of the petition shared similar experiences in the comments, saying working locks would have made them feel safer. They recalled watching faculty members attempt to lock the doors “before giving up and shutting the lights off,” watching their teacher check the doors before informing them “they don't lock,” or using their body weight and chairs to hold the door closed. After learning the HCB building classrooms did lock from the outside, “all I can say is our friend that was in the bathroom that came back into our room to let us know about the situation before it hit all our phones was that she walked right in,” Walker wrote Monday in a text to CNN. “I haven't been contacted by any FSU faculty. None of our professor's were under that impression. The only way SWAT personally got into our room was our instructor opening the door for them,” Walker said. “Regardless we should have been briefed on this as a student body and i'm shocked, if this is the case, that we haven't been informed.” Brian Higgins, who teaches emergency preparedness and response at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and consults several colleges for active shooter response, said locks are “an integral part of an active shooter response plan.” Colleges and universities like FSU are more challenging to fully lock down due to the open nature of their campuses, compared to K-12 schools, which are typically more enclosed, according to Juliette Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst who works with schools on security planning. This can make them a soft target for such attacks, she said. At the same time, parents and families represent the outside stakeholders who have a key interest in emergency situations like an active shooter, she added. Another challenge is perimeter control because colleges and universities exist as open environments for classes, social activities and extracurriculars, Kayyem said. FSU's campus, for example, is roughly the size of 400 football fields. “The idea of ‘safe,' can't exist in this environment, so what you do is try to make these universities safer,” Kayyem said, like controlling access to buildings, strong lines of communication, security planning and lockdown training. The speedy police response to Thursday's shooting aligns with the commonly taught active shooter protocol established after the Columbine school shooting of 1999, when Colorado police waited roughly an hour after gunfire erupted in the school for SWAT teams to arrive, during which two young men killed 13 people. Ramsey said of the police response to the FSU shooting: “It was absolutely incredible how fast they got there … Within two minutes, they arrived on the scene and were able to neutralize the individual to keep him from causing even more harm.” In an active shooter response plan, security planning consultant Brian Higgins says, “there are no silver bullets,” as relying on a single protocol could lead to failure. FSU adopted a “Run, Hide, Fight” protocol similar to other schools in responding to an active shooter event, which involves a one-hour training class led by the campus police department's Crime Prevention Officers, according to its website. Related article These Parkland students experienced their second deadly school shooting in 7 years While no method is perfect, Kayyem said the quick dissemination of information through alert systems is vital for students to know where the biggest threat is coming from, so they know what actions to take. It includes the capacity to lock-in, she added. It never crossed their minds to check whether their classroom doors could lock, but now both Bannister and Walker say they will never again feel safe in a confined room without the protective measure. The two students commended Florida State University for its response to the tragedy, offering psychological services and deadline extensions. I'm so proud to be a Seminole. Walker agreed, saying she will always remember how her classmates banded together to stay strong and calm each other down. I'll never forget their faces,” Walker said through tears.

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? On Monday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that could lead health insurance plans to offer narrower coverage. The case, known as Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, challenges the authority of a group within the US Department of Health and Human Services tasked with requiring insurers to cover some forms of preventative care. This body, known as the US Preventive Services Task Force (PSTF), has exercised its authority to mandate coverage of a wide range of treatments — from cancer screenings, to drugs that prevent transmission of the HIV virus, to eye ointments that prevent infections that cause blindness in infants. The plaintiffs, represented by former Donald Trump lawyer Jonathan Mitchell, want the justices to strip the PSTF of this authority — thus permitting health plans to deny coverage for treatments they are currently required to pay for. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito came out swinging against the PSTF, and Justice Neil Gorsuch appeared likely to join them in attempting to sabotage Obamacare. But they were the only three justices who clearly telegraphed sympathy to Mitchell's arguments. Notably, Republican Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett both seemed inclined to vote against Mitchell, although their questions did leave some uncertainty about how they would ultimately rule in this case. All three of the Court's Democrats appeared all but certain to uphold the PSTF, so that means there may be at least five votes to preserve health insurers' obligations under Obamacare. This case turns on a somewhat arcane issue involving the government's hiring and firing practices. Members of the PSTF were appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, so they do not qualify as principal officers. So the question in this case is whether they are validly classified as inferior officers. As the Supreme Court said in Edmond v. United States (1997), “‘inferior officers' are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate.” The government's argument that PSTF members count as inferior officers is pretty straightforward. Every judge who has looked at this case so far has concluded that the health secretary may remove PSTF members at will. Mitchell, meanwhile, primarily relies on a provision of federal law which states that PSTF members “shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.” Task force members, he claims, cannot simultaneously be “independent” and also subject to secretarial supervision. But most of the justices appeared skeptical of Mitchell's reading of the word “independent.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out that she sometimes asks her law clerks for their “independent judgment” regarding a legal question she needs to decide, but that does not mean that she has to take the law clerk's recommendation, or that she can't fire the clerk. Significantly, Barrett — who repeatedly described Mitchell's interpretation of the word “independent” as “maximalist” — seemed persuaded by Sotomayor's argument. As Barrett said at one point during the argument, she sometimes asks her law clerks to provide recommendations that are “independent” of outside influence, but not “independent” of Barrett's own approach to how cases should be decided. Even more significantly, Barrett pointed to the doctrine of “constitutional avoidance,” which says that if there are multiple ways of construing a statute, courts should avoid reading it in ways that raise constitutional problems. Kavanaugh, meanwhile, asked some questions that suggest he might be sympathetic to Mitchell's approach; early in the argument, for example, he told Justice Department lawyer Hashim Mooppan that he thought the government's interpretation of the word “independent” was “odd.” But he seemed to shift gears once Mitchell took the podium. Indeed, the Supreme Court is currently considering a case that could eliminate Congress's ability to create such independent agencies. Again, Kavanaugh and Barrett did hedge enough in their questions that it is not entirely clear how they will vote in this case. And Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican who also sometimes breaks with the Court's right flank, was silent for most of the argument. So it is not at all clear where Roberts will come down in Kennedy v. Braidwood Management. Still, based on Monday's argument, it appears possible, perhaps even likely, that the PSTF will survive. Gorsuch, at one point, floated an alternative way of resolving this case. While every judge who has heard the case so far agreed that the secretary has the power to appoint and remove task force members, there's no statute which directly states that he can do so. And Barrett, at one point, also signaled that she is open to sending the case back down in a procedure known as a “remand.” So a remand does not necessarily mean that health insurers will gain the power to deny coverage for cancer screenings or anti-HIV medication. Again, given the course of Barrett and Kavanaugh's questioning, it's difficult to say with certainty how this case will end up. For the moment, however, one of two outcomes seem most likely: Either the Supreme Court holds off on deciding the PSTF's fate for now, or it votes to permanently rescue this body from Mitchell's attack. ﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.</p>

Tony Gilroy poses for a portrait to promote “Andor” on Tuesday, April 15, 2025, in Los Angeles. BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — “Andor” returns for its second season on Disney+ with a three-episode premiere Tuesday and the weight of the “Star Wars” galaxy seemingly on its shoulders. “We took no creative notes on this show,” Gilroy, whose deep screenwriting resume also includes four films in the “Bourne” franchise and 2007 Oscar nominee “Michael Clayton,” which he also directed. He told The Associated Press that “I've never had this much freedom before, even in final-cut films that I worked on. The forthcoming season, whose production was delayed by Hollywood's 2023 strikes, are coming with high expectations from fans who have been disappointed in other recent “Star Wars” TV offerings, with no new movies released in the franchise in six years. “This second season, it's about all the layers, and the social and political climate that needs to happen for a revolution to erupt, for a rebellion to exist,” Luna told the AP. Gilroy drew inspiration from a broad range of historical and fictional sources. “Who's ever going to get another chance to do another 1,500 pages on revolution again, with this much money and this much muscle, and everything else?” he said. He sells her on the ecstatic feelings of destiny rebellion can bring. “It's quite beautiful and idealistic also, like a revolution has to be, It's a great reminder of how romantic the idea of revolution is,” Luna said. Cast members say it can feel revolutionary working for Gilroy, who passes on the same freedom to them that Disney gives to him. “He doesn't believe in withholding information as power,” said Adria Arjona, who plays Andor's partner Bix Caleen. Her character's arc in particular brings real-world elements including addiction and even darker forms of trauma unlike anything “Star Wars” has shown before. Gilroy said he didn't have to fight over the galaxy's canon at all. “I've seen canon stretch so much,” he said. But a lot of things have changed since then.” Other elements, like the route Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) takes from respectable senator to leader of the rebellion, were not predetermined. Her early-season path includes a wedding ceremony full of rituals — and dances — new to “Star Wars” that Gilroy invented out of whole cloth. He said one of the pleasures of getting to make something so large and sprawling is that he has gotten to use nearly every writing thought he has had. “All I did for five years was just max out my imagination,” Gilroy said. Season 2 also sees the emergence of “Rogue One” characters for the first time in the TV series, including Andor's droid sidekick K-250, played by Alan Tudyk, and Death Star builder Orson Krennic, played by Ben Mendelsohn. Luna took special pleasure in the return of Tudyk and his robot who speaks with no filter. The three episodes dropping Tuesday gel to form what's basically a 2 1/2 hour movie, with Cassian stuck among rival rebel factions, Bix living in a farming community amid an imperial crackdown, and Mon Mothma having to play the patrician matriarch at her daughter's wedding, before all three are pulled in new directions. The entire series has been planned in those kinds of clusters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this July 31, 2019, file photo, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington. Trump called Powell “a major loser” and said that energy and grocery prices are “substantially lower” and “there is virtually No Inflation.” Yet Trump said the economy could slow without rate cuts. Gas prices have fallen for the past two months, in part because oil costs have dropped on fears of slower growth, but food prices jumped in January and March and overall inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. The stock market, which fell immediately at the opening bell Monday, tumbled further after Trump's post, with Dow dropping by more than 1,000 points and the broad S&P 500 stock index falling nearly 3% in mid-day trading. The Federal Reserve was established as an independent agency and most economists think central banks that are free of political interference do a better job at keeping inflation in check. Otherwise, it would be harder for the Fed to take unpopular steps to keep prices down, such as raising interest rates. The interest rate on 10-year Treasuries has been rising as Trump rolled out aggressive tariff policies against trading partners and continues to attack Powell and the Federal Reserve. The interest rate ticked higher again on Monday to 4.37%. The dollar losing value is unusual when stock prices fall and Treasury yields rise because investors typically buy U.S. government bonds during market turmoil, driving down the yield. Trump also criticized Powell for being “too late” to move on interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have long acknowledged that they waited too long to raise rates when inflation was first ignited in 2021. But right now, Powell has underscored that the Fed faces a potentially “challenging scenario.” Trump's tariffs could worsen inflation, and the Fed would typically respond to rising prices by keeping its rate elevated, or even raising it. “Our tool only does one of those two things at the same time,” Powell said last week. Trump lashed out at Powell on Friday and said he could fire him if he wanted, though it would likely touch off a legal battle that could go to the Supreme Court. Powell has said the president lacks the authority to fire him and has made clear he won't step down until his term ends in May 2026. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, when asked Friday whether firing Powell is an option, said that Trump “and his team will continue to study that matter.” Hassett also accused Powell of acting politically. Trump made a similar claim in his Truth Social post, accusing the Fed chair of cutting rates last year “in order to help Sleepy Joe Biden, later Kamala, get elected.” The Fed reduced its key rate three times in late 2024 as inflation cooled and out of concern that hiring was also slowing, though it later rebounded. “The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,” he said. Also Sunday, Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve's Chicago branch, said on CBS' “Face the Nation” that undermining the Federal Reserve's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth, and less hiring. And William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, said Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't “going to make the American people better off over time.”</p>

Jackson, an 11-time NBA champion as a coach and two-time champion as a player, posted the criticism on Easter Sunday, when the league had four games in the first round of the NBA Playoffs scheduled. "Again the NBA tests faith by playing multiple games on Christmas and Easter… sacred days," the post on X read. The post was Jackson's first in over a year, but his criticism of the NBA is not unique. "They went into the lockout year, and they did something that was kind of wonky. They did a bubble down in Orlando, and all the teams that could qualify went down there, and stayed down there," he said at the time during an appearance on the "Tetragrammaton with Rick Rubin" podcast.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said “disgruntled” former employees who were fired last week were behind the news that he allegedly shared sensitive information in a second, unreported Signal group chat. His brother Phil has a job at the Department of Defense. Last week, three Pentagon officials — senior adviser Dan Caldwell, deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick, and Colin Carroll, chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense — were fired following an investigation into media leaks, though the three have denied that they leaked information to the media. In a joint statement, the fired officials said they were “incredibly disappointed” by how their service ended. “We understand the importance of information security and work every day to protect it. At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of ‘leaks' to begin with,” they said. On Sunday, former interim Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot wrote an op-ed for Politico — an outlet he kicked out of its designated seat in the Pentagon press corps — in which he described the last month as a “month from hell” in the department. “It's been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon,” he said. “President Donald Trump has a strong record of holding his top officials to account,” Ullyot added. “Given that, it's hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.”</p>

After every foreign trip, Francis would go to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book. Pope Francis simplified the funeral rituals last year to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes. ▶ Read more about the pope's upcoming funeral and burial In the short text, Pope Francis decreed he would be buried in a simple underground tomb — with only “Franciscus” written on it — at St. Mary Major Basilica, home to Francis' favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, to whom he was particularly devoted. The Vatican says Pope Francis died of a cerebral stroke that put him into a coma and led to irreversible heart failure. In a statement, he noted that Francis also suffered from episodes of respiratory insufficiency and had had bilateral pneumonia, as well as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote on X that the pope “leaves behind a great legacy of true love for one's neighbors.” Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who received the pope four years ago in a historic meeting, said Francis was “greatly respected by all for his distinguished role in serving the causes of peace and tolerance, and for expressing solidarity with the oppressed and persecuted across the globe.” The South Sudan Council of Churches says it remembers with gratitude Francis' visit to the country and his “dedicated efforts to promote healing and unity among our leaders.” Tensions continue, however, recently raising fears of a return to civil war.

Biden planned to visit Francis one more time before leaving office, but the trip was canceled because of devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Pope Francis appealed for peace in Gaza and Ukraine as well as other conflict hotspots, in his Easter speech.

Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune called Francis an “immense personality” and said he “wrote his name in golden letters in modern history.” Though Christians have been increasingly targeted for proselytizing in Muslim-majority Algeria, the Catholic Church enjoys official recognition. Tebboune met Vatican officials when they visited on behalf of Francis in 2022, touring sites including the monastery where a group of Trappist monks were killed during the country's civil war. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle said Francis was “the rare leader who made us want to be better people. “In his humility and his gestures at once simple and profound — embracing the sick, ministering to the homeless, washing the feet of young prisoners — he shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God and one another,” the Obamas said in a statement. Any baptized Catholic male is eligible, though only cardinals have been selected since 1378. The winner must receive at least two-thirds of the vote from those cardinals under age 80 and thus eligible to participate.

Current regulations notionally limit the number of electors to 120, but popes have often exceeded that ceiling. Those over 80 can't vote but can participate in pre-conclave meetings, known as general congregations, in which church problems are discussed. It was in these meetings in 2013 that then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio spoke about the need for the church to go to the “existential peripheries” to find those who suffer — an off-the-cuff speech that helped his election. ▶ Read more about how the next pope will be chosen “Where Francis had supreme power, he refused to make the necessary changes,” said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the U.S.-based group BishopAccountability. David Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, noted the pope's “prompt and impressive action” on other matters but said the pope's “genial personality and warm demeanor distracted many from the unhealthy and still essentially unaddressed structural and cultural flaws in the church that cause kids to keep being hurt.” After delivering the blessing, Francis delighted the crowd of some 35,000 people with a long loops of greeting from his popemobile. He was history's first Latin American pontiff who charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change. Bolaños on X called Francis a “good man and a great Pope” and praised his defense of the weak, saying that Francis's “reformist” 12-year papacy would “leave a great legacy in the Church and in the world.” Michael Nsikak Umoh, spokesperson for the Nigerian bishops' association. In Congo, where pope visited in 2023 to demand that foreign powers stop plundering Africa's natural resources, Abbé Camille Esika in the capital, Kinshasa, said Francis “wanted to be the voice of the voiceless.” The South African Catholic Bishops' Conference has encouraged all Catholics to pray for those choosing his successor. His last public appearances, on Easter Sunday, were marked by a speech from the Loggia balcony and a meeting with crowds outside St. Peter's Basilica. A woman holds a picture of Pope Francis reading in Italian “Farewell Francis, thank you His Holiness, today all the people cry for you” in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican after Cardinal Camerlengo Kevin Joseph Farrell announced the death of Pope Francis, Monday, April 21, 2025. Francis' coffin will be moved from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta hotel, where he lived, to St. Peter's Basilica for public viewing. In a change ordered by Francis, the pope's body will no longer placed on an elevated bier in the basilica. No date for the funeral has been announced, but it must be held between four and six days after the death. Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism — an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform synagogues in North America -- said the relationship between the Catholic and Jewish communities flourished under Francis. “He honored the shared heritage of our faiths and took meaningful steps to heal historical wounds, reinforcing a path toward mutual respect and collaboration,” he said. He said the group especially appreciated Francis's consistent calls for dialogue and mutual respect between Israelis and Palestinians, emphasizing the necessity of a two-state solution that ensures security and self-determination for both. “In Jewish tradition, when a righteous soul dies, we say, based on Proverbs 10:7, ‘The memory of the righteous is a blessing.' With Pope Francis, we are certain that his memory will be a source of inspiration to all people of faith as we continue his extraordinary life's work of building a world rooted in love, justice, and peace.” President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! He said in a letter that Francis had dedicated himself to the service of others, “consistently revealing by his own actions how to live a simple, but meaningful life. The best tribute we can pay to him is to be a warm-hearted person, serving others wherever and in whatever way we can.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scores of foreign students across the country are included in a pair of sweeping lawsuits that allege the Trump administration unlawfully stripped them of their legal status amid a broader crackdown on immigration. Cases have ranged from high-profile instances involving alleged support of terror organizations to relatively minor offenses, like years-old misdemeanors. While some affected students have brought individual cases, at least two federal lawsuits filed in courts in Georgia and New Hampshire aim to represent large swaths of students at once – more than a hundred in each. Kuck told CNN he was aware of at least 10 other lawsuits filed on behalf of international students that made similar arguments. Asked for comment about the lawsuits, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the ACLU “should consider changing their name.” “The American Civil Liberties Union appears far more interested in protecting foreign students than then (sic) civil liberties and safety of Americans,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN. “It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live & study in the United States of America,” McLaughlin said. At the heart of both lawsuits is the difference between a foreign student's visa and their legal status as a student. There are several types of visas for international students studying in the United States. Both lawsuits deal with F-1 visas, among the most common type of student visa. Once admitted, they must “maintain” their status by pursuing their course of study, avoiding unauthorized employment and adhering to other rules. While a person's legal status – their ability to remain in the United States – is determined by US Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security, visas are issued by the State Department. DHS may initiate the termination of status for several reasons, one of the lawsuits notes, including by revoking a special waiver issued on the individual's behalf, the introduction of a private bill to make them a permanent resident, or following a notification to the federal register citing national security, diplomatic or public safety reasons. The expiration of an exchange visitor visa does not typically mean that person is immediately considered to be in the US illegally: ICE's website notes someone can stay in the US even if their F-1 visa is expired – so long as they maintain their status. The first lawsuit – initially filed in the Northern District of Georgia on April 11 – originally included 17 foreign students attending colleges and universities in Georgia, Louisiana, Arizona, Texas, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Missouri, Illinois and New York. The case has since ballooned, with 133 foreign students included among the plaintiffs –– all of whom are identified using pseudonyms “due to fear of retaliation by Defendants.” US Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Acting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons are all named as defendants. CNN has reached out to the White House, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Justice Department office for comment. According to the complaint, the plaintiffs' SEVIS records were marked as “OTHER - Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked. SEVIS record has been terminated,” or “Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status.” The lawsuit acknowledges some of the plaintiffs have faced criminal allegations or charges, but none have a criminal conviction. None have violated the restriction that requires them not to be convicted of a violent crime carrying a sentence longer than one year, the lawsuit says. For example, Jane Doe 1, a college student in Georgia, believes she is being targeted for a domestic violence case dismissed in February because “there was no underlying proof of any crime,” the complaint says. John Doe 2, also a Georgia student, believes he's being targeted for traffic citations, including driving with an expired license plate while his driver's license was withdrawn; his case was ultimately closed. “Rather,” the lawsuit says, “DHS's act of unlawfully terminating SEVIS records appears to be designed to coerce students, including each Plaintiff, into abandoning their studies and ‘self-deporting' despite not violating their status.” Filed Friday in the District of New Hampshire, it so far represents five international students: Three, all from India, attend Rivier University in New Hampshire, while two others are from China and attend the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. The lawsuit notes at least 112 students have had their F-1 status terminated in New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico. Again, the plaintiffs allege they were stripped of their student status unlawfully. One of the plaintiffs, a 23-year-old, claims to have received an email this month from his school notifying him his SEVIS record indicated he had failed to maintain status. “Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked,” it read, according to the lawsuit. “The only criminal matters the individual Plaintiffs have encountered are either dismissed non-violent misdemeanor charges or driving without a valid US driver's license (but using an international or foreign driver's license),” the lawsuit says. “While Defendants' reasons for these mass terminations of student status are unclear, what is clear is that these terminations – across the board – flout the applicable regulations governing student status termination and the regulations governing failure to maintain student status.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rate of diagnoses among men fell from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021 but these incidence rates among women increased slightly every year between 2003 and 2021. Those trends were interrupted in 2020, when cancer incidence rates fell significantly, the report shows, possibly because of disruptions in medical care related to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Because fewer cancers were diagnosed in 2020, especially through screening, we may see a larger percentage of cancers diagnosed at a late stage in future years,” the report says. Related article After her breast cancer diagnosis, Gaby Dabrowski found unexpected ‘joy' – and success – on the tennis court It's based on data from cancer registries funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute, and it's released by those institutions, the American Cancer Society and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. “However, sustained disparities by race and ethnicity emphasize the need to fully understand the factors that create these differences so that they can be mitigated.” Fewer people in the US are using tobacco, helping lower incidence and death rates for smoking-related cancers like lung, bladder and larynx, the report says. Related article Young women are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with cancer as young men: ‘We're seeing a change' Previously published research has shown that cancer diagnoses are shifting from older to younger adults and from men to women. Middle‐age women now have a slightly higher cancer risk than their male counterparts, and young women are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as young men, according to an American Cancer Society report published earlier this year. The new report shows that incidence rates among women have risen 0.3% each year. Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are also gradually increasing, driven mostly by types of cancer that have been associated with factors like obesity, alcohol use and age when someone gives birth for the first time. Differences in access to care and less use of diagnostic procedures and treatment may account for some of the difference, the researchers say. “One additional potential risk factor disproportionately affecting Black women is the use of chemical hair relaxers, which may be associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer among postmenopausal women.” Changing habits such as stopping tobacco use, staying at a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet with fruits and vegetables, avoiding alcohol and protecting skin can all reduce risk of cancer. Screening can help find and treat cancers early, before they spread.</p>

Demure, submissive and erotic, Suzie Wong is that bigger-than-life stereotype, that caricature Asian women grew up with in the U.S. We may have also secretly hoped to play that geisha-like image to win our way out of our oppression. We learn an Asian actor getting to play an Asian role was a victory back in those days, as the roles were taken by white actors wearing strange slant-eyed makeup. Her father was Chinese, an architect with a love for movies. “I've broken barriers, celebrated achievements, overcome disappointments and survived tragedies, all part of my remarkable journey from Hong Kong to Hollywood and beyond. This is my story,” she writes in the prologue. Her book is speckled with the big names of that era, Pat Boone, Katherine Hepburn, Dick Van Dyke. But she also depicts the racial barriers of that period. All women, especially in Hollywood, were trying to be beautiful and desirable. She talks about how Jack Soo, a Japanese American who portrays a nightclub owner in “Flower Drum Song,” was incarcerated with other Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II. Kwan believes her story is about hard work and advancement despite racism, not succumbing to it. Another big win is when Ross Hunter, a hot producer, rushes over to her at a Hollywood party and casts her in “Flower Drum Song.” The musical film shattered stereotypes, she says, by focusing on fashionably dressed, wealthy Asians. Even those who may find that message lacking in addressing the meaning of diversity and Asian American pride will acknowledge there is a lot to learn from Kwan's history. She is simply trying to land roles, hopefully good ones that showcase her talent in works by respected directors. Miyoshi Umeki, her friend and another prominent Asian actor of that period, did not like having to speak pidgin in her roles, but did it because that was her job as a professional. That kind of pain is the legacy being explored in Kwan's life. Being an Asian in America is what she calls “our shared humanity,” in which “East can meet West and possibly make the world a little better.”</p>

Alex Clark, host of the wellness podcast "Culture Apothecary," breaks down how easy it is to make one smart food decision that aligns with the growing MAHA movement. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) recently announced a public health alert over a Mexican-inspired pork product sold at Aldi supermarkets nationwide. The 16-ounce refrigerated sleeved tray packages, which are labeled "Pork Carnitas," were flagged in a public announcement on April 19 due to potential foreign object contamination. The FSIS said the product "may be contaminated with foreign material, specifically pieces of metal." "These items were shipped to Aldi supermarkets nationwide." The affected products have use-by dates of 06/30/2025 and 07/01/2025. The affected 16-ounce sleeved tray packages labeled "Pork Carnitas" have a use-by date of June 30 or July 1. The FSIS is not recalling the product because it is no longer available for sale. Equipment damage may have contaminated the pork carnitas product (not pictured) during production. "Although this product is no longer available for sale, FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers' refrigerators or freezers," the statement read. "Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase." In January, some packages of Casa Mamita Chicken & Cheese Taquitos – another product sold at Aldi – were recalled due to metal contamination. FSIS officials urge consumers to throw away or return the affected products (not pictured). Several thousand packages of oyster crackers were recalled in March after a "stainless steel wire" contaminated the crackers during production.

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The tricky thing about generating electricity is that for the most part, you pretty much have to use it or lose it. Making sure there are always enough generators spooled up to send electricity to every single power outlet in the country requires precise coordination. That's effectively what those who design and run the grid have had to do. You wouldn't have to overbuild the grid or spend so much effort keeping power generation in equilibrium with users. You could smooth over the drawbacks of intermittent power sources that don't emit carbon dioxide, like wind and solar. You could have easy local backup power in emergencies when transmission lines are damaged. You may not even need a giant, centralized power grid at all. And while the US has actually been using a crude form of energy storage called pumped hydroelectric power storage for decades, the country is now experiencing a gargantuan surge in energy storage capacity, this time from a technology that most of us are carrying around in our pockets: lithium-ion batteries. The aging US grid is also in dire need of upgrades, and batteries can cushion the shock of adding gigawatts of wind and solar while buying some time to perform more extensive renovations. Some power markets are finally starting to understand all the services batteries can provide — frequency regulation, peak shaving, demand response — creating new lines of business. Batteries are also a key tool in building smaller, localized versions of the power grid. If we can get it right, true grid-scale battery storage won't just be an enabler of clean energy, but a way to upgrade the power system for a new era. Back in 2011, one of my first reporting assignments was heading to a wind farm in West Virginia to attend the inauguration of what was at the time the world's largest battery energy storage system. Built by AES Energy Storage, it involved thousands of lithium-ion cells in storage containers that together combined to provide 32 megawatts of power and deliver it for about 15 minutes. “It was eight megawatt-hours total,” said John Zahurancik, who was vice president of AES Energy Storage at the time and showed me around the facility back then. That was about the amount of electricity used by 260 homes in a day. In the years since, battery storage has increased by orders of magnitude, as Zahurancik's new job demonstrates. He is now the president of Fluence, a joint venture between AES and Siemens that has deployed 38 gigawatt-hours of storage to date around the world. “The things that we're building today, many of our projects are over a gigawatt-hour in size,” Zahurancik said. Last year, the largest storage facility to come online in the US was California's Edwards & Sanborn Project, which can dispatch 33 GW for several hours. It wasn't a steady climb to this point, however. Overall grid battery capacity in the US barely budged for more than a decade. What could a giant battery do for your city? #batteries #electriccar #climate #climateaction #climatecrisis #climatechange #cleanenergy #environment #renewableenergy #greenenergy One shift is that the most common battery storage technology, lithium-ion cells, saw huge price drops and energy density increases. That's partly because the cells on the power grid aren't that different from those in mobile devices and electric vehicles, so grid batteries have benefited from manufacturing improvements that went into those products. “It's all one big pipeline,” said Micah Ziegler, a professor at Georgia Tech who studies clean energy technologies. “The batteries in phones, cars, and the grid all share common characteristics.” Seeing this rising demand, China went big on battery manufacturing and, much as it did in solar panels, created economies of scale to drive global prices down. China now produces 80 percent of the world's lithium-ion batteries. And because grid batteries don't have to be small enough to be mobile — unlike the batteries in your laptop or phone — they can take advantage of cheaper, less dense batteries that otherwise might not be suited for something that has to fit in your pocket. There's even talk of giving old EV batteries a second life on the power grid. A major hurdle for deploying grid energy storage systems is that they don't generate electricity on their own, so the rules for how they should connect to the grid and how much battery developers should get paid for their services were messy and restrictive in the past. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order 841 removed some of the barriers for energy storage systems to plug into wholesale markets and compete with other forms of power. Eleven states to date including California, Illinois, and Maryland have also set specific procurement targets for energy storage, which require utilities to install a certain amount of storage capacity, creating a push for more grid batteries. Together, these factors created a whole new businesses for power companies, spawned new grid battery companies, and fertilized the ground for a bumper crop of energy storage. But it's also an important ingredient in grid stability, reliability, and resilience, helping ensure a steady flow of megawatts during blackouts and extreme weather. If the grid dips below this frequency when a power-hungry user switches on, it can trip circuit breakers and cause power instability. Since batteries have nearly zero startup time, unlike thermal generators, they can quickly absorb or transmit power as needed to keep the grid humming the right tune. Grid batteries can also step in as reserve power when a generator goes offline or when a large power user unexpectedly turns on. They also let power providers save electricity when it's cheap to produce, and sell it back on the grid at times when demand is high and power is expensive. It's often faster to build a battery facility than an equivalent power plant, and since there are no smokestacks, it's easier to get permits and approvals. Batteries have already proven useful for overstressed power networks. As temperatures reached triple digits in Texas last year, batteries provided a record amount of power on the Lone Star State's grid. ERCOT, the Texas grid operator, didn't have to ask Texans to turn down their power use like it did in 2023. Between 2020 and 2024, Texas saw a 4,100 percent increase in utility-scale batteries, topping 5.7 gigawatts. Grid batteries have a halo effect for other power generators too. Most thermal power plants — coal, gas, nuclear — prefer to run at a steady pace. Ramping up and down to match demand takes time and costs money, but with batteries soaking up some of the variability, thermal power plants can stay closer to their most efficient pace, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping costs in check. I have been covering clean energy for more than a decade, growing well-acquainted with the drawbacks of intermittent wind and solar power. Batteries seemed like an obvious solution, and after one of my earliest reporting assignments, I thought that grid-level energy storage would take off. But the sector sat stagnant for years until it started to rocket upward around 2020. I was curious about the reason why grid-scale batteries took off so suddenly and what heights they might reach. “It's kind of like hybridizing your car,” Zahurancik said. You don't have to build power lines to accommodate absolute maximum electricity needs if you have a battery — on the generator side or on the demand side — to dish out a few more electrons when needed. “What we do with standalone batteries, the more and more of those you get, you start to alleviate needs or at least abridge things like new transmission build,” Smith said. These batteries also allow the grid to adapt faster to changing energy needs, like when a factory shuts down or when a new data center powers up. On balance this leads to a more stable, efficient, cheaper, and cleaner power grid. Most grid batteries are designed to store and dispatch electricity over the course of two to eight hours, but the grid also needs ways to stash power for days, weeks, and even months since power demand shifts throughout the year. There are also some fundamental looming challenges for grid-scale storage. Like most grid-level technologies, energy storage requires a big upfront investment that takes decades to pay back, but there's a lot of uncertainty right now about how the Trump administration's tariffs will affect battery imports, whether there will be a recession, and if this disruption will slow electricity demand growth in the years to come. There are 10 US factories slated to start up this year, which would raise the total EV battery manufacturing capacity to 421.5 gigawatt-hours per year. Total global battery manufacturing is projected to reach around 7,900 gigawatt-hours in 2025. Interconnection queues for all energy systems, but particularly solar, wind, and batteries, typically last three years or more as project developers produce reliability studies and cope with mounting regulatory paperwork delays. “I do worry about the IRA because it will change the curve, and quite honestly we cannot afford to change the curve right now with any form of clean energy,” Smith said. Still, utility-scale energy storage is a tiny slice of the sprawling US power grid, and there's enormous room to expand. “Even though we've been accelerating and going fast, by and large, we don't have that much of it,” Zahurancik said. “You could easily see storage becoming 20 or 30 percent of the installed power capacity.”</p>

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? by  Umair Irfan,  Benji Jones,  Adam Clark Estes, and  Sam Delgado At every light switch, power socket, and on the road, an unstoppable revolution is already underway. Technologies that can power our lives and jobs while doing less harm to the global climate — wind, solar, batteries, etc. Clean energy isn't just powering our devices, tools, and luxuries — it's growing the global economy, creating a whole suite of new jobs, and reshaping trade. And despite what headlines may say, there's no sign these trends will reverse. Political and economic turmoil may slow down clean energy, but the sector has built up so much momentum that it's become nigh unstoppable. Texas utilities have come to realize that investing in clean energy is not just good for the environment; it's good business. In some US markets, installing new renewable energy is cheaper than running existing coal plants. If these energy trends persist, the US economy will see its greenhouse gas emissions diminish faster, reducing its contribution to climate change. Now, just a few months into Trump's second presidency, it's still an open question just how fragile the country's progress on clean energy and climate will be. President Donald Trump does not like wind energy — apparently, in part, because he thinks turbines are ugly. “We're not going to do the wind thing,” Trump said after his inauguration during a rally. Within mere hours of stepping into office, Trump signed an executive order that hamstrung both onshore and offshore wind energy developments, even as he has claimed that the US faces an energy crisis. The order directed federal agencies to temporarily stop issuing approvals for both onshore and offshore wind projects and pause leasing for offshore projects in federal waters. Those policies could also pose a serious threat to offshore developments. But the sector overall simply has too much inertia to be derailed, according to Eric Larson, a senior research engineer at Princeton University who studies clean energy. “Because costs have been coming down so dramatically in the last decade, there is a certain momentum there that's going to carry through,” Larson said. Since 2010, US wind capacity has more than tripled, spurred by federal tax incentives. But even without those incentives — which Congress may eventually try to cut — onshore wind turbines are the cheapest source of new energy, according to the research firm Lazard. In 2023, the average cost of new onshore wind projects was two-thirds lower than a typical fossil fuel alternative, per a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency. In fact, wind energy might be the best example of how politics have had little bearing on the growth of renewable energy. Texas, which overwhelmingly supported Trump in the recent election, generates more wind energy than any other state, by far. The next three top states for wind energy production — Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas — all swung for Trump in the last election, too. These states are particularly windy, but they've also adopted policies, including tax incentives, that have helped build out their wind-energy sectors. “It's just a way to make money,” Larson said of wind. “It has nothing to do with the political position on whether climate change is real or not. In Iowa, for example, wind energy has drawn at least $22 billion in capital investment and has helped lower the cost of electricity. In 2023, wind generated about 60 percent of the state's energy — more than double any other source, like coal or natural gas. The wind sector is not without its challenges. Construction of new wind farms had begun slowing even before Trump took office. Dozens of counties across the US, in places like Ohio and Virginia, have also successfully blocked or delayed wind projects, citing a range of concerns like noise and impact on property values. Offshore wind, which is far costlier, faces even more opposition. Opponents similarly worry that they'll affect coastal property values and harm marine life. Yet ultimately these hurdles will only delay what is likely inevitable, analysts say: a future powered in large part by wind. It's hard to think of a natural wonder more unstoppable than the sun, and harnessing its energy has proven just as formidable. This lets the same-size panel convert more light into electricity. Since the device itself is a printed semiconductor, it has benefited from many of the manufacturing improvements that have come with recent advances in computer chip production. And since solar panels are modular, small gains in efficiency and cost reduction quickly add up, boosting the business case. There are some clouds on the horizon, however. The single-junction PV panel may be closing in on its practical efficiency limit. Solar energy is variable, and some power grid operators have struggled to manage the spike in solar production midday and sudden drop-off in the evening, creating the infamous “duck curve” graph of energy demand that shows how fast other generators have to ramp up. Still, solar energy provides less than 4 percent of electricity in the US, so there is immense room to grow. Overall costs continue to decline, and new technologies are emerging that can get around the constraints imposed by conventional panels. While wind and solar energy have soared upward for more than a decade, storing electricity on the grid with batteries is just taking off. Grid-scale battery capacity suddenly launched upward around 2020 and has about doubled every year since. That's good news for intermittent power sources, such as wind and solar: Energy storage is the booster rocket for renewables and one of the key tools for addressing the stubborn duck curve that plagues solar power. Batteries for the grid aren't that far removed from those that power phones and computers, so they've benefited from cost and performance improvements in consumer batteries. And they still have room to get cheaper. On the power grid, batteries do a number of jobs that help improve efficiency and cut greenhouse gas emissions. The specific combination of solar-plus-storage is still a small share of utility-scale projects, but it's gaining ground in the residential market as these systems get cheaper. Batteries also help grid operators cope with demand peaks: They can bank power when it's cheap and sell those electrons when electricity is more expensive. They also maintain grid stability and provide the juice to restart power generators after outages or maintenance. That means there's a huge demand for grid batteries beyond backing up renewables. Water is pumped uphill into a reservoir when power is cheap and then runs downhill through turbines when it's needed. Batteries get around these hurdles with higher efficiencies, scalability, and modularity. And since they stay parked in one place, energy density and portability don't matter as much on the grid as they would in a car or a phone. Car batteries that have lost too much capacity to be worthwhile in a vehicle can get a second life on the power grid. Designs like flow batteries that store energy by the megawatt-hour and molten salt batteries that stash power for months could outperform the reigning lithium-ion battery. Fossil fuels currently account for nearly 90 percent of the energy consumption in the transportation sector, which makes it an obvious target for decarbonization. And while it will take some time to figure out how to electrify planes, trains, and container ships, the growth of EVs, including passenger cars and trucks, has reached a tipping point. The price of a new EV is nearly equivalent to a new gas-powered car, when you include state and federal subsidies. Even though the Trump administration has effectively waged war on the EV transition by pulling funding for charging infrastructure expansion and threatening to end subsidies for new EV purchases, at best those moves may slow a largely unstoppable EV transition in the long term. There are signs, however, that the number of people buying EVs in the US and Europe is slowing, even as subsidies remain available. Experts say this is likely due, in part, to more consumer choice, as the number of EV offerings, including off-road trucks and minivans, continues to grow. But even here we see encouraging signs: As more EVs have come to market, more plug-in hybrid models have also appeared. And plug-in hybrids tend to be slightly cheaper and help people deal with range anxiety, the umbrella term for the fear of not being able to find a charger, while still reducing emissions. “The early adopters who are just all in on that EV tech, they've adopted it,” Nicole Wakelin, editor at large of CarBuzz, told Vox in January. Around the world, cheap EVs are surging in popularity. The cheapest model from Chinese front-runner BYD now costs less than $10,000, and by 2027, Volkswagen promises it will sell a cheap EV in Europe for about $20,000. Meanwhile, in the US, the average price for a used EV in mid-2024 was $33,000, compared to $27,000 for an internal combustion engine vehicle. Those Chinese EVs aren't currently available in the US. For any of these clean energy sectors to reach their highest potential, there's an essential requirement they all share: a robust, skilled workforce. The 2024 Clean Jobs America report by E2, a national group focused on climate solutions across industries, paints a positive picture for clean jobs. All together, clean energy outpaced economy-wide employment growth for the last five years. And while the Trump administration has targeted the wind industry, rolled back some climate-friendly policies, and griped about solar, the administration's policies have yet to put a dent on positive job growth in clean jobs. “I expect [the administration] will go after some provisions, but there is quite a bit in the IRA that will be very difficult to repeal since large-scale clean energy investments have been made, and a majority of those in red states whose politicians will not want to give them up,” one former US official told Heatmap News. Republican districts have benefited far more than progressive ones from clean tech manufacturing investments to the tune of over $161 billion, Bloomberg reported. Going after clean jobs would mean stalling economic growth in communities that helped deliver Trump a second term — a move that most would call politically unwise. Globally, clean energy sectors added over 4.7 million jobs to a total of 35 million from 2019 to 2022 — exceeding the amount of fossil fuel jobs internationally. One paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that fewer than 1 percent of fossil fuel workers have transitioned to green jobs, citing a lack of translatable skills — operating an oil derrick isn't as applicable to installing solar panels, for example. Another paper from Nature found that while some fossil fuel workers might have the right skills for clean energy jobs, the location of green jobs often aren't where fossil fuel workers are based. Several policy routes can be taken to create a more equitable transition for these workers, such as funding early retirement programs for fossil fuel workers who lose their jobs or heavily investing in fossil fuel communities where there is potential for creating renewable energy hubs. While President Trump has largely been hostile to renewable energy, there's one clean energy source that the administration actually supports: geothermal. Geothermal has long lived in the shadows of other renewables — especially as wind and solar have surged. But geothermal's potential may be greater than any of those, and ironically, being in Trump's good graces may give this sector the final boost it needs. US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has long praised geothermal, and the fracking company he oversaw prior to joining the Trump administration invested in Fervo Energy, a company that specializes in geothermal technologies. In 2023, geothermal energy produced less than half a percent of total US utility-scale electricity generation, far behind other renewables like solar and wind. The regional specificity has been a big barrier to geothermal taking off more broadly. But these geographic and financial barriers could be broken down. Because it's not intermittent and doesn't rely on specific weather conditions (the way that solar, wind, and hydropower do) geothermal has a capacity advantage over other renewables. In 2023, geothermal had a capacity factor, or how often an energy source is running at maximum power, of 69 percent, compared to 33 percent and 23 percent for wind and solar, respectively — meaning it's more capable of producing reliable power. That advantage could be critical for US decarbonization goals. In March 2024, the DOE released a lengthy report on the necessary steps to unlocking enhanced geothermal's full potential on a commercial scale. In October of last year, the federal government approved a massive geothermal project in Utah that plans to provide power for more than 2 million homes and aims to be operational by 2026. Geothermal also has bipartisan support (and is perhaps one of the few issues that the Biden and Trump administration would share similar views on). And because it's borrowing technology from the gas and oil industry, it can tap into former fossil fuel workers to staff these plants. Geothermal's breakthrough isn't assured, but it's on the cusp of takeoff. If the necessary financial investments are made, and companies can show that advances in technology can be scaled up beyond the western US, it could usher in the age of a geothermal energy revolution. ﻿The world is steadily moving away from fossil fuels. Trump wants to reverse years of climate progress.</p>

People in Michigan, Texas, Tennessee and Washington, D.C. contemplate President Trump's executive order establishing English as the official language of the United States. U.S. citizens throughout the country told Fox News Digital this month what they think about President Donald Trump's recent executive order to make English the official language in America. While many found the mandate to be a no-brainer, others said it flies in the face of America's diversity. "I mean, this is how the country was built hundreds of years ago – it was based on a group of people from different nations coming in to form this country." Americans weigh in on whether they support President Trump's executive order to make English the official language of the United States. (Insets: Fox News Digital | Background: Anna Moneymaker / Staff) The text of Trump's order stated, "A nationally designated language is at the core of a unified and cohesive society, and the United States is strengthened by a citizenry that can freely exchange ideas in one shared language." The order added that an official language is intended to "promote unity" and "cultivate a shared American culture for all citizens," while ensuring consistency in government operations and creating a pathway to civic engagement. Steve from Birmingham, Mich., told Fox he thinks Trump is "100 percent absolutely correct" to sign the order, noting that there "should be no other language" officially designated. Junior, a Mexican-American living in Houston, said he respects the order. So America, it's English, you know what I mean?" However, Mary in Washington, D.C., said, "I don't think that's fair." "I think that we need to be multicultural, and I think that the more diversity we have, the more beautiful the land is, the more enriched we can be by learning something else about someone else," she said. Michigan resident David shared Mary's viewpoint, stating, "I think there is no official language for a reason. We have nothing but immigrants from all over the world." He argued that when the U.S. Constitution was ratified, "there were probably 40 to 50 languages being spoken in the United States." Darryl from Houston said, "I think English should always have been the official language of the United States." Tennessee native Glen was less opinionated on the subject, stating, "Hard to say, really. I don't know that I necessarily agree with that, because we have people from all different nationalities. So, I don't have any strong thoughts on that one way or the other." Lindy and Trudy – two friends from Houston – slammed the executive order. I think we were there, you know, in the 1950s. But it's just not a reality in today's world." Trudy added, "I think we are a mixed nation of diverse people, and we have to face the fact that not everyone is going to speak English." When asked if he supported the order, Howard from North Carolina told Fox, "Yes." Jay from Knoxville, Tenn., appeared to indicate he supported the order, though he expressed openness to cultural diversity in the U.S. "I would prefer that everybody speaks English, but I also am respectful of people and their cultures and their languages when they come to America," he said. Charles, a Mississippi man touring D.C., was forceful in his defense of the order, stating, "You know, we're Americans. Gabriel Hays is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former chief Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot, who was once a strong backer of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is now warning that the “total chaos” of the last month at the Defense Department, including Signalgate and the recent firings over supposed leaks, could lead to Hegseth's ouster. In an op-ed in Politico, Ullyot detailed his shift from once arguing that Hegseth was the “best man to shake things up” at the DOD to now observing that the Pentagon is in “disarray” under his leadership and may not have much time left as defense secretary. All three were put on leave as part of an investigation into leaks in the department, with the Pentagon using polygraph tests in its inquiry. Yet Ullyot revealed that none of the fired officials were given a polygraph test in the investigation, and one of them was told by investigators that he would soon be cleared of all wrongdoing. The defense secretary's initial response to reporters was to deny that any “war plans” were shared, which Ullyot said only made things worse as editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg then released the full text chain shortly after. Now faced with the loss of two of his closest advisers and another Signal chat leak revealed by the New York Times on Sunday night, Ullyot concluded by suggesting that Hegseth's time in the high-level Cabinet post may be coming to a close, given President Donald Trump's first term, which saw him go through three different defense secretaries. “President Donald Trump has a strong record of holding his top officials to account. Given that, it's hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer,” he said. Ullyot was no longer serving in his role as chief Pentagon spokesman in late March following uproar over the deletion of a story about Jackie Robinson as part of the DOD's initiative to remove DEI content. His resignation from the department came just last week on April 17.</p>
