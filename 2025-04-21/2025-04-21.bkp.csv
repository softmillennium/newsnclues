            Kenya's Sharon Lokedi won a thrilling battle over compatriot and two-time defending champion Hellen Obiri at the Boston Marathon, smashing the course record in the process.
    


            Lokedi surged away from her rival in the closing stages and crossed the line in 2:17:22 – more than two and a half minutes faster than Buzunesh Deba's previous record from 2014.
    


            It was Lokedi's second major marathon victory having triumphed in New York in 2022, while also avenging her runner-up finish to Obiri at last year's race.
    


            “I'm always second to her and today I was like: There's no way,” the 31-year-old said. “I just have to put it out there and fight till the end and see how it goes. I'm so glad I ran that fast and she was right behind me. We all fought and wanted this so bad.”
    


            Ethiopia's Yalemzerf Yehualaw was third in 2:18:06, still well inside the old course record.
    


            The lead group set off at a blistering pace, passing through the halfway mark in 1:08:46. The race started to thin out in the hilly latter stages, eventually leaving only Lokedi and Obiri to battle for the victory.
    


            “We went through halfway in 68 minutes and I thought: That's so fast! We hadn't got to the hills yet,” said Lokedi. “We just kept the pace honest, but I was worried we were going too fast.”
    


            In the men's race, Kenyan John Korir pulled clear from the lead pack around mile 20 to take a commanding victory in a time of 2:04:45.
    


            Tanzania's Alphonce Simbu outsprinted Kenya's Cyprian Kotut to finish second, crossing the line 19 seconds behind Korir, while American Conner Mantz narrowly missed out on a podium place in fourth.
    


            The 28-year-old Korir follows in the footsteps of his brother Wesley, who took the title in Boston 13 years ago. The pair embraced at the finish line as they celebrated becoming the first siblings ever to win the race.
    


            “I expected him there (at the finish line). I had promised him that I am going to win and I made it,” Korir told ESPN, adding: “Today I will make jokes with him because I am the fastest in the family. He had a title for Boston in the family but now I've got it.”
    


            The reigning Chicago Marathon champion had to overcome a difficult start in Boston when he fell in the first 50 meters and lost his race number from the front of his singlet. However, he soon managed to pick himself up and catch up with the lead runners.
    


            The stumble didn't seem to faze Korir during the race as he built a big lead over the field in the last six miles, not long after defending champion Sisay Lemma of Ethiopia had pulled out.
    


            In the wheelchair races, Switzerland's seven-time Paralympic champion Marcel Hug won his eighth title in Boston, while USA's Susannah Scaroni claimed her second having also triumphed in 2023.

Follow:


            When the newly elected Pope Francis returned to the front desk of his hotel in Rome to personally settle his bill a day after being introduced to cheering crowds in St. Peter's Square in 2013, it was a first glimpse into the modesty that would come to define his papacy.
    


            But for one real estate developer turned reality television star observing developments from his penthouse in Manhattan, it was a sign of something else.
    


            “I don't like seeing the Pope standing at the checkout counter (front desk) of a hotel in order to pay his bill,” Donald Trump, still years from mounting his first presidential bid, wrote on Twitter. “It's not Pope-like!”
    


            There was little in common between now-President Trump and Pope Francis, who died Monday at 88. The two men sparred from afar on issues of immigration and the environment, adopted divergent approaches to the sumptuous trappings of their respective offices, and lived vastly different kinds of lives.
    


            “That's why I'll never be Pope!” Trump responded to a commenter on his post in 2013, who observed “the difference between the Pope and you is the Pope doesn't have to constantly brag how great he is.”
    


            Yet for all the obvious differences, there was some overlap in how Francis and Trump arrived at their positions, and how they viewed their roles.
    


            Each was elected as an outsider and brought to their office a pledge to represent society's forgotten: for Trump, the American workers who he said Washington passed over in an era of globalization; and for Francis, the poor and marginalized often left to the side of a fast-changing world.
    


            Both also sought dramatic changes to the institutions they ran: the sprawling federal government for Trump, and the billion-person strong Catholic Church for Francis.
    


            “He's a very good man who loved the world. And he especially loved people that were having a hard time. And that's good with me,” Trump said Monday after ordering flags on federal buildings lowered to half staff.
    


            Trump sent his love to American Catholics before quickly turning his remarks toward his strength among Catholic voters.
    


            “We love you all, we're with you all. They were with me through the election, as you know, very strongly,” Trump said at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. “It's just an honor to have the support of the Catholics. I feel very badly for them because they love the pope.”
    


            When they met during Trump's first term at the Vatican in 2017 — their only face-to-face encounter — Trump and Francis had already been tangling on the issue of immigration after Francis declared anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants was “not a Christian.” Trump had spent the 2016 presidential campaign vowing to construct a wall along the Southern US border to keep migrants out.
    


            Those differences were put aside during Trump's visit, where he was accompanied by his wife Melania, who wore a traditional black veil. Both leaders appeared determined not to let their dispute spoil the encounter.
    


            And like most presidents before him, Trump emerged from his meeting with the pope appearing starstruck.
    


            “He is something, he's really good. We had a fantastic meeting and we had a fantastic tour, it was really beautiful,” Trump said.
    


            Trump and the first lady had arrived to the Vatican about a half-hour earlier, his long motorcade and armored black SUV a stark contrast to the blue Ford Focus that Francis himself had arrived in to work that day.
    


            The meeting was not entirely devoid of politics. The pope presented Trump a copy of his influential encyclical document on preserving the environment, which was interpreted as an attempt by Francis to encourage Trump to adopt stronger efforts at combatting climate change. (It didn't appear effective; Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord a few weeks later).
    


            Like many world leaders who watch Trump from afar, Francis found Trump easier to talk to than his harsh language on the campaign trail might have suggested.
    


            He lightened the mood when shaking Melania Trump's hand, asking her in Italian, “Did you give him potica to eat?” — referring to the Slovenian dessert few could imagine the glamorous former model whipping up in the White House kitchen.
    


            Francis also handed Trump a medallion etched with the image of an olive tree, which he explained was “a symbol of peace.”
    


            “We can use peace,” Trump responded. As they parted ways, Trump told him: “I won't forget what you said.”
    


            The three US presidents who met Francis all found themselves moved by the experience in different ways. President Barack Obama took the rare step of traveling to Joint Base Andrews to greet Francis at the start of the pope's blockbuster visit to the United States in 2015.
    


            Later, the pope led a short parade in his open-air popemobile around the South Lawn, which was crowded with thousands who had come to witness a rare papal visit to the White House, some carrying babies for the pope to kiss.
    


            The cultural moment couldn't be denied several months later on Halloween, when the child of an administration official arrived to the annual White House trick-or-treating event dressed as the pontiff, complete with a tiny white car.
    


            It was on that visit that Francis met privately with members of then-Vice President Joe Biden's family in the immediate aftermath of his son Beau Biden's death from cancer. Counseling the Biden's inside an airplane hanger at the Philadelphia International Airport, Francis “provided us with more comfort that even he, I think, will understand,” Biden would later recount.
    


            After he became president, Biden traveled to Rome amid a raging debate inside the US Catholic Church over whether he and other politicians who support abortion rights should receive communion. Afterward, Biden said Francis called him a “good Catholic” and that he should continue receiving the sacrament.
    


            Last year, as he was preparing to depart office under a cloud of disappointment following his exit from the 2024 race and his vice president's loss to Trump, Biden had planned to visit Rome again to meet Francis. The trip was canceled amid wildfires in Los Angeles, but in his final days as president Biden awarded Francis the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
    


            Trump and Francis would never meet again after their 2017 encounter. After Trump was elected to a second term, Francis took harsh aim at his administration's plans for mass deportations, warning such a step would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity and “will end badly.”
    


            It was a remarkable rebuke, issued in a letter to US bishops. It appeared to take aim at Vice President JD Vance for his defense of deportations on theological grounds.
    


            “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,” the pope wrote, responding to Vance's assertion that people should take care of their family, communities and country before expanding care to others.
    


            In some ways, the rupture appeared to reflect a growing rift between traditionalist American Catholics and the Vatican under Francis, which had sought to be more inclusive of same-sex couples, women and other groups.
    


            Still, the discord did not appear to seep into Vance's meeting with Francis on Easter Sunday, just a day before he died. Vance appears to have been the last world leader Francis met before his death. He sat briefly with the pope in a reception room at the Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican guesthouse where he has lived since his election in 2013.
    


            Vance, who has called himself a “baby Catholic” after converting to the faith as an adult, was on Vatican grounds on Sunday for less than 20 minutes, and the meeting hadn't been confirmed ahead of time. During their short session, the pope gifted the vice president a tie, rosaries and three big chocolate Easter eggs for Vance's three children.
    


            “I pray for you every day,” Vance could be heard telling the Pontiff as they sat together at the Vatican.

Follow:


            The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear arguments in a case against the US Postal Service filed by a Texas woman who claims her carrier declined to deliver the mail to her rental properties because she is Black.
    


            Lebene Konan, a realtor and licensed insurance agent, alleged that the post office that covers two rental properties she owns in suburban Dallas changed the lock on her post office box and then declined to deliver the mail to the property for two to three months.
    


             Konan claimed that happened because the carrier and postmaster did not “like the idea that a Black person” owned them.
    


            A 1946 law generally allows people to sue the federal government for damages if employees cause injury or property loss through their negligence. But the law includes a number of exceptions, including for any claim raising from the “loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.” The question for the high court, then, is whether the exception applies to Konan's situation.
    


            A federal district court in Texas granted the government's request to dismiss the case, because of the exception. But the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The Biden administration appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in September, and the Trump administration has continued to defend against the suit.
    


            In the fiscal year that ended in 2023, the US Postal Service delivered more than 116 billion pieces of mail to more than 166 million delivery points across the nation, the government noted. If courts embraced Konan's position, the government said, it could open the USPS up to a flood of lawsuits.
    


            “Under the logic of the Fifth Circuit's decision, any person whose mail is lost or misdelivered could bring a federal tort suit – and potentially proceed to burdensome discovery – so long as she alleges that a USPS employee acted intentionally,” the government told the high court in its appeal.
    


            The Supreme Court is likely to hear arguments in the fall and hand down a decision next year.
    


            Also Monday, the court also declined to review an appeals court ruling that found Minnesota's ban on people under 21 carrying handguns violated the Second Amendment.
    


            The decision means that ban will remain blocked.
    


            A three-judge panel of the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals said in a unanimous decision that the 2003 law runs afoul of both the Second Amendment and the 14th Amendment, holding that the state could not lawfully prohibit individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 from obtaining a public carry permit simply because they are not yet 21.
    


            Minnesota appealed that decision in January, arguing that the appeals court failed to take into account a new Supreme Court decision from last year that softened the historical standard courts must consider when weighing whether gun regulations are constitutional.

            More than 30 states and the District of Columbia have similar regulations. Another appeals court, the 5th Circuit, ruled earlier this year that a law banning the sale of handguns to 18- to 20-year-olds is also unconstitutional.
    


            The question of how far governments may go in regulating guns for those under 21 has been caught up in a broader debate about history that was created by a landmark 2022 decision from the Supreme Court that made it easier for Americans to carry guns in public. That decision required courts to find analogous gun regulations in history before ruling they were consistent with the Second Amendment.
    


            In the case of Minnesota's law, the 8th Circuit ruled that there was no adequate historical analogue to the state's ban.
    


            But a subsequent Supreme Court decision last year appeared to alter the analysis lower courts must make when weighing the constitutionality of gun laws.
    


            In that case, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from owning guns. A majority of justices said courts need not find the exact same regulation in the historical record but rather whether the new law is “relevantly similar” to laws that “our tradition is understood to permit.”

Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, died at 7:35 a.m. at his residence in the Vatican's Casa Santa Marta, Cardinal Kevin Farrell said in a statement.

Francis ""knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity,"" the Ukrainian leader also said in his message.

""He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians,"" Zelensky added. ""We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support. Eternal memory!""

Zelensky last met with Francis during a visit to the Vatican in October, according to US broadcaster CNN.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters later that he and Francis had discussed the plight of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children deported to Russia since Moscow's full-scale invasion, and the need to make every effort to bring them home.

Francis in April 2022 condemned atrocities committed during Russia's war against Ukraine, including ""the massacre of Bucha,"" the town near Kyiv where mutilated bodies of civilians and mass graves were found after the withdrawal of Russian forces.

On the first anniversary of Russia's war, Francis called on Catholics to pray for Ukrainians, saying that ""war is destruction,"" CNN reported.

Top Polish officials have paid tribute to Francis, calling him ""a great apostle of mercy"" and ""a good, warm and sensitive man.""

The Polish foreign ministry said that ""the Holy Father united the hearts of millions with his kindness.""

The pontiff had been battling serious respiratory issues after a bout of double pneumonia earlier this year.

Francis, who became pope in 2013, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital in mid-February after experiencing difficulty breathing.

He spent 38 days there before returning to his Vatican residence to continue his recovery.

In 1957, in his early 20s, Francis—then Jorge Mario Bergoglio—underwent surgery in his native Argentina to remove part of a lung due to a severe respiratory infection, according to the Vatican News.

In his later years, he frequently struggled with respiratory illnesses. In November 2023, he cancelled a planned trip to the United Arab Emirates due to influenza and lung inflammation, the Vatican News said.

The pope's death comes just hours after he appeared in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican for Easter Sunday celebrations.

NEW YORK, April 21. /TASS/. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth sent detailed information on US strikes on Yemen to a private Signal messenger chat group that included his wife, brother and lawyer, The New York Times (NYT) reported citing sources.

According to the publication, on March 15, Hegseth posted the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornet fighters, which struck positions of Yemeni Houthis from the Ansar Allah rebel movement, in a chat that included his wife Jennifer, who is not a Pentagon employee, as well as his brother Phil and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore, who work in the defense department.

As the publication points out, unlike the chat with the participation of US administration officials in the Signal messenger, this second chat was created by the Pentagon chief personally and included, in addition to his wife, about a dozen people from Hegseth's inner circle, including two officials suspended due to data leaks. Moreover, the head of the US defense department used his personal phone, not his work phone, to communicate in the chat.

Shooter Patrick Crusius was sentenced to life in prison without parole for 2019 massacre near US-Mexico border

The gunman who killed 23 people in a racist attack at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas – one of the deadliest mass shootings in US history – pleaded guilty on Monday to capital murder in a state district court.

Patrick Crusius was automatically sentenced to life in prison without parole for the massacre near the US-Mexico border. The change of plea comes after local prosecutors took the death penalty off the table.

The people who were killed ranged in age from a 15-year-old high school athlete to elderly grandparents. They included immigrants, a retired city bus driver, a teacher, tradesmen including a former iron worker, and several Mexican nationals who had crossed the US border on routine shopping trips.

Crusius has acknowledged he targeted Hispanics on 3 August 2019, when he opened fire in a Walmart in the Texas border city that was crowded with weekend shoppers from the US and Mexico.

The El Paso county district attorney, James Montoya, declined to pursue the death penalty. Montoya says that decision was driven by a majority of victims' relatives who want the case to be over.

Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level after pleading guilty to hate crimes and weapons charges.

Crusius was expressionless before the hearing began at the El Paso county courthouse, which was under heightened security. Crusius wore a striped jumpsuit, shackles and a protective vest.

About 100 people from victims' families were seated in the gallery behind a few rows reserved for media, prosecutors and Crusius's defense team.

If the plea arrangement proceeds, families will be able to give victim impact statements. Dozens of people made emotional statements during a similar hearing in federal court in 2023 that lasted for three days.

Crusius, a white community-college dropout, was 21 years old when police say he drove more than 700 miles (1,100km ) to El Paso from his home near Dallas.

Not long after posting a racist rant online that warned of a Hispanic “invasion”, he opened fire with an AK-style rifle inside and outside the store. Crusius was arrested shortly after.

Joe Spencer, a defense attorney in the state and federal cases, said Crusius had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder that can be marked by hallucinations, delusions and mood swings, and has suffered from debilitating mental illness for most of his life.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

At least 11 state colleges enroll in program that trains officers for ‘limited' involvement in immigration operations

Fears of a new wave of deportations and student visa cancellations are rising at a number of Florida's most diverse universities after administrators signed agreements recasting campus police as federal immigration agents.

Miami's Florida International University (FIU) is one of at least 11 state colleges to enroll in the top tier of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) 287(g) program that trains local police departments for “limited” involvement in immigration operations.

The partnerships give campus officers broad new powers to stop, question and detain students about their immigration status, and share information directly with Ice, which students and faculty members believe could escalate the Trump administration's assault on those studying in the US from abroad.

Nationally, more than 1,400 international students and recent graduates perceived by the government to be pro-Palestinian have had their F-1 or J-1 visas canceled by the homeland security department, according to a tally by Inside Higher Ed, with the Miami New Times reporting dozens in Florida.

Additionally, a series of prominent arrests, detentions and deportations of students, alumni and scholars have sparked outrage and protests on campuses nationwide. They include Mahmoud Khalil, Rümeysa Öztürk and Mohsen Mahdawi.

At the University of Florida (UF), which confirmed its collaboration with Ice earlier this month, students have organized several demonstrations against the agreement, and in support of Felipe Zapata Velázquez, a Colombian third-year student deported after he was arrested last month by local police for alleged traffic offenses and handed over into Ice custody.

Maxwell Frost, a Democratic Florida congressman, decried what he called Velázquez's “government-funded kidnapping”. Protesters say his deportation is part of an ongoing Trump administration purge of overseas students, many for minor infractions.

Earlier this year, the government reactivated the taskforce model of the Ice partnership program that was discontinued by Barack Obama in 2012 for racial profiling, and which the American Civil Liberties Union has argued is unconstitutional.

Ron DeSantis, Florida's rightwing Republican governor, directed state law enforcement agencies in February to sign up, and the Miami Herald reported on Thursday that almost every college with its own campus law enforcement agency is enrolled.

“That the University of Florida has signed on to the highest level of these agreements is atrocious,” Stephen Sykes, the chair of the UF chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America, said.

“There's no rule in Florida that any group sign on at this level, which effectively makes the police force a wing of Ice itself.”

Sykes continued: “Even across activist communities at UF that generally don't have the best relationships with police, they were seen as kind of the good people. They protected activists during our Palestine encampment, they were just there hanging out. It felt more like they were protecting us than trying to box us in. Now a lot of that trust is definitely gone.

“Students are scared to come out now, because to even speak up is to risk deportation.”

Activists at FIU share Sykes's concerns that international students in particular will be reluctant to seek help from campus law enforcement, or to report crimes.

“What will they do with any information they receive? Who will they send it to?” said Bayan Abedulazis, the president of FIU's Students for Justice in Palestine chapter.

“Things are very uncertain, and there is a lot of fear, just because of the fact that FIU is an international university. Most students either have a background of family not coming from the US or are directly coming from out of the country, and they've just kind of detached from a lot of these spaces, like SJP or the like, because they don't want to be caught or have risk for themselves or their families.”

FIU has almost 3,800 international students from more than 142 countries, according to its website. Madeline Baró, the senior director of media relations, told the Guardian that the visas of 18 students had been revoked, but would not comment about the university's agreement with Ice.

There was a “no Ice on campus” protest on Tuesday, but Abedulazis said her group had advised international students not to take part.

“For SJP specifically, Palestine is such a big international issue, and we have a lot of international students that have wanted to be involved, or have been involved in the past,” she said.

“This past semester we've advised students not to attend any kind of public demonstrations, specifically in regards to Palestine, or just in the general sense, because of the kind of risk that it's been posing for students to speak out publicly in any kind political manner.”

Educators joined the midweek protest at FIU, with members of its Union Faculty of Florida chapter displaying placards opposing the Ice agreement.

“Universities have usually been considered free spaces, open spaces,” Terrence Peterson, a history professor, told WLRN.

“ We want our students to show up. It's hard enough to get them to show up anyways if they're afraid to come because they might be arrested and deported.”

Rogelio Tovar, the chair of FIU's board of trustees, defended the agreement to colleagues during their meeting on Tuesday, WLRN reported.

“No student should be fearful if they're here legally and they're in compliance with the law,” he said.

The university recently acceded to a request from DeSantis to appoint Jeanette Nuñez, a close political ally and his former lieutenant governor, as interim president, sparking allegations of cronyism.

The activist group Florida Student Power Network has also been helping organize campus resistance to Ice integration with university administrators, and lobbying Florida's state legislators in Tallahassee.

“University campuses do not have to comply to these agreements,” the group said in a statement ahead of a protest at Boca Raton's Florida Atlantic University (FAU).

“It is clear that schools are bowing down to a racist agenda rather than prioritizing the safety of their students. This won't stop at FAU. We need to fight back.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Armed thieves broke into reality TV star's flat in France in 2016, making off with possessions worth millions of euros

A group of pensioners nicknamed the “grandpa robbers” will go on trial in Paris next week, charged with stealing jewellery worth millions of euros from the US TV reality star Kim Kardashian when she attended Paris fashion week in 2016.

In what was considered the biggest robbery of an individual in France in 20 years, Kardashian was tied up and held hostage at gunpoint in her bedroom in central Paris by armed thieves dressed as police officers in the early hours of 3 October 2016. The thieves escaped with up to an estimated €10m in jewellery.

At the time of the robbery, Kardashian was without security protection and sitting alone in her bedroom at an exclusive apartment building in central Paris, known as a “no address” site, where celebrities visiting Paris often rent sumptuous suites.

Her bodyguard had instead accompanied her sister, the fellow reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian, to a Paris nightclub after the sisters had spent the day at major Paris fashion shows being photographed.

Kardashian, 44, a billionaire celebrity influencer and business owner, later told the TV interviewer David Letterman she had feared she would be raped and murdered during the heist. She said of one of the burglars: “I saw him have a gun out for me, and I was like, OK, this is it. I kept on thinking about Kourtney, I kept on thinking she's going to come home and I'm going to be dead in the room and she's going to be traumatised for the rest of her life if she sees me … I thought that was my fate.”

At that time, Kardashian routinely posted most of her daily movements and whereabouts on social media, where she also displayed her jewellery, including a large 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring given to her by her then husband, the rapper Kanye West, which was estimated to be worth $4m. Those details on social media may have facilitated the thieves' targeting of her.

Kardashian later told a Forbes Power Women's Summit the thieves had followed her movements on social media. “They knew my every move and what I had.” She said it had changed her approach to what she posted.

Kardashian, who is now a criminal justice advocate in the US, will travel to give evidence at the Paris trial, which runs from 28 April to 23 May.

A group of five armed men, all aged over 60, are alleged to have arrived by bicycle or on foot and impersonated police officers to enter the building just after 2am.

After allegedly holding the concierge at gunpoint, they went to Kardashian's apartment, where one man pulled a gun on her. Kardashian told police that the man spoke in “a very strong French accent” in English, telling her to hand over her diamond engagement ring. She was held at gunpoint, her arms and feet were tied and her mouth was taped. The men then fled the room in less than 10 minutes taking the ring and other jewels.

Ten people will go on trial in Paris in connection with the heist, on charges including armed robbery, membership of a criminal gang, and kidnapping – which refers to Kardashian being held hostage at gunpoint. Eight deny any involvement.

One of the accused, Yunice Abbas, now 71, has admitted his part in the heist saying he was part of the group who entered the building and he stood guard downstairs. He told TF1 TV in France on Sunday: “We were all grandads.” He said he had previously served 20 years in prison for robbery, had been out of prison for 10 years and was struggling to make ends meet. “I had a proposal for a big job, which would be my last … They told me there was a 20-carat diamond that wasn't protected … That was tempting.”

He said that, at the time, he had not known who they were robbing. “I was told it was the wife of a rapper. I didn't ask questions.”

He said: “I see her as a victim; we had nothing against her personally.”

Aomar Ait Khedache, known as “Old Omar”, 68, has also admitted participating in the heist but denies the prosecution's accusation that he was the ringleader.

Of the 12 people originally charged over the robbery, only 10 will be present at the trial after one suspect died and another – Pierre Bouianere, 80 – was declared unable to participate in proceedings for health reasons. He will be tried separately.

Most of the jewels were never recovered. At least one item was dropped by the thieves while escaping – a diamond-encrusted cross worth €30,000, which was found by a passerby as she went to work the next morning and handed to police.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Asian crime syndicates behind the multibillion-dollar cyberscam industry are expanding globally, including to South America and Africa, as raids in Southeast Asia fail to contain their activities, the UN said in a report yesterday.

Criminal networks that emerged in Southeast Asia in the past few years, opening sprawling compounds housing tens of thousands of workers, many trafficked and forced to scam victims around the world, have evolved into a sophisticated global industry, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said.

Even as Southeast Asian governments have intensified a crackdown, syndicates have moved within and beyond the region, the agency said, adding that a “potentially irreversible spillover has taken place ... leaving criminal groups free to pick, choose, and move ... as needed.”

“It spreads like a cancer,” said John Wojcik, a regional analyst for UNODC. “Authorities treat it in one area, but the roots never disappear; they simply migrate.”

Conservative estimates indicate there are hundreds of large-scale scam farms around the world generating tens of billions of dollars in annual profits, the UNODC said, calling on countries to work together and intensify efforts to disrupt the gangs' financing.

“The regional cyberfraud industry ... has outpaced other transnational crimes, given that it is easily scalable and able to reach millions of potential victims online, with no need to move or traffic illicit goods across borders,” Wojcik said.

The US alone reported more than US$5.6 billion in losses to cryptocurrency scams in 2023 — including more than US$4 million in so-called pig-butchering scams or romance scams designed to extort money from often elderly and vulnerable people.

In recent months, authorities from China, where many of the gangs originate, Thailand and Myanmar have led a crackdown on scam operations in lawless areas of the Thai-Myanmar border, with Thailand cutting power, fuel and Internet supply to areas housing scam compounds.

However, syndicates have adapted, shifting operations between “the most remote, vulnerable and underprepared parts of Southeast Asia,” especially in Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia, and beyond, exploiting jurisdictions with weak governance and high rates of corruption, the agency said.

Raids in parts of Cambodia where the industry is most visible “led to significant expansion in more remote locations,” including the country's western Koh Kong Province, as well as areas bordering Thailand and Vietnam, the agency said.

New sites also continue to be developed in Myanmar, it added, a country in the throes of an expanding conflict since the military seized power four years ago.

Spokespeople for the Cambodian government and Myanmar junta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Syndicates have expanded into South America, the agency said, seeking to enhance money laundering and underground banking partnerships with South American drug cartels.

They are increasingly establishing operations in Africa, including in Zambia, Angola and Namibia, and in eastern Europe, including Georgia, the agency said.

Gangs have also rapidly diversified their workforce, recruiting people from dozens of nationalities, it said, reflecting how the industry scams targets across the globe and has sought to evade anti-trafficking efforts.

Citizens of more than 50 countries — from Brazil to Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan — were rescued during recent crackdowns on the Thai-Myanmar border.

The international community is at a “critical inflection point,” the UNODC said, adding that failure to address the problem would have “unprecedented consequences for Southeast Asia that reverberate globally.”

CESKE BUDEJOVICE, Czech Republic

An overtime goal from Tessa Janecke on Sunday earned the US a 4-3 win over reigning champions Canada to win gold at the IIHF Women's World Championship as the latest chapter in their rivalry was decided in dramatic fashion.

With less than three minutes remaining in the first period of overtime, Janecke got to the puck ahead of goalie Ann-Renee Desbiens to score from close range before skating away and throwing her stick in the air in celebration.

“I saw a turnover and went to the net, hoping to put it in,” Janecke told TSN. “There's nothing like it... It was just so much fun.”

The rivals have faced off for gold at 23 of 24 world championships, including last year's gold-medal game, which Canada won 6-5 in overtime, along with meeting in six of seven Olympic finals.

It was the 11th title for the US who are closing in on Canada's haul of 13. They gained sweet revenge for their loss last year when they hosted the tournament, and at the Arena Ceske Budejovice they laid down a marker ahead of next year's Olympics.

“Just shows how strong we are as a group and how much we can persevere through anything. I wouldn't want to do it with any other group,” Janecke said.

After a scoreless first period, the second saw four goals in the space of 2 minutes, 16 seconds, with the US taking a 2-0 lead with goals in quick succession from Caroline Harvey and Abbey Murphy before Canada drew level.

Harvey celebrated the opening goal by miming holding a phone to her ear, after she appeared to lose a mobile phone on the ice during her side's quarter-final win over Germany.

After Taylor Heise put the US in front again, Canada recovered with Sarah Fillier equalizing with less than six minutes remaining and ultimately sending the match to sudden-death overtime.

Gwyneth Philips made some vital saves in overtime before Janecke found the winner from a Heise pass in what was the longest game in women's worlds history.

Earlier, Finland won their 15th bronze medal in the competition with a 4-3 overtime win over the Czech Republic after the hosts had led 2-0 at the end of the first period.

The tournament was a roaring success in the Czech Republic, with a total attendance of 122,331, topping the previous highest of 119,231 set in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2007.

Chen, a point guard who played her first three seasons in college for Princeton University, transferred to the University of Connecticut (UConn) for her final season, which culminated in a national championship earlier this month.
While at Princeton, Chen was named the Ivy League tournament's most outstanding player three times from 2022 to last year. 
Prior to the draft, ESPN described Chen as

The Liverpool head coach on Sunday last week said that Nunez was absent from the 2-1 victory at Anfield, having felt unwell during training the day before, although the striker sat behind the substitutes throughout the game.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Sunday proposed carrying out a prisoner swap with Venezuela, suggesting he would exchange Venezuelan deportees from the US his government has kept imprisoned for what he called “political prisoners” in Venezuela.

In a post on X, directed at Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Bukele listed off a number of family members of high-level opposition figures in Venezuela, journalists and activists detained during the South American government's electoral crackdown last year.

“The only reason they are imprisoned is for having opposed you and your electoral fraud,” he wrote to Maduro. “However, I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans who were deported, in exchange for the release and surrender of an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners you hold.”

Among those he listed were the son-in-law of former Venezuelan presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, a number of political leaders seeking asylum in the Argentine embassy in Venezuela, and what he said were 50 detained citizens from a number of different countries across the world. 

Bukele also listed the mother of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, whose house the political leader has said was surrounded by Venezuelan police in January.

Bukele said he would ask El Salvador's foreign ministry to be in contact with the Maduro government.

Venezuela's prosecutor's office responded on Sunday night, calling Bukele's statements “cynical” and referred to the Salvadoran leader as a “neofascist.”

It demanded Bukele's government provide the Venezuelan government with a list of the people detained, as well as their legal status and medical reports.

“The treatment received by Venezuelans in the United States and El Salvador, constitutes a serious violation of international human rights law and constitutes a crime against humanity,” it said in the statement.

The proposal comes as El Salvador has come under sharp international scrutiny for accepting Venezuelans and Salvadorans deported by US President Donald Trump's administration, which accused them of being alleged gang members with little evidence. 

Deportees are locked up in a “mega-prison” know as the Terrorism Confinement Center, built by the Bukele government during his crackdown on the country's gangs.

Controversy has only continued after it was revealed that a Maryland father married to a US citizen, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was deported by mistake. The US Supreme Court ordered the US government to facilitate his return, but there is no sign of that happening.

El Salvador Archbishop Jose Luis Escobar Alas on Sunday called on Bukele not “to allow our country to become a big international prison.”

Despite the controversy, Bukele maintained that all of the people he has kept in the prison were “part of part of an operation against gangs like the Tren de Aragua in the United States.”



                                                                                Young women standing idly around a park in Tokyo's west suggest that a giant statue of Godzilla is not the only attraction for a record number of foreign tourists.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Monday that he had not expected U.S. President Donald Trump to participate in the Japan-U.S. tariff negotiations held in Washington last week.

“I've never seen a [U.S.] president show up right from the start [of negotiations like that]. It was way beyond my expectations,” Ishiba said at a meeting of the House of Councillors Budget Committee on Monday morning.

Ishiba and  economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa, who traveled to the United States for the negotiations, were among those attending intensive deliberations at Monday's Budget Committee meeting. The session focused on the Trump administration's tariff measures.

“President Trump prioritizes the negotiations with Japan. A decision will be made through the president's leadership,” Ishiba said, analyzing Trump's appearance at the talks. “I think these are the two meanings behind it.”

Akazawa said, “The government will work as one to give the highest priority and our full efforts [to the ongoing talks with Washington].”

Regarding the fact that tariff negotiations with Japan are seeing the most rapid progress, Ishiba said Japan and the United States have the closest relationship economically and otherwise.

“This means the situation is conducive to building a win-win relationship for both. It can become a model case for the rest of the world,” Ishiba said. “We must discuss what we can do together for the world.”

In contrast, Ishiba also said he had “serious concerns” about the tariffs' compatibility with the Japan-U.S. Trade Agreement, and expressed his intention to continue pointing this out to Washington.

Akazawa described Wednesday's talks at the White House as “a good first step toward building trust.”

Regarding Trump's participation in the negotiations, Akazawa said: “The president is dissatisfied with the trade deficit. He expressed his candid view of the situation of the United States in the global economy.”

Akazawa said he explained to the U.S. side that Japan is the world's top investor in the United States and is creating jobs across the country. He then requested a review of a series of U.S. measures, including the tariffs introduced on automobiles, steel and aluminum.

As to high prices, particularly for food and energy, Ishiba said, “They are having a serious impact on people's lives,” indicating his intention to implement measures to address energy issues.

Regarding the abolition of the provisional portion of gasoline taxes, Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Yoji Muto stressed that he would pay close attention to discussions among the Liberal Democratic Party, Komeito and the Democratic Party for the People.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis, history's first Latin American pontiff who charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change, died Monday. He was 88.

Bells tolled in church towers across Rome after the announcement, which was read out by Cardinal Kevin Ferrell, the Vatican camerlengo, from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta, where Francis lived.

“At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church,″ Ferrell said.

Francis, who suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14, 2025, for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there, the longest hospitalization of his 12-year papacy.

But he emerged on Easter Sunday — a day before his death — to bless thousands of people in St. Peter's Square and treat them to a surprise popemobile romp through the piazza, drawing wild cheers and applause.

From his first greeting as pope — a remarkably normal “Buonasera” (“Good evening”) — to his embrace of refugees and the downtrodden, Francis signaled a very different tone for the papacy, stressing humility over hubris for a Catholic Church beset by scandal and accusations of indifference.

After that rainy night on March 13, 2013, the Argentine-born Jorge Mario Bergoglio brought a breath of fresh air into a 2,000-year-old institution that had seen its influence wane during the troubled tenure of Pope Benedict XVI, whose surprise resignation led to Francis' election.

But Francis soon invited troubles of his own, and conservatives grew increasingly upset with his progressive bent, outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics and crackdown on traditionalists. His greatest test came in 2018 when he botched a notorious case of clergy sexual abuse in Chile, and the scandal that festered under his predecessors erupted anew on his watch.

And then Francis, the crowd-loving, globe-trotting pope of the peripheries, navigated the unprecedented reality of leading a universal religion through the coronavirus pandemic from a locked-down Vatican City.

He implored the world to use COVID-19 as an opportunity to rethink the economic and political framework that he said had turned rich against poor.

“We have realized that we are on the same boat, all of us fragile and disoriented,” Francis told an empty St. Peter's Square in March 2020. But he also stressed the pandemic showed the need for “all of us to row together, each of us in need of comforting the other.”

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

Ukraine is under pressure to respond this week to a U.S. proposal on concluding the war with Russia, which includes the possibility of Washington recognizing Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and barring Ukraine from NATO, the Wall Street Journal reported on April 20, citing an obtained document.

The proposals, outlined by senior Trump administration officials in a confidential meeting with Ukrainian and European counterparts in Paris on April 17, were confirmed by Western officials to the WSJ. 

The news comes as Washington signaled readiness to drop ceasefire efforts within the coming days unless progress is achieved. 

Ukraine's feedback is expected at a follow-up meeting in London later this week. If there is alignment between Kyiv, Washington, and European allies, the proposals could be formally introduced to Moscow.

Among the most controversial elements is the suggestion that the U.S. could formally recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Additionally, Ukrainian accession to NATO would be ruled out under the current proposal. 

""NATO isn't on the table,"" said U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg in an interview with Fox News on April 20.

Ukraine has previously said it would not recognize occupied territories as Russian as part of any peace deal. The move to recognize Crimea under Russian rule also contradicts a decade-long bipartisan consensus in Washington and international law.

In 2018, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reaffirmed U.S. opposition to the annexation, calling it a threat to ""a bedrock international principle shared by democratic states: that no country can change the borders of another by force."" The U.S. Congress has also passed legislation opposing any recognition of Russia's claim over Crimea.

Ukraine has also previously rejected restrictions on joining international alliances and organizations—namely, NATO and the EU—as part of a potential peace deal. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte recently said that Kyiv's path toward membership remains ""irreversible"" but added that the matter would not be part of an eventual peace settlement.

The Ukrainian delegation in Paris included Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky, along with Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. According to the WSJ, the Trump team, including Kellogg and special envoy Steve Witkoff, should be present at the London meeting as well.

Witkoff is then expected to travel to Moscow, the WSJ reported. Officially the special envoy for the Middle East, Witkoff has led Trump's diplomatic outreach to Russia, meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin three times, most recently on April 11.

In a comment to the WSJ, a senior State Department official emphasized that the ideas were presented as ""potential options"" rather than ultimatums, though Kyiv is expected to offer a firm stance quickly.

Another proposal would involve establishing a neutral zone around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, potentially leaving it under American control.

In an earlier call with Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly suggested the idea of the U.S. acquiring Ukrainian energy assets, which he said could be the ""best protection for that infrastructure.""

While the U.S. proposals stop short of granting Russia formal legal recognition of its claimed annexation of four partially occupied eastern Ukrainian regions, they also do not call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from those areas. 


Since 2022, Moscow has illegally declared Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts as part of the Russian Federation, incorporating them into its Constitution and demanding the complete retreat of Ukrainian forces from their administrative borders.

The Trump administration has not ruled out bilateral military assistance to Ukraine or support for European nations contributing forces to a ""reassurance force,"" a potential buffer against future aggression. However, no specific security guarantees have yet been offered as part of the proposed deal.

This goes in contrast with Russian demands for a full halt of military support to Ukraine, which the Kremlin voiced as a precondition to a 30-day ceasefire suggested by the Trump administration over a month ago. While Ukraine has accepted the offer if Russia reciprocates, Moscow has not yet supported the idea. In recent weeks, Russia has intensified attacks on civilians in Ukrainian cities.

During talks with the U.S. representatives in Saudi Arabia, Kremlin officials were reportedly seeking relief from U.S. sanctions and the restoration of trade ties, efforts being led by Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev.

Zelensky's office has not publicly commented on the details of the U.S. proposal. On April 19, Ukrainian officials reaffirmed openness to a mutual 30-day ceasefire, though they accused Moscow of violating a temporary truce over the Easter holiday on April 20.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Editor's note: The article was expanded with responses from world leaders.

Pope Francis died on Easter Monday, April 21, at the age of 88, in his residence in Vatican City, the Vatican news service reported.

""At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church,"" said Cardinal Kevin Ferrell, the Vatican camerlengo.

""He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with faithfulness, courage, and universal love, especially for the poorest and most marginalized.""

The pope has struggled with numerous health problems in recent years, being hospitalized with bronchitis and pneumonia in February 2025. On Easter, he made his first prolonged public appearance after being released from the hospital in March.

Pope Francis was elected to lead the Catholic Church in 2013, following Pope Benedict XVI's abdication. Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he was the first pope from the Americas and the first Jesuit pope.

""Millions of people around the world are mourning the tragic news of Pope Francis's passing,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media.

""He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity. He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support.""

""I am saddened to hear of the passing of Pope Francis... Under his leadership, the Holy See provided important humanitarian support to Ukraine and contributed to peace efforts,"" Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in response to the news.

Also extending his condolences, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Pope Francis ""an advocate for the weak, a reconciling and a warm-hearted person.""

""My sympathies go out to the religious community worldwide,"" the German chancellor said.

""From Buenos Aires to Rome, Pope Francis wanted the Church to bring joy and hope to the poorest. To unite people with one another and with nature. May this hope be reborn endlessly beyond him,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said on X.

""To all Catholics, to a grieving world, my wife and I send our thoughts.""

""Today, the world mourns the passing of Pope Francis. He inspired millions, far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, joining other world leaders in extending her sympathies.

 

Pope Francis has often weighed in on the Russia-Ukraine war, condemning violence and urging a peaceful settlement. Some of his comments were a matter of controversy in Ukraine, as they were perceived as relativizing Russia's responsibility in the war.

During Sunday prayer on Dec. 15, 2024, Pope Francis referred to Russia and Ukraine as ""brothers,"" while reiterating calls for peace.

""They are brothers, cousins. Let them come to an understanding. War is always a defeat. Peace to the whole world,"" the pope said during a visit to the French island of Corsica.

The pontiff, who enjoyed broad popularity around the world, has advocated for a more open stance of the church on sexuality and the LGBT community, drawing rebuke from conservative church members. In turn, he has also attracted criticism from progressives, who saw his reform efforts as insufficient.

Pope Francis passed away only a day after a brief meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Vatican. The two have previously clashed over the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies.

""I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,"" Vance said.

Russian nationals in the U.S. plan to hold the Immortal Regiment March in Washington, D.C., on May 3 to mark 80 years since the end of World War II, Ukrinform reported on April 21.

This will be the first time the event has been held in the U.S. capital since the outbreak of Russia's all-out war against Ukraine in 2022.

The Immortal Regiment March is typically a mass event throughout Russia, involving processions of people carrying photos of their relatives who fought in or were killed during World War II. 

The organizers of the movement, who launched it in 2011, have since complained that Russian officials hijacked it for their political purposes.

The march is scheduled to start at 3:30 p.m. local time in Lafayette Square, near the White House, according to the brochure, which was distributed among Russian-speaking groups in the U.S. and obtained by Ukrinform.

The marchers will walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the World War II Memorial in downtown Washington, D.C.

Similar events must be authorized by municipal authorities. The organizers said they had permission, the Ukrainian news agency reported, citing undisclosed sources.

The Metropolitan Police Department's press service in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to the news agency's request for comment, Ukrinform reported.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

World and religious leaders have been reacting to the death of Pope Francis on Monday.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Pope Francis focused on ecological degradation and social injustice, and his residential schools apology in 2022 “was a crucial step” in moving the church towards meaningful reconciliation.

“His Holiness understood and taught that value in the market must never eclipse the values of society,” he said Monday morning at a campaign stop in Charlottetown, P.E.I.

“He called on us to reintegrate human values into our economic lives… So I join others in reflecting on his passing and commit myself to fulfilling his challenge,” he said.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre offered condolences to all Catholics, saying of the Pope, “His humility, compassion, and steadfast faith had a profound impact on millions of Canadians and others around the world from every faith background.”

U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that he signed an executive order to lower federal and state flags to half-staff across the country in honour of Pope Francis. 

“He was a good man, worked hard. He loved the world and it's an honour to do that,” Mr. Trump said at the White House Easter Egg Roll.

U.S. Vice-President J.D. Vance, who met the pontiff on Easter Sunday, said in a statement that he was happy to see him “though he was obviously very ill.”

“But I'll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful. May God rest his soul,” Mr. Vance added. 

French President Emmanuel Macron praised the Pope for his dedication and kindness toward the most vulnerable. “In this time of war and brutality, he had a sense for the other, for the most fragile,” Mr. Macron said. 

In Paris, Notre Dame cathedral's bells rang 88 times on Monday in tribute to the Pope's age. 

The ringing ended with a volley of bells to signal the start of a mass for Francis. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also announced that the Eiffel Tower would be switched off Monday evening to honour the Pope.

Argentines gathered in Buenos Aires for a Mass after the death of Pope Francis at age 88 on Monday.

Flags over Buckingham Palace in London and all U.K. government buildings have also been lowered to half-staff. 

“Francis's whole life and ministry was centred on Jesus who comes among us not to be served, but to serve,” said the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell who is the acting head of the Church of England. 

Obituary: Francis, the people's pope

“We saw that compellingly in Francis's service of the poor his love of neighbour, especially the displaced, migrant; the asylum seeker, his deep compassion for the well-being of the earth and his desire to lead and build the church in new ways.”

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the Pope “asked the world, once again, for the courage to change direction, to follow a path that ‘does not destroy, but cultivates, repairs, protects.' ”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Pope knew how to give hope to the suffering. “We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support. Eternal memory!”

Russian President Vladimir Putin offered his condolences as well saying the Pope was a “defender of the highest values of humanism and justice.” 

Israel's President Isaac Herzog called the Pope “a man of deep faith and boundless compassion.”

Francis “dedicated his life to uplifting the poor and calling for peace in a troubled world. I truly hope that his prayers for peace in the Middle East and for the safe return of the hostages will soon be answered,” Mr. Herzog wrote on X. 

Friedrich Merz, who will take over as Germany's new Chancellor next month, said on X that Francis “will be remembered for his tireless engagement for the weakest in society, for justice and reconciliation.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the Pope inspired millions of people “far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate.”

In a statement from Buckingham Palace, King Charles said that he and the Queen were “most deeply saddened to learn of the death of Pope Francis.”

“Our heavy hearts have been somewhat eased, however, to know that His Holiness was able to share an Easter Greeting with the Church and the world he served with such devotion throughout his life and ministry,” Charles added. 

The King added that he and the Queen will always remember their meetings with Francis including earlier this month in Rome. “His belief that care for Creation is an existential expression of faith in God resounded with so many across the world. Through his work and care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many.”

The King and Queen met the Pope for about 20 minutes during their visit to Italy two weeks ago. Their official state visit to the Vatican had been called off because of the Pope's health but a private meeting was arranged at the last minute. The royal couple celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary that day and the Pope extended his best wishes. 

In a post on X the White House showed a photograph of U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife Melania with the Pope along with another photo of Mr. Vance meeting him on Sunday. “Rest in Peace, Pope Francis,” read the caption.

Pope Francis set out to rid the modern papacy of pomp and to make it more inclusive. His informal style and simplicity alienated many conservatives but endeared him to millions of Catholics. Lucy Fielder has more.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, pictured in March at the Federal Reserve in Washington, is the latest target of U.S. president Donald Trump's ire.Jacquelyn Martin/The Associated Press

Then: Antoine Walker, Ron Mercer, Dee Brown and Chauncey Billups. Now: JD Vance, Elon Musk, Tom Homan and Peter Navarro.

They are known for the same tactics.

The first group were members of coach Rick Pitino's 1997-1998 Boston Celtics, which opened the season with a full-court press that broke with NBA conventions and left opponents unsettled. The second are members of U.S. President Donald Trump's second administration, which opened with a full-court press that is leaving his opponents unsettled.

Since he began his second term, Mr. Trump and his team have been employing a full-court press on Washington and the world in ways, and intensity, never seen before from an American president – with no established institution, durable alliance or long-term exception going unaffected.

The new administration has placed maximum pressure on Congress, the courts, institutions, trading partners, universities, immigrants, museums, arts venues, news organizations, minorities and transgender people – all at the same time. It is a remarkable show of strength across a remarkable field of targets.

On the hard court, Mr. Pitino's full-court press was exhausting with a high risk of failure. In the court of public opinion, Mr. Trump's full-court press is exhausting Americans and brings with it a high risk of failure.

It's not only the assault on conventions and institutions that is marking the opening months of the Trump administration. It's also the breadth and depth of the set of opening offensives that are setting them apart from any earlier period.

Driven by a non-government employee, Mr. Musk, powered by a promiscuous use of executive orders, and having ripple effects far beyond Washington and the broader sphere of government, these moves have the potential of changing the nature of the American presidency and American politics and culture more broadly.

As the U.S. rails against DEI, Jackie Robinson Day stands tall

The administration's offensives take more the shape of a hurricane than a tornado – sustained winds over a widening mass of territory rather than a path of destruction confined to a narrow area.

So far, the White House has challenged the sovereignty of Canada, Greenland and Panama, to the prerogatives of Congress and the courts. It has threatened the independence of the Federal Reserve Board, the nation's high-prestige universities, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the Smithsonian Institution.

In each case, Mr. Trump and his lieutenants have changed the character of the country and sowed resentment, retrenchment and re-evaluation abroad.

They've even challenged the nature and extent of tax exemptions for non-profit organizations, bringing many of the fiercest legal lions to heel. Mr. Trump's demands have prompted a US$1-billion in deals with law firms whose compositions and inclinations he opposes.

The latest incursion into established legal and institutional precedents is illustrative of the extent of the full-court press. The target: Fed chair Jerome Powell and, by extension, the once unquestioned inviolable independence of the central bank, tasked with balancing unemployment and inflation.

Established in 1913, the Fed's independence was assured because it was established by Congress, its funding decisions aren't subject to the appropriations process, its decisions can't be adjusted by the president or by lawmakers, and its chairs have assumed they cannot be removed before their terms, which don't coincide with the president, are completed.

But Mr. Trump, who appointed Mr. Powell, has grown impatient with the Fed chair, in part because he isn't cutting interest rates. Presidential frustration with Fed members is not unprecedented: president Richard Nixon, whose conferences with Fed chair Arthur Burns raised eyebrows, once urged him to discipline his colleagues. (“Just kick ‘em in the rump a little,” Mr. Nixon said in a 1971 conversation recorded on the White House tapes.)

But no president has issued a statement like Mr. Trump's description last week of Mr. Powell (a chair “who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG” and who “issued a report which was another, and typical, complete ‘mess!”).

At the same time, there is increased focus on Mr. Trump's apparent belief in the “unitary executive” theory, which provides for expanded presidential power and is the philosophical and legal basis of his resistance to court decisions.

That prompted a stunning reaction from Appeals Court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a conservative jurist appointed by president Ronald Reagan, who rebuked the administration's refusal to conform to court orders to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, deported to El Salvador, to the United States.

“The respect that courts afford the Executive must be reciprocated by the Executive's respect for the courts. Too often this has not been the case, as calls for the impeachment of judges for decisions the Executive disfavors and exhortations to disregard court decisions sadly illustrate,” the judge wrote.

Over the weekend, the Supreme Court ordered the administration to halt the deportation of a separate group of immigrants. Three in five Americans believe the President must conform to judicial rulings, according to a Wall Street Journal poll.

The ripples of change have produced ripples of fear across the country.

“We are all afraid,” Senator Lisa Murkowski, a second-generation Republican from Alaska, said at an Anchorage conference last week. “It's quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before. I'll tell you, I'm oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that's not right.”

Full-court presses often wear out the team employing them. It may have temporarily discomfited the Celtics' opponents, but the team finished with a losing record – and the coach chose to resign rather than be fired.

People attend the Auto Shanghai show in Shanghai, China, on April 19, 2021.ALY SONG/Reuters

More than 70 Chinese and international automotive brands will showcase more than 100 new or refreshed models at the Shanghai auto show this week, intensifying already cutthroat competition in the world's premier market for electric vehicles and hybrids.

Top-selling Chinese brands such as BYD and Geely are expected to take centre stage at the show from April 23 to May 2, while foreign automakers such as Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota and General Motors' Cadillac brand will also jostle for attention.

As a years-long consumer price war in China drags on, next-generation automated-driving features have become the next front in the battle for vehicle sales and profits.

But automakers' plans to tout next-generation driver-assistance systems in Shanghai have been upended by a government crackdown on marketing claims using terms such as “smart” or “autonomous” to describe their technology after a fatal crash of Xiaomi SU7 in March.

The Chinese electric sport sedan struck a cement pole and caught fire, killing three people, shortly after the driver tried to take over from the car's assisted-driving system.

The launch of the SU7 shortly before last year's Beijing auto show created a sensation, and it has since sold more than 215,000 copies, outpacing Tesla's TSLA-Q Model 3 on a monthly basis since December.

The resulting government scrutiny has Chinese automakers such as BYD and Zeekr scrambling to revise their marketing presentations, veering away from boasts about automated-driving capabilities and instead emphasizing driver caution.

Driver-assistance systems have become a critical tool for automakers to differentiate themselves in China's crowded EV market.

BYD, the nation's leading EV-and-hybrid maker, supercharged the competition in developing such systems after announcing in February it would offer its “God's Eye” driver-assistance system as free standard equipment across its lineup, including in entry-level models costing as little as about $10,000.

BYD is following the same playbook with driver-assistance technology as it took with EVs – using its vast scale to drop the cost and pressure rivals, said Bo Yu, an analyst with auto industry research firm Jato Dynamics.

Many automakers “criticize BYD for the pricing war,” she said. “BYD is taking a similar strategy with God's Eye – making everyone else uncomfortable.”

China regulators in February also prohibited car makers from installing over-the-air software updates to driver-assistance software without government approval.

That prompted Tesla to halt a limited-time free trial of its “Full Self Driving” (FSD) software in China, which despite its name is not fully autonomous. Days later, it also dropped FSD from the name, calling it “intelligent assisted driving” instead.

Tech giant Huawei, which supplies automotive software and has launched eight models in partnership with Chinese car makers, on Tuesday launched a campaign urging caution when using its assisted-driving systems.

At a livestreamed event last week for Huawei and Chery's jointly developed Luxeed brand, popular Chinese American actress Liu Yifei, a celebrity endorser of the brand, said: “While the technology provides us with good assistance, we should also pay attention to driving safety.”

At the Shanghai auto show, Geely's Zeekr EV brand plans to launch its first model equipped with so-called Level 3 driver-assistance technology, meaning it can enable hands-off driving on highways and city streets but still requires drivers to watch the road.

But its press conferences will now focus instead on showcasing hybrid models and battery technology, Zeekr said.

Chinese regulators are also tightening EV-battery standards, aiming to reduce the risks of fires and explosions.

Regulatory challenges aside, China's “new energy vehicle” sector – including fully electric models and a wide variety of gasoline-electric hybrids – continues its historic sales surge.

Electrified vehicles now account for more than half of all new-car sales in China, a far higher share than in the United States, Europe and almost all other global markets, and marking the achievement of a goal Beijing originally set for 2030.

About a dozen new models to debut in Shanghai this week are electric crossovers priced to compete directly with Tesla's Model Y, potentially adding to the U.S. EV maker's mounting challenges in China and globally. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Tesla has steadily lost market share in China, from a peak of 15 per cent in 2020 of the country's battery-electric vehicle market to 9 per cent in the first quarter and its annual sales declined globally for the first time last year.

Those declines accelerated in Europe and the United States in the first quarter amid widespread public backlash over CEO Elon Musk's polarizing politics as a top adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Tesla has skipped China auto shows since 2021 after a protest by an unhappy customer at the site. The U.S. EV pioneer releases new models or redesigned models at a much slower pace than its Chinese competitors.

Many of the Model Y competitors to debut this week offer more advanced battery-charging, assisted driving and in-car entertainment for a lower sticker price, such as Xpeng's G6 and Zeekr's E6.

Xiaomi had been expected by some analysts to unveil its hotly anticipated YU7 crossover, deemed the biggest potential threat to the Model Y but it will instead only show its current SU7 and SU7 Ultra models at the show and has no plans to hold a news conference. It did not give a reason and did not respond to a request for comment.

Independent automotive analyst Lei Xing, who has followed the rise of China's auto industry for two decades, called those and other formidable new Chinese electric crossovers “Model Y killers.”

“It's a tsunami of pressure” on Tesla's best-selling model, he said. “It's not going to be just one vehicle that beats the Model Y – it's 12 or 13.”

Klaus Schwab has led the WEF — the organization behind the prestigious Davos conference — for over 50 years. But Schwab's life work has also been criticized as a symbol of the elites' detachment from ordinary people.

The founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Klaus Schwab, resigned on Monday as chairman of the forum's board.

""Following my recent announcement, and as I enter my 88th year, I have decided to step down from the position of Chair and as a member of the Board of Trustees, with immediate effect,"" he said in a statement released by the WEF.

The German-born economist did not offer a reason for leaving the Geneva-based WEF, which organizes annual meeting of the international political and economic elite in the Swiss luxury ski resort of Davos.

Vice Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe will serve as interim chairman, with the search for a new chair having begun after Schwab's resignation was accepted at an extraordinary meeting on April 20. 

Schwab established the WEF in 1971 with the aim of creating a forum for policymakers and top corporate executives to tackle major global issues. The first conference was also held in Davos that year, with hundreds attending, including businesspeople, academics and politicians.

Over the decades, however, the WEF and the annual summit started drawing criticism from opponents on both left and right as being too elitist and detached from lives of ordinary people. Schwab himself was targeted by various conspiracy theorists in recent years. One viral controversy links him to the ""You'll own nothing. And you'll be happy"" quote which was published by the WEF in a 2016 video clip.

The video speculates on the ways the world could change by 2030. Schwab has never said or wrote the words shown on screen, which are actually based on an essay by Danish politician Ida Aukens about possible futures ""for better and for worse."" However, many have interpreted the video as proof of the WEF working to create a dystopian future without private ownership.

Two Turkish nationals, a man and his son-in-law, were killed in a town north of Frankfurt. Police believe a ""personal motive"" likely played in a role in the crime.

German police on Easter Sunday were still searching for the shooter or shooters responsible for the double killing in the western town of Bad Nauheim a day before.

The suspect shot and killed two people at a residential address in the town on Saturday evening. Bad Nauheim lies about 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) north of Germany's financial capital, Frankfurt.

German police said a 59-year-old man and his 28-year-old son-in-law were killed in the shooting. Both victims were Turkish nationals. 

The victims were not previously known to the police.  

Police said they couldn't rule out whether more than one suspect could be involved in the killing.

In addition to police, German special forces or SEK have been involved in the response to the crime, with a helicopter also assisting in the manhunt.

German mass-circulation daily Bild reported that the SEK arrested two men in the nearby town of Nidderau-Erbstadt after the shooting, but the authorities later released them because it turned out they had nothing to do with the crime. 

German authorities reckon a ""personal motive"" played a role in the killing. Police have said that they believe the public is not in danger after the shooting. 

At the same time, local German news outlet Hessenschau reported that local residents were asked to not pick up hitchhikers in the area. 

The local government in Bad Nauheim posted its condolences online on Sunday, saying ""our thoughts are with the victims and our families.""

""Despite the impact of the tragic act on our holiday today, let us remember that Easter is a powerful symbol of hope and renewal,"" the post read. ""Let's take the opportunity to remember the power of new beginnings, especially in challenging times.""

			William Burck and Robert Hur accuse the president of trying to ‘invade university freedoms'

That America's oldest and most prestigious university would retain high calibre legal counsel in its confrontation with the Trump administration came as a surprise to nobody.

But the two individuals who agreed to spearhead its fight, after losing $2.3 billion in federal funding, have raised some eyebrows.

The lawyers – who signed and co-wrote the punchy legal response informing the president the university would not be complying with his demands – are William Burck and Robert Hur – both of whom are well known, and connected in Republican circles.

The administration had put pressure on Harvard to change its hiring, admissions and other internal procedures, which would include reporting foreign students accused of conduct violations.

On Monday, after Mr Hur and Mr Burck issued their response accusing the US president of trying to “invade university freedoms”, Mr Trump suspended federal funds before threatening to revoke the institution's tax-exempt status.

Mr Hur was appointed by Mr Trump himself to serve as United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, while Mr Burck worked under George W Bush and gave legal advice to several of Mr Trump's closest allies in the Russia-gate scandal.

The son of South Korean immigrants, Mr Hur was born in New York City and went on to study at Harvard, before reading for a masters degree in philosophy at King's College, Cambridge.

He earned his law degree at Stanford, and is currently in private practice at international firm King and Spalding, where he is a partner in its “special matters and government investigations” practice.

After leaving law school, Mr Hur spent a year as clerk to Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the US Supreme Court, before joining the justice department on and off for the next two decades.

In 2017, he was appointed by Mr Trump to serve as Maryland's District Attorney.

In 2023, Merrick Garland, the Attorney General at the time, tasked Mr Hur with the job of overseeing the department's investigation of classified documents that Joe Biden had been found to have at his Delaware home.

The probe took place at the same time that Mr Trump was investigated for allegedly wrongly possessing classified documents stored at his Mar-a-Lago estate.

Mr Hur eventually decided not to bring charges against Mr Biden, but the reasons he gave for not doing so reverberated across the nation, where concerns about the president's well-being were growing

“We have also considered that, at trial, Mr Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” Mr Hur wrote in his Feb 2024 report.

“Based on our direct interactions with and observations of him, he is someone for whom many jurors will want to identify reasonable doubt. It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him by then a former president well into his eighties of a serious felony that requires a mental state of wilfulness.”

Mr Biden and other Democrats denounced Mr Hur's language.

In particular, he rejected a suggestion he could not remember the date that his son Beau had died.

“How in the hell dare he raise that,” Mr Biden told reporters in a hastily called press conference at the White House.

“Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn't any of their damn business.”

Mr Trump also denounced the decision, saying at the time: “It was just announced that Joe Biden's department of injustice will bring zero charges against crooked Joe despite the fact he wilfully retained undisclosed droves of ultra-classified national security documents.

“If he's not going to be charged, that's up to them, but then I should not be charged.”

At the time, Mr Hur was urged by Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell to pledge not to accept any future roles offered by Mr Trump if he became president for a second time.

“I'm not here to speak about what may or may not happen in the future,” was Mr Hur's response.

Mr Burck earned a bachelor's degree in political science and government at Yale, going on to postgraduate study in the same subject at Harvard, according to his LinkedIn profile.

He studied law at Yale.

The lawyer, once described by The New York Times as the modern day “Washington super-lawyer”, now works in a private practice, at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan – before that he was a federal prosecutor, whose cases included that of Martha Stewart.

The TV personality was investigated for alleged insider trading. In 2004, Stewart was sentenced to five months in jail after being found guilty of conspiracy and obstruction of justice.

Mr Burck then spent several years in the Bush administration, initially as the deputy counsel, then as special counsel, and eventually as White House deputy staff secretary.

He was given the job of representing Mr Bush in his dealings with the National Archives and Records Administration.

As a lawyer Mr Burck has provided legal advice to a range of people, including Steve Bannon, who was Mr Trump's first campaign manager, as well as Don McGahn, the ex-White House counsel, and Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, as an investigation proceeded into alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia.

None of the men were ever charged.

Mr Bannon was later jailed for four months for failing to comply with subpoenas surrounding the House of Representatives Jan 6 insurrection investigation.

In addition to being a Fox Corporation board member, in January, Mr Burck was appointed as an outside ethics adviser, tasked by the Trump organisation with vetting deals that could pose conflicts with public policy.

He also represented New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft against accusations that he paid for massage parlour sex, in a case that saw the matter dismissed.

Most recently Mr Burck represented Eric Adams, the New York City mayor, who had been charged with corruption.

The case was later dropped following demands from Mr Trump.

The mayor had agreed to help the president in an effort to crack down on illegal immigrants in the city.

The clash between Mr Trump and Harvard began on Friday, when the administration sent a list of demands to the university to institute a series of reforms or risk losing federal funding.

Those changes included abolishing its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes, reporting foreign students who were accused of breaching its code of conduct, and rejecting applicants who are “hostile” to “American values”.

Alan Garber, the university's president, accused the government of trampling over its First Amendment rights and attempting to “control the Harvard community”.

In a separate letter to government lawyers, Mr Hur and Mr Burck said the administration was trampling over Harvard's free speech rights and acting well beyond its legal authority.

Mr Trump suspended more than $2 billion in federal funding – something critics have said is illegal – and later mulled on social media: “Perhaps Harvard should lose its tax exempt status and be taxed as a political entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting “sickness?”

In his final public message, Pope Francis decried the “terrible conflict” in Gaza.

The Vatican announced Monday that Pope Francis has died at the age of 88, hours after he appeared at an Easter mass and appealed for an end to Israel's war on the Gaza Strip.

The pope's Easter address, read aloud by Archbishop Diego Ravelli, decried the “terrible conflict” in Gaza that “continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.”

“I appeal to the warring parties: call a cease-fire, release the hostages, and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace!” said the message from the pope, an outspoken opponent of military conflict and war profiteers, climate destruction, and runaway economic inequality.

“In the face of the cruelty of conflicts that involve defenceless civilians and attack schools, hospitals, and humanitarian workers, we cannot allow ourselves to forget that it is not targets that are struck, but persons, each possessed of a soul and human dignity,” the pope's address continued.

News of Pope Francis' death came after a bout with double pneumonia left him hospitalized for more than a month. The Vatican did not specify a cause of death in its announcement.

The Nation's John Nichols wrote Sunday that Pope Francis' calls for peace have made him “arguably the most consistent high-profile defender of the humanity of the Palestinian people during a period when the Israeli assault on Gaza has been pursued with relentless violence.”

Nichols continued:

With a boldness and specificity that has often sparked controversy, this pope has challenged economic injustice, racism, environmental neglect, militarism, and the abuses of new technologies that increase inequality. He has faced his share of criticism, not just from conservatives who disapprove of his views but also from reformers who sincerely wish that he would do more to modernize the church. Yet, in a time of too much indifference and impunity, this pope has remained uniquely engaged with the embattled regions that political and media elites neglect or abandon.

That's been especially true when it comes to Gaza, where Pope Francis has long argued for cease-fires, arms blockades, aid convoys, and a diplomatic urgency that recognizes that Palestinians and Israelis are “fraternal peoples [who] have the right to live in peace.”

In a tribute to Pope Francis, Palestinian theologian Munther Isaac wrote Monday that “he conveyed true compassion to Palestinians, most notably to those in Gaza during this genocide.”

“The pope left our world today, and the occupation and the wall remained. Even worse, he left our world while a genocide continues to unfold,” Isaac wrote, pointing to the pontiff's call for a thorough international investigation of Israel's assault on Gaza.

“Today I wonder: Will the millions who will mourn his death these coming days respect this wish of his?” Isaac asked. “Will they care for Gazans and Palestinians the way he did?”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Disability rights advocates are filing lawsuits as students, teachers and parents organize to protect education.

Disability rights advocates are filing lawsuits as students, teachers and parents organize to protect education.

If the Trump administration and the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) have their way, the basic educational and human rights of students with disabilities will soon be eviscerated. Due to the planned demolition of the Department of Education, the rights of students with disabilities to “a free, appropriate public education” — guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) — are under fire.

For nearly 50 years, the Department of Education (DOE) has been responsible for distributing funds — $14.2 billion in fiscal year 2025 — to state and local school districts to enable them to educate students with a range of disabilities. Among other things, this money goes toward training teachers, service providers, and other staff in best practices for both special and general education classrooms. It also goes toward coordinating research and record keeping; providing technical assistance; and doing outreach to parents and caregivers to make sure they know their rights. The Trump administration is attacking all of these functions with its plan to dismantle the Department of Education.



Moreover, the 12 regional sites of DOE's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) are also being threatened with closure (seven have already been shuttered). These offices have worked to investigate allegations of discrimination or abuse made by students and their families, including the still-common practice of isolating or restraining students in special ed programs. In fiscal year 2024, OCR received 22,687 complaints, all of which were meant to be investigated.

This oversight function apparently rankles the right wing, and groups like the Heritage Foundation claim OCR's work is an unnecessary expansion of “special rights.” In fact, 17 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and West Virginia) are currently suing the U.S. government, asking that it declare Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 unconstitutional.

Section 504 prohibits institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating against or excluding people with disabilities from programs or services. Then there's IDEA, which is also squarely in the right's crosshairs, since it guarantees every child access to public schooling.

More than 7.5 million K-12th graders — 15 percent of all U.S. students — receive services through IDEA. Each has an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that guides their schooling and stipulates the services they are legally entitled to receive, among them one-on-one or small group tutoring; speech, occupational, or physical therapy; and/or mental health counseling. An additional 1.5 million kids who do not have, or need, an IEP get accommodations through Section 504. For example, students with diabetes may be given permission to eat in class despite a general rule against doing so.

Education advocates and disability justice activists see this as common sense — right-wingers do not. Their educational wish list, delineated in Project 2025, includes overhauling special ed — and not in students' favor. They also want to freeze OCR, move DOE functions to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and return the bulk of education authority to the states. Already, 1,300 OCR staff have been fired, and on March 20, Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the secretary of education to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of the DOE.

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), has been a vocal critic of the plan since it was announced. “The DOE and the laws it is supposed to execute have one major purpose: to level the playing field and fill opportunity gaps to help every child in America succeed,” she told Truthout by email. “Trying to abolish it and its Office for Civil Rights sends a message that the president doesn't care about opportunity for all kids.” She calls granting authority to the states “a grave mistake” and pledges that the AFT will “fight them tooth and nail.”

So will many others. A letter to Congress, signed by 15 disability rights groups, made clear that removing federal oversight of critical civil rights laws like IDEA “leaves students vulnerable to the variation in state implementation and threatens to bring us back to a time when many students with disabilities were denied an education.”

Denise Marshall is CEO of the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates (COPAA), an organizational signatory of the letter. Marshall told Truthout that COPAA and the National Center for Youth Law have filed a federal lawsuit to restore OCR's investigative functions. (Another pending lawsuit, filed by the National Education Association, aims to stop the closure of the DOE and asks for the reinstatement of all fired staff.)

“OCR has investigated a lot of egregious situations for kids who've been restrained, isolated or forced out of school,” Marshall said. “This administration does not hide its hostility to people of color, people with gender identities that it doesn't like, and the disabled. In many cases, people who'd filed complaints with OCR have discovered that investigations have been halted. It's why we filed a lawsuit. OCR had been investigating cases and holding districts accountable.”

Marshall also talked about another potential loss should DOGE and Trump succeed in their efforts. “Congress has spent years working to align disability, education and civil rights laws to support the educational success of all students, but particularly students with disabilities,” she said. “The right seems to be of the mindset that protections like IDEA, Section 504, even the Americans with Disabilities Act, are too expensive and are unfair to everyone else. We loudly disagree.”

Soyoung Park, author of (Re)Imaging Inclusion for Children of Color With Disabilities and director of online programs in early childhood and childhood special education at the Bank Street College of Education, concurs. “The whole reason for IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act was to ensure inclusion and the maintenance of rights,” she told Truthout. “Putting educational functions into HHS perpetuates a medical model and may contribute to increasing the segregation and isolation of people with disabilities. To consider the education of children with a disability only a health issue, rather than an equity issue, is wrong.”

Furthermore, Park is concerned that a move to HHS will limit research and data gathering, especially when it comes to racial inequities. “We know that Black and Brown students in special education experience disproportionate punishments. Stopping the DOE from gathering statistics about this and stopping research to identify best practices will be detrimental to children and their families and teachers,” she said.

Stephanie Flynt McEben, public policy analyst at the National Disability Rights Network, agrees and told Truthout that, in addition, she is afraid that moving DOE to HHS will perpetuate low expectations for children with disabilities. Instead, she says that she and her organization favor a “social model” that “focuses on each individual and works to ensure that they can contribute and compete with their nondisabled peers.” She also fears that returning education to the states will mean vast disparities in what's offered. “Already half of the OCR staff have been laid off, so we're already seeing a backlog of complaints build up,” Flynt McEben said. “The reason DOE was created in the first place was because states could not do what was needed to support students with disabilities, and the government recognized that federal oversight was necessary.”

This potential lack of oversight terrifies parent William Fertman, whose 7-year-old son attends the California School for the Deaf (CSD), a state-funded program in Fremont. “Once the DOE is gone, there may be no one to oversee the disbursement of funds for a school like CSD,” he told Truthout. “Before DOGE and this administration, if we had complaints or concerns, we could go to the OCR to make sure the money was going to the appropriate places and services were being delivered. I see what's being done as incredibly disruptive and dangerous. I fear that it will allow states to pass legislation that violates or undermines IDEA, and there will be no one at the federal level to stop it from happening.”

As for his son, Fertman says that because the school uses American Sign Language for classroom instruction and also teaches students to read and write in English, his son “has full access to everything. He's not the Deaf kid with an interpreter, or the kid who gets pulled out of class a few times a week for services.”

Fertman then addressed the broader issues facing education. “If the right succeeds, the money that is supposed to come to California for special education services could be disrupted. Kids with all kinds of disabilities deserve equal access to schooling, but they could be thrown into the darkness and left there because there will be no money for the state to disburse.”

Heather Dailey, a parent of a son who has autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has similar concerns. Her son is now in a mainstream 7th-grade class but meets in a small group with a tutor for five 30-minute sessions each week. Like Fertman, she is worried about money.

“There have always been funding difficulties for special education,” she told Truthout. “If the funding stream changes, federal cuts will mean less money coming in, and more competition for scarce resources. I worry that the idea that children with disabilities can't learn and are a waste of resources will again get traction and will impact how people look at the disabled. Hateful rhetoric can impact policy and the way IDEA is implemented and overseen.”

“We live in a country with high income inequality,” parent Jessica Hardin added. “My daughter is 4, in pre-K. She gets speech, occupational, physical and music therapies in school. These are services my husband and I could not pay for out of pocket. Government support makes it possible for my daughter to have some semblance of an independent child's life, but I'm living with the devastating fear that this could all go away. If it does, we don't know what we'll do.” Hardin said that her daughter, who does not speak or use the bathroom independently, has to be supervised at all times. “She can be a danger to herself,” she explains, “so we need extra support to maintain our careers and also take care of our 9-year-old son. My daughter is making slow, steady progress, but while she needs special care, she is also really sweet and funny.”

Parent Jennifer Bukowski feels similarly. Her son has autism and Type 1 diabetes and relies on a one-on-one mentor in his 8th-grade classroom. “My son would be lost without his paraprofessional,” she told Truthout. “My son gets distracted easily and needs to be redirected back to the subject. He's come a very long way, but he doesn't have friends and needs to learn social skills. People don't realize this about special ed. It's not just about academics. The behavioral part is as important as math, science, history and English. In the long run, if my son gets what he needs to be independent and find a job, he'll be contributing to the community. Shouldn't everyone want this for every person with a disability who is able to work?”

All agree that early intervention matters. Tricia, who asked that her surname not be used, is the mother of two neurodivergent children, a 19-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter. Now living in New Hampshire, she said that her son, who excelled in school despite clear signs that he was struggling socially, did not get diagnosed until late middle school, by which point he was experiencing severe anxiety and depression. “He went into such autistic burnout that my goal became keeping him alive,” she said. He is now attending Landmark College, a private program for students with learning disabilities, ADHD and autism. Tricia said that while he is now doing well, the late diagnosis complicated his progress. Her daughter's experience was different. “My daughter has a language-based learning disability that was discovered when she was 7. After getting her services at a specialized private school that the district paid for, she's done well socially and academically.”

Still, like other parents interviewed, Tricia is enraged by what's happening in Washington. “The Trump administration seems to want people to be less educated. Maybe he thinks that this will lead to less pushback. The administration also seems to want to shove disability into a closet again. They see the disability justice movement as ‘wokeness' and they want the power to extinguish it.”

Nonetheless, despite being heartened by the resistance she's seen – in the courts, in the streets and in public gatherings — Tricia, like many others across the country, remains scared about what the future holds for herself and her family.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Four more senators have since traveled to El Salvador to continue pressuring for Abrego García's release.

We speak with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, just back from El Salvador, where he met Kilmar Abrego García, the Maryland father whom the Trump administration says they forcibly transferred to an El Salvador mega-prison last month by “administrative error.” “We will keep fighting for his constitutional rights, because if we deny the constitutional rights for one person, we threaten them for everybody,” says Van Hollen. Four more Democratic lawmakers, including Congressmembers Maxwell Alejandro Frost of Florida and Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, have since traveled to El Salvador to continue pressuring for Abrego García's release.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: In a moment, we're going to talk about the life and legacy of Pope Francis, but we begin today's show with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, who's just returned from a trip to El Salvador, where he met last week with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland father whom the Trump administration says they forcibly transferred to an El Salvador notorious mega-prison last month by mistake. Van Hollen shared a photo of the two seated together at a table in what appears to be a hotel restaurant. Senator Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last Wednesday in a push for Abrego Garcia's release but had initially been barred from having any contact with him. Abrego Garcia's wife Jennifer celebrated the meeting, saying in a statement, “My children and my prayers have been answered.”

Abrego Garcia lived in Maryland for almost 15 years after fleeing gang violence in El Salvador. He's a sheet metal worker.

Following Van Hollen's trip, four Democratic lawmakers, including Congressmembers Maxwell Frost of Florida, Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, have arrived in El Salvador, where they intend to continue pressuring for Abrego Garcia's release.

For more, we are joined by Senator Chris Van Hollen.

Senator Van Hollen, welcome back to Democracy Now! The huge news of the day is the pope has died. Two of his major issues — once again, just yesterday, Easter Sunday, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza — you went to the border there, deeply concerned about Israel's assault on Gaza — and his deep concern for migrants. You just came back from El Salvador, where you met with Abrego Garcia. Why don't we start there? What exactly happened?

SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, Amy, I'm glad you mentioned the pope. We're all going to miss him. He was a pope for all of humanity, and Pope Francis was a beautiful soul.

So, when I met with Abrego Garcia, my main purpose was to let him know that his wife and his kids loved him and that they were fighting for his return, and to let him know that his sheet metal workers' union and millions of people in the United States who believe in the Constitution of the United States were fighting for his return and for due process.

He spoke about the conditions that he had experienced, the trauma of having been abducted off the streets of Maryland, trying to make a phone call from the Baltimore detention center — it was from Baltimore — without being allowed to do that, and, of course, then ending up first in the notorious CECOT prison. So, it was — it was, of course, emotional to hear about the trauma he experienced.

I told him we were going to keep fighting for him. I met with the vice president of El Salvador and said, “You really should not be complicit in this Trump administration illegal scheme.” And so, we will keep fighting for his constitutional rights, because if we deny the constitutional rights for one person, we threaten them for everybody.

AMY GOODMAN: So, can you tell us exactly what Kilmar said as you met at the hotel? And how is it that you got it totally turned around? First, you were met by what? El Salvadoran soldiers? You were told you can't to meet with him. And then, just before you left, they brought him out?

SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, first, I met with the vice president, and I asked if I could meet with Abrego Garcia. He said no. I said, “If I come back next week, can I meet with Abrego Garcia?” He said no. I asked if I could call Abrego Garcia. He said no. And so, the next day, I tried to visit CECOT, which is this notorious prison, and was stopped by soldiers three kilometers short of the prison, and they told me they had been ordered not to allow me to proceed.

I had a number of press conferences in El Salvador with a lot of local press, and I called out this sort of horror of this person having been abducted and denied his constitutional rights, and made the point that El Salvador is violating international law, because international law requires that someone like Abrego Garcia be able to make contact with family, with their lawyers, with others. And so, as I was really preparing to leave on Thursday night, we got a call saying that they had relented and that I could sit down with him.

And in my conversation, which lasted probably over 40 minutes, we covered a lot of things, from his abduction to the conditions he was experiencing and many other things. So it's hard to sort of capture all of that, but the bottom line was he had been traumatized by what happened. He said it was his family, thinking of his family, that gave him the strength to go on. And I think the fact that he had learned for the first time that people in America were fighting for his constitutional rights also gave him additional strength.

AMY GOODMAN: I want you to explain how much money Bukele is getting, this country of El Salvador is getting, for imprisoning hundreds of men. We don't know what their crime is, if there's any crime at all. But Bukele said on social media about your meeting, “Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.” He also wrote, “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps' & ‘torture'” — obviously mocking — he goes on to say, “now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!” You have called this margarita-gate. Can you explain what happened and Bukele's, to say the least, cynical remark?

SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, sure. This was — it shows how far Bukele and Trump will go to deceive people and try to change the story, because what happened was this. When I first sat down with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, if you look at the original — the first photos, you'll see a glass of water and a cup of coffee. As we were speaking, the government folks, Bukele's folks, ordered the waiters to bring these two glasses that were filled with liquid, looked like margaritas, because they had either salt or sugar or something around the rim. We, of course, did not order them. They brought them to the table. If you looked at the one in Kilmar's glass, the liquid was actually lower than mine to try to create the appearance that he actually drank it. All of this is a deception. As I pointed out, if you were really Sherlock Holmes, you would see that the sugar or salt or whatever it was around the rim, that there was no gap in it, so, obviously, no one had had a sip.

But this goes to the big lie being told by Bukele and Trump and others to try to create the impression that this person, who was in one of the most notorious prisons in El Salvador and now is still very much in detention and in a news blackout, is somehow being treated fairly. So, these are the lengths they will go, Amy, to try to create this deception, this illusion. They actually wanted to have the meeting by the pool of the hotel. We negotiated away from that. But it was pretty clear what their plan for deception was. And, you know, I think they really bungled it, because they did it in such a blatant way that I'm telling you what happened, and we're calling it out, and what it demonstrates is what a big lie they will tell.

AMY GOODMAN: I know you have to go. Fifteen seconds. How do you see Kilmar coming home? What is your demand? And why is this so important to you, Senator?

SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, two things. Number one, when you have the Trump administration flagrantly violating court orders, I do think at some point the court is going to have to find the Trump administration lawyers in contempt and sanction them, number one.

Number two, we need to keep pressure on El Salvador. I'm going to be talking later today to some officials in the state of Maryland. You know, El Salvador has seen more American tourists going there. My view is that American tourists should not be visiting El Salvador when they're participating in this illegal scheme with the Trump administration. State pension funds can look to see whether they want to divest from any companies doing business in El Salvador. So there are ways to put pressure on El Salvador here.

And the reason this is all so very important is because when you deny constitutional rights to one person, you are threatening them for every single one of us. That's why this case is so important. If the Trump administration gets away with violating his constitutional rights and violating constitutional orders — I mean, court orders, you know, we are already in a constitutional crisis, but it's getting worse by the day.

AMY GOODMAN: Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, thanks so much for being with us. Democratic senator has returned from El Salvador after meeting last week with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland father who was sent to the notorious CECOT mega-prison last month by what the Trump Homeland Security Department admitted was an administrative error. The lawyer who admitted this in court from the DOJ has been fired.

When we come back, the pope has died. Yesterday, on Easter Sunday, he once again called for a ceasefire in Gaza, was a fierce pro-immigrant voice. We'll look at his life and legacy. Stay with us.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theepochtimes.com","Hegseth Responds After Report Says He Shared Attack Plans in Second Signal Chat","https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pentagon-responds-after-report-says-hegseth-shared-attack-plans-in-second-signal-chat-5844970","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:03:30 GMT","

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on April 21 responded to a report that he shared plans for an attack in Yemen in a chat that included his wife and brother.

“What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax,” Hegseth told reporters at the White House in Washington.

“This is what the media does. They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations. Not going to work with me. Because we're changing the Defense Department, putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters, and anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news don't matter. So I'm happy to be here at the Easter Egg Roll with my dad and my kids.”

Citing anonymous sources, The New York Times reported on Sunday that Hegseth in March shared details of forthcoming strikes in Yemen to a second Signal group. Hegseth's wife, Jennifer Hegseth, was in the chat, as were Hegseth's brother and Hegseth's lawyer, both of whom work for the Pentagon, according to the report.

The attack plans were said to be similar to those shared in a chat that included Cabinet members and whose existence was disclosed by the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic after administration officials said he was mistakenly added to the chat.

Parnell said that the NY Times was “enthusiastically taking the grievances of disgruntled former employees as the sole sources for their article” and that the paper “relied only on the words of people who were fired this week and appear to have a motive to sabotage the Secretary and the President's agenda.”

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said in a statement to news outlets: “No matter how many times the legacy media tries to resurrect the same non-story, they can't change the fact that no classified information was shared. Recently-fired ‘leakers' are continuing to misrepresent the truth to soothe their shattered egos and undermine the President's agenda, but the administration will continue to hold them accountable.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News that President Donald Trump “stands strongly behind Secretary Hegseth, who is doing a phenomenal job leading the Pentagon.”

Three Department of Defense officials who had been placed on leave as part of an investigation into unauthorized disclosures indicated on Friday that they were no longer with the Pentagon.

A Pentagon official told The Epoch Times in an email, “At this time, no final senior staffing changes have been decided, and the Secretary will make any future announcements on his own timetable.”

Some Democrats on Sunday called for Hegseth's resignation or termination after the report that a second Signal chat was published.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theepochtimes.com","Bipartisan Lawmakers Renew Effort to Ban Stock Trading by Members of Congress","https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/bipartisan-lawmakers-renew-effort-to-ban-stock-trading-by-members-of-congress-5844221","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 09:05:46 GMT","

WASHINGTON—An issue in Congress is once again bringing together progressive House Democrats and Freedom Caucus-aligned House Republicans in support of new legislation.

The issue? The trading of stocks by members of Congress. In recent years, several senators and representatives have been the subject of critical reports regarding stock trades they've personally undertaken, yielding handsome profits shortly before market-sensitive news.

Insider trading by members of Congress and their staff is already prohibited, and they are required to report any stock purchase to congressional authorities within 45 days of the transaction, per the Ethics in Government Act. Still, members routinely have access to sensitive and even classified information that could indirectly influence markets, which some lawmakers say gives them the ability to unfairly profit from their government service.

Several dozen members of the House have co-sponsored the “Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust (TRUST) in Congress Act,” which would ban members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from stock trading in its entirety. The legislation has the largest number of co-sponsors among several bills that have been introduced for this purpose.

The TRUST in Congress Act would require members of Congress to place their stock holdings into a blind trust for the duration of their elected service. The bill does not specify any penalties for non-compliance.

Efforts to ban stock trading by members have been repeatedly attempted in multiple Congresses, though none have ever received a final vote in either the Senate or House of Representatives. In both chambers, the party leadership effectively controls the placement of bills on the floor and can prevent legislation from being considered.

In the Senate, a previous effort to ban stock trading by members of Congress was led by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who introduced a bill with Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) during the 118th Congress, though it was never passed by the full body.

The bill has not been reintroduced in the 119th Congress.

Even as polling shows that many voters favor such bans, there is opposition in Congress. Hawley's legislation, when considered at the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in July 2024, received ‘Nay' votes from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.). None have released a public statement about their vote against the bill.

Other branches of government have ethics rules requiring divestment of assets or the creation of blind trusts to prevent conflicts of interest. Supreme Court justices and other federal judges are permitted to hold individual stocks but are required to recuse themselves from cases involving those companies.

In the executive branch, officers may also hold stock but cannot work on issues involving those companies, with criminal penalties for non-compliance. Only the president and vice president are exempt from such conflicts.

The offices of Hawley and Pelosi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

            After months without a meteor shower, sky-gazers now have a reason to keep their chins up — the Lyrids are here to kick off the season.
    


            The Lyrids have graced the sky since April 17 and will hang around until Saturday, with the densest concentration of meteors flying by Monday night into Tuesday, according to the American Meteor Society. In a perfectly dark sky, onlookers can typically spot up to 18 meteors per hour during the Lyrid shower's peak. This year, however, light from the waning crescent moon will make it somewhat harder to see the celestial show.
    


            Still, local weather conditions allowing, careful observers in the Northern Hemisphere can expect around five streaking lights per hour appearing between 10 p.m. local time Monday and 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, said Dr. Bill Cooke, lead for NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office.
    


            “Most meteors you see (during a Lyrid shower) are not brilliant fireballs — they are faint little streaks — and the more moonlight there is, it tends to wash out those faint little streaks,” Cooke said. “Meteor observing is one of those things where you're going to take your time.”
    


            For the optimal viewing experience, Cooke recommends lying down somewhere outside with minimal light pollution and giving your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness.
    


            “The other important thing is: Don't look at your cell phone, because that bright screen destroys your night vision,” Cooke said. “And it takes your eyes off the sky.”

            Regular meteor showers occur throughout the year as the Earth passes through a field of debris left by comets and asteroids, said Shannon Schmoll, director of Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.
    


            The Lyrids originate from the parent comet C/1861 G1 (Thatcher), which is about halfway through its roughly 415-year orbit around the sun. While Comet Thatcher was discovered in 1861, the Lyrids have been observed for 2,700 years, making them one of the oldest known meteor showers, according to NASA.
    


            The best time to view the Lyrids is when Lyra, the Northern Hemisphere constellation from which the meteors appear to radiate, is above the horizon, according to EarthSky.
    


            As the comet travels, it leaves a trail of ice and dust moving thousands of miles per hour in its wake, astronomer Dean Regas said.
    


            “The meteors hit the (Earth's) atmosphere and slow down, and that transmits heat. That's the flash you see,” Regas said. “Most of the material from meter showers, the comet pieces, will burn up before they hit the ground, and a lot of them are about the size of a grain of sand. So it's really impressive to see something so small light up like that.”

            While the Lyrids tend to be relatively predictable each year, occasionally they exceed expectations.
    


            Outbursts of 100 meteors per hour occur unpredictably, averaging about every 60 years. The next outburst is expected around 2042, according to the American Meteor Society. It is not entirely known what causes these outbursts, but other planets and objects are thought to affect the density of the debris as they cross paths, Schmoll said.
    


            If you miss the peak of the Lyrid shower, there's still a chance to catch some shooting stars this year.
    


            Here are peak dates for upcoming meteor showers in 2025, according to the American Meteor Society and EarthSky.

            Following the recent pink moon event, there are eight more full moons to look out for this year, with supermoons occurring in October, November and December.
    


            Here's the list of full moons remaining in 2025, according to the Farmers' Almanac:
    


            ●       May 12: Flower moon
    


            ●       June 11: Strawberry moon

            In the lead-up to the fall season, two eclipse events will grace the sky.
    


            A total lunar eclipse will be most visible from Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, parts of eastern South America, Alaska and Antarctica on September 7 and 8. A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when Earth is between the sun and moon and the three celestial objects line up in a row so that the moon passes into our planet's shadow.

            When the moon is within the darkest part of Earth's shadow, called the umbra, it takes on a reddish hue, which has led to the nickname “blood moon” for a lunar eclipse, according to NASA. That shadow isn't perfect, so sunbeams sneak around the shadow's edges, bathing the moon in warm hues.
    


            A partial solar eclipse will occur on September 21 as the moon moves between the sun and Earth but the celestial bodies aren't perfectly aligned, according to NASA. In this type of event, the moon only blocks part of the sun's face, creating a crescent shape in which it appears the moon is taking a “bite” out of the sun. This event will be visible to parts of Australia, Antarctica and the Pacific Ocean.

Follow:


            A new report on cancer in the US shows a steady decline in overall deaths from 2001 through 2022. The rate of diagnoses among men fell from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021 but these incidence rates among women increased slightly every year between 2003 and 2021.
    


            Those trends were interrupted in 2020, when cancer incidence rates fell significantly, the report shows, possibly because of disruptions in medical care related to the Covid-19 pandemic. After 2020, they returned to expected levels. “Because fewer cancers were diagnosed in 2020, especially through screening, we may see a larger percentage of cancers diagnosed at a late stage in future years,” the report says.

            The 2024 Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer was published Monday in the journal Cancer. It's based on data from cancer registries funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute, and it's released by those institutions, the American Cancer Society and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.
    


            “Overall, cancer incidence and death rates continue to decline, representing changes in risk factors, increases in screening utilization, and advances in treatment,” the researchers write. “However, sustained disparities by race and ethnicity emphasize the need to fully understand the factors that create these differences so that they can be mitigated.”
    


            Fewer people in the US are using tobacco, helping lower incidence and death rates for smoking-related cancers like lung, bladder and larynx, the report says. And these sustained declines in lung cancer have been a major contributor to the overall improvements in cancer death.
    


            However, incidence rates are on the rise for several other cancers, including those linked with excess weight, such as pancreas and kidney cancers; uterine, breast and liver cancers among women; and colon and rectal cancers among adolescents and young adults.

Young women are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with cancer as young men: ‘We're seeing a change'



Previously published research has shown that cancer diagnoses are shifting from older to younger adults and from men to women. Middle‐age women now have a slightly higher cancer risk than their male counterparts, and young women are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as young men, according to an American Cancer Society report published earlier this year.
    


            The new report shows that incidence rates among women have risen 0.3% each year. The largest observed increase among women was for stomach cancer, which the researchers say may be largely due to a change in the classification of tumors by the World Health Organization.
    


            Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are also gradually increasing, driven mostly by types of cancer that have been associated with factors like obesity, alcohol use and age when someone gives birth for the first time.
    


            The data continues to show large racial disparities. For example, Black women have a 40% higher rate of death from breast cancer than White women, and their rate of death from uterine cancer is double that of White women.
    


            Differences in access to care and less use of diagnostic procedures and treatment may account for some of the difference, the researchers say. “One additional potential risk factor disproportionately affecting Black women is the use of chemical hair relaxers, which may be associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer among postmenopausal women.”
    


            Changing habits such as stopping tobacco use, staying at a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet with fruits and vegetables, avoiding alcohol and protecting skin can all reduce risk of cancer. Screening can help find and treat cancers early, before they spread. Screenings are available and recommended for certain people for breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer.

            “One more trip,” he says. “And then I'll stop.”
    


            He's a fisherman by trade, born and raised in the coastal city of Manta — a place once known for tuna and tranquility. But these days, the fish are harder to find. The trips are longer. And the money, he says, just isn't there anymore.
    


            “As a fisherman, in a month you can make $300,” he says. “But with the drug, the white one… that's the money, brother!”
    


            One trip, running cocaine by sea to Mexico, pays $60,000, he says. Half up front. Half when you make it back alive. “I think that if I get one more trip, I would go, to try my luck,” he says, adding he wants to buy his mother a house. “And then I'll stop.”
    


            He agrees to take us out — not on a drug run, but to show us how it's done. The routes, the tactics, the escape paths. He asks that we not use his name or show his face.
    


            If this was his one last trip, he says he would have dozens of black sacks of cocaine — worth an estimated $500,000 in Ecuador but as much as $5 million on US streets, he says — hidden beneath the false floors of “pregnant” speedboats he and three others power across the Pacific. “We leave from here to get to one point over there in Mexico, where there's a boat waiting for us. We don't enter a port,” he explains.
    


            Once the drop is made, they head back to Ecuador, this time with a cargo of fish as a cover story. “If I come back with nothing,” he says, “the people will quickly realize one is involved in something that's not good.”
    


            The fisherman says he isn't proud of what he does. And he knows the risks: rough waters, failing engines, criminal rivalries, and coast guard patrols. “If we are stopped, we lose everything… we don't know if they stop us to rob us or kill us.”
    


            Still, he goes, moving with a youthful energy in his voice and a face weathered by decades at sea. They carry just enough to last: food, water, energy bars — “six sacks of supplies,” he says.
    


            Now in his late 50s, he says fear doesn't stop him. “Fear, only towards God,” he says. “I know it's a crime. I know it goes against God… but I have to support my mother.”
    


            She runs a small evangelical church and pleads with him not to go. “‘Don't be involved in that,' she tells me. But I tell her, ‘Mom, you can't clean anymore… I'm the one who needs to care for you,'” he says.
    


            When we meet him, the sun is dipping behind the Pacific. The dock is alive with fishing boats weaving between larger vessels anchored offshore. The water glows in the orange light and the air is thick with the sharp smell of gasoline.
    


            As we pull away, another boat full of police officers drifts past. The fisherman smiles and waves, confidently.
    


            The officers wave back.
    


            Several hundred miles from the Ecuadorian mainland, the waters off the Galápagos Islands glisten with postcard beauty. But this stretch of the Pacific has become a critical corridor in the cocaine trade — and a battleground in Ecuador's fight against it.
    


            On patrol with Ecuador's navy, a coast guard captain surveys the horizon from the deck of his vessel. CNN is withholding his name due to growing concerns that military officials are being targeted by the very traffickers they're trying to stop.
    


            “The area where drugs are smuggled is about 200 miles off the shore… right by the limits of the Galápagos exclusive economic zone with the high seas,” he says.
    


            It's only March, and already his crew has seized six tons of cocaine. “Last year, we caught 15 tons,” he adds — noting this year's pace, if sustained, could nearly double last year's haul.
    


            The captain says their first responsibility is saving lives at sea — shipwrecks, distress calls, rescue operations. But close behind is the fight against organized crime.
    


            “What's happening is the boats (the drug runners) are using are not massive, so they need to refuel. Some of these refueling stations are in Galápagos, and they then continue onto Central America,” he explains. “That's why our navy is looking for the fuel… because it's one of the ways the narco-traffickers move drugs.”
    


            What officials call the “gas stations at sea” look like fishing boats — nets tossed off the sides, poles out for show — but they're part of a vast narco-logistics network.  Quietly stationed near the Galápagos Islands, each contains up to 40 large canisters of fuel to supply the high-speed boats running cocaine north toward Mexico and the United States.
    


            The strategy is simple: stay just outside Ecuador's territorial waters, avoid major patrol routes, and supply the drug runners as they go. If they're not intercepted, the vessels link up mid-ocean — often under cover of night — and continue their journey, undetected.
    


            It's a supply chain built for stealth — and for speed. And it's helping fuel a wave of cartel-driven violence that's turned Ecuador's coastal cities into some of the deadliest in Latin America.
    


            Many of those who take these trips never return.
    


            In a modest home near the port, more than two dozen women crowd into Solanda Bermello's living room — mothers, wives, and sisters of men who were arrested abroad or simply never came home. Some hold photographs. Others clutch letters, hoping someone might deliver them to husbands or sons locked up overseas.
    


            Bermello founded the Association of Mothers and Wives of Fishermen Detained in Other Countries nine years ago — after her own son was caught running drugs and imprisoned. Today, she says the group includes 380 members and they've documented more than 2,000 cases in Mexico, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the United States since January 2024.
    


            “We've sent letters to all those countries,” she says, pleading for repatriation of their loved ones.
    


            Many don't know where their relatives are being held or even if they're still alive.
    


            “Our fishermen are not drug traffickers,” Bermello says. “They are drug trafficking mules. Unfortunately, they are offered an amount of money that is so large for them… but at times they do not collect any of that money because they end up in prison and leave their families adrift and their children fatherless.”
    


            She says economic desperation, not ambition, is what drives them. “They are not drug traffickers,” she repeats. “Unfortunately, they do it because of the economic situation in the country — we don't have money, we don't have work, we don't have a way to subsist.”
    


            Even those trying to fish legally, she says, aren't safe. “Our fishermen are robbed by pirates. Not even making an honest living is possible.”
    


            She supports the idea of a US security presence returning to a nearby military base, vacated in 2009 after Ecuador banned foreign troops on its soil. “The US used to help us,” she says. “We need that again.”
    


            The streets of Ecuador's coastal cities are soaked in blood. In just the first few months of 2025, more than 2,500 homicides have been recorded according to national police statistics — on pace to make this the deadliest year in the country's history. InSight Crime, an organization that tracks and investigates crime in the Americas, now ranks Ecuador as having the highest homicide rate in Latin America.
    


            The surge in violence is fueled by a complex web of transnational crime: drug trafficking routes, turf wars, and brutal alliances between local gangs and foreign cartels. Ecuador's location between Peru and Colombia, top producers of cocaine, and its efficient transport and export network has made it attractive to traffickers.

            It's a crisis unfolding beyond its borders but with real consequences for the US — from the cocaine flooding into American cities to the migration pressures reshaping its southern border.
    


            Newly re-elected President Daniel Noboa says Ecuador can't face it alone. “We would love to have US forces,” he told CNN last week in his first interview since winning the April 13 runoff vote. Noboa described the country's gang war as a “transnational fight” — one that requires international backing to win.
    


            “There are plans,” he said. “We had conversations, we had a plan, we had options… and now we just need another meeting, post-election, to consolidate it.”
    


            But Noboa insists this won't mean American boots patrolling Ecuadorian streets. “The control of the operations will be in the hands of our military and our police,” he said. US forces, he explained, would play a support role — focused on monitoring illegal operations and reinforcing Ecuador's ability to stop them before they reach open waters.
    


            Last month, CNN obtained plans showing that Ecuador has already begun construction of a new naval facility in the coastal city of Manta — infrastructure a senior Ecuadorian official says is designed with US troops in mind. “It will be eventually occupied by US forces,” the official said.
    


            Noboa, who was born and educated in the United States, has pushed to revive Ecuador's cooperation with Washington across multiple fronts, including security, trade, and migration. He says he wants to fix conditions at home to keep Ecuadorians from fleeing north, while also stepping up efforts to intercept drug flows bound for the US.
    


            He's even expressed willingness to reform Ecuador's constitution — potentially allowing for the formal return of a US military presence, like the one that existed from 1999 to 2009 at the now-defunct Manta Air Base.
    


            “That would help to keep peace,” Noboa said. “Like we had in the past.”
    


            As he heads into his second term, the young president is staking his political future on security. He has invited both US President Donald Trump and El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele — another right-wing populist who cracked down on gangs — to his inauguration in May. And he insists another meeting with US officials is just around the corner.
    


            “I think sooner than later,” he told CNN.
    


            For Ecuador, the war is already underway —  at sea, on land, in homes and streets. And for the fisherman who once cast lines for tuna, it's a war that pays. His next drug run, he says, might be his last. But the system that pulled him in shows no signs of stopping.

Live Updates


            • Remembering the pope: Pope Francis, the first Latin American pontiff in nearly 1,300 years, died on Easter Monday. He was 88 years old and died of a stroke followed by heart failure, the Vatican said. Tributes are pouring in and mourners are honoring him in churches around the world.
    


            • Francis' last days: The Vatican's announcement comes after Francis spent his final days in service of the church, participating in the celebration of Easter and making a high-profile appearance in public after battling multiple health issues.  Just before that, he held a brief meeting with US Vice President JD Vance.
    


            • What happens now? Francis' death prompts a period of mourning, after which all cardinals under the age of 80 will convene to pick the next leader of the Catholic Church. It typically takes between two and three weeks for a new pope to be chosen. The pope will lie in state for several days until the funeral.
    


            Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, will celebrate a Mass for Pope Francis at Saint Patrick's Cathedral tomorrow at noon, the Archdiocese of New York Marketing Office said today.
    


            “The cardinal will depart for Rome on Tuesday evening for the funeral of Pope Francis, and the subsequent conclave to elect his successor,” the release added.
    


            The timing of Francis' death and the way he lived his final days had profound significance, the cardinal said today.
    


                    “The last time we saw him, Easter Sunday. The last words of blessed Easter, as he gave us his blessing. The day that we believe Jesus rose from the dead and shares that victory with us, in which we trust, by divine mercy, Pope Francis now shares in abundance, you couldn't have choreographed it better. And we thank him for that. The way he lived and the way he died, he was a great teacher.”
                





            Pope Francis wasn't just “an eloquent preacher,” Dolan said. He also cared deeply for every member of his church and communities of other faiths.
    


            Pope Francis said that he wished to be buried in a “simple” tomb in the ground at Rome's Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, which should bear a one-word inscription – his name in Latin.
    


                    “The tomb must be in the earth; simple, without particular decoration and with the only inscription: Franciscus,” the pontiff said in his will, which was released by the Vatican.
                





            Francis chose to be buried in the basilica because of its personal significance to him, noting in his will that he prayed there regularly. He will be the first pope in more than a century to be buried outside the Vatican.
    


            He said he had arranged for an unnamed benefactor to cover the expenses of his burial.
    


            Pope Francis died of a stroke followed by heart failure on Monday morning, the Vatican's press office said in a statement released Monday evening.
    


            Francis' death was also affected other by other ailments, including a “previous episode of acute respiratory failure,” arterial hypertension and type II diabetes, the statement said.
    


            The statement was signed by the Director of the Health and Hygiene Directorate of the Vatican City State, Andrea Arcangeli.
    


            The late pontiff was hospitalized for five weeks earlier this year, initially suffering from a severe respiratory infection. He was subsequently diagnosed with a polymicrobial infection, which evolved to pneumonia in both lungs. Francis came close to death during his hospitalization, according to his medical team.
    


            His doctors had said that the pope was so critically ill the staff considered stopping his treatment so he could die. After his medical team said his condition had stabilized, he continued his recovery at his Casa Santa Marta residence.
    


            Despite his poor health, Francis, one of the oldest popes in the church's history, was seen a number of times in public at the Vatican during Holy Week, culminating in an Easter Sunday appearance where he delighted crowds at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
    


This post was updated with more details on the pope's medical history.



            Several actors, TV hosts and celebrities have paid tribute to Pope Francis by sharing photos and messages in remembrance of the late pontiff.
    


Actor Jonathan Pryce, who earned an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Pope Francis in the 2019 film “The Two Popes,” said in a statement sent to CNN that he was “saddened to hear” of the Pope's death and that it was “an absolute privilege to portray him.” Pryce added that Pope Francis “was a man of integrity who embraced diversity and equality, spoke for the poor, the disenfranchised, refugees and immigrants” and called on “world leaders” to listen to his teachings.
    


“The View” host Whoopi Goldberg shared a photo of her meeting Pope Francis on her Instagram page, writing in the caption that he was “the closest in a long time that seemed to remember that Christ's love enveloped believer and none believer.” Goldberg added that her reminded her of “Pope John the 23rd who made belief real.”
    


Actor Antonio Banderas remembered Pope Francis on his Instagram page as “a man who, at the head of the Catholic Church, showed kindness, love, and mercy to the neediest people,” and shared a photo of himself shaking hands with the pontiff.
    


Late night host Jimmy Fallon wrote on his Instagram page that it was “an honor” to meet Pope Francis last summer, adding that he's glad to have made the pope laugh and thanked him for his “encouraging words.”
    


Journalist and author Maria Shriver said she was “deeply heartbroken” to learn of the passing of Francis, writing on her Instagram page about how much she “admired his voice in our world.” Shriver also recalled traveling to Rome to cover Pope Francis in his earliest days as the pontiff, calling it “one of the highlights of my journalism career” and wrote she was “proud to be a Catholic” while he was the pope. “I hope whoever comes next will continue Pope Francis's steady, strong, and compassionate leadership,” she added.”
    


Actor Russell Crowe shared a photo of Rome on his X page, writing that it's a “beautiful day” in the capital of Italy but that it's “a sad day for the faithful.”
    


            A rosary prayer was held for the late Pope Francis at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City this evening.
    


            The prayer was led by Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, the archpriest of St. Peter's Basilica, in front of hundreds of mourners in and around the square.
    


                    “We wish to thank the Lord for the gifts he bestowed upon the entire church through the apostolic ministry of Pope Francis, a pilgrim of hope who never disappointed,” he said. “We wish to entrust him to the merciful father in communion with Mary, Queen of Heaven, and through the intercession of the apostle Peter,” Gambetti said.
                





            Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, the Archbishop of Chicago, said Pope Francis' delivered his message in both words and actions, all the way up until the final days of his life.
    


            Francis gave the traditional Easter blessing on Sunday, appearing from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. He later greeted cheering crowds from the popemobile — the first time he had done so since his hospitalization.
    


            In that ride, Francis wanted “to be with people. He wanted them to know that he was with them. He was a fellow pilgrim with them,” Cupich said. He described the pope as someone who “always put people at ease with his humor,” but also someone who could be serious and take up serious issues.
    


            “I think that also says much about his legacy. He wanted to accompany people, and he told us to accompany one another because we're all fellow pilgrims,” Cupich told CNN.
    


            Francis was renowned for his advocacy for the poor and insistence on a more welcoming Catholic Church. He made defense of the planet, the plight of migrants and building peace through dialogue the pillars of his papacy.
    


            Cupich, who was elevated to archbishop by Francis in 2016, said Francis “gave us a more expensive view of what we could be” and how we could help others. The archbishop said he feels a “great sense of gratitude that I lived a time in which he was a pope.”
    


            “Even though there is division in the world, and even in the church, he told us that — time and again — that the Lord prayed for unity within the human family before he died and that is something that we should promote,” Cupich said.
    


Watch:



            When Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina was elected pope in 2013, taking the name of Pope Francis, the reaction across Latin America was nothing short of rapturous.
    


            Latin Americans had traditionally been overwhelmingly Catholic, but many in the region felt slighted by a church that throughout modern history looked to Europe when choosing its top leadership. Many saw themselves in Pope Francis, who championed migrants' rights, spoke out against the growing divide between rich and poor and made a point of ministering to those who seemed to be forgotten by society.
    


            Here was a Pope who had been a pastor in some of Latin America's poorest shanty towns, in times of military dictatorship and nationwide financial meltdowns.
    


            Forged from his experiences in Latin America, and with a charisma and common touch unlike any pope before him, Francis left an enduring mark on the lives of millions of Catholics around the world.
    


            Much of Francis' success as Pope can be attributed to the common touch he never seemed to have lost.
    


            According to Ecuador's former President Rafael Correa, during a 2015 meeting with Francis, the pontiff joked that many people assumed that as the first pope from Argentina, whose citizens are famous for their high self-regard, he would have taken the name “Jesus II.”
    


            That off-the-cuff style was perhaps his greatest asset: In 2015, after the first meeting between Francis and then-Cuban leader Raul Castro, a long-time atheist, a disarmed Castro exclaimed, “If the pope continues to speak like this, sooner or later, I will start praying again and I will return to the Catholic Church.”
    


            Castro's remark was so out of character that at the time it was not reported in Cuba's state-run press.
    


            Argentines of various faiths and backgrounds gathered today to pray for Pope Francis at some of the churches where he worshiped and worked.
    


            In Buenos Aires, Father José Luis Carbajal led Mass at the San José de Flores church, where Jorge Bergoglio – as Francis was known before becoming pope – began his priestly vocation.
    


                    “There is the confessional where he finishes confirming his priestly vocation,” Carbajal told reporters at the church. “I have those memories, you know? They kill me, because it's as if he gave you importance without you being it. He made you feel important, valued, cherished, loved.”
                





            At the Buenos Aires Cathedral, where Francis was once archbishop, both Catholics and non-religious residents spoke about what the pontiff, a fellow Argentine, meant to them.
    


            “To me, he represents a leader beyond being religious,” said Hugo, a resident of Buenos Aires. “Although he was religious and had his duties, I find him an admirable person. I see him more as a person than a pope, maybe because I'm not very religious.”
    


            Paula, who is Christian, told CNN she felt immense pride that Francis represented both her country and faith.
    


            “Well, as an Argentine, it's truly a pride, and as a Christian too. His reach to everyone, to all people, really. So, one more among us,” she said.
    


            Paula and Hugo did not provide their last names.
    


            One bishop in Minnesota is remembering Pope Francis for his life and legacy, but also for his charming and funny personality.
    


            Bishop Robert Barron of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester said Francis was “very warm, very generous, funny. I would speak to him in Spanish, and there was almost always a joke involved or a pleasantry of some kind.”
    


            Barron was appointed by Francis and met with him several times last October.
    


                    “He also had an extraordinary memory,” Barron told CNN. “He wouldn't see someone like me every day, and he had a keen sense of who I was and knew people's names. I was always very impressed by that.”
                





            Barron said the late pope was also “very approachable” and his emphasis on taking care of the poor and marginalized communities was “a natural extension of his personal style.”
    


            Francis spent his final days participating in the celebration of Easter. Barron said that also is an example of how he “always wanted to be out with the people,” even after he was treated for double pneumonia a few weeks ago.
    


            “The last thing I heard him say was that kind of strained ‘buona Pasqua,' you know, wishing good Easter to everybody,” Barron said. “What a wonderful final message for a pope. The pope's job is to declare the resurrection, which is what he was doing, really, with his last breath.”
    


            US House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi on Monday shared her memories of Pope Francis, whom she met with four times before his death.
    


            In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Pelosi, who is Catholic, praised Francis as a “confident pope,” and said he spoke about immigrants and refugees “again and again,” as it was “such a high priority for him.”
    


                    “This is a person, I mean, so beautiful, so lovely, so joyous. He would laugh about so many things. And I found the great privilege to meet with him at least four times,” she said.
                





            The pope, Pelosi said, loved children and she recalled visiting him with her own kids and grandkids.
    


            She remembered the late pope allowing her to receive the holy sacrament of Communion during an official visit to the Vatican in 2022, despite her home archbishop banning her from doing so due to her support for abortion rights.
    


            Pelosi said Francis met privately with her and her husband, Paul, and the Vatican released photos of them together. She then was allowed to receive communion during Mass, which she said “effectively” sent a message.
    


            Argentina's President, Javier Milei, has declared seven days of mourning following the death of Pope Francis, as confirmed to CNN by a spokesperson close to the president. The pope was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which is a Catholic-majority country.
    


            The same source informed CNN that Milei is scheduled to travel to Rome this Wednesday for the funeral events of Francis at the Vatican.
    


Some background: Before he became president, Milei once took issue with Pope Francis. Milei clashed with the pontiff over his country's economic policies, saying in 2022 that Francis is “always on the side of evil.” He later walked back that statement, and when he met the pontiff, the two embraced each other.
    


            After the pope's death Monday, Milei said “having been able to know him in his kindness and wisdom was a true honor for me.”
    


            President Donald Trump said he is unsure if he will attend the funeral of Pope Francis at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City.
    


            “I don't know yet. We're going to be briefed on it right now,” Trump told reporters at the White House Easter Egg Roll Monday morning.
    


            Asked if he'd like to go to the funeral, Trump said: “Well, I don't know. I just have to look at the timing. We just lowered the flags.” Trump had ordered flags flown at half-staff earlier Monday in honor of the pope's death.
    


            Additionally, Trump, who the pope had criticized over his immigration crackdown, said he agrees with Pope Francis' message of tolerance toward migrants.
    


            “Yeah, I do, I do,” Trump said. “I really do.”
    


                    Commenting on the pope's legacy, Trump said: “He's a very good man who loved the world. And he especially loved people that were having a hard time. And that's good with me.”
                





            A host of African leaders have offered their condolences after the death of Pope Francis on Monday, paying tribute to the late pontiff.
    


            A statement released by Egypt's presidency said that Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the country's leader, “profoundly mourns” Pope Francis. The death of the pontiff “represents a profound loss for the entire world, as he was a voice for peace, love, and mercy, and an example to be emulated in devotion to noble values,” the statement said, noting Francis' commitment to the people of Gaza and his criticism of Israel's war against Hamas.
    


Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the president of Nigeria, said in a post on X that he mourns the death of Francis with a “heavy heart,” calling him a “humble servant of God, tireless champion of the poor, and guiding light for millions.”
    


Kenya's President William Samoei Ruto called the death of Pope Francis a “big loss to the Catholic faithful and the Christian world,” adding that “his strong ethical and moral convictions inspired millions across the world, regardless of faith or background.”
    


Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, said that “Catholics and people of all faiths are saddened” by the passing of Francis, who “sought to unite humanity and wished to see a world governed by fundamental human values.” He added that “Pope Francis advanced a world view of inclusion, equality and care for marginalized individuals and groups, as well as responsible and sustainable custody of the natural environment.”
    


Abiy Ahmed Ali, the prime minister of Ethiopia, wrote on X that he extended his “deepest condolences” on the Pope's death. “May his soul rest in eternal peace, and may his legacy of compassion, humility, and service to humanity continue to inspire generations to come,” he wrote.
    


The President of Zimbabwe Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa called the late pope “a man of profound humility who stood for peace, compassion, and justice,” writing on X that he joins the world in mourning Francis' passing.
    


            Argentine soccer team San Lorenzo de Almagro paid tribute to Pope Francis' devotion to the club, saying on X that he was “always one of us.”
    


                    “From Jorge Mario Bergoglio to [Pope] Francis, there was one thing that never changed: his love for the Cyclone,” the team said, referring to one of its nicknames.
                





            The post included a video tribute to the Pope, showing him holding jerseys and memorabilia of the team, from his days as priest and cardinal to his time as pontiff. “Wrapped in deep sorrow, from #SanLorenzo today we say to Francis: Goodbye, thank you, and farewell! We will be together for eternity!” the team wrote.
    


            In Buenos Aires, a local fan of the club spoke to CNN about what Pope Francis meant to his community, where he was considered “family.”
    


            “We are from the neighborhood, we are from San Lorenzo … It was an important part of Francis, our club. But we come mainly to try to bring a bit of empathy, solidarity, and the desire that Francis had for us to be united today,” Daniel Ruiz said.
    


            CNN spoke with parishioners at the cathedral in Buenos Aires after the death of Pope Francis, including Elisa, who worked with the late pope in the church when he was a cardinal.
    


                    “I couldn't believe it. I was trying to find out if it was true news or not, and at the moment I consulted everywhere, and I was quite shocked,” Elisa, who did not provide her name, told CNN. “I left my house to come to work. I had a journey of over an hour. I was looking for photos of him praying, looking for videos, reviewing the video from yesterday, the blessing that I saw live. Remembering his voice. So until now, I got emotional at the photo. I broke down right there because we saw him here and nothing.”
                





            Elisa described Pope Francis as “very present” in the community of Barracas.
    


            She noted that the pope chose to only take the bus as his method of transport and walked all over the neighborhood. Elisa said that he “gave confirmation to my sister and me in 1997 or 1998. And there we started working with the church. He would come and we were in the choir, and we saw him at all the masses.”
    


            Elisa said she'll remember Pope Francis' “calm” and “firm voice,” as well as his willingness to see those who “nobody wanted to look at.”
    


                    “He focused on what no one wanted to talk about or look at. He had that broad perspective. And those arms, those arms that said to everyone, everyone, everyone, it didn't matter who they were, to everyone,” she said, noting that she will remember him as “always advocating for children, caring for women, for those discarded, that gaze he had for everyone.”
                





            Pope Francis was a “messenger of hope, humility, and humanity,” the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, said at a news conference in New York on Monday where he paid tribute to the late pontiff.
    


            Guterres extended his condolences to Catholics and called Francis a “transcendent voice for peace, human dignity, and social justice.”
    


            Those working at the UN were “greatly inspired by his commitment to the goals and ideals of our organization,” Guterres added.
    


            Guterres also mentioned Francis' Easter message, delivered on Sunday, just hours before his death. Francis “urged the world to invest in what he referred to as the weapons of peace, to help the most vulnerable, to fight hunger, to advance development,” Guterres said.
    


                    “Our divided and discordant world will be a much better place if you follow his example of unity and mutual understanding in our own actions.”
                





            The death of Pope Francis has triggered a period of mourning in the Vatican and signals the start of a millennia-old process of picking a new pontiff.
    


            It is a procedure steeped in tradition, but one which has been subtly updated for the modern world.
    


            Cardinals — senior church officials appointed by the pope — from around the world must gather for the conclave in which Francis' successor is selected. It typically takes between two and three weeks for a pope to be chosen, though it can stretch slightly beyond that if cardinals struggle to agree on a candidate.
    


            The voting process is kept secret but will take place with the eyes of the world on the Vatican and amid intense scrutiny of the Catholic Church — an institution whose reputation has been stained by the scandal of child sex abuse within its ranks, overshadowing the legacies of successive popes.
    


            Leaders across the Americas paid tribute to Pope Francis on Monday as the region — home to 47.8% of the world's Catholic population, according to the Vatican — woke up to news of his death.
    


Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney remembered the pope as “a shepherd of deep moral clarity, spiritual courage, and boundless compassion” who “redefined the moral responsibilities of leadership in the 21st century.”
    


Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a post on X it was a “great honor and privilege” to know the pope, calling him a “humanist who stood for the poor, peace, and equality.”
    


Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said “humanity loses a voice of respect and acceptance of others” in his post mourning the pope's death. Francis “always stood by those who need it most: the poor, refugees, the young, the elderly, and the victims of wars and all forms of prejudice,” Lula da Silva added.
    


US President Donald Trump commemorated the pope on social media, saying “May God Bless him and all who loved him!” He was joined by other US political leaders, who also released tributes to Pope Francis, which you can read here.
    


Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated how many of the world's Catholics live in the Americas. It is 47.8%.



            President Donald Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff as a “mark of respect for the memory” for Pope Francis, who passed on Monday.
    


            The order applies to “all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, on the day of interment,” Trump wrote in the proclamation.
    


            He also included “United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.”
    


            On the White House South Lawn, where the Easter Egg Roll was underway, the American flag on the top of the White House was flying at half-staff Monday morning.
    


            When Pope Francis looked over thousands of Catholics who had gathered in St. Peter's Square on Easter Sunday, he had prepared a speech that looked over at a world replete with pockets of conflict and called for an end to the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan.
    


            Too infirm to read aloud more than a few phrases, Francis sat while an aide delivered his Easter speech: A “celebration of life” amid the “rumble of death” that he said was growing across the world.
    


            Francis' papacy began in a different, more peaceful time. In 2013, Russia had not yet annexed Crimea. Syria's civil war was bloody but had not yet dragged in large foreign powers. Migration to Europe was not yet deemed a “crisis.”
    


            In a speech delivered just hours before his death, Francis listed 11 countries and six regions now wracked by conflict, surveying a world sliding further into war and disorder.
    


                    “What a great thirst for death, for killing, we witness each day in the many conflicts raging in different parts of our world!… How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants!” Francis said.
                





            He prayed for Christian communities in Lebanon and Syria, “constructive dialogue” to help resolve famine in Yemen, peace in Sudan and South Sudan and he prayed for victims of violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He also mentioned a nascent ceasefire after years of civil war in Myanmar was a slim “sign of hope.
    


            The pontiff prayed for a “just and lasting peace” in Ukraine, and decried the sufferings of people in Gaza, “where the terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction.” Francis, a fervent critic of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, ramped up his censures in recent months, calling the conflict “very serious and shameful” in January.
    


            Just yesterday, Pope Francis gave the traditional Easter blessing, appearing from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica before greeting the cheering crowds in St. Peter's Square from the popemobile.
    


You can watch those moments from his final public appearance here:

            Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton quoted from Pope Francis' last public address in a social media post remembering the late pontiff.
    


                    “In Pope Francis's last public address, he preached care of the marginalized, the vulnerable, and migrants, saying ‘I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves.' May we heed his wish,” Clinton said on X.
                





            Pope Francis died Monday morning at Casa Santa Marta, a guesthouse near St. Peter's Basilica where Francis has lived since his election in 2013, according to the Vatican spokesperson.
    


            The pope died on the second floor of the residence, according to the Vatican press office.
    


            Francis' body will be laid in a coffin at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) on Monday, the Vatican said in a statement earlier today.
    


            Matteo Bruni, director of the Vatican press office, said he is “hopeful” that the Vatican will be able to release the cause of death on Monday evening, following the official certification of death.
    


            US lawmakers and officials are reacting to the death of Pope Francis, the first non-European pontiff in nearly 1,300 years. Here's what some of them are saying:
    


This post has been updated with additional reactions. 



            As news of Pope Francis' death spread across the globe, some Catholics outside the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris remembered the pontiff for setting a new example of how the Catholic Church should be led.
    


            One woman described him as the “best pope of the era” talking to CNN affiliate BFMTV.
    


            Another woman remembered Francis as an “ordinary person,” saying he didn't stay confined in the walls of the Vatican.
    


                    “As soon as he became pope, he didn't stay inside the church, in the Vatican, he went out, he visited people, he knew as an ordinary person. So, he really acted as an ordinary person,” she told BFMTV.
                





            Pope Francis's tireless advocacy for migrants saw him sharply criticize President Donald Trump's immigration deportation policies in the months before his death.Francis, whose pontificate was a counterweight to the rise of nationalist populism, often found himself under fire from powerful conservative Catholic forces in the US.
    


            In a February letter to American bishops, the pope offered a pointed criticism of Trump's treatment of migrants, saying that “the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women.”
    


            Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, acknowledged the pope's criticism at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast later that month.
    


            “As you've probably seen publicly, the Holy Father, Pope Francis, has criticized some of our policies when it comes to immigration,” the vice president said. “Again, my goal here is not to litigate with him or any other clergy member about who is right and who is wrong. You obviously know my views and I will speak to them consistently because I think that I have to do it because it serves the best interest of the American people.”
    


            The vice president and pope met briefly on Sunday. While Vance's meeting with the pope appeared friendly, the Vice President also met senior Vatican officials on Saturday — a meeting that was described by the Vatican as including an “exchange of opinions.”The Vatican said opinions were exchanged on issues concerning migrants, refugees, and prisoners.
    


            Former President Barack Obama is remembering Pope Francis on Monday as “the rare leader who made us want to be better people.”
    


                    “In his humility and his gestures at once simple and profound – embracing the sick, ministering to the homeless, washing the feet of young prisoners – he shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God and one another,” Obama wrote in a statement along with his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama.
                





            When he was president, Obama took the rare step of traveling to Joint Base Andrews to greet Francis at the start of the pope's blockbuster visit to the United States in 2015.
    


            Later, the pope led a short parade in his open-air popemobile around the South Lawn, which was crowded with thousands who had come to witness a rare papal visit to the White House, some carrying babies for the pope to kiss.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says no travel is planned “at this time” for President Trump to attend the funeral of Pope Francis, which could occur later this week.
    


            Still, she didn't rule out a trip to Rome for the funeral.
    


            “It doesn't mean it's not happening,” she said.
    


Remember: President George W. Bush attended the funeral for the last pope who died while still pontiff, John Paul II.
    


            “We're praying for the millions Christians around the world who loved the Pope and admired him,” Leavitt told reporters at the White House.
    


            A new pope will need to be elected following the death of Pope Francis, a process rooted in history that's called conclave — the secret meeting of cardinals to hold a papal election.
    


            The conclave typically happens 15 and 20 days after the papal office becomes vacant. Technically, any Roman Catholic male can be elected the leader, but the last pope not chosen from the College of Cardinals was Urban VI in 1379.
    


Here's a look at how the next pope will be chosen: 



            After the Vatican announced the death of Pope Francis, bells rang out from the Vatican to mark his passing.
    


            Watch those bells ringing out here:

            Pope Francis' body could lie in state in St. Peter's Basilica for people to come and pay their respects as soon as Wednesday, a Vatican spokesperson said Monday.
    


                    “The transfer of the body of the Holy Father to the Vatican Basilica for the homage of all the faithful could take place on Wednesday morning,” said Matteo Bruni, director of the Vatican press office.
                





            Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, has sent his condolences to the Vatican following the death of Pope Francis, who he called “a symbol of tolerance, love and fraternity.”
    


            In his St. Peter's Square address on Easter Sunday, a day before his death, Pope Francis said he was thinking of “the people of Gaza, and its Christian community in particular, where the terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.”
    


More on Francis' calls for peace: Francis, who had long criticized Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, appealed to the warring sides to “call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace!”
    


            Throughout the war, Francis has made nightly calls to Father Gabriele Romanelli, parish priest of the Holy Family Church in Gaza, where Christians and Muslims have often sought refuge from Israeli bombardment.
    


            Hamas also expressed its “heartfelt condolences” to Catholics around the world following Francis' death.
    


            “Francis was known for his significant stances in promoting the values of dialogue between religions and advocating for understanding and peace among peoples, as well as rejecting hate and racism,” Hamas said in a statement.
    


            World leaders who previously clashed with Pope Francis over political issues, including immigration and the economy, have expressed their condolences following the pontiff's death.
    


            Francis' papacy was defined by his support for refugees and migrants. He called for solidarity with those fleeing war and persecution, urged the world to recognize their suffering and insisted they should be welcomed into societies.
    


            Hungary's Viktor Orban and Pope Francis had starkly differing views on the treatment of refugees. Today, Orban thanked the pontiff “for everything.” The leader of Hungary met with Francis on multiple occasions.
    


            Before he became president, Javier Milei of Argentina — a Catholic-majority country — also took issue with Pope Francis. Milei clashed with the pontiff over his country's economic policies, saying in 2022 that Francis is “always on the side of evil.” He later walked back that statement, and when he met the pontiff, the two embraced each other. After his death, Milei said “having been able to know him in his kindness and wisdom was a true honor for me.”
    


            In the US, Francis and President Donald Trump clashed in 2016 during Trump's first presidential campaign. Francis called Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants “not Christian,” provoking a fiery response from Trump, who called the pontiff's comments “disgraceful.” Francis also took issue with statements from Vice President JD Vance this year, refuting his use of a theological concept to defend the administration's approach and criticizing the Trump administration's approach to immigration. In February, the pope described Trump's plans to deport immigrants as a “disgrace.”



            On Monday, shortly after meeting Francis, Vance said his “heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.” Trump posted on social media saying “Rest in Peace, Pope Francis!” and “May God Bless him and all who loved him!”.
    


CNN's Christopher Lamb and Ivana Kottasová contributed to this report. 



            President Donald Trump is commemorating the late Pope Francis, issuing a brief statement on social media following the pontiff's death.
    


            “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!” Trump wrote in a brief message on Truth Social.
    


            The president also honored Pope Francis at the White House Easter Egg Roll today, calling the late pope a “good man.”
    


                    “I just signed an executive order putting the flags of our country… at half-mast in honor of Pope Francis,” Trump said as he addressed a crowd on the South Lawn from the Blue Room Balcony.
                





            Trump continued, “He was a good man. He worked hard. He loved the world. And it's an honor to do that.”
    


            Trump met the pope at the Vatican during his first term in 2017.
    


            Francis had been publicly critical of the Trump administration's immigration policies.

            Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, remarked on the timing of Pope Francis' death on Easter Monday, saying, “you couldn't have choreographed” it any better.
    


            “We can never choreograph our own birth or death, can we, that's always in God's hands,” Dolan told reporters.
    


                    “But if you could choreograph it, you couldn't have choreographed it any better than what happened. The last time we saw him, Easter Sunday. The last words, ‘A blessed Easter,' as he gave us his blessing,” Dolan added.
                





            Dolan remembered Francis as “great teacher” and “wonderful steward,” adding that “he's the father of our family, and there's a death in the family.”
    


            He recalled the Italian tradition of referring to Easter Monday as “Lunedi dell'Angelo” which literally translates as the Monday of the Angels, referencing the day when Christians believe angels announced Jesus' resurrection.
    


            “They remember what the angels said to the women: ‘Why are you looking for the living among the dead?' We're convinced that even though Pope Francis has passed over from this life to the next, he still lives.”
    


            Former President Joe Biden mourned the loss of Pope Francis in a statement Monday, calling the late pontiff, “the People's Pope - a light of faith, hope and love.”
    


            “It is with great sadness that Jill and I learned of the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis. He was unlike any who came before him,” Biden said. “Pope Francis will be remembered as one of the most consequential leaders of our time and I am better for having known him.”
    


            Biden, the second Catholic to serve as US president, praised Pope Francis for his work to help the marginalized and on issues like pursuing peace and combatting climate change.
    


                    “For decades, he served the most vulnerable across Argentina and his mission of serving the poor never ceased,” Biden continued. “As Pope, he was a loving pastor and challenging teacher who reached out to different faiths. He commanded us to fight for peace and protect our planet from a climate crisis. He advocated for the voiceless and powerless. He made all feel welcome and seen by the Church. He promoted equity and an end to poverty and suffering across the globe. And above all, he was a Pope for everyone. He was the People's Pope - a light of faith, hope, and love.”
                





            Biden awarded the pope with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in January. He did so from afar after a trip to meet with the Pope at the Vatican was canceled due to the wildfires in California.
    


            Biden is in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, after having spent Easter there.
    


            Pope Francis' body will be laid in a coffin at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) on Monday, the Vatican said in a statement.
    


            Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, the Vatican camerlengo, will preside over the certification of Francis' death and the placing of his body in the coffin.
    


            The Pope's family and a string of other senior Vatican officials will take part in the rite, which will be held in the Chapel of the Domus Sanctae Marthae, the Vatican said.
    


            Following the death of Pope Francis, a cardinal from the United States has become acting head of the Vatican until a new pope is elected.
    


            He is Cardinal Kevin Farrell, a Dublin-born cleric who became a naturalized American citizen after spending many years ministering in the United States. Farrell, a former Bishop of Dallas, holds the position of “camerlengo,” or chamberlain, which is the acting head of the Vatican in the period between the death or resignation of a pope and appointment of the next Catholic leader.
    


            The 77-year-old holds a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. He's the highest-ranking US bishop in the church's central administration and is known as a strong decision-maker and organizer. He has the advantage of being a fluent speaker of English and Spanish — the two most widely spoken languages in the church. He's also known to speak Italian and Irish Gaelic.
    


            Farrell's expertise caught the attention of Pope Francis, who made him one of his most trusted collaborators.
    


            In 2016, Francis appointed the then Bishop of Dallas to be the leader of the Vatican's family life, later making him a cardinal and then, three years later, choosing him for the important and sensitive position of camerlengo.
    


            St. Peter's Square filled with people on Monday following the announcement of Pope Francis' death. Due to the large crowds, people moved slowly, some pushing their bicycles, others pushing strollers or steering their children through the throng.
    


            For Alessia Saltini, an Italian tourist, Francis' death “struck in every sense.”
    


            “What happened this morning, we were a bit sad because we knew about the health conditions of the pope, but we were practically on the right track and we knew from the news that he was going to die,” she told Reuters.
    


            Many tourists were still in Rome following the Easter weekend, when the world's 1.3 billion Catholics celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
    


            “I'm here for Easter, and I find it very significant that the Pope has died during Easter, or the Easter weekend,” Becca Tusa, an Argentinian tourist, told Reuters. “I'm from Argentina, the pope was Argentinian, so it has quite a bit of significance for us. It's a moment of a bit of sadness and at the same time thankfulness and a celebration of life.”
    


            Pope Francis' death was announced earlier today by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the Vatican's camerlengo, who stood at a microphone, reading a statement in his Irish-accented Italian.

            “Dear brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis,” he said. “At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of His Church.”
    


            As the camerlengo, Farrell is the acting head of the Vatican in the period between the death or resignation of a pope and appointment of the next leader of the Catholic Church.
    


            Filipino President Bongbong Marcos said Pope Francis was a “man of profound faith and humility,” who led “not only with wisdom but a heart open to all, especially the poor and the forgotten.”
    


Key context: Nearly four in five Filipinos are Catholic, according to the country's latest census, in 2020.
    


            “Pope Francis taught us that to be a good Christian is to extend kindness and care to one another,” Marcos added in a statement on Facebook.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he is grieving with Catholics around the world following the death of Pope Francis, who died on Easter Monday.
    


                    “He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity. He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians,” Zelensky said in a statement on X.
                





            Zelensky last met Francis in October, during a visit to the Vatican. The Ukrainian leader said the pair had discussed the plight of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children deported to Russia since Moscow's full-scale invasion, and the need to make “all possible endeavors” to bring them home.
    


            Francis was a consistent critic of Russia's invasion. On the first anniversary of Russia's war, Francis called on Catholics to pray for Ukrainians, saying: “Let us not be ashamed to suffer and weep, for war is destruction, a war always diminishes us.”
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin has paid tribute to Pope Francis in a message addressed to Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, the Vatican's camerlengo — the acting head of the church until a new pope is elected.
    


            Putin expressed his “most sincere condolences” and praised the Pope as “a faithful servant of Christian doctrine, a wise religious and statesman, and a consistent defender of the high values of humanism and justice,” in a message published by the Kremlin Monday.
    


            Putin also mentioned Francis's role in fostering dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches and for strengthening ties between Russia and the Holy See.
    


            “I had the opportunity to communicate with this outstanding person on many occasions, and I will forever cherish the brightest memory of him,” Putin said.
    


            Speaking during a press briefing Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin and Pope Francis had met many times and “had great respect for each other.”
    


            Pope Francis will be the first pope in more than a century to be buried outside the Vatican. Although popes are usually buried in the grottoes beneath St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City, Francis' final resting place will be the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore on the other side of the River Tiber in Rome.
    


            He revealed his plans to break with tradition and be buried there in December 2023, explaining that he felt a “very strong connection” with the basilica, which he used to visit on Sunday mornings to honor the Virgin Mary.
    


            “I want to be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore,” Francis said. “Because it is my great devotion.”
    


            Although seven other popes are buried in Santa Maria Maggiore, Francis will be the first since Leo XIII, who died in 1903, not to be buried in St. Peter's Basilica.
    


            The basilica was the only place, other than a visit to a Rome prison to show his solidarity with inmates, that Pope Francis went to outside the Vatican after his hospital stay, Vatican analyst Katie McGrady pointed out.
    


            “It is where the Salus Populi Romani, his favorite Marian image is kept and that image of Our Lady, Pope Francis would go and visit before every trip and he would visit it on his return,” she said.
    


            Pope Francis' death follows a decline in his health during the final years of his papacy.
    


            The 88-year-old pontiff, who as a young man had a small part of one lung removed, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 after experiencing bronchitis symptoms. A subsequent CT scan led to a diagnosis of pneumonia in both lungs. His condition stablized and, five weeks later, the pontiff was allowed to return to the Vatican to continue his recovery.
    


            However, after leaving hospital the pontiff was unable to speak for long periods due to his respiratory difficulties and underwent physiotherapy to help regain his voice. He also had difficulty raising his arms and wore a nasal cannula to receive oxygen.
    


            When he was younger, the Argentine leader endured severe pneumonia and had part of his right lung removed. Earlier this year, he suffered two falls and had been seen with a walking stick or using a wheelchair to help his mobility, restricted by pain in his knee.
    


            Throughout his papacy, he had to cancel a few trips due to ill health. In 2022, he canceled a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan after doctors said he might also have to miss a later trip to Canada for a knee injury. In 2023, the Vatican also said he was suffering from lung inflammation, which prevented him fulfilling some commitments, including attending COP28 climate talks in Dubai.
    


            Francis also suffered from diverticulitis, a common condition that can cause inflammation or infection of the colon. In 2021, he had surgery to remove part of his colon.
    


            In December 2022, Francis revealed that he had already signed his resignation letter to be used in the event of him becoming “impaired.” Francis made the comment in an interview with Spanish news outlet ABC, when asked what would happen if a pope was suddenly rendered unable to perform his duties due to health issues or an accident.
    


            The day before he died, Pope Francis received a visit from a world leader with whom he'd recently tangled on the issue of immigration.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance, who appears to have been the last world leader Francis met before his death, sat briefly with the pope in a reception room at the Casa Santa Marta, the Vatican guesthouse where he has lived since his election in 2013.
    


            Vance was on Vatican grounds on Sunday for less than 20 minutes, and the meeting hadn't been confirmed ahead of time.
    


            During their short session, he pope gifted the vice president a tie, rosaries and three big chocolate Easter eggs for Vance's three children.
    


            Vance, who has called himself a “baby Catholic” after converting to the faith as an adult, had sparred from afar with Francis on the issue of mass deportations. But those differences didn't appear to arise Sunday during their short meeting.
    


            “I pray for you every day,” Vance could be heard telling the Pontiff as they sat together at the Vatican.
    


            CNN's Christopher Lamb contributed reporting
    


            Britain's King Charles III has paid tribute to Pope Francis, saying that he and his wife, Queen Camilla, were “most deeply saddened” to learn of the pope's death, but that he was glad Francis “was able to share an Easter Greeting with the Church” on Sunday, a day before his death.
    


                    “His Holiness will be remembered for his compassion, his concern for the unity of the Church and for his tireless commitment to the common causes of all people of faith, and to those of goodwill who work for the benefit of others. His belief that care for Creation is an existential expression of faith in God resounded with so many across the world,” Charles said, according to Buckingham Palace.
                





            Charles said he and Camilla were “greatly moved” to have been able to visit Francis just days before his death, during a state visit to Italy to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary.
    


            UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer also paid tribute, saying: “His leadership in a complex and challenging time for the world and the church was often courageous, yet always came from a place of deep humility.”
    


                    “Pope Francis was a pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten. He was close to the realities of human fragility, meeting Christians around the world facing war, famine, persecution and poverty.”
                





            The death of Pope Francis on Monday morning would have come as a shock to many, after he made a few high-profile appearances over the Easter weekend.
    


            Easter is the most important festival in the Christian calendar and while Francis did not lead the main Holy Week and Easter services, he did make brief appearances.
    


            On Thursday, Francis spent 30 minutes at a prison in Rome.
    


            On Saturday, the pontiff visited St. Peters Basilica in the evening.
    


            On Sunday, he delighted crowds after giving the traditional Easter blessing from the balcony of St. Peters Basilica.
    


            He offered the “Urbi et Orbi” blessing to the “City [of Rome] and to the World” while an aide read his address. Only the pope can offer this blessing which includes the offer of an indulgence, a remission for the effect of sins. His voice sounded weak but he appeared without the nasal canula he has been wearing to receive oxygen as he said “Brothers and Sisters, Happy Easter.”
    


            He later greeted cheering crowds in St. Peter's Square from the popemobile, the first time he had done so since his hospitalization.
    


            Earlier on Easter Sunday, before giving the blessing, Francis had a private meeting with US Vice President JD Vance.
    


            Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Catholic world has “lost an exceptional leader” following the death of Pope Francis.
    


            “Pope Francis' long and distinguished papacy was marked by his unwavering commitment to the principles of compassion, peace, and human dignity.  He spoke out for the poor, the marginalised, and the oppressed,” Martin said in a statement.
    


                    “His solidarity with refugees, his calls for climate action, and his insistence on global peace and equality set him apart as a champion of justice in the modern world.”
                





            Martin said Francis holds “a special place in the hearts of the Irish people,” recalling the pontiff's 2018 visit — just the second visit to the country by a pope in the church's history.
    


            Over 3.5 million people living in Ireland reported that their religion was Roman Catholic, according to the 2022 census, accounting for 69% of the population.
    


            The White House has shared an initial memorial post for the late Pope Francis, writing on X “Rest in Peace” alongside photos of President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance meeting the Pontiff.
    


            Trump met Francis at the Vatican in 2017, while Vance met Francis briefly on Sunday, just one day before his death.
    


            Church bells across Rome began to ring after the Vatican announced Pope Francis' death on Monday morning.
    


            The pope's death comes as most Italians have the day off work as Easter Monday is a national holiday in Italy. Many Italians traditionally spend the day meeting with family and friends and gather for picnics. It's likely that many will be reconsidering their plans in light of the pontiff's passing.
    


            Put simply, the camerlengo — or chamberlain — is the acting head of the Vatican in the period between the death or resignation of a pope and appointment of the next leader of the Catholic Church.
    


            It's the camerlengo's job to “officially ascertain the Pope's death,” draw up the death certificate, place seals on the pope's bedroom and study and make funeral preparations.
    


            The camerlengo is also tasked with making practical arrangements for the conclave, to ensure the confidentiality of proceedings and orderly voting.
    


            The camerlengo's powers are limited to the day-to-day administration of the Vatican and he chairs a committee of three other cardinals as he carries out his duties. When serious matters arise, he must consult with the wider body of cardinals.
    


            Pope Francis was elected in 2013 after Benedict XVI retired. He was the first Latin American pope in history and the first from the Americas.
    


            Before he was pope, he was Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the archbishop of Buenos Aires.

French President Emmanuel Macron has paid tribute to Pope Francis, saying:  “From Buenos Aires to Rome, Pope Francis wanted the Church to bring joy and hope to the poorest. To unite people with one another and with nature. May this hope be resurrected unceasingly beyond him,” Macron said in a statement.
    


Germany's chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz said “the death of Pope Francis fills me with great sadness. Francis will be remembered for his tireless commitment to the weakest members of society, to justice and reconciliation,” in a statement.
    


European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sent a message of condolences, saying the pope “inspired millions, far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate.”
    


Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “deeply pained” by the passing of the pope. “In this hour of grief and remembrance, my heartfelt condolences to the global Catholic community. Pope Francis will always be remembered as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world,” he said.
    


Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed his “deepest condolences to the Christian world,” remembering the pope as “a man of deep faith and boundless compassion” who “saw great importance in fostering strong ties with the Jewish world and in advancing interfaith dialogue.”
    


Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a national televised address that all flags would fly at half-staff on government buildings Tuesday as a sign of respect for the late pontiff. “For Australian Catholics, he was a devoted champion and loving father,” Albanese said. “Pope Francis lived out his faith and vocation in word and deed. He was truly inspirational.”
    


New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said Francis was “a man of humility, his legacy includes an unwavering commitment to the vulnerable, to social justice and to interfaith dialogue.”
    


Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Francis was “a pioneer of interfaith harmony, peace, and the promotion of humanity,” calling his passing “an irreparable loss to the entire world.”
    


Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun said Francis' death was “loss for all humanity, as he was a powerful voice for justice and peace, a champion of the poor and marginalized, and an advocate for dialogue between various religions and cultures.”
    


Malta's President Myriam Spiteri Debono said that Francis “will be remembered for his humility, the particular attention he gave during his term to the poor and marginalized, and his continuous work for international peace and reconciliation between peoples.”
    


Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk paid tribute to the pope on X, calling him a “good, warm and sensitive man.”
    


            US Vice President JD Vance, who met with Francis hours before his death, said he was “happy to see” the pope on Easter Sunday, “though he was obviously very ill.”
    


            “I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,” Vance said Monday in a post on X.
    


                    “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I'll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful.”
                





            Pope Francis had a private meeting with Vance, a devout Catholic, on Sunday. A day earlier, Francis had criticized the Trump administration's immigration policy.
    


            Pope Francis spent his final days in service of the church, participating as much as he could in the celebration of Easter, the high point of the Christian calendar.
    


            The 88-year-old pontiff did not lead the main Holy Week and Easter services but has made brief appearances over the weekend, including spending 30 minutes at a prison in Rome on Thursday and making a visit to St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday evening.
    


            And then on Sunday morning, he was able to offer the “Urbi et Orbi” blessing to the “City [of Rome] and to the World” while an aide read his address. Only the pope can offer this blessing which includes the offer of an indulgence, a remission for the effect of sins.
    


            He later greeted cheering crowds in St. Peter's Square from the popemobile, the first time he has done so since his hospitalization. He also met briefly with US Vice President JD Vance, who is the last foreign civic dignitary to have met with Pope Francis.
    


            “It is quite extraordinary that after the highest point of the church's liturgical year, at the highest point, the Pope then passes on and it's, in some ways quite fitting, because of course the Easter message is all about the death and new life,” said CNN Vatican correspondent Christopher Lamb from Rome.
    


                    “The last days of Francis were really dedicated to serving the church, to continuing his ministry right until the end. He did not resign, as some people speculated (he would). He always signaled his determination to go until the end, to serve until the very last moment.”
                





            Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio to Italian migrants in Buenos Aires in 1936, was the first Latin American and member of the Jesuit order to be elected pope in the church's 2,000-year history. He was also the first pope to call himself Francis.
    


            The Argentinian pontiff quickly gained a reputation as a modernizer, with an outward-facing approach which saw him speak out boldly on humanitarian crises, such as migration, war and climate change.
    


            He sought to reform the church by tackling elitist mentalities among the clergy, demanding a compassionate approach to divorced and gay Catholics and insisting that the church welcome everyone.
    


            He took a series of measures to clean up financial corruption in the Vatican, and to tackle the scourge of clerical sexual abuse, including laws to hold bishops accountable for cover-ups. Francis also sought an enlarged role for women working in the Vatican and authorized priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples.
    


            He built bridges with the Muslim world, while seeking to play the role of peacemaker in the face of global conflicts, particularly in Ukraine and the Middle East.
    


            His reforms saw him face unprecedented resistance from ultra-conservatives inside the church, although progressive Catholics felt he should have gone further in allowing the ordination of married men as priests, shifting official teaching on homosexuality and giving a greater space for women in ministry.
    


            Despite taking a series of tough measures, Francis also failed to quell the scandal of child sexual abuse and other forms of abuse that have plagued the Catholic Church — a disgrace that he made his personal responsibility to end, but which continued to damage the institutional church in multiple countries throughout his papacy.
    


            The death of Pope Francis has triggered a period of a mourning in the Vatican and signals the start of a millennia-old process of picking a new pontiff.
    


            It is a procedure steeped in tradition, but one which has been subtly updated for the modern world.
    


            The “Papal Interregnum” — the period between the death of one pope and the election of another — began when Francis passed away.
    


            Cardinals must now decide exactly when the funeral can take place, and after that, when conclave can begin. But much of the timeline is predetermined; the pope's death triggered the start of nine days of mourning known as the Novendiales, and the pope must be buried between the fourth and sixth day after death.
    


            The body of the pope must also be displayed at St. Peter's Basilica for mourning, and a mass will take place on each day. Mourners lined up for miles to see the body of Pope John Paul II, the last serving pope to die, in 2005.
    


            Then, all cardinals under the age of 80 will convene in the Vatican to pick Francis' successor.
    


            It typically takes between two and three weeks for a pope to be chosen, following the death of his predecessor, though it can stretch slightly beyond that if cardinals struggle to agree on a candidate.
    


Read more about what happens next.



            The pope's death was announced on Monday morning by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the Vatican camerlengo.
    


            “Dear brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis,” a statement from the camerlengo said.
    


                    “At 7:35 this morning the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father. His whole life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and His Church.”
                





            Farrell continued, “He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage and universal love, especially in favour of the poorest and most marginalised.”
    


                    “With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the Triune God,” the statement concluded.
                





            Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born on December 17, 1936, in Buenos Aires to parents of Italian descent. The oldest of five children, the pope often recalled fond memories of a close-knit family and of how his Italian grandmother shaped his faith.
    


            His grandparents narrowly escaped a deadly shipwreck when they migrated from Italy to Argentina, an experience that no doubt influenced his advocacy for those making perilous journeys across the Mediterranean in search of a better life in Europe.
    


            When he was 16, Bergoglio had a profound experience during confession which convinced him to train for the priesthood.
    


            He entered the seminary but three years later started training to become a Jesuit, the religious order renowned for its missionary work.
    


            His leadership abilities were recognized and in 1973, at the young age of 36, he was appointed head of the Jesuit order in Argentina, a position he would hold until 1979.
    


            He became the Bishop of Rome in 2013, setting the tone for his pontificate on the night of his election.
    


                    “Let us pray for the whole world, that there may be a great spirit of fraternity,” he said from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.
                





            He stayed true to those words, encouraging all people, no matter their religion or race, to remember their common humanity. Francis was a bridge builder, seeking to work with all faiths and denominations.

            Francis' stint at the head of the Catholic Church was unlike any in centuries.
    


            He was the first pope since the 1400s to co-exist with his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who resigned due to ill health but occasionally signaled his displeasure with the direction in which Francis was steering the church.
    


            And he brought a unique style to the Vatican. Francis famously swerved the opulence afforded to serving popes in favor of the modest trappings of his life in Argentina, where he had once worked as a janitor and a bouncer at a bar.
    


            He turned down the opportunity to move into the luxurious papal apartments, instead opting for a smaller guest house, and celebrated his first birthday in office with three homeless men living on the streets of Rome.
    


            But his tenure did not heal deep divisions within the Catholic Church, whose reputation remains deeply stained by the ongoing revelations of sexual abusers in its ranks, and whose strict teachings on social issues have raised questions about its relevance in parts of the world.
    


            Pope Francis, the first non-European pontiff in nearly 1,300 years, has died, the Vatican has announced. He was 88.
    


            The announcement would have come as a shock to many, coming less than a day after the pope made a high-profile appearance in public.
    


            While he did not appear as engaged as usual on Sunday, he still managed to address a huge crowd of worshippers.
    


            Francis gave the traditional Easter blessing from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, in what marked his highest-profile appearance yet since being discharged from hospital.
    


            Just before that, he held a brief meeting with US Vice President JD Vance.
    


            The death of Francis, who was one of the oldest popes in the church's history, came weeks after he was discharged from a Rome hospital having battled a life-threatening case of pneumonia in both lungs.
    


            His medical team said his condition had stabilized, allowing for him to continue his convalescence at his Casa Santa Marta residence back at the Vatican. Two weeks after leaving hospital, he delighted the faithful by making a surprise appearance at St. Peter's Square.
    


            The pope's tireless advocacy for migrants saw him sharply criticize US President Donald Trump's immigration deportation policies in the months before his death. Francis, whose pontificate was a counterweight to the rise of nationalist populism, often found himself under fire from powerful conservative Catholic forces in the US.
    


            Francis brought a humbler, more forward-looking approach to the Vatican and worked to soften what the Catholic Church said on social issues like homosexuality, the death penalty and the role of women.
    


            But he struggled to quell the scandal of child sex abuse that has tarnished trust in the church for decades.
    


            His death will open a debate about the future direction of the Catholic Church, with cardinals from across the globe expected to gather in Rome in the coming days to mourn the pontiff and then elect his successor.

            Meghan Bannister put on a dress for class, a choice befitting the warm weather in Tallahassee. Thursday stood out as her last day of class before graduation but by noon, the Florida State University senior had to grapple with the chilling reality of a gunman opening fire on the sprawling campus.
    


            Bannister had been practicing active shooter drills since she was in fourth grade and had heard the horror stories from her friends who experienced the 2018 Parkland high school massacre. So, when they heard the shots, she and her classmates from all different states knew exactly what to do as the school went on lockdown.

            “We sent desks to either door, we sat up against the wall altogether. We held hands, the lights came off, we fell silent, we prayed. It's so sad that everyone knew how to act,” Bannister told CNN.
    


            Students all over campus hid under desks, barricaded doors and texted loved ones as emergency sirens wailed in the background. Within four minutes after the first shot was fired, the suspected gunman, FSU student Phoenix Ikner, 20, was shot by police and taken into custody, authorities said.
    


            Thousands of students and staff received emergency alerts about the attack and went into lockdown. Two men working   near the student union were killed and five   others were wounded in the shooting. Another person was injured while trying to run away, police said. The hospital declined to say whether Ikner was one of their patients.
    


            Law enforcement officers responded just two minutes after the first   911 call reported the shooting, authorities said. University officials, along with law enforcement and school safety preparedness experts credit the rapid response from police and timely messages through the school's emergency alert system for preventing an even greater tragedy.
    


            Students like Bannister agree the response time is what saved lives: “The fact there is no student that passed away is truly a miracle and remarkable, and that is all credited to Florida State.”
    


            They followed the advice offered in the alerts as best they could but encountered a problem.
    


            “Lock and stay away from all doors and windows and be prepared to take additional protective measures,” the FSU school alert said.
    


            Bannister and her classmate Sarah Walker were inside a classroom on the second floor of the university's HCB building, which had a view of the student union. The room was located right at the top of the staircase, open to the hallway.

            As they went into lockdown, a classmate shouted to lock the doors at the front and the back of the classroom, Bannister recounted. The student who was standing at the door said in response: “These doors don't lock,” she said. “The response was, ‘What do you mean they don't lock?'”
    


            Walker said their classmates broke down. “The fear in people's faces, the shaking and the crying started really badly in everyone after we realized there were no locks on the doors,” Walker said.
    


            “The only thing I could think about was if the shooter wanted to enter a classroom building from where he was at the union, he could walk right in, to the top of the stairs. We are the first classroom. Any external person had access to that room,” Bannister said.
    


            But a university spokesperson said classroom doors in the HCB building did automatically lock — from the outside.
    


            “During a lockdown situation, like on April 17, doors in the HCB Building lock immediately as they are part of our electronic locking system that is centrally managed,” FSU spokesperson Amy Farnum-Patronis said in an email to CNN.
    


            “During normal operations, the doors in HCB are on card-swipe access, so the rooms remain locked at all times, unless there is a scheduled class,” she wrote.
    


            “If you are inside the room, you can still leave — you are not locked in, but potential threats are locked out,” Farnum-Patronis said.
    


            “As they could open the door from the inside, the students may have been under the impression that the doors were unlocked.”
    


            The spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNN's question about whether just the HCB classrooms or all campus classrooms lock from the outside (but not from the inside) during a lockdown.
    


            Before the university inspected the locks and clarified how they work, Walker and Bannister organized a petition signed by nearly 30,000 people calling for working locks on all classroom doors.

            “No one should have to be in a classroom feeling unprotected during what was the most terrifying moment of our lives. This is a basic safety measure that can no longer be overlooked,” the petition says.
    


            Many of the students sheltering in place across the campus who signed the petition said they endured similar anxiety, believing their classroom doors didn't lock.
    


            FSU students in support of the petition shared similar experiences in the comments, saying working locks would have made them feel safer. They recalled watching faculty members attempt to lock the doors “before giving up and shutting the lights off,” watching their teacher check the doors before informing them “they don't lock,” or using their body weight and chairs to hold the door closed.
    


            After learning the HCB building classrooms did lock from the outside, “all I can say is our friend that was in the bathroom that came back into our room to let us know about the situation before it hit all our phones was that she walked right in,” Walker wrote Monday in a text to CNN.
    


            “I haven't been contacted by any FSU faculty. None of our professor's were under that impression. If that's the case we and thousands of other students had ZERO idea that was even occurring. The only way SWAT personally got into our room was our instructor opening the door for them,” Walker said.
    


            “Regardless we should have been briefed on this as a student body and i'm shocked, if this is the case, that we haven't been informed.”
    


            Walker said although the locks may have been locked from the outside, they are asking the university to equip all doors to be manually lockable from the inside.
    


            Brian Higgins, who teaches emergency preparedness and response at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and consults several colleges for active shooter response, said locks are “an integral part of an active shooter response plan.”
    


            Colleges and universities like FSU are more challenging to fully lock down due to the open nature of their campuses, compared to K-12 schools, which are typically more enclosed, according to Juliette Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst who works with schools on security planning. This can make them a soft target for such attacks, she said.
    


            “It's a unique population. They have a tremendous amount of freedom … Classes that don't take attendance, they can sleep wherever they want,” Kayyem said. At the same time, parents and families represent the outside stakeholders who have a key interest in emergency situations like an active shooter, she added.
    


            Another challenge is perimeter control because colleges and universities exist as open environments for classes, social activities and extracurriculars, Kayyem said. FSU's campus, for example, is roughly the size of 400 football fields.
    


            “The idea of ‘safe,' can't exist in this environment, so what you do is try to make these universities safer,” Kayyem said, like controlling access to buildings, strong lines of communication, security planning and lockdown training. The goal, she added, is to fortify the campus with relatively easy, cost-effective ways to minimize the likelihood of a high fatality event.
    


            The speedy police response to Thursday's shooting aligns with the commonly taught active shooter protocol established after the Columbine school shooting of 1999, when Colorado police waited roughly an hour after gunfire erupted in the school for SWAT teams to arrive, during which two young men killed 13 people.
    


            “The active shooter training is different now. The first on the scene get in there, go to the sound of gunfire, neutralize the individual to avoid more people being seriously injured or killed,” said Charles Ramsey, former police chief of the Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia police departments.
    


            Ramsey said of the police response to the FSU shooting: “It was absolutely incredible how fast they got there … Within two minutes, they arrived on the scene and were able to neutralize the individual to keep him from causing even more harm.”
    


            In an active shooter response plan, security planning consultant Brian Higgins says, “there are no silver bullets,” as relying on a single protocol could lead to failure. “Even if they have all the locks working, it could be at that very moment in a panic somebody doesn't turn the handle all the way and the hatch doesn't catch,” he added.
    


            FSU adopted a “Run, Hide, Fight” protocol similar to other schools in responding to an active shooter event, which involves a one-hour training class led by the campus police department's Crime Prevention Officers, according to its website.

            While no method is perfect, Kayyem said the quick dissemination of information through alert systems is vital for students to know where the biggest threat is coming from, so they know what actions to take. It includes the capacity to lock-in, she added.
    


            “I felt powerless, so unsafe, so unsettled,” Walker said. Bannister said the anticipation of waiting for someone to enter the classroom, either the SWAT team or the shooter, was “the scariest and worst moment of my life.”
    


            It never crossed their minds to check whether their classroom doors could lock, but now both Bannister and Walker say they will never again feel safe in a confined room without the protective measure.
    


            The two students commended Florida State University for its response to the tragedy, offering psychological services and deadline extensions.
    


            “You never think that this could happen to you,” said Bannister. “I wouldn't be able to get through this if it wasn't for them. I'm so proud to be a Seminole. We are unconquered.”
    


            Walker agreed, saying she will always remember how her classmates banded together to stay strong and calm each other down.
    


            “I just want to say how much I love my classmates. I'll never forget their faces,” Walker said through tears. “We just did the best we could in the moment. I'll never forget that classroom … I hope we all stay in touch for life after this.”

            Scores of foreign students across the country are included in a pair of sweeping lawsuits that allege the Trump administration unlawfully stripped them of their legal status amid a broader crackdown on immigration.
    


            By CNN's tally, more than 1,000 students and graduates have had their visas or statuses revoked, undermining their ability to remain in the US and continue their studies. Cases have ranged from high-profile instances involving alleged support of terror organizations to relatively minor offenses, like years-old misdemeanors.
    


            While some affected students have brought individual cases, at least two federal lawsuits filed in courts in Georgia and New Hampshire aim to represent large swaths of students at once – more than a hundred in each.
    


            “I can file 133 lawsuits, but I think the court wouldn't be happy about that, so we're filing one,” Charles Kuck, the attorney for one of the cases and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told CNN Sunday. Lawyers are expensive; grouping the cases together, Kuck said, made it possible for the plaintiffs to afford representation while ensuring his firm, Kuck Baxter, could litigate the case.
    


            The state affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union have also championed the cases.
    


            Both cases are focused on the plaintiffs' lawful status as foreign students, which the lawsuits argue is distinct from the visa allowing them entry into the United States: The complaints allege the government unlawfully stripped the students of their status, leaving them vulnerable to detention or deportation.
    


            Kuck told CNN he was aware of at least 10 other lawsuits filed on behalf of international students that made similar arguments.
    


            Asked for comment about the lawsuits, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the ACLU “should consider changing their name.”
    


            “The American Civil Liberties Union appears far more interested in protecting foreign students than then (sic) civil liberties and safety of Americans,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN.
    


            “It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live & study in the United States of America,” McLaughlin said. “When you break our laws and advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country.”
    


            Here's what we know.
    


            At the heart of both lawsuits is the difference between a foreign student's visa and their legal status as a student.
    


            There are several types of visas for international students studying in the United States. Both lawsuits deal with F-1 visas, among the most common type of student visa.
    


            The visa, however, is distinct from a student's status, these lawsuits argue: The visa allows foreign students to enter the United States. Once admitted, they must “maintain” their status by pursuing their course of study, avoiding unauthorized employment and adhering to other rules.
    


            While a person's legal status – their ability to remain in the United States – is determined by US Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security, visas are issued by the State Department. DHS may initiate the termination of status for several reasons, one of the lawsuits notes, including by revoking a special waiver issued on the individual's behalf, the introduction of a private bill to make them a permanent resident, or following a notification to the federal register citing national security, diplomatic or public safety reasons.
    


            The expiration of an exchange visitor visa does not typically mean that person is immediately considered to be in the US illegally: ICE's website notes someone can stay in the US even if their F-1 visa is expired – so long as they maintain their status.
    


            Neither lawsuit challenges the students' visa revocations – rather, they allege the Trump administration unlawfully terminated the plaintiffs' legal status, kneecapping the students' ability to continue working and studying in the United States and jeopardizing their plans for completing their programs.
    


            The first lawsuit – initially filed in the Northern District of Georgia on April 11 – originally included 17 foreign students attending colleges and universities in Georgia, Louisiana, Arizona, Texas, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Missouri, Illinois and New York. Nine of those students were from India; five were from China and one each were from Colombia, Mexico and Japan.
    


            The case has since ballooned, with 133 foreign students included among the plaintiffs –– all of whom are identified using pseudonyms “due to fear of retaliation by Defendants.” US Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Acting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons are all named as defendants.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Justice Department office for comment.
    


            On Friday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order directing the government to reinstate the plaintiffs' student status by Tuesday while the case proceeds.
    


            The complaint argues the Trump administration terminated their statuses by removing the students from the Student and Exchange Visitor System, or SEVIS – an online database schools use to provide the government legally required information about international students.
    


            According to the complaint, the plaintiffs' SEVIS records were marked as “OTHER - Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked. SEVIS record has been terminated,” or “Otherwise Failing to Maintain Status.”
    


            The lawsuit acknowledges some of the plaintiffs have faced criminal allegations or charges, but none have a criminal conviction. None have violated the restriction that requires them not to be convicted of a violent crime carrying a sentence longer than one year, the lawsuit says.
    


            For example, Jane Doe 1, a college student in Georgia, believes she is being targeted for a domestic violence case dismissed in February because “there was no underlying proof of any crime,” the complaint says. John Doe 2, also a Georgia student, believes he's being targeted for traffic citations, including driving with an expired license plate while his driver's license was withdrawn; his case was ultimately closed.
    


            Regardless, the revocation of a visa is not grounds for the termination of student status, the lawsuit argues: “A nonimmigrant visa controls a noncitizen's admission into the United States, not their continued stay.”
    


            “Rather,” the lawsuit says, “DHS's act of unlawfully terminating SEVIS records appears to be designed to coerce students, including each Plaintiff, into abandoning their studies and ‘self-deporting' despite not violating their status.”
    


            Attorneys for the plaintiffs celebrated the Friday ruling. Another hearing is set for Thursday.
    


            “We believe this ruling shows the students are likely to prevail on their claims and we are pleased the court ordered the government to halt its unlawful actions while the lawsuit continues,” Akiva Freidlin, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia said in a statement Saturday.
    


            The second lawsuit contains similar arguments. Filed Friday in the District of New Hampshire, it so far represents five international students: Three, all from India, attend Rivier University in New Hampshire, while two others are from China and attend the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.
    


            However, the suit proposes to represent far more: The plaintiffs' attorneys have asked the court to certify the case as a class action, which means it could include many other students in similar situations. The lawsuit notes at least 112 students have had their F-1 status terminated in New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico.
    


            Sec. Noem, acting ICE Director Lyons, DHS and ICE are all named among the defendants.
    


            Again, the plaintiffs allege they were stripped of their student status unlawfully.
    


            One of the plaintiffs, a 23-year-old, claims to have received an email this month from his school notifying him his SEVIS record indicated he had failed to maintain status. “Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked,” it read, according to the lawsuit. “SEVIS record has been terminated.”
    


            The language closely echoes that cited in the Georgia case.
    


            The New Hampshire lawsuit also acknowledges the students had faced run-ins with police, mostly for traffic-related offenses.
    


            “The only criminal matters the individual Plaintiffs have encountered are either dismissed non-violent misdemeanor charges or driving without a valid US driver's license (but using an international or foreign driver's license),” the lawsuit says.
    


            “While Defendants' reasons for these mass terminations of student status are unclear, what is clear is that these terminations – across the board – flout the applicable regulations governing student status termination and the regulations governing failure to maintain student status.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump repeated his attacks Monday against the chair of the Federal Reserve, demanding that the central bank lower its key interest rate to boost the economy. 

Trump called Powell “a major loser” and said that energy and grocery prices are “substantially lower” and “there is virtually No Inflation.” Yet Trump said the economy could slow without rate cuts.

Gas prices have fallen for the past two months, in part because oil costs have dropped on fears of slower growth, but food prices jumped in January and March and overall inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target.

Trump's comments drove the stock market and the dollar lower as investors in the U.S. and overseas grow increasingly wary about the economic standing of the U.S. On Friday, a top White House adviser said the administration is studying whether it can fire Powell, a move that would undermine the Fed's independence and likely send shock waves through global financial markets. 

The stock market, which fell immediately at the opening bell Monday, tumbled further after Trump's post, with Dow dropping by more than 1,000 points and the broad S&P 500 stock index falling nearly 3% in mid-day trading. The dollar fell to a three-year low.

The Federal Reserve was established as an independent agency and most economists think central banks that are free of political interference do a better job at keeping inflation in check. Otherwise, it would be harder for the Fed to take unpopular steps to keep prices down, such as raising interest rates. 




The interest rate on 10-year Treasuries has been rising as Trump rolled out aggressive tariff policies against trading partners and continues to attack Powell and the Federal Reserve. The interest rate ticked higher again on Monday to 4.37%. 

The dollar losing value is unusual when stock prices fall and Treasury yields rise because investors typically buy U.S. government bonds during market turmoil, driving down the yield. Instead, investors appear to be avoiding U.S. markets due to the perception of rising risk. 

Trump also criticized Powell for being “too late” to move on interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have long acknowledged that they waited too long to raise rates when inflation was first ignited in 2021. 

But right now, Powell has underscored that the Fed faces a potentially “challenging scenario.” Trump's tariffs could worsen inflation, and the Fed would typically respond to rising prices by keeping its rate elevated, or even raising it. Yet the economy could also slow because of the duties, which the Fed would normally seek to counter with rate cuts. 

“Our tool only does one of those two things at the same time,” Powell said last week.

As a result, Powell has underscored that the Fed will stay on the sidelines as it waits to see how the tariff policies play out. 

Trump lashed out at Powell on Friday and said he could fire him if he wanted, though it would likely touch off a legal battle that could go to the Supreme Court. Powell has said the president lacks the authority to fire him and has made clear he won't step down until his term ends in May 2026. 

Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, when asked Friday whether firing Powell is an option, said that Trump “and his team will continue to study that matter.” Hassett also accused Powell of acting politically. 

Trump made a similar claim in his Truth Social post, accusing the Fed chair of cutting rates last year “in order to help Sleepy Joe Biden, later Kamala, get elected.” The Fed reduced its key rate three times in late 2024 as inflation cooled and out of concern that hiring was also slowing, though it later rebounded. 

On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's “Meet the Press” and added that, “I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.” 

“The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,” he said. 

Also Sunday, Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve's Chicago branch, said on CBS' “Face the Nation” that undermining the Federal Reserve's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth, and less hiring. 

And William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, said Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't “going to make the American people better off over time.” 

“They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,” he said.

Demure, submissive and erotic, Suzie Wong is that bigger-than-life stereotype, that caricature Asian women grew up with in the U.S. 

We may have also secretly hoped to play that geisha-like image to win our way out of our oppression. But over the years, some of us grew to resent it, fight it and reject it, hoping to claim our true identity and dignity as a person. 

In “The World of Nancy Kwan,” a memoir by the pioneer Hollywood star, we hear from the real-life woman who played Suzie Wong.

We learn an Asian actor getting to play an Asian role was a victory back in those days, as the roles were taken by white actors wearing strange slant-eyed makeup. 

Kwan was born in Hong Kong in 1939. Her father was Chinese, an architect with a love for movies. Her mother was English, a model and actor, although she left when Kwan was young, and she was raised by a stepmother. It was hard because being Eurasian was an anomaly, she recalls. 

“I've broken barriers, celebrated achievements, overcome disappointments and survived tragedies, all part of my remarkable journey from Hong Kong to Hollywood and beyond. This is my story,” she writes in the prologue.

Her book is speckled with the big names of that era, Pat Boone, Katherine Hepburn, Dick Van Dyke. Some passages read like a gossip column, such as her accounts of her friendship with Bruce Lee.

But she also depicts the racial barriers of that period.




All women, especially in Hollywood, were trying to be beautiful and desirable. In fact, being dubbed “the Asian Bardot,” referring to Brigette Bardot, was a genuine compliment.

She talks about how Jack Soo, a Japanese American who portrays a nightclub owner in “Flower Drum Song,” was incarcerated with other Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II. 

Kwan believes her story is about hard work and advancement despite racism, not succumbing to it.

After all, Asian actors' roles used to be limited to “Fu Manchu villains, hypersexualized Dragon Ladies and comic buffoons” and “shopkeepers, maids and houseboys,” according to Kwan. 

And so getting featured on the cover of Life magazine, wearing a body-hugging cheongsam, counted as a victory.

Another big win is when Ross Hunter, a hot producer, rushes over to her at a Hollywood party and casts her in “Flower Drum Song.”

The musical film shattered stereotypes, she says, by focusing on fashionably dressed, wealthy Asians. Regardless of race, people cherish family, suffer heartbreak, laugh, sing, dance and dream of happiness, she writes. 

Kwan calls the work “joyous entertainment with the universal message that whatever our race, we're all alike.”

Even those who may find that message lacking in addressing the meaning of diversity and Asian American pride will acknowledge there is a lot to learn from Kwan's history.

She is simply trying to land roles, hopefully good ones that showcase her talent in works by respected directors.

Miyoshi Umeki, her friend and another prominent Asian actor of that period, did not like having to speak pidgin in her roles, but did it because that was her job as a professional. 

That kind of pain is the legacy being explored in Kwan's life.

Being an Asian in America is what she calls “our shared humanity,” in which “East can meet West and possibly make the world a little better.”

Pope Francis has died. He was history's first Latin American pontiff who charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change. He was 88.

Pope Francis, history's first Latin American pontiff who charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change, died Monday. He was 88.

Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and is home to around 30 million Catholics, roughly 14% of the country's population.

President Bola Tinubu, who is Muslim, said Pope Francis was “a steadfast advocate for the developing world.”

“He challenged the powerful to act with justice, called nations to welcome the stranger, and reminded us that our common home—this Earth—is a gift we must protect for future generations,” Tinubu said in a post on X. 

After his 38-day hospital stay, Francis stopped by the basilica on his way home on March 23, delivering flowers to be placed before the icon of the Virgin Mary.

He returned on April 12 to pray before the Madonna for the last time.

Francis wanted to be buried not in St. Peter's Basilica or its grottoes under the Vatican — where most popes are buried — but in the St. Mary Major Basilica across town in Rome. 

His choice reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary located there, the Salus Populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome).

After every foreign trip, Francis would go to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book.

Pope Francis simplified the funeral rituals last year to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes.

In the short text, Pope Francis decreed he would be buried in a simple underground tomb — with only “Franciscus” written on it — at St. Mary Major Basilica, home to Francis' favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, to whom he was particularly devoted.

Francis thanked those who prayed for him and asked for continued prayers.

“The suffering that became present in the latter part of my life I offered it to the Lord for world peace and brotherhood among peoples,” he concluded.

The will was dated June 29, 2022.

The Vatican says Pope Francis died of a cerebral stroke that put him into a coma and led to irreversible heart failure. The death was confirmed Monday by Dr. Andrea Arcangeli, the head of the Vatican's health department.

In a statement, he noted that Francis also suffered from episodes of respiratory insufficiency and had had bilateral pneumonia, as well as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Francis died Monday at 7:35 a.m.

The prime duty of the all-male corps, with its colorful uniforms and plumed helmets, is to protect the pope. The members stand guard during papal ceremonies as well as at the various entrances of the Vatican — a tiny, independent walled city-state near Rome's Tiber River.

The Catholic archbishop of Mexico City, Carlos Aguiar Retes, highlighted Pope Francis' devotion toward Our Lady of Guadalupe, patron saint of Mexico's more than 100 million Catholics.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote on X that the pope “leaves behind a great legacy of true love for one's neighbors.”

Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who received the pope four years ago in a historic meeting, said Francis was “greatly respected by all for his distinguished role in serving the causes of peace and tolerance, and for expressing solidarity with the oppressed and persecuted across the globe.”

As the sun sets over St. Peter's Square, the Vatican has begun a Rosary prayer for Francis, who died after offering his final blessing from the square on Easter Sunday.

Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, archpriest of St. Peter's Basilica, led the Vatican's first public commemoration following the pope's death.

At the start of the Rosary, Gambetti bowed before an icon of the Madonna as a choir sang.

The first reading was delivered by Sister Raffaella Petrini, the president of the Vatican City State and one of the highest ranking women at the Vatican, whose appointment was a sign of his insistance that women be given more prominent, decision-making roles.

The South Sudan Council of Churches says it remembers with gratitude Francis' visit to the country and his “dedicated efforts to promote healing and unity among our leaders.” 

The pope once famously knelt and kissed the feet of rivals President Salva Kiir and deputy Riek Machar, which the council called “a profound act of humility.” 

Tensions continue, however, recently raising fears of a return to civil war.

To mourn Pope Francis, the Home Ministry said the Indian flag would be flown at half mast on government buildings nationwide for the next two days as well as the day of pontiff's funeral. There will also be no official entertainment activities.

India has roughly 30 million Christians, about 2.3% of the country's population.

Russian President Vladimir Putin says “the pope has done a lot of good not only for his flock, but also for the entire world.”

He noted in televised remarks that Pope Francis passed away immediately after Easter, suggesting, “This is a special sign that the person has lived their life not in vain and has done a lot of good.”

All professional matches in Argentina are postponed for a day due to the pope's death, the country's soccer body AFA said.

The games moved to Tuesday will be preceded by a minute of silence to mourn Francis, who was the Archbishop of Buenos Aires before being elected pope. 

Games in Italy have also been postponed.

The U.S. House Speaker Emerita from California said it was a high honor to attend Pope Francis' installation in 2013 and to be in the House chamber during his historic address to the Congress in 2015. 

“In San Francisco, we take special pride in Pope Francis, as he shares the namesake of our City and honors the call of our anthem, the Song of Saint Francis, to be an ‘instrument of peace,'” Pelosi said.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Francis leaves behind “a legacy of faith, service and compassion for all — especially those left on the margins of life or trapped by the horrors of conflict.”

Guterres said the United Nations was greatly inspired by his message during a visit to U.N. headquarters in 2015, supporting the organization's ideal of “a united human family.”

President Donald Trump says he signed an executive order lowering U.S. flags at half-staff in recognition of the passing of Pope Francis.

“He was a good man,” Trump said. “He loved the world and it's an honor to do that.”

Marathon runners and spectators in Boston shared their reactions Monday to the death of Pope Francis.

One of Pope Francis' final encounters before his death was with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who visited the Vatican over the weekend.

The meeting took place on Easter Sunday. Vance, a Catholic convert, entered the room and reached down for the pope's hand. “Hello,” the vice president said. “So good to see you.”

Vance's visit was not without political sensitivities, and he met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin on Saturday for what the Vatican described as “an exchange of opinions.” The Catholic Church, under Francis' leadership, has championed the rights of migrants, while Vance and President Donald Trump have advocated for crackdowns.

Vance's office said the vice president and the cardinal “discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump's commitment to restoring world peace.”

Francis' address to Congress came at a pivotal moment in bitterly divided Washington in 2015.

He called on American lawmakers to create a “culture of care” in welcoming immigrants, protecting the environment and sharing the nation's wealth with those less fortunate.

Afterward, the pope spoke from a Capitol balcony, greeting thousands with “buenos dias.” He had been invited by the U.S. House then-embattled Republican speaker, John Boehner, himself a Catholic, who teared up at times, and announced his own resignation the next day.

In Francis' hometown of Buenos Aires, Argentines gathered for Mass. Some cried. “I think he was a rebel. He may have been contradictory, but that was nice, too,” said worshipper Catalina Favaro.

Bishop Jorge García Cuerva told those gathered that “the pope of everyone has died. The pope of all humanity who insisted one and a thousand times that there must be room for everyone.”

The pope's beloved soccer team — Buenos Aires club San Lorenzo, who nickname is “The Saints” — wrote “Goodbye, Holy Father” on its website. The team won the national championship in 2013, the year Francis was elected pope.

The death of a pope initiates a centuries' old ritual to elect a new pontiff



The historic Sigismund Bell in Krakow, Poland, which is reserved only for the most national important events, rang out to mark the death of Francis.

But across mostly Catholic Poland, the death of Francis was met with nothing like the outpouring of grief when the Polish-born Pope John Paul II died 20 years ago. People then flooded the streets and filled churches in grief at the loss of a spiritual leader and a national hero – a man credited with helping bring about the fall of communism.

“I am better for having known him,” Biden, a Catholic who regularly attends Mass, wrote on X, where he described him as “the People's Pope.” 

The former president's political agenda overlapped with Francis' vision for the Catholic Church, including a focus on environmental protection. They met at the Vatican in 2021 at a time when some conservatives thought Biden shouldn't be allowed to receive Communion because of his support for abortion. 

Biden planned to visit Francis one more time before leaving office, but the trip was canceled because of devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area. He instead awarded the pope with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a phone call.

Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune called Francis an “immense personality” and said he “wrote his name in golden letters in modern history.”

Though Christians have been increasingly targeted for proselytizing in Muslim-majority Algeria, the Catholic Church enjoys official recognition. Tebboune met Vatican officials when they visited on behalf of Francis in 2022, touring sites including the monastery where a group of Trappist monks were killed during the country's civil war. 

Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle said Francis was “the rare leader who made us want to be better people.

“In his humility and his gestures at once simple and profound — embracing the sick, ministering to the homeless, washing the feet of young prisoners — he shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God and one another,” the Obamas said in a statement. 

Any baptized Catholic male is eligible, though only cardinals have been selected since 1378. The winner must receive at least two-thirds of the vote from those cardinals under age 80 and thus eligible to participate.

Here's a look at a few of the possible candidates:

The death of a pope starts a centuries-old ritual involving sacred oaths by the cardinals electing a successor, the piercing of ballots with a needle and thread after they're counted, and then burning them to produce either the white or black smoke to signal if there's a new leader for the world's 1.3 billion Catholics.

Here's a look at the process: 

After the pope has died, the camerlengo, or chamberlain, must certify the death and seal the papal apartment. He runs administrative and financial duties of the Holy See until a new pope takes over.

The largely ceremonial job of camerlengo is currently held by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the Irish-born American head of the Vatican's laity office, who also announced the death on Monday morning.

The death of a pope begins a precise sequence of events that include the confirmation of death in the pontiff's home, the transfer of the coffin to St. Peter's Basilica for public viewing, a funeral Mass and burial. Interment must take place between the fourth and sixth day after his death.

After the funeral, there are nine days of official mourning, known as the “novendiali.”

During this period, the cardinals arrive in Rome. To give everyone time to assemble, the conclave must begin 15-20 days after the “sede vacante” is declared, although it can start sooner if the cardinals agree.

Only cardinals under age 80 are eligible to vote. Current regulations notionally limit the number of electors to 120, but popes have often exceeded that ceiling. According to the most recently updated Vatican statistics, there were 135 cardinals under age 80 and eligible to vote. Cardinals over age 80 can be elected pope.

Those over 80 can't vote but can participate in pre-conclave meetings, known as general congregations, in which church problems are discussed. It was in these meetings in 2013 that then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio spoke about the need for the church to go to the “existential peripheries” to find those who suffer — an off-the-cuff speech that helped his election.

“Where Francis had supreme power, he refused to make the necessary changes,” said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the U.S.-based group BishopAccountability.

David Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, noted the pope's “prompt and impressive action” on other matters but said the pope's “genial personality and warm demeanor distracted many from the unhealthy and still essentially unaddressed structural and cultural flaws in the church that cause kids to keep being hurt.”

In a message of condolences following Francis' death Monday, Mattarella focused on what Francis decided to do on Easter Sunday, when he appeared on the same loggia where he first was introduced to the world after his 2013 election, and delivered the Easter Urbi et Orbi blessing (Latin for “to the city and the world”). 

After delivering the blessing, Francis delighted the crowd of some 35,000 people with a long loops of greeting from his popemobile.

“One thought stands out over everything — what he decided to do yesterday — on Easter, with his blessing to the world and his tour of the square among the faithful, with his final reminder of the principle of humanity as the criterion of conduct for each person,” Mattarella said. “Today it appears as a greeting to the church, to women and men around the world.”

Pope Francis has died. He was history's first Latin American pontiff who charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change. He was 88.



The period will start on Tuesday, Justice Minister Félix Bolaños said on Monday.

Bolaños on X called Francis a “good man and a great Pope” and praised his defense of the weak, saying that Francis's “reformist” 12-year papacy would “leave a great legacy in the Church and in the world.”

The pope visited Africa five times, acknowledging the strong growth of the Catholic Church there. He often spoke about issues at the heart of the region, from climate change to marginalization.

The pope was “very unambiguous in telling world powers to stop exploiting Africans,” said the Rev. Michael Nsikak Umoh, spokesperson for the Nigerian bishops' association.

In Congo, where pope visited in 2023 to demand that foreign powers stop plundering Africa's natural resources, Abbé Camille Esika in the capital, Kinshasa, said Francis “wanted to be the voice of the voiceless.”

The South African Catholic Bishops' Conference has encouraged all Catholics to pray for those choosing his successor.

The Pope's last day, Easter Sunday, was marked by an appearance on the Loggia balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, meeting the faithful in the piazza below, and a private meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance.



Pope Francis died Monday. He was 88. His last public appearances, on Easter Sunday, were marked by a speech from the Loggia balcony and a meeting with crowds outside St. Peter's Basilica.



In an appearance on Fox News, Karoline Leavitt pointed to President Donald Trump's statement about the pope's passing and added that the pope “touched millions of lives throughout his tenure as the head of the Catholic Church and so it's a solemn day for Catholics around the world and we are praying for all those who loved the pope and believed in him.”

The date will be confirmed when cardinals gather Tuesday morning, for the first time since Francis' death, to make the first decisions about funeral plans and other urgent matters.

Francis' coffin will be moved from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta hotel, where he lived, to St. Peter's Basilica for public viewing.

According to a new ritual Francis approved last year, the body of the pope will be placed in a wooden coffin, with a zinc coffin inside. The pope will be dressed in red liturgical vestments, his miter — the traditional headdress of bishops — and the pallium woolen stole, a kind of scarf.

When the body is brought into the basilica, the Litany of Saints chant is sung. The camerlengo, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, leads the procession.

In a change ordered by Francis, the pope's body will no longer placed on an elevated bier in the basilica. Rather, the simplified wooden coffin is placed facing the pews, with the Pasqual candle nearby.

No date for the funeral has been announced, but it must be held between four and six days after the death.

The Vatican said they met for a few minutes at the Domus Santa Marta “to exchange Easter greetings.” Vance and the pope have tangled sharply over migration and the Trump administration's plans to deport migrants en masse.



Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism — an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform synagogues in North America -- said the relationship between the Catholic and Jewish communities flourished under Francis.

“He honored the shared heritage of our faiths and took meaningful steps to heal historical wounds, reinforcing a path toward mutual respect and collaboration,” he said. 

He said the group especially appreciated Francis's consistent calls for dialogue and mutual respect between Israelis and Palestinians, emphasizing the necessity of a two-state solution that ensures security and self-determination for both. 

“In Jewish tradition, when a righteous soul dies, we say, based on Proverbs 10:7, ‘The memory of the righteous is a blessing.' With Pope Francis, we are certain that his memory will be a source of inspiration to all people of faith as we continue his extraordinary life's work of building a world rooted in love, justice, and peace.”

President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!”

The Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has offered prayers and condolences for Francis to his spiritual brothers, sisters and followers around the world.

He said in a letter that Francis had dedicated himself to the service of others, “consistently revealing by his own actions how to live a simple, but meaningful life. The best tribute we can pay to him is to be a warm-hearted person, serving others wherever and in whatever way we can.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Stores selling secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories are poised to benefit from President Donald Trump'strade war even as businesses the world over race to avert potential damage, according to industry experts.

American styles carry international influence, but nearly all of the clothing sold domestically is made elsewhere. The Yale University Budget Lab last week estimated short-term consumer price increases of 65% for clothes and 87% for leather goods, noting U.S. tariffs “disproportionately affect” those goods.

Such price hikes may drive cost-conscious shoppers to online resale sites, consignment boutiques and thrift stores in search of bargains or a way to turn their wardrobes into cash. Used items cost less than their new equivalents and only would be subject to tariffs if they come from outside the country. 

“I think resale is going to grow in a market that is declining,” said Kristen Classi-Zummo, an apparel industry analyst at market research firm Circana. “What I think is going to continue to win in this chaotic environment are channels that bring value.”

The outlook for pre-owned fashion nevertheless comes with unknowns, including whether the president's tariffs will stay long enough to pinch consumers and change their behavior. It's also unclear whether secondhand purveyors will increase their own prices, either to mirror the overall market or in response to shopper demand. 

Jan Genovese, a retired fashion executive, sells her unwanted designer clothes through customer-to-customer marketplaces like Mercari. If tariffs cause retail prices to rise, she would consider high-end secondhand sites. 

“Until I see it and really have that sticker shock, I can't say exclusively that I'll be pushed into another direction,” Genovese, 75, said. “I think that the tariff part of it is that you definitely rethink things. And maybe I will start looking at alternative venues.”

The secondhand clothing market already was flourishing before the specter of tariffs bedeviled the U.S. fashion industry. Management consulting firm McKinsey and Co. predicted after the COVID-19 pandemic that global revenue from pre-owned fashion would grow 11 times faster than retail apparel sales by this year as shoppers looked to save money or spend it in a more environmentally conscious way. 

While millennials and members of Generation Z were known as the primary buyers of used clothing, data from market research firm Sensor Tower shows the audience may be expanding. 

The number of mobile app downloads for nine resale marketplaces the firm tracks — eBay, OfferUp, Poshmark, Mercari, Craigslist, Depop, ThredUp, TheRealReal and Vinted — increased by 3% between January and the end of March, the first quarterly gain in three years, Sensor Tower said. 

The firm estimates downloads of the apps for eBay, Depop, ThredUp and The RealReal also surged compared to a year earlier for the week of March 31, which was when Trump unveiled since-paused punitive tariffs on dozens of countries. 

Circana's Classi-Zummo said that while customers used to seek out collectible or unusual vintage pieces to supplement their wardrobes, she has noticed more shoppers turning to secondhand sites to replace regular fashion items.

“It's still a cheaper option” than buying new, even though retailers offer discounts, she said.

Poshmark, a digital platform where users buy and sell pre-owned clothing, has yet to see sales pick up under the tariff schedule Trump unveiled but is prepared to capitalize on the moment, CEO Manish Chandra said. 

Companies operating e-commerce marketplaces upgrade their technology to make it easier to find items. A visual search tool and other improvements to the Poshmark experience will “pay long dividends in terms of disruption that happens in the market” from the tariffs, Chandra said. 

Archive, a San Francisco-based technology company that builds and manages online and in-store resale programs for brands including Dr. Martens, The North Face and Lululemon, has noticed clothing labels expressing more urgency to team up, CEO Emily Gittins said. 

“Tapping into all of the inventory that is already sitting in the U.S., either in people's closets or in warehouses not being used,” offers a revenue source while brands limit or suspend orders from foreign manufacturers, she said. 

“There's a huge amount of uncertainty,” Gittins said. “Everyone believes that this is going to be hugely damaging to consumer goods brands that sell in the U.S. So resale is basically where everyone's head is going.” 

Stock analysts have predicted off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores will weather tariffs more easily than regular apparel chains and department stores because they carry leftover merchandise in the U.S. 

Still, resale vendors aren't immune from tariff-induced upheavals, said Rachel Kibbe, founder and CEO of Circular Services Group, a firm that advises brands and retailers on reducing the fashion industry's environmental impact. 

U.S. sellers that import secondhand inventory from European Union countries would have to pay a 20% duty if Trump moves forward with instituting “reciprocal” tariffs on most trading partners and eliminates an import tax exception for parcels worth less than $800, Kibbe said. 

A circular fashion coalition she leads is seeking a tariff exemption for used and recycled goods that will be offered for resale, Kibbe said. Trump already ended the duty-free provision for low-value parcels from China, a move that may benefit sellers of secondhand clothing by making low-priced Chinese fashions pricier, she said. 

James Reinhart, co-founder and CEO of the online consignment marketplace ThredUp, said the removal of the “de minimis” provision and the 145% tariff Trump put on products made in China would benefit businesses like his. He doubts creating resale channels would make a big difference for individual brands.

“Brands will explore this and they may do more, but I don't see them massively changing their operations,” Reinhart said. “I think they're going to be figuring out how to survive. And I don't think resale helps you survive.”

Rebag, an online marketplace and retail chain that sells used designer handbags priced from $500 to tens of thousands of dollars, expects tariffs to help drive new customers and plans to open more physical stores, CEO Charles Gorra said. 

Gorra said the company would analyze prices for new luxury goods and adjust what Rebag charges accordingly. The two historically rose in tandem, but Rebag could not match Chanel's 10% price increase last year because of lower resale demand, Gorra said. 

“That has nothing to do with the tariffs,” he said. “Consumers are feeling priced out.”

Norah Brotman, 22, a senior at the University of Minnesota, buys most of her own clothes on eBay. She also thrifts fashions from the 1990s and early 2000s at Goodwill stores and resells them on Depop. 

If tariffs upend the economics of fast fashion and discourage mindless consumption, Brotman would count that as a plus. 

“I would love if this would steer people in a different direction,” she said.

Moments after Daniris Espinal walked into her new apartment in Brooklyn, she prayed. In ensuing nights, she would awaken and touch the walls for reassurance — finding in them a relief that turned to tears over her morning coffee. 

Those walls were possible through a federal program that pays rent for some 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence. Espinal was fleeing both.

But the program, Emergency Housing Vouchers, is running out of money — and quickly.

Funding is expected to be used up by the end of next year, according to a letter from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and obtained by The Associated Press. That would leave tens of thousands across the country scrambling to pay their rent.

It would be among the largest one-time losses of rental assistance in the U.S., analysts say, and the ensuing evictions could churn these people — after several years of rebuilding their lives — back onto the street or back into abusive relationships.

“To have it stop would completely upend all the progress that they've made,” said Sonya Acosta, policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which researches housing assistance.

“And then you multiply that by 59,000 households,” she said.




The program, launched in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden as part of the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, was allocated $5 billion to help pull people out of homelessness, domestic violence and human trafficking.




People from San Francisco to Dallas to Tallahassee, Florida, were enrolled — among them children, seniors and veterans — with the expectation that funding would last until the end of the decade.

But with the ballooning cost of rent, that $5 billion will end far faster.

Last month, HUD sent letters to groups dispersing the money, advising them to “manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.” 

The program's future rests with Congress, which could decide to add money as it crafts the federal budget. But it's a relatively expensive prospect at a time when Republicans, who control Congress, are dead set on cutting federal spending to afford tax cuts.

Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who championed the program four years ago, is pushing for another $8 billion infusion. 

But the organizations lobbying Republican and Democratic lawmakers to re-up the funding told the AP they aren't optimistic. Four GOP lawmakers who oversee the budget negotiations did not respond to AP requests for comment.

“We've been told it's very much going to be an uphill fight,” said Kim Johnson, the public policy manager at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

Espinal and her two daughters, aged 4 and 19, are living on one of those vouchers in a three-bedroom apartment with an over $3,000 monthly rent — an amount extremely difficult to cover without the voucher.

Four years ago, Espinal fought her way out of a marriage where her husband controlled her decisions, from seeing her family and friends to leaving the apartment to go shopping.

When she spoke up, her husband said she was wrong, or in the wrong or crazy.

Isolated and in the haze of postpartum depression, she didn't know what to believe. “Every day, little by little, I started to feel not like myself,” she said. “It felt like my mind wasn't mine.”

When notices arrived in March 2021 seeking about $12,000 in back rent, it was a shock. Espinal had quit her job at her husband's urging and he had promised to cover family expenses.

Police reports documenting her husband's bursts of anger were enough for a judge to give her custody of their daughter in 2022, Espinal said. 

But her future was precarious: She was alone, owed thousands of dollars in back rent and had no income to pay it or support her newborn and teenage daughters.

Financial aid to prevent evictions during the pandemic kept Espinal afloat, paying her back rent and keeping the family out of shelters. But it had an expiration date.

Around that time, the Emergency Housing Vouchers program was rolled out, targeting people in Espinal's situation.

A “leading cause of family homelessness is domestic violence” in New York City, said Gina Cappuccitti, director of housing access and stability services at New Destiny Housing, a nonprofit that has connected 700 domestic violence survivors to the voucher program.

Espinal was one of those 700, and moved into her Brooklyn apartment in 2023.

The relief went beyond finding a secure place to live, she said. “I gained my worth, my sense of peace, and I was able to rebuild my identity.”

Now, she said, she's putting aside money in case of the worst. Because, “that's my fear, losing control of everything that I've worked so hard for.”

Legendary NBA coach Phil Jackson criticized the league for scheduling games on Christian holidays in a rare post on social media on Sunday. 

Jackson, an 11-time NBA champion as a coach and two-time champion as a player, posted the criticism on Easter Sunday, when the league had four games in the first round of the NBA Playoffs scheduled.

The post was Jackson's first in over a year, but his criticism of the NBA is not unique. 

In 2023, Jackson made headlines when he said he stopped watching the NBA following the COVID-19 pandemic because the league had gotten too political. 

""They went into the lockout year, and they did something that was kind of wonky. They did a bubble down in Orlando, and all the teams that could qualify went down there, and stayed down there,"" he said at the time during an appearance on the ""Tetragrammaton with Rick Rubin"" podcast.

""And they had things on their backs like ‘Justice.' I made a little funny thing like, 'Justice just went to the basket and Equal Opportunity just knocked him down.'... So, my grandkids thought that was pretty funny to play up those names. So, I couldn't watch that.""

Jackson was referring to the NBA allowing players to wear social justice messages on the backs of their jerseys during the bubble in Orlando. He added at the time that he felt the league was catering to a ""certain audience.""

""They didn't know it was turning other people off. People want to see sports as non-political.""

The Vatican says Pope Francis has passed away the day after meeting VP Vance on Easter.

Pope Francis was elected to the papacy on March 13, 2013, at the age of 76. He passed away at the age of 88 on Monday, April 21.

Born in Argentina as Jorge Bergoglio, Pope Francis joined the Society of Jesus at the age of 21. He was ordained a priest days before his 33rd birthday and was consecrated as an auxiliary bishop of his hometown of Buenos Aires in 1992. 

In 1998, he was named the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, serving in that role until his election to the papacy in 2013. He was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 2001 by Pope John Paul II, whom he would later canonize.

Here are five ways the pope impacted the Catholic Church.

Pope Francis was the first Jesuit to be elected pope.

Francis' election marked many other firsts. A native of Argentina, he was the first pope to be elected from the Americas and the first from the Southern Hemisphere. 

He was also the first pope to adopt the regnal name ""Francis.""  

""For many Jesuits, what the first Jesuit pope meant was someone who could show the world what the Jesuits are really about, beyond the stereotypes,"" Fr. David Paternostro, S.J., a Jesuit priest who lives in Missouri, told Fox News Digital.

""Francis is a man who has felt Jesus close to him in spite of his sins and wants others to have this same feeling.""

Paternostro continued, ""From his very first interview, where he answered the question, 'Who is Jorge Mario Bergoglio?' by declaring, 'I am a sinner,' he demonstrated a hallmark of Jesuit spirituality: a sense of being a sinner loved by the Lord and called to friendship with Jesus."" 

WHAT IS THE PAPAL ENCLAVE? INSIDE THE ANCIENT PROCESS OF CHOOSING THE NEXT POPE

Pope Francis, Paternostro said, ""showed the world what Jesuits can be at our best: a true evangelist, a true son of Ignatius and (as he has described himself repeatedly) a true son of the Church."" 

""Francis is a man who has felt Jesus close to him in spite of his sins and [wanted] others to have this same feeling,"" Paternostro said. 

Throughout the 12 years of his papacy, Pope Francis canonized nearly 1,000 people. (This total, however, includes the ""Martyrs of Otranto,"" a group of 813 people who were killed on Aug. 14, 1480, in Otranto, Italy.) 

Among the notable people canonized by Pope Francis was St. Junipero Serra, a Spanish priest who established nine missions in what is now California.

Serra's canonization on Sept. 23, 2015 was the first-ever on U.S. soil, Fox News Digital previously reported.

Francis also canonized Pope John Paul II, Mother Teresa, Pope Paul VI and Pope John XXIII. 

On Aug. 2, 2018, Pope Francis issued a letter revising the Catechism of the Catholic Church's teaching on the death penalty.

MOTHER TERESA'S LAST MESSAGE, WRITTEN ON DAY SHE DIED, REVEALS DEEP FAITH IN CHRIST

""Pope Francis continued the recent tradition of previous popes, including from St. John Paul II, by escalating Catholic opposition to modern-day use of the death penalty,"" Charles Camosy, professor of bioethics at the Creighton University School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital. 

Francis' language in the letter, however, ""stopped short of calling the practice intrinsically evil, a term used frequently in Catholic moral theology,"" Camosy said.

Pope Francis called the death penalty ""inadmissible.""  (AP)

Instead, Francis used the term ""inadmissible"" and said it was an attack on human dignity.

""I think it is fair to say that the Holy Father used the strongest possible language against the death penalty without using language that would 100% close the door on it no matter what,"" Camosy said.

Italy was one of the hardest-hit areas in the first months of the coronavirus pandemic and saw thousands of deaths. The entire country went into lockdown on March 9, the first to do so.

About two weeks later, on March 27, 2020, in one of the most striking moments of his papacy, Pope Francis delivered a special ""Urbi et Orbi"" (""from the city to the world"") blessing from St. Peter's Square, which was televised worldwide.

For Dawn Eden Goldstein, a Washington, D.C.-based theologian and canon lawyer, the moment had special meaning.

""I have never been so proud to be a Catholic as when Pope Francis gave his extraordinary blessing to the world from a near-empty St. Peter's Square on March 27, 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when half the world was under lockdown,"" she said. 

She continued, ""His message was powerful: He encouraged us to treat the crisis as an opportunity for personal conversion and for building fraternity, and he assured us that Jesus was with us.""

After the blessing, Pope Francis lifted the Eucharist, contained in a special receptacle called a monstrance, and took it out of St. Peter's Basilica. 

Visibly limping, Pope Francis then blessed the world. 

""He gave us all a moment of profound intimacy with the Lord at the time when we needed it most,"" Goldstein said.

The word ""Catholic"" translates to ""universal,"" and Pope Francis' papacy exemplified this. Francis visited places no previous pontiff had ever visited and appointed cardinals from non-traditional locations. 

During his papacy, Pope Francis became the first pope to visit Iraq, Mongolia, Myanmar and the United Arab Emirates.

People in Michigan, Texas, Tennessee and Washington, D.C. contemplate President Trump's executive order establishing English as the official language of the United States. 

Americans are divided over the fact that English has been deemed the official language of the United States under the new Trump administration.

U.S. citizens throughout the country told Fox News Digital this month what they think about President Donald Trump's recent executive order to make English the official language in America. While many found the mandate to be a no-brainer, others said it flies in the face of America's diversity.

""I disagree with that. I think we're a melting pot,"" Shane, a Kentucky resident, said. ""I mean, this is how the country was built hundreds of years ago – it was based on a group of people from different nations coming in to form this country.""

Trump signed the executive order on March 1, marking the first time that the U.S. has ever had an official language. 

The text of Trump's order stated, ""A nationally designated language is at the core of a unified and cohesive society, and the United States is strengthened by a citizenry that can freely exchange ideas in one shared language."" 

The order added that an official language is intended to ""promote unity"" and ""cultivate a shared American culture for all citizens,"" while ensuring consistency in government operations and creating a pathway to civic engagement.

About 180 of the 195 countries across the globe have already set their own official languages.

Steve from Birmingham, Mich., told Fox he thinks Trump is ""100 percent absolutely correct"" to sign the order, noting that there ""should be no other language"" officially designated.

Junior, a Mexican-American living in Houston, said he respects the order. 

""I'm Mexican, but I'm American and this is America, you know what mean? So America, it's English, you know what I mean?"" he said.

However, Mary in Washington, D.C., said, ""I don't think that's fair.""

""I think that we need to be multicultural, and I think that the more diversity we have, the more beautiful the land is, the more enriched we can be by learning something else about someone else,"" she said.

Michigan resident David shared Mary's viewpoint, stating, ""I think there is no official language for a reason. We're a polyglot country. We have nothing but immigrants from all over the world."" 

He argued that when the U.S. Constitution was ratified, ""there were probably 40 to 50 languages being spoken in the United States.""

Darryl from Houston said, ""I think English should always have been the official language of the United States.""

Tennessee native Glen was less opinionated on the subject, stating, ""Hard to say, really. I don't know that I necessarily agree with that, because we have people from all different nationalities. So, I don't have any strong thoughts on that one way or the other.""

Lindy and Trudy – two friends from Houston – slammed the executive order. 

""I think it's wrong,"" Linda said. ""We're not there. I think we were there, you know, in the 1950s. You know, or at least that's what everyone grew up – my generation grew up thinking that. But it's just not a reality in today's world.""

Trudy added, ""I think we are a mixed nation of diverse people, and we have to face the fact that not everyone is going to speak English.""

When asked if he supported the order, Howard from North Carolina told Fox, ""Yes.""

Jay from Knoxville, Tenn., appeared to indicate he supported the order, though he expressed openness to cultural diversity in the U.S. 

""I would prefer that everybody speaks English, but I also am respectful of people and their cultures and their languages when they come to America,"" he said.

Charles, a Mississippi man touring D.C., was forceful in his defense of the order, stating, ""You know, we're Americans. English is our language.""

Fox News senior national correspondent Eric Shawn reports on the death of Pope Francis from St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. 

Pope Francis, who changed the face of the papacy, was broadly popular with the more than 60 million U.S. Catholics, according to recent public opinion polling.

Seventy-eight percent of American Catholics expressed a favorable opinion of the pope in a Pew Poll conducted in early February, shortly before Francis' lengthy hospitalization for a case of double pneumonia. The 88-year-old pope died on Monday 

Francis' popularity among American Catholics was constant throughout his dozen-year tenure as pope, with his favorability peaking at 90% in a February 2015 poll by Pew.

""Pope Francis enjoyed broad support among American Catholics – certainly exceeding the popularity of any elected officials in the U.S.,"" veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance, the president of New England College, told Fox News.

U.S. Catholics also generally viewed Francis more positively than his immediate predecessor in the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI.

FIVE WAYS POPE FRANCIS IMPACTED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH

Benedict's favorability ratings ranged between 67% and 83% in Pew polling during his eight years as pope.

While popular with many Catholics, Francis' attempts to make the church more inclusive made him an enemy to some in the conservative wing of the church. And there was plenty of pushback against the pope's moves to overhaul a very divided church.

Those divisions may have contributed to a partisan divide when it comes to U.S. Catholics' views of Francis.

According to the February Pew Poll, 88% of U.S. Catholics who identified as Democrats or leaned toward the Democratic Party had a positive view of the pope. But favorable opinions of Francis dropped to 69% among U.S. Catholics who said they were Republicans or leaned toward the GOP.

""His reform agenda, emphasizing values that sought to lift up the poorest, most marginalized individuals in the world, played better with Catholic Democrats than Republicans,"" Lesperance noted.

 ""And despite being critical of the current administration's position on building the wall, mass deportations, and migrants, the late pope enjoyed the support of nearly two-thirds of Catholic Republicans. His legacy will be one of reform and social justice for Catholics across the globe.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Pete Hegseth says ‘disgruntled' fired staffers behind second Signal group chat story","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense/3385912/pete-hegseth-disgruntled-staffers-signal-group-chat-story/","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 14:48:16 GMT","

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said “disgruntled” former employees who were fired last week were behind the news that he allegedly shared sensitive information in a second, unreported Signal group chat.

“What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,” he said Monday morning at the White House's Easter Egg Roll.

It was Hegseth's first public comments since the New York Times reported Sunday that he shared similar information about the United States's intended military operations in Yemen against the Houthis in a second Signal group chat allegedly including his wife and brother. His brother Phil has a job at the Department of Defense.

While Hegseth said the people behind the story were “disgruntled former employees,” he did not directly deny the existence of the group chat and whether he shared information about the strikes in it.

“This is what the media does. They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations. Not going to work with me,” he said.

Last week, three Pentagon officials — senior adviser Dan Caldwell, deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick, and Colin Carroll, chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense — were fired following an investigation into media leaks, though the three have denied that they leaked information to the media.

HOW SECURE IS SIGNAL? GROUP CHAT SNAFU RAISES QUESTIONS OVER APP SECURITY

In a joint statement, the fired officials said they were “incredibly disappointed” by how their service ended.

“We understand the importance of information security and work every day to protect it. At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of ‘leaks' to begin with,” they said.

On Sunday, former interim Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot wrote an op-ed for Politico — an outlet he kicked out of its designated seat in the Pentagon press corps — in which he described the last month as a “month from hell” in the department.

“It's been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon,” he said. “Even strong backers of the secretary like me must admit: The last month has been a full-blown meltdown at the Pentagon — and it's becoming a real problem for the administration.”

HEGSETH POSTED YEMEN STRIKE DETAILS IN SECOND SIGNAL CHAT: REPORT

“President Donald Trump has a strong record of holding his top officials to account,” Ullyot added. “Given that, it's hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Racial discrimination is alive and well among Oregon Democrats","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/op-eds/3384899/racial-discrimination-is-alive-and-well-among-oregon-democrats/","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

COVID isn't over.

At least not in deep-blue states such as Oregon, where the state legislature believes programs conceived with American Rescue Plan Act dollars should continue in perpetuity. Worse, since COVID coincided with the so-called “racial reckoning” in the wake of George Floyd's death, many of these programs are rife with rules that require racial discrimination.

On Monday, the Oregon House of Representatives will vote on two different bills, both introduced by Democrats, to expand one such program. The program, called Prosperity 10,000, provides workforce development services to so-called “priority populations.”

Oregon law currently defines “priority populations” not by income or need but by race, gender identity, and sexual orientation. That's not compassion — it's unconstitutional. While the two bills modify the program in different ways, neither corrects the definition of “priority populations.”

While Oregon continues to double down on race- and sex-based discrimination, the Trump administration has signaled it will use every tool at its disposal to ensure states adhere to the principle of color-blind equality. If Oregon wants to continue to secure federal funding for programs such as Prosperity 10,000, it must rid itself of the race- and sex-based discrimination enshrined in its state statutes.

The Prosperity 10,000 program provides state and federal funds to Oregon's Higher Education Coordinating Commission for its workforce development initiatives. The program includes conventional efforts to get people back to work, such as career readiness and job training. It also pays for paid internships and wraparound services, including child care, housing, transportation, and free laptops.

The program began back in 2022 with Senate Bill 1545 as part of Oregon's $200 million allocation of State Fiscal Recovery Funds under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. At the time, the proponents of Senate Bill 1545 told legislators that the “disparate impact of COVID” meant that certain groups needed special services or they were likely to “fall further behind.”

Thus, the program was set up to serve only certain “priority populations.” According to Oregon Revised Statute 660.300 Subsection 8, “priority populations” are defined as follows: communities of color, women, low-income communities, rural and frontier communities, veterans, persons with disabilities, incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals, members of Oregon's nine federally recognized Indian tribes, individuals who disproportionately experience discrimination in employment on the basis of age, and individuals who identify as members of the LGBT community. In other words, if you're black or gay, you go to the front of the line.

Last month, I asked my legislative counsel for a legal opinion on the constitutionality of all this.

I was told that using Oregon Revised Statute 660.300's definition of “priority populations” to determine eligibility for services would leave the state vulnerable to a challenge under the equal protection clause. The Prosperity 10,000 program distributes public funds on the basis of an individual's status as a member of a “community of color,” which invokes a suspect class. And that courts apply the most stringent form of judicial scrutiny to such classifications, requiring the state to prove the classifications are narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest. Recent U.S. Supreme Court case law makes it unlikely that laws that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or nationality can withstand strict scrutiny.

In other words, the program violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the U.S. Constitution. It's illegal.

Three weeks ago, on Thursday, March 27, in front of my House Committee on Higher Education and Workforce Development, the same committee that is advancing these bills, the legislative and policy affairs director for the Higher Education Coordinating Commission said the same thing. 

In answering a Democratic committee member's question about “wanting more teachers who look like her,” the HECC director stated, “The state has had goals related to the diversification of its education workforce that date back a few decades at this point, to 1991, and I think the challenge that we have today, is that the specific mechanisms that are at play in these bills to assist the state in meeting that workforce goal, have been determined through evolving jurisprudence to be difficult from a legal perspective.”

“Difficult from a legal perspective” is code for “it's illegal.”

TRUMP'S CHAOTIC EUROPEAN DEFENSE SPENDING MESSAGING

We can debate continuing Covid-era programs into perpetuity. We can debate the use of federal funds for free laptops. But cleaning up our state statutes to remove Civil Rights Act violations should be a no-brainer. That's why I've introduced a “minority report” version of the Prosperity 10,000 program bill, which removes the illegal discrimination in the state statute's definition of “priority populations.” We are scheduled to vote on my bill Monday morning.

Let's see which Oregon state representatives actually believe in equality and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Reps. Robert Garcia (D-CA), Maxwell Frost (D-FL), Yassamin Ansari (D-AZ), and Maxine Dexter (D-OR) arrived in El Salvador on Monday.

Their trip follows that of Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), who went to El Salvador last week to visit Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was deported from the United States. The senator said the “main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar,” and he spoke with his wife, Jennifer, about his condition.

Monday's trip was meant “to pressure the Trump Administration to abide by a Supreme Court order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia,” per a joint press release from the visiting lawmakers.

“The Congressional members are in El Salvador to bring attention to President Trump's illegal defiance of the binding and unanimous Supreme Court decision in Noem v. Abrego Garcia that demands the Administration facilitate Abrego Garcia's return and due process in the United States,” they wrote.

The high court's decision was “per curiam,” which does not necessarily mean it was unanimous. “Per curiam” decisions are made without rendering written opinions, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor offered merely a statement along with Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Garcia said he is going on the trip to “remind” Americans of the hundreds of other illegal immigrants who were also sent to El Salvador, suggesting that they did not receive “due process.”

Ansari cited her history with her parents fleeing Iran when its citizens were “disappeared” as her reason for flying to El Salvador. 

“I refuse to sit back and watch it happen here, too. Kilmar Abrego Garcia's illegal abduction and President Trump's complete disregard of due process and a unanimous Supreme Court ruling are deeply disturbing,” Ansari said. “If this can happen to Mr. Abrego Garcia, it can happen to any of us.”

Dexter alleged “his due process rights [were] ripped away.” At the time of his deportation, Abrego Garcia had a “withholding of removal” order, which prohibited him from being sent to El Salvador. The administration has said it was following through on a deportation order that remained active even after Abrego Garcia received his new status.

“This is not just one family's nightmare; it is a constitutional crisis that should outrage every single one of us,” Dexter said in a press release. “Our constitutional rights are on the line.” 

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials confirmed that these immigrants were deported under Code Title 8, which allows federal authorities to remove quickly certain migrants who cross into the country illegally. They were also deported under the Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to remove migrants immediately if they come from an invading country in times of war.

“Donald Trump and ICE are not above the law,” Frost said. “We cannot and will not let Donald Trump get away with this.”

Garcia and Frost attempted to classify the trip as a congressional delegation, or CODEL, to House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY), who denied the request. Comer told the representatives that if they “wish to meet with” Abrego Garcia, they would have to spend their “own money.”

“But I will not approve a single dime of taxpayer funds for use on the excursion you have requested,” Comer said.

JOHN KENNEDY ADMITS KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA'S DEPORTATION WAS ‘A SCREWUP'

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele committed to keeping Abrego Garcia, as the Trump administration classified him as a member of MS-13.

However, the Salvadoran is no longer in the Terrorism Confinement Center, referred to as the CECOT. Instead, he was moved to another undisclosed prison.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former chief Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot, who was once a strong backer of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is now warning that the “total chaos” of the last month at the Defense Department, including Signalgate and the recent firings over supposed leaks, could lead to Hegseth's ouster.

In an op-ed in Politico, Ullyot detailed his shift from once arguing that Hegseth was the “best man to shake things up” at the DOD to now observing that the Pentagon is in “disarray” under his leadership and may not have much time left as defense secretary.

He particularly shed light on the recent firings of three Pentagon officials, two of whom were leading advisers to Hegseth. All three were put on leave as part of an investigation into leaks in the department, with the Pentagon using polygraph tests in its inquiry.

Yet Ullyot revealed that none of the fired officials were given a polygraph test in the investigation, and one of them was told by investigators that he would soon be cleared of all wrongdoing. He said this is indicative of a larger “habit” of Hegseth's team of “spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.”

Ullyot was also critical of Hegseth's response to the Signal leak revealed in late March, when the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic was mistakenly added to a group chat discussing sensitive details of imminent U.S. strikes on the Yemeni Houthis. The defense secretary's initial response to reporters was to deny that any “war plans” were shared, which Ullyot said only made things worse as editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg then released the full text chain shortly after.

These incidents at the Pentagon are not the end of what Ullyot called the “Month from Hell” for the defense agency, as he predicted more firings as well as “even bigger bombshell stories” coming out this week.

Now faced with the loss of two of his closest advisers and another Signal chat leak revealed by the New York Times on Sunday night, Ullyot concluded by suggesting that Hegseth's time in the high-level Cabinet post may be coming to a close, given President Donald Trump's first term, which saw him go through three different defense secretaries.

“President Donald Trump has a strong record of holding his top officials to account. Given that, it's hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer,” he said.

Ullyot was no longer serving in his role as chief Pentagon spokesman in late March following uproar over the deletion of a story about Jackie Robinson as part of the DOD's initiative to remove DEI content. His resignation from the department came just last week on April 17.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Breaking: Pope Francis has died at 88. Read The Atlantic's full coverage:

Who would want to be president of an Ivy League school?

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

It makes for a most tempting “Help Wanted” ad: Earn $5 million a year to lead one of the nation's most powerful and prestigious institutions. Enjoy fancy dinners, almost unlimited travel, and a complimentary mansion in Upper Manhattan.

This is an incomplete list of the perks that the president of Columbia University receives. And yet no one seems to want the job.

In late March, Katrina Armstrong, Columbia's interim president, resigned after an unhappy seven-month tenure, one marked by a never-ending dispute about campus anti-Semitism, and by President Donald Trump's war on Columbia's funding and independence. The school is now on its fourth president in only three years, and its latest leader isn't even an academic.

In a sure sign of near-pathological administrative dysfunction, Columbia's board of trustees chose its own co-chair, the journalist Claire Shipman, to serve as the school's newest acting president. In other words, the hiring committee, evidently finding no one willing or able to run the school, hired itself. This is an exceedingly rare occurrence in the history of elite higher education, a fact Shipman seemed to acknowledge in her first public statement: “Ornamental language can't disguise the fact that this is a precarious moment for Columbia University.” (A university spokesperson declined to comment on how the acting president was chosen. Shipman did not respond to an interview request.)

Columbia's difficulty in appointing even an acting president suggests that it may be, at least for the moment, nearly unmanageable. But it is not the only elite university in trouble. Three of the other seven Ivy League universities are led by presidents who began as interim appointments. Across the country, the average length of college presidents' tenure has fallen to less than six years.

Christopher L. Eisgruber: The cost of the government's attack on Columbia

With declining trust in higher education, campuses fractured over the Israel-Hamas conflict, and a White House eager to wage populist war on elites (a White House run, incidentally, by Trump, a University of Pennsylvania graduate, and Yale Law alumnus J. D. Vance), the job of elite college president, formerly considered difficult but prestigious, has become, on many campuses, impossible and thankless. Presidents are charged with leading an inflexible organization made up of autonomous and competing constituencies through a period that requires immediate change. But they can't do anything without angering either parents, students, professors, donors, administrators, or Trump. Any false step might cost them their position. Being president of an elite university might once have been the greatest job in America. Now it is the greatest worst job.

The job was hard even before the Hamas attack on southern Israel in 2023 and the rise of Trump 2.0. Modern university presidents are judged on the size of the donations they bring in, their crisis-management skills, and their ability to climb the rankings of a publication, U.S. News & World Report, that barely exists as a journalistic entity. They must possess not only academic experience, but a set of attributes that a career in academia does not inculcate: fundraising prowess, financial and budgetary skills, and charisma. “It's one of those job descriptions that nobody could ever come close to,” Nicholas Dirks, a former chancellor of UC Berkeley, told me. Even the search committees charged with selecting university presidents often can't agree on what they're looking for, said one search-firm executive, who requested anonymity to avoid compromising future searches.

As their responsibilities have expanded, top-tier presidents must ceaselessly service empowered constituencies. Students, who pay (or whose parents pay) for a luxury product, believe they can demand more for their money. Donors must be kept happy. The number of administrators has grown much faster than tenured faculty; they've become a powerful constituency of their own. Amid these changes, faculty members have remained a crucial bloc. And as universities conduct more and more research, they've become more dependent on federal grants. These shifts enabled universities' growth. But they also make the president vulnerable when constituencies disagree.

The events following October 7, 2023, made that clear. “No matter what a president does, he or she is going to get pilloried,” Brian Rosenberg, a visiting education professor at Harvard and a former president of Macalester College, in Minnesota, told me. “It's the first thing that I can remember that really fractured the consensus on campus.” Presidents faced calls to crack down on anti-Semitism at anti-Israel protests, and were condemned when they did so. Any decision enraged some group—if not all of them at once. “There were literally trucks driving around my neighborhood in Cambridge both criticizing the president of Harvard for being too soft on the protesters and for being too hard on the protesters,” Rosenberg said.

Franklin Foer: Columbia University's anti-Semitism problem

Congressional Republicans summoned the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, and MIT to testify about anti-Semitism on their campuses. After the university leaders gave disastrously robotic answers, donors threatened to withhold millions in gifts unless they resigned. Four days later, Liz Magill, Penn's president, stepped down. A month later, under the added pressure of credible plagiarism allegations, Claudine Gay left her post at Harvard.

At a second hearing, Minouche Shafik, who took over Columbia in July 2023, accepted the premise that her school had an anti-Semitism problem and publicly committed to disciplining professors and students. Congress was, for the moment, satisfied. But campus protests then became even more disruptive. Against the faculty senate's wishes, Shafik called in the police, who made more than 100 arrests. Professors who had lost faith in her leadership considered censuring her for the move. She soon resigned as well, speaking of her struggle to “overcome divergent views across our community” and the “considerable toll” that the role had taken on her and her family.

The Trump administration has taken full advantage of these internal divisions. In March, it canceled $400 million worth of federal grants and contracts at Columbia, ostensibly as punishment for what the administration claims has been an insufficient response to anti-Semitism. The government demanded extensive concessions—including that Columbia administrators place the department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African studies into receivership—as a precondition for getting the funding back.

Armstrong, Columbia's interim president, largely acquiesced, with some minor modifications. She then had to face the faculty. Some were furious that she would allow the government to dictate university policy, one professor told me. (The professor spoke on the condition of anonymity because he had received threats after commenting publicly on these issues.) In a meeting with faculty, Armstrong downplayed the scope of the changes in response to the Trump administration, saying, for example, that the university wasn't banning masks that conceal protesters' identities, according to The Wall Street Journal. When that leaked to the media, the Trump administration demanded that she double down on her commitments. Armstrong did so—and resigned three days later.

Clearly, a Columbia president won't succeed by trying to evade scrutiny or appease all constituencies simultaneously. “The president of Harvard is gone. The president of Penn is gone. The president of Columbia is gone,” Chris Rufo, the conservative activist who has influenced the Trump administration's approach to higher education, recently told The New York Times. “That's a pretty good track record. That's three for three. That's a hat trick right off the bat.”

Universities searching for new presidents are now prioritizing candidates who can play politics on a national level—candidates with political acumen and crisis-management experience. “Especially at some of the elite universities, you wanted that scholar,” Rod McDavis, the head of AGB Search, told me. “Today, we're seeing a different need from the standpoint of what a president has to be.”

Rose Horowitch: What Harvard learned from Columbia's mistake

Some faculty argue that if presidents resisted government coercion, they could preserve university independence and keep their job. Here, Harvard provides a test case. Earlier this month, the government threatened to cancel up to $9 billion worth of grants and contracts to the university if Harvard did not agree to a series of demands. These included appointing an external body to audit faculty viewpoints and screening foreign students for disfavored beliefs. But last Monday, Harvard's president, Alan Garber, said that the university had rejected the government's demands. In response, the Trump administration promptly canceled about $2 billion worth of federal funding for the university, with more cuts on the way; in addition, the IRS is planning to rescind its tax-exempt nonprofit status, and the Department of Homeland Security has threatened to revoke its ability to enroll foreign students. If Garber can push back against the administration and keep his job, he will provide an example of a path forward—albeit an expensive one. (Garber does seem to be inspiring other universities to stand up to the government. Faculty at several Big Ten schools have now passed resolutions to establish a “mutual defense compact” that would provide resources to any member institution that ends up in a legal fight with the administration.)

Columbia will also have the chance to find out whether a different approach can placate everyone. On Thursday, the board chair announced the start of the public search for the school's next leader, with the generous start date of January 2026. In the meantime, Shipman, the acting president, has said that she will proceed with the reforms that her predecessor agreed to, but will reject further government intrusion. “I am committed to navigating Columbia through this moment to the best of my ability,” she wrote in a message to the campus community. The day after she took the job, congressional Republicans predicted that her tenure would be short-lived.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Breaking: Pope Francis has died at 88. Read The Atlantic's full coverage:

And what happens when empirical fact is labeled “improper ideology”

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Elizabeth Hays, a white woman from central North Carolina, had never been to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. But earlier this month, after she read about Donald Trump's executive order targeting the museum and others throughout the Smithsonian system, she made the nearly five-hour drive up to Washington, D.C., to visit. She was worried that if she waited any longer, she might encounter a sanitized version of the museum, or no museum at all.

She told me this in front of a display focused on contemporary manifestations of Black protest. Elisa Hill, a Black woman from Maryland, was visiting that day too. “I'm very worried about what's going to happen here,” Hill told me, shaking her head. “Because it represents the history that we all need to know and understand. I'm just afraid that it's going to be censored.”

I, too, had carried this concern since hearing about the executive order. I tried to contact museum officials—including Lonnie Bunch, the head of the Smithsonian and the founding director of NMAAHC—but each person I reached out to was unavailable. I was not surprised by this response. Smithsonian officials no doubt fear that if they speak publicly about the executive order, then they, and the institution, might be further targeted. So instead, I made a trip to NMAAHC, hoping to talk directly with people there and take stock of what might be lost.

Lonnie G. Bunch III: Why is America afraid of Black history?

Every time I visit NMAAHC, the first person I think of is Ruth Odom Bonner. On September 24, 2016, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama stood alongside the 99-year-old Bonner—and three other generations of her family—to ring the bell signaling the opening of the museum to the public. Bonner's presence that day was significant because she was the daughter of a man who was born into slavery. Not the granddaughter. Not the great-granddaughter. The woman who opened NMAAHC was the child of a man born in bondage. His name was Elijah Odom.

As a young boy, Odom and his brothers had escaped to freedom. He became a farmer, lived through Reconstruction and Jim Crow, and ultimately attended and graduated from medical school, becoming the only practicing Black physician in his community of Bisco, Arkansas. Elijah Odom's life represented the possibility that existed on the other side of slavery. In 2016, his daughter Ruth was a reminder that the history presented in the museum she helped inaugurate did not happen all that long ago.

The history inside the museum still reverberates through our country. It is impossible to understand the contemporary landscape of social, political, and economic inequality without understanding the forces and events that served as its catalysts. This is why so many have worked so hard to silence this history.

Upon my arrival at NMAAHC, I stumbled onto a tour of a new exhibit, “In Slavery's Wake: Making Black Freedom in the World,” a project that places the experiences of slavery, colonialism, and freedom-making across the world in conversation with one another.

The docent leading the tour, Edward Flanagan, was a Black man who looked to be in his 80s. He wore a black long-sleeve shirt with the face of James Baldwin alongside his words: “Ignorance allied with power is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.”

“The only way that slavery works is the continued public application of violence and terror,” Flanagan told the group. He laced his hands together in front of his body. “Also, race does not exist. It is a social construct made necessary by unrestrained capitalism, colonialism, and the slave trade. Those three items are going to come up again and again and again. Those are the things that have formed your world.”

This idea, that capitalism, slavery, and colonialism are the forces that have shaped our contemporary world, is central to the exhibit. And it occurred to me, listening to Flanagan, that this was the exact sort of story that Trump and many of his allies would like to excise from museums, classrooms, and every other realm of American life.

What would it mean if every American understood, as Flanagan said, that a large portion of the country's millionaires in the mid-19th century lived along the Mississippi? Or, as he later shared, that many of our most prestigious universities established before 1865 were built using the profits of chattel slavery? These are empirical facts, not ideological ones. And as more Americans have come to understand this history, they have, appropriately, begun to question much of what they have been taught about America.

Many universities, for instance, have begun in recent years to acknowledge the ways slavery provided the capital for their infrastructure, and the fact that such infrastructure was often literally constructed by enslaved laborers. Commissions have been formed. Memorials have been erected. New courses have been offered. It is perhaps not a coincidence, then, that these are some of the same institutions that have been most directly targeted by Trump, who has threatened to pull federal funding from universities that engage in anything that falls under his nebulous definition of DEI. Many colleges and universities are capitulating. Some are fighting back.

Phillip Atiba Solomon: Am I still allowed to tell the truth in my class?

Perhaps the most striking part of the exhibit was the section on rebellions. Flanagan came to a map of the world with clusters of dots, most of them between the Americas and the West African coast, crossing the Atlantic like a bridge connecting the two continents. Contrary to what many believe, he explained, rebellions were a relatively common occurrence on slave ships; the dots represented those uprisings. The caption beneath the map stated that captured Africans revolted during one in 10 slave-trade voyages. “Notice the concentration along the coast of Africa,” Flanagan said. Many of these revolts, he told us, took place when the vessels were docked offshore and land was still in sight. The captives would think, “I can still see home. It's right over there.”

Flanagan told the group the story of the Amistad, a slave ship traveling from Cuba to Long Island that became the site of an 1839 slave revolt. The captured Africans were arrested by American officials. But in 1841, the case made it to the Supreme Court, where the captives were defended by former President John Quincy Adams, and where the justices ruled in their favor, granting them their freedom and allowing them to sail back to their homeland of Sierra Leone.

Flanagan pointed to three framed images behind him—court sketches. Between the sketches was a quote from one of the rebels, a man named Sengbe, who said, “I am resolved that it is better to die than be a white man's slave.”

A group of teenagers who had been eavesdropping on Flanagan's presentation eventually dropped all pretense and joined the group. One young woman—with brown skin, hoop earrings, and long braids—walked up to the sketches of the kidnapped Africans, pulled out her phone, and took a picture of the sketches and the quote between them. I remembered my time as a high-school teacher and how, during discussions on slavery, so many of my Black students would ask why more enslaved people hadn't fought back. Resistance to enslavement came in many forms, of course, oftentimes more subtle than outright rebellion. But knowing that a rebellion occurred during one-tenth of slave-trade voyages helps disabuse people, especially students, of the idea that the enslaved simply accepted the conditions that had been forced upon them—and shows that, in many cases, captured Africans resisted long before they reached the shores of the Americas.

Black resistance, Flanagan told the group, has always existed. This exhibit, and this museum more broadly, allows us to see it. It also reminds us that resistance is possible in our own time—which is exactly the sort of thing that's led authoritarian regimes around the world to scrub examples of political resistance from classrooms, books, and the internet.

As the tour came to an end, Flanagan asked if anyone in the group had questions. A clean-shaven white man raised his hand and asked, “Sir, were you a Freedom Rider?” Flanagan smiled and nodded. “I was a Freedom Rider, yes.” The group began to murmur with surprise and admiration.

“I came here all the way from Alaska,” the man said. “May I take a picture with you?” Flanagan nodded and waved for the man to come up next to him; the man's wife took their photograph.

After the group had dispersed, I went up to Flanagan and introduced myself. He told me that he has been volunteering as a docent at NMAAHC for the past three years but has been a fan of the museum since it opened and was a supporter even before that. “They've been taking my money since 2003,” he said, laughing, referencing the year George W. Bush signed legislation authorizing the creation of the museum. The process of becoming a docent, he said, was more difficult than getting either of his master's degrees. “I had to be able to do the whole museum,” he said. The museum is also, for Flanagan, a family affair. His daughter is part of the museum's team that coordinates educational programming.

In the 1960s, as a college student at Howard University, Flanagan traveled from Washington, D.C., to Rockville, South Carolina, challenging the enforcement of laws that prohibited integration in public transportation and facilities. He decided to become a Freedom Rider during the civil-rights movement for the same reason he decided to become a docent at NMAAHC during the Black Lives Matter movement. He put his hands in his pockets, shrugged, and said, “You gotta do something.”

I asked Flanagan what he thought about the recent executive order. He smiled. “I am told not to talk about that while I'm wearing my badge and my lanyard,” he said. Then his face became more sober. “What I will say is that as a docent, I would like to tell, as John Hope Franklin says, the unvarnished truth. And one of the things we strive to do is tell the real story.”

What Flanagan understands is that the real story of America includes the story of slavery. He looked around at all the people walking through the exhibit. The elders. The students. The families. “I love this museum,” he said. “They'll have to beat me away with a stick.”

In his March 27 executive order, President Trump directed Vice President J. D. Vance to “remove improper ideology” from NMAAHC and other Smithsonian museums. As I walked around the museum, I wondered which of these exhibits would fall under that rubric. What does it mean for something to be improper if the administration's understanding of what is acceptable excludes anything that might make white Americans feel bad? Is the statue of Thomas Jefferson surrounded by bricks inscribed with the names of people he enslaved improper? Is a slave cabin that once sat on the grounds of a plantation in South Carolina improper? Are the shackles that were once locked around the feet of enslaved children improper? Is Harriet Tubman's silk shawl improper? Is Nat Turner's Bible improper? Is Emmett Till's casket improper? Are the photographs of men and women who were lynched as white audiences looked on improper?

The National Museum of African American History and Culture is not a place that traffics in improper ideology. It is a museum that recognizes that America has been suffused with improper ideologies for most of its history: ideologies that ignore the centrality of slavery to the nation's founding. Ideologies that tell us the Civil War was simply about states' rights. Ideologies that call Reconstruction a failure rather than a campaign that was actively destroyed. Ideologies that excise the important role of queer and female activists during the civil-rights movement. Ideologies that ignore the connections between racism and incarceration. Ideologies that tell Americans that the contemporary landscape of inequality in this country has nothing to do with history, and is simply a result of who has worked hard and who has not.

Several years ago, I visited the museum with my grandparents—my grandfather, who was born in 1930 Jim Crow Mississippi, and my grandmother, who was born in 1939 Jim Crow Florida. Inside, I pushed my grandfather in his wheelchair, his cane laid across his lap, a map of the museum in his hands. My grandmother walked behind us and moved ahead of us with an effortless independence, her gait steady and unhurried. I remember watching them take in the exhibits and remark upon how proximate they felt to what was on display. When I asked my grandmother about it later, she kept repeating the words I lived it. I lived it. I lived it.

My grandmother's history exists inside this museum. Ruth Odom Bonner's history exists inside this museum. This nation's history exists inside this museum.

The two Republican justices appeared open to an attack on Obamacare, but ultimately seemed likely to reject it.

by  Ian Millhiser

On Monday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that could lead health insurance plans to offer narrower coverage. The case, known as Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, challenges the authority of a group within the US Department of Health and Human Services tasked with requiring insurers to cover some forms of preventative care.

This body, known as the US Preventive Services Task Force (PSTF), has exercised its authority to mandate coverage of a wide range of treatments — from cancer screenings, to drugs that prevent transmission of the HIV virus, to eye ointments that prevent infections that cause blindness in infants. Notably, the PSTF was given this power by the Affordable Care Act, the landmark legislation signed by President Barack Obama, which Republican litigants frequently ask the courts to undermine.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The plaintiffs, represented by former Donald Trump lawyer Jonathan Mitchell, want the justices to strip the PSTF of this authority — thus permitting health plans to deny coverage for treatments they are currently required to pay for.

Based on Monday's argument, it does not appear likely that Mitchell has the votes for that outcome. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito came out swinging against the PSTF, and Justice Neil Gorsuch appeared likely to join them in attempting to sabotage Obamacare. But they were the only three justices who clearly telegraphed sympathy to Mitchell's arguments.

Notably, Republican Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett both seemed inclined to vote against Mitchell, although their questions did leave some uncertainty about how they would ultimately rule in this case. All three of the Court's Democrats appeared all but certain to uphold the PSTF, so that means there may be at least five votes to preserve health insurers' obligations under Obamacare.

This case turns on a somewhat arcane issue involving the government's hiring and firing practices. The Constitution says that certain officials — under the Supreme Court's precedents, officials who wield significant authority — are “officers of the United States.” Officers that answer only to the president and who make final decisions on behalf of the government are considered “principal officers,” and must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Meanwhile, lesser-ranking officials known as “inferior officers” may be appointed by an agency leader such as a Cabinet secretary.

Members of the PSTF were appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, so they do not qualify as principal officers. So the question in this case is whether they are validly classified as inferior officers. To qualify as such an official, their work must be supervised by a principal officer confirmed by the Senate. As the Supreme Court said in Edmond v. United States (1997), “‘inferior officers' are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate.”

The government's argument that PSTF members count as inferior officers is pretty straightforward. Every judge who has looked at this case so far has concluded that the health secretary may remove PSTF members at will. A statute permits the secretary to delay implementation of the PSTF's recommendations indefinitely. And the PSTF is part of the Public Health Service, which by statute is controlled by the assistant secretary for health (who is also a Senate-confirmed official), and by the secretary himself.

Mitchell, meanwhile, primarily relies on a provision of federal law which states that PSTF members “shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.” Task force members, he claims, cannot simultaneously be “independent” and also subject to secretarial supervision.

But most of the justices appeared skeptical of Mitchell's reading of the word “independent.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out that she sometimes asks her law clerks for their “independent judgment” regarding a legal question she needs to decide, but that does not mean that she has to take the law clerk's recommendation, or that she can't fire the clerk.

Significantly, Barrett — who repeatedly described Mitchell's interpretation of the word “independent” as “maximalist” — seemed persuaded by Sotomayor's argument. As Barrett said at one point during the argument, she sometimes asks her law clerks to provide recommendations that are “independent” of outside influence, but not “independent” of Barrett's own approach to how cases should be decided.

Even more significantly, Barrett pointed to the doctrine of “constitutional avoidance,” which says that if there are multiple ways of construing a statute, courts should avoid reading it in ways that raise constitutional problems. Thus, if the word “independent” can be read in more than one way, the Court should pick an interpretation that doesn't render the PSTF unconstitutional.

Kavanaugh, meanwhile, asked some questions that suggest he might be sympathetic to Mitchell's approach; early in the argument, for example, he told Justice Department lawyer Hashim Mooppan that he thought the government's interpretation of the word “independent” was “odd.” But he seemed to shift gears once Mitchell took the podium.

Among other things, Kavanaugh noted that his Court is normally reluctant to read the law to create federal bodies that are independent of the government's normal organizational chart, where agency leaders answer to the president and nearly everyone else answers to an agency leader. Indeed, the Supreme Court is currently considering a case that could eliminate Congress's ability to create such independent agencies. So Kavanaugh appeared to believe that this statute should not be construed to make the PSTF independent from the secretary if it is possible to read it in another way.

Again, Kavanaugh and Barrett did hedge enough in their questions that it is not entirely clear how they will vote in this case. And Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican who also sometimes breaks with the Court's right flank, was silent for most of the argument. So it is not at all clear where Roberts will come down in Kennedy v. Braidwood Management.

Still, based on Monday's argument, it appears possible, perhaps even likely, that the PSTF will survive.

Gorsuch, at one point, floated an alternative way of resolving this case. While every judge who has heard the case so far agreed that the secretary has the power to appoint and remove task force members, there's no statute which directly states that he can do so. Instead, that power is likely implicit in other provisions of law, such as the provision giving the secretary control over the Public Health Service.

Gorsuch suggested that the Court may send the case back down to the lower court to decide whether the secretary actually has the power to appoint and remove task force members. And Barrett, at one point, also signaled that she is open to sending the case back down in a procedure known as a “remand.”

If that happens, that would be bad news for the PSTF in the short term, because the case was previously heard by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the most right-wing court in the federal appellate system, and one, based on its past behavior, that is likely to be hostile to any statute associated with a Democratic president.

Still, even if the case is sent back down to the Fifth Circuit, and even if the Fifth Circuit does read federal law to undercut the PSTF, the Supreme Court can still review that decision once it is handed down. So a remand does not necessarily mean that health insurers will gain the power to deny coverage for cancer screenings or anti-HIV medication.

Again, given the course of Barrett and Kavanaugh's questioning, it's difficult to say with certainty how this case will end up. For the moment, however, one of two outcomes seem most likely: Either the Supreme Court holds off on deciding the PSTF's fate for now, or it votes to permanently rescue this body from Mitchell's attack.

The incredible technology is harnessing the potential of solar and wind — and quietly revolutionizing the energy system.

by  Umair Irfan

The tricky thing about generating electricity is that for the most part, you pretty much have to use it or lose it.

This fundamental fact has governed and constrained the development of the world's largest machine: the $2 trillion US power grid. Massive generators send electrons along a continent-wide network of conductors, transformers, cables, and wires into millions of homes and businesses, delicately balancing supply and demand so that every light switch, computer, television, stove, and charging cable will turn on 99.95 percent of the time. 

Making sure there are always enough generators spooled up to send electricity to every single power outlet in the country requires precise coordination. And while the amount of electricity actually used can swing drastically throughout the day and year, the grid is built to meet the brief periods of peak demand, like the hot summer days when air conditioning use can double average electricity consumption. Imagine building a 30-lane highway to make sure no driver ever has to tap their brakes. That's effectively what those who design and run the grid have had to do.

But what if you could just hold onto electricity for a bit and save it for later? You wouldn't have to overbuild the grid or spend so much effort keeping power generation in equilibrium with users. You could smooth over the drawbacks of intermittent power sources that don't emit carbon dioxide, like wind and solar. You could have easy local backup power in emergencies when transmission lines are damaged. You may not even need a giant, centralized power grid at all. 

That's the promise of grid-scale energy storage. And while the US has actually been using a crude form of energy storage called pumped hydroelectric power storage for decades, the country is now experiencing a gargantuan surge in energy storage capacity, this time from a technology that most of us are carrying around in our pockets: lithium-ion batteries. Between 2021 and 2024, grid battery capacity increased fivefold. In 2024, the US installed 12.3 gigawatts of energy storage. This year, new grid battery installations are on track to almost double compared to last year. Battery storage capacity now exceeds pumped hydro capacity, totaling more than 26 gigawatts. 

There's still plenty of room to expand — and a pressing need to do so. The power sector remains the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and there will be no way to add enough intermittent clean energy to sufficiently decarbonize the grid without cheap and plentiful storage. 

The aging US grid is also in dire need of upgrades, and batteries can cushion the shock of adding gigawatts of wind and solar while buying some time to perform more extensive renovations. Some power markets are finally starting to understand all the services batteries can provide — frequency regulation, peak shaving, demand response — creating new lines of business. Batteries are also a key tool in building smaller, localized versions of the power grid. These microgrids can power remote communities with reliable power and one day shift the entire power grid into a more decentralized system that can better withstand disruptions like extreme weather. 

If we can get it right, true grid-scale battery storage won't just be an enabler of clean energy, but a way to upgrade the power system for a new era. 

Back in 2011, one of my first reporting assignments was heading to a wind farm in West Virginia to attend the inauguration of what was at the time the world's largest battery energy storage system. Built by AES Energy Storage, it involved thousands of lithium-ion cells in storage containers that together combined to provide 32 megawatts of power and deliver it for about 15 minutes. 

“It was eight megawatt-hours total,” said John Zahurancik, who was vice president of AES Energy Storage at the time and showed me around the facility back then. That was about the amount of electricity used by 260 homes in a day. 

In the years since, battery storage has increased by orders of magnitude, as Zahurancik's new job demonstrates. He is now the president of Fluence, a joint venture between AES and Siemens that has deployed 38 gigawatt-hours of storage to date around the world. “The things that we're building today, many of our projects are over a gigawatt-hour in size,” Zahurancik said.

Last year, the largest storage facility to come online in the US was California's Edwards & Sanborn Project, which can dispatch 33 GW for several hours. That's roughly equivalent to the electricity needed to power 4.4 million homes for a day.

It wasn't a steady climb to this point, however. Overall grid battery capacity in the US barely budged for more than a decade. Then, around 2020, it began to spike upward. What changed?

One shift is that the most common battery storage technology, lithium-ion cells, saw huge price drops and energy density increases. “The very first project we did was in 2008 and it was on the order of $3,000 a kilowatt-hour for the price of the batteries,” said Zahurancik. “Now we're looking at systems that are on the order of $150, $200 a kilowatt-hour for the full system install.”

That's partly because the cells on the power grid aren't that different from those in mobile devices and electric vehicles, so grid batteries have benefited from manufacturing improvements that went into those products. 

“It's all one big pipeline,” said Micah Ziegler, a professor at Georgia Tech who studies clean energy technologies. “The batteries in phones, cars, and the grid all share common characteristics.” Seeing this rising demand, China went big on battery manufacturing and, much as it did in solar panels, created economies of scale to drive global prices down. China now produces 80 percent of the world's lithium-ion batteries. 

The blooming of wind and solar energy created even more demand for batteries and increased the pressure to improve them. The wind and the sun are often the cheapest sources of new electricity, and batteries help compensate for their variability, providing even more reason to scale up storage. “The benefits of this relationship are apparent in the increasing number of power plants that are being proposed and that have already been deployed that combine these resources,” Ziegler said. The combination of solar plus storage accounted for 84 percent of new US power added in 2024.

And because grid batteries don't have to be small enough to be mobile — unlike the batteries in your laptop or phone — they can take advantage of cheaper, less dense batteries that otherwise might not be suited for something that has to fit in your pocket. There's even talk of giving old EV batteries a second life on the power grid. 

Regulation has also helped. A major hurdle for deploying grid energy storage systems is that they don't generate electricity on their own, so the rules for how they should connect to the grid and how much battery developers should get paid for their services were messy and restrictive in the past. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order 841 removed some of the barriers for energy storage systems to plug into wholesale markets and compete with other forms of power. Though the regulation was issued in 2018, it cleared a major legal challenge in 2020, paving the way for more batteries to plug into the grid.

Eleven states to date including California, Illinois, and Maryland have also set specific procurement targets for energy storage, which require utilities to install a certain amount of storage capacity, creating a push for more grid batteries. Together, these factors created a whole new businesses for power companies, spawned new grid battery companies, and fertilized the ground for a bumper crop of energy storage. 

Energy storage is the peanut butter to the chocolate of renewable energy, making all the best traits about clean energy even better and balancing out some of its downsides. But it's also an important ingredient in grid stability, reliability, and resilience, helping ensure a steady flow of megawatts during blackouts and extreme weather. 

The most common use is frequency response. The alternating current going through power lines in the US cycles at a frequency of 60 hertz. If the grid dips below this frequency when a power-hungry user switches on, it can trip circuit breakers and cause power instability. Since batteries have nearly zero startup time, unlike thermal generators, they can quickly absorb or transmit power as needed to keep the grid humming the right tune. 

Grid batteries can also step in as reserve power when a generator goes offline or when a large power user unexpectedly turns on. They can smooth out the hills and valleys of power load over the course of the day. They also let power providers save electricity when it's cheap to produce, and sell it back on the grid at times when demand is high and power is expensive. It's often faster to build a battery facility than an equivalent power plant, and since there are no smokestacks, it's easier to get permits and approvals. 

Batteries have already proven useful for overstressed power networks. As temperatures reached triple digits in Texas last year, batteries provided a record amount of power on the Lone Star State's grid. ERCOT, the Texas grid operator, didn't have to ask Texans to turn down their power use like it did in 2023. Between 2020 and 2024, Texas saw a 4,100 percent increase in utility-scale batteries, topping 5.7 gigawatts. 

Grid batteries have a halo effect for other power generators too. Most thermal power plants — coal, gas, nuclear — prefer to run at a steady pace. Ramping up and down to match demand takes time and costs money, but with batteries soaking up some of the variability, thermal power plants can stay closer to their most efficient pace, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping costs in check. 

I have been covering clean energy for more than a decade, growing well-acquainted with the drawbacks of intermittent wind and solar power.

Batteries seemed like an obvious solution, and after one of my earliest reporting assignments, I thought that grid-level energy storage would take off. But the sector sat stagnant for years until it started to rocket upward around 2020.

I was curious about the reason why grid-scale batteries took off so suddenly and what heights they might reach.

“It's kind of like hybridizing your car,” Zahurancik said. “If you think about a Prius, you have an electric motor and you have a gasoline motor and you make the gas consumption better because the battery absorbs all the variation.”

Another grid battery feature is that they can reduce the need for expensive grid upgrades, said Stephanie Smith, chief operating officer at Eolian, which funds and develops grid energy storage systems. You don't have to build power lines to accommodate absolute maximum electricity needs if you have a battery — on the generator side or on the demand side — to dish out a few more electrons when needed. 

“What we do with standalone batteries, the more and more of those you get, you start to alleviate needs or at least abridge things like new transmission build,” Smith said. These batteries also allow the grid to adapt faster to changing energy needs, like when a factory shuts down or when a new data center powers up. 

On balance this leads to a more stable, efficient, cheaper, and cleaner power grid. 

As good as they are, lithium-ion batteries have their limits. Most grid batteries are designed to store and dispatch electricity over the course of two to eight hours, but the grid also needs ways to stash power for days, weeks, and even months since power demand shifts throughout the year. 

There are also some fundamental looming challenges for grid-scale storage. Like most grid-level technologies, energy storage requires a big upfront investment that takes decades to pay back, but there's a lot of uncertainty right now about how the Trump administration's tariffs will affect battery imports, whether there will be a recession, and if this disruption will slow electricity demand growth in the years to come. The extraordinary appetite for batteries is increasing competition for the required raw materials, which may increase their prices. 

Though China currently dominates the global battery supply chain, the US is working to edge its way in. Under the previous administration, the US Department of Energy invested billions in energy storage factories, supply chains, and research. There are dozens of battery factories in the US now, though most are aimed at electric vehicles. There are 10 US factories slated to start up this year, which would raise the total EV battery manufacturing capacity to 421.5 gigawatt-hours per year. Total global battery manufacturing is projected to reach around 7,900 gigawatt-hours in 2025. 

There's also a long and growing line of projects waiting to connect to the power grid. Interconnection queues for all energy systems, but particularly solar, wind, and batteries, typically last three years or more as project developers produce reliability studies and cope with mounting regulatory paperwork delays.

The Trump administration is also working to undo incentives around clean energy, particularly the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The law established robust incentives for clean energy, including tax credits for stand-alone grid energy projects. “I do worry about the IRA because it will change the curve, and quite honestly we cannot afford to change the curve right now with any form of clean energy,” Smith said. On the other hand, Trump's tariffs may eventually spur even more battery manufacturing within the US. 

Still, utility-scale energy storage is a tiny slice of the sprawling US power grid, and there's enormous room to expand. “Even though we've been accelerating and going fast, by and large, we don't have that much of it,” Zahurancik said. “You could easily see storage becoming 20 or 30 percent of the installed power capacity.”

Climate progress is actually good business.

At every light switch, power socket, and on the road, an unstoppable revolution is already underway. 

Technologies that can power our lives and jobs while doing less harm to the global climate — wind, solar, batteries, etc. — are getting cheaper, more efficient, and more abundant. The pace of progress on price, scale, and performance has been so extraordinary that even the most optimistic forecasts about green tech in the past have turned out to be too pessimistic. Clean energy isn't just powering our devices, tools, and luxuries — it's growing the global economy, creating a whole suite of new jobs, and reshaping trade.

And despite what headlines may say, there's no sign these trends will reverse. Political and economic turmoil may slow down clean energy, but the sector has built up so much momentum that it's become nigh unstoppable. 

Take a look at Texas: The largest oil- and gas-producing state in the US is also the largest in wind energy, and it's installing more solar than any other. Texas utilities have come to realize that investing in clean energy is not just good for the environment; it's good business. And even without subsidies and preferential treatment, the benefits of clean technologies — in clean air, scalability, distribution, and cost — have become impossible to ignore.

And there's only more room to grow. The world is still in the early stages of this revolution as market forces become the driver rather than environmental worries. In some US markets, installing new renewable energy is cheaper than running existing coal plants. Last year, the US produced more electricity from wind and solar power than from coal for the first time. 

If these energy trends persist, the US economy will see its greenhouse gas emissions diminish faster, reducing its contribution to climate change. The US needs to effectively zero out its carbon dioxide emissions by the middle of the century in order to keep the worst damages of climate change in check. 

Now, just a few months into Trump's second presidency, it's still an open question just how fragile the country's progress on clean energy and climate will be. But the data is clear: There is tremendous potential for economic growth and environmental benefits if the country makes the right moves at this key inflection point. 

Certainly incentives like tax credits, business loans, and research and development funding could accelerate decarbonization. On the other hand, pulling back — as the Trump administration wants to do — would slow down clean energy in the US, though it wouldn't stop it. 

But the rest of the world isn't sitting idle, and if the US decides to slow its head start, its competitors may take the lead in a massive, rocketing industry. —Umair Irfan, Vox climate correspondent

President Donald Trump does not like wind energy — apparently, in part, because he thinks turbines are ugly. “We're not going to do the wind thing,” Trump said after his inauguration during a rally. “Big, ugly windmills, they ruin your neighborhood.” 

He's put some power behind those feelings. Within mere hours of stepping into office, Trump signed an executive order that hamstrung both onshore and offshore wind energy developments, even as he has claimed that the US faces an energy crisis. The order directed federal agencies to temporarily stop issuing approvals for both onshore and offshore wind projects and pause leasing for offshore projects in federal waters.

Policies like this will harm the wind industry, analysts say, as will existing and potential future tariffs, which will likely make turbines more expensive. Those policies could also pose a serious threat to offshore developments. But the sector overall simply has too much inertia to be derailed, according to Eric Larson, a senior research engineer at Princeton University who studies clean energy. 

“Because costs have been coming down so dramatically in the last decade, there is a certain momentum there that's going to carry through,” Larson said.

Since 2010, US wind capacity has more than tripled, spurred by federal tax incentives. But even without those incentives — which Congress may eventually try to cut — onshore wind turbines are the cheapest source of new energy, according to the research firm Lazard. In 2023, the average cost of new onshore wind projects was two-thirds lower than a typical fossil fuel alternative, per a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency.

In fact, wind energy might be the best example of how politics have had little bearing on the growth of renewable energy. Texas, which overwhelmingly supported Trump in the recent election, generates more wind energy than any other state, by far. The next three top states for wind energy production — Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas — all swung for Trump in the last election, too. These states are particularly windy, but they've also adopted policies, including tax incentives, that have helped build out their wind-energy sectors. 

“It's just a way to make money,” Larson said of wind. “It has nothing to do with the political position on whether climate change is real or not. People continue to get paid to put up wind turbines, and that's enough for them to do it.” 

In Iowa, for example, wind energy has drawn at least $22 billion in capital investment and has helped lower the cost of electricity. In 2023, wind generated about 60 percent of the state's energy — more than double any other source, like coal or natural gas.

The wind sector is not without its challenges. In the last two years the cost of wind energy has gone up, due in part to inflation and permitting delays — which raised the costs of other energy sources, too. Construction of new wind farms had begun slowing even before Trump took office. Dozens of counties across the US, in places like Ohio and Virginia, have also successfully blocked or delayed wind projects, citing a range of concerns like noise and impact on property values. Offshore wind, which is far costlier, faces even more opposition. Opponents similarly worry that they'll affect coastal property values and harm marine life. 

Yet ultimately these hurdles will only delay what is likely inevitable, analysts say: a future powered in large part by wind. —Benji Jones, Vox environmental correspondent



It's hard to think of a natural wonder more unstoppable than the sun, and harnessing its energy has proven just as formidable. The United States last year saw a record amount of clean energy power up, with solar leading the way. Over the past decade, solar power capacity in the US has risen eightfold. 

Why? Solar has just gotten way, way, way cheaper, even more than wind. 

The main technology for turning sunlight into electricity, the single-junction photovoltaic panel, has drastically increased the efficiency by which it turns a ray of sunlight into a moving electron. This lets the same-size panel convert more light into electricity. Since the device itself is a printed semiconductor, it has benefited from many of the manufacturing improvements that have come with recent advances in computer chip production. 

Solar has also benefited from economies of scale, particularly as China has invested heavily in its production. This has translated into cheaper solar panels around the world, including the US. And since solar panels are modular, small gains in efficiency and cost reduction quickly add up, boosting the business case.

There are some clouds on the horizon, however. The single-junction PV panel may be closing in on its practical efficiency limit. Solar energy is variable, and some power grid operators have struggled to manage the spike in solar production midday and sudden drop-off in the evening, creating the infamous “duck curve” graph of energy demand that shows how fast other generators have to ramp up. Still, solar energy provides less than 4 percent of electricity in the US, so there is immense room to grow. Overall costs continue to decline, and new technologies are emerging that can get around the constraints imposed by conventional panels. Across the US and around the world, the sun has a long way to rise. —Umair Irfan



While wind and solar energy have soared upward for more than a decade, storing electricity on the grid with batteries is just taking off. 

Grid-scale battery capacity suddenly launched upward around 2020 and has about doubled every year since. That's good news for intermittent power sources, such as wind and solar: Energy storage is the booster rocket for renewables and one of the key tools for addressing the stubborn duck curve that plagues solar power. 

Batteries for the grid aren't that far removed from those that power phones and computers, so they've benefited from cost and performance improvements in consumer batteries. And they still have room to get cheaper.

On the power grid, batteries do a number of jobs that help improve efficiency and cut greenhouse gas emissions. The obvious one is compensating for the capriciousness of wind and solar power: As the sun sets and the wind calms, demand rises, and grid operators can tap into their power reserves to keep the lights on. The specific combination of solar-plus-storage is still a small share of utility-scale projects, but it's gaining ground in the residential market as these systems get cheaper.

Batteries also help grid operators cope with demand peaks: They can bank power when it's cheap and sell those electrons when electricity is more expensive. They also maintain grid stability and provide the juice to restart power generators after outages or maintenance. That means there's a huge demand for grid batteries beyond backing up renewables. 

Right now, the main way the US saves electricity on the grid is pumped hydropower, which currently provides about 96 percent of utility-scale storage. Water is pumped uphill into a reservoir when power is cheap and then runs downhill through turbines when it's needed. This method tends to lose a lot of energy in the process and is limited to landscapes with the ideal terrain to move water up and down. 

Batteries get around these hurdles with higher efficiencies, scalability, and modularity. And since they stay parked in one place, energy density and portability don't matter as much on the grid as they would in a car or a phone. That opens up several more options. Car batteries that have lost too much capacity to be worthwhile in a vehicle can get a second life on the power grid. Designs like flow batteries that store energy by the megawatt-hour and molten salt batteries that stash power for months could outperform the reigning lithium-ion battery. —Umair Irfan

Transportation is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Fossil fuels currently account for nearly 90 percent of the energy consumption in the transportation sector, which makes it an obvious target for decarbonization. And while it will take some time to figure out how to electrify planes, trains, and container ships, the growth of EVs, including passenger cars and trucks, has reached a tipping point.

The price of a new EV is nearly equivalent to a new gas-powered car, when you include state and federal subsidies. And the US charging infrastructure is getting better by the day: With over 200,000 chargers currently online, the number is growing. Even though the Trump administration has effectively waged war on the EV transition by pulling funding for charging infrastructure expansion and threatening to end subsidies for new EV purchases, at best those moves may slow a largely unstoppable EV transition in the long term. The automotive industry is all in on the electric transition. Buoyed by strong and growing EV sales trends in China and increasing EV offerings, global demand is growing.

There are signs, however, that the number of people buying EVs in the US and Europe is slowing, even as subsidies remain available. Experts say this is likely due, in part, to more consumer choice, as the number of EV offerings, including off-road trucks and minivans, continues to grow. But even here we see encouraging signs: As more EVs have come to market, more plug-in hybrid models have also appeared. And plug-in hybrids tend to be slightly cheaper and help people deal with range anxiety, the umbrella term for the fear of not being able to find a charger, while still reducing emissions.



“The early adopters who are just all in on that EV tech, they've adopted it,” Nicole Wakelin, editor at large of CarBuzz, told Vox in January. “So now it's up to everybody else to dip their toes in that water.”

Around the world, cheap EVs are surging in popularity. Prices of EV batteries, the most expensive component of the vehicle, are dropping globally even as their capacity grows. That trend is leading to more and more inexpensive EV models hitting the market. China, once again, is leading the charge here. The cheapest model from Chinese front-runner BYD now costs less than $10,000, and by 2027, Volkswagen promises it will sell a cheap EV in Europe for about $20,000. Meanwhile, in the US, the average price for a used EV in mid-2024 was $33,000, compared to $27,000 for an internal combustion engine vehicle. Those Chinese EVs aren't currently available in the US.

It remains to be seen how far Trump will go to keep America hooked on fossil fuels. It's clear, however, that more and more people want EVs and are buying them, charging them, and quite frankly, loving them. —Adam Clark Estes, Vox senior technology correspondent

For any of these clean energy sectors to reach their highest potential, there's an essential requirement they all share: a robust, skilled workforce. The good news for the clean energy industry is that data show the jobs are rolling in.

The 2024 Clean Jobs America report by E2, a national group focused on climate solutions across industries, paints a positive picture for clean jobs. Renewable energy jobs increased by 14 percent from 2020 to 2023 — a surge boosted by the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) climate-focused policies. Jobs in the solar sector have grown by 15 percent in that same period, with 12 percent growth for wind and 11 percent growth for geothermal. In just 2023 alone, 150,000 jobs in the clean energy industry were added. All together, clean energy outpaced economy-wide employment growth for the last five years.

And while the Trump administration has targeted the wind industry, rolled back some climate-friendly policies, and griped about solar, the administration's policies have yet to put a dent on positive job growth in clean jobs.

“I expect [the administration] will go after some provisions, but there is quite a bit in the IRA that will be very difficult to repeal since large-scale clean energy investments have been made, and a majority of those in red states whose politicians will not want to give them up,” one former US official told Heatmap News. Republican districts have benefited far more than progressive ones from clean tech manufacturing investments to the tune of over $161 billion, Bloomberg reported. Going after clean jobs would mean stalling economic growth in communities that helped deliver Trump a second term — a move that most would call politically unwise.



The clean industry is growing beyond the United States. Globally, clean energy sectors added over 4.7 million jobs to a total of 35 million from 2019 to 2022 — exceeding the amount of fossil fuel jobs internationally.

While the data bodes well for the industry, there are concerns from workers, unions, and communities that the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy may leave many skilled employees behind. One paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that fewer than 1 percent of fossil fuel workers have transitioned to green jobs, citing a lack of translatable skills — operating an oil derrick isn't as applicable to installing solar panels, for example. Another paper from Nature found that while some fossil fuel workers might have the right skills for clean energy jobs, the location of green jobs often aren't where fossil fuel workers are based. 

Several policy routes can be taken to create a more equitable transition for these workers, such as funding early retirement programs for fossil fuel workers who lose their jobs or heavily investing in fossil fuel communities where there is potential for creating renewable energy hubs. 

Clean energy jobs are growing, and it doesn't have to be at the cost of the 1.7 million workers in the US with fossil fuel occupations. —Sam Delgado

While President Trump has largely been hostile to renewable energy, there's one clean energy source that the administration actually supports: geothermal. 

Geothermal has long lived in the shadows of other renewables — especially as wind and solar have surged. But geothermal's potential may be greater than any of those, and ironically, being in Trump's good graces may give this sector the final boost it needs. 

If you know President Trump's motto of “drill, baby, drill,” this might not come as a surprise. Geothermal energy is tapped by drilling into the ground and extracting heat from the earth, and it uses similar technology to the oil and gas industry. US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has long praised geothermal, and the fracking company he oversaw prior to joining the Trump administration invested in Fervo Energy, a company that specializes in geothermal technologies. 

Despite the fact that the first geothermal plant was built in 1904 in Italy, the energy source is still in its infancy. In 2023, geothermal energy produced less than half a percent of total US utility-scale electricity generation, far behind other renewables like solar and wind. 

Historically, developing geothermal energy has been constrained by geography and relatively few have been built. Most geothermal production happens in the western United States because of the region's access to underground hot water that can drive turbines isn't too far from the surface. California dominates the geothermal landscape, with 67 percent of US geothermal electricity generation coming from the state — the outcome of state policy priorities and the right geologic conditions. The regional specificity has been a big barrier to geothermal taking off more broadly.

Then there's the issue of cost. Compared to solar and wind development and operations, building geothermal plants and drilling is much more expensive. And it currently costs more per megawatt hour than solar and wind. 

But these geographic and financial barriers could be broken down. Geothermal companies have been exploring enhanced geothermal, a method that could make it possible to drill for geothermal energy everywhere. Coupling enhanced geothermal with drilling technology and techniques from the oil and gas industry can also help with efficiency and bring down costs — a parallel to how advances in fracking in the early 2000s helped supercharge the US oil and gas industry.

What geothermal lacks in current scale, it makes up for in future potential. Because it's not intermittent and doesn't rely on specific weather conditions (the way that solar, wind, and hydropower do) geothermal has a capacity advantage over other renewables. In 2023, geothermal had a capacity factor, or how often an energy source is running at maximum power, of 69 percent, compared to 33 percent and 23 percent for wind and solar, respectively — meaning it's more capable of producing reliable power. 

That advantage could be critical for US decarbonization goals. According to the Department of Energy (DOE), enhanced geothermal has the potential to power more than 65 million homes and businesses in the US. 

Right now, stakeholders from energy policymakers to climate scientists to geothermal company executives, are determined to turn potential into reality. 

In March 2024, the DOE released a lengthy report on the necessary steps to unlocking enhanced geothermal's full potential on a commercial scale. In October of last year, the federal government approved a massive geothermal project in Utah that plans to provide power for more than 2 million homes and aims to be operational by 2026. The company behind the project and one of the leading enhanced geothermal startups, Fervo Energy, secured $255 million in funding from investors just before the year came to a close.

Geothermal also has bipartisan support (and is perhaps one of the few issues that the Biden and Trump administration would share similar views on). And because it's borrowing technology from the gas and oil industry, it can tap into former fossil fuel workers to staff these plants. 

But it's key to note that getting to take off will be really, really expensive — the DOE projects that it will take $20 billion to $25 billion to get geothermal ready for a commercial breakout by 2030. Geothermal's breakthrough isn't assured, but it's on the cusp of takeoff. If the necessary financial investments are made, and companies can show that advances in technology can be scaled up beyond the western US, it could usher in the age of a geothermal energy revolution. —Sam Delgado, former Future Perfect fellow

They've dreamed for years of smashing elite universities. Now they're getting their way.

by  Andrew Prokop

Back in 2021, far-right blogger Curtis Yarvin, who supports abolishing American democracy and replacing it with a dictatorship, went on a podcast to discuss how a hypothetical “American Caesar” might successfully carry out a power grab if elected president.

His interlocutor, then-former (and now, current) Trump official Michael Anton, argued that any such effort would fail because “the real power centers” in the US — the elite media and academic institutions exemplified by “Harvard and the New York Times” — would fight back.

“That's right,” Yarvin agreed. “That's why, basically, you can't continue to have a Harvard or a New York Times past the start of April.”

It's now April — and Harvard is suddenly facing an unprecedented assault from the Trump administration.

President Donald Trump has already revoked $2.2 billion in federal research funding for the university. He and his aides have suggested they may use more weapons of state power soon — revoking Harvard's nonprofit status through the IRS, taking away its certification to host international students, and scrutinizing its disclosures of foreign donations.

The assault on Harvard is part of a broader Trumpian assault on elite universities, which is itself part of a yet broader federal assault on progressive institutions and groups deemed enemies of the president (from Big Law firms to liberal nonprofits to mainstream media outlets). 

The attacks have various pretexts, but they fit a larger strategy that right-wing activists advocate. They believe that the best way of strengthening the right's cultural power is to force liberal and left-leaning institutions to bend the knee — or be destroyed. And though destroying Harvard will be a tall order, tactics like these likely will have massive long-term consequences, forever transforming the relationship between the federal government and academia.

Harvard became Trump's top target because it stood up to him in a high-profile way, announcing last Monday it would not give in to his demands. The school has won praise from Trump critics for resisting where Columbia University didn't last month. But really, Harvard had no choice but to fight back, because Trump officials' demands had become far more extreme.

Most notably, Trump officials demanded that every single department and teaching unit at Harvard, as well as the student body, face federal government-approved audits for “viewpoint diversity” every year through 2028. This essentially meant that the punishment would continue until Trump allies determined every component of Harvard had sufficiently moved to the right — a stunning federal intrusion on a private university.

Much of this seems plainly illegal, and Harvard is sure to fight back in court. But this may just be the start. Aides to Trump, the New York Times recently reported, “have spoken privately of toppling a high-profile university to signal their seriousness.” That is: They may not just want to change Harvard's ways — they may want to destroy it.

That's easier said than done. Harvard is well-positioned to fight back, both in court and via fundraising among its wealthy alumni network, and the school has an enormous endowment. But the longer-term trajectory for the relationship between universities and the federal government seems bleak. 

Now that Trump has pioneered the tactic of pulling funds to coerce and try to control universities, it seems hard to put that genie back in the bottle: The threat will loom during any future Republican presidency. Universities will likely have to either figure out how to live without the federal government, or make themselves more acceptable to the right.

Trump's stunning weaponization of government power against universities is happening partly because of his own vindictiveness. But it's also a strategy that certain thinkers and activists on the right have long advocated.

Conservatives have long complained that elite colleges and universities are poisoning the minds of America's youth with their far-left ways. But over the past decade — the decade of the Great Awokening — this has become increasingly central to the right's narrative of what ails America. Influential voices on the right, such as activist Christopher Rufo, argued “wokeness” was in large part created by elite universities. 

Yarvin, meanwhile, started focusing on this long before the wokeness wars. He's long asserted that progressives dominate US culture because of what he calls “the Cathedral” — elite academic and media institutions that, in his telling, set the bounds of acceptable political discourse and distort reality to fit their preferred ideological frames.

To people persuaded by this account, like Vice President JD Vance, the response seemed obvious: Vance said in 2021 that conservatives should “honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.”

Several developments in the 2020s made universities more vulnerable to these right-wing attacks. The Covid-19 pandemic turned many on the right against the medical establishment, making them more open to threatening scientific and medical research funding (which is most of the direct federal funding for universities). The Supreme Court declared Harvard's race-based affirmative action practices illegal in 2023, opening the door to future federal scrutiny over whether Harvard or other universities complied with the ruling. 

Above all, there was the eruption of the Israel-Gaza war and the pro-Palestinian protests that caused controversy on many campuses. Though many students and faculty members supported the protests, others — including major donors — opposed them, arguing Jewish students had become newly unsafe on campus. Protest supporters have argued this was a blatant effort to chill criticism of Israel. But the issue was bitterly divisive, Congress joined the fray, and Ivy League presidents (including Harvard's) were soon forced out.

The Trump administration cited those protests in creating a “Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism,” which has taken on the leading role in threatening funding for Harvard and other universities. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his allies have been similarly aggressive in taking a wrecking ball to the medical research status quo involving grants to universities. And recent reporting suggests Trump himself is personally involved in and excited about the effort.

Trump can clearly hurt Harvard. Layoffs are already beginning at the Harvard School of Public Health. The school can make up for some grant losses with new fundraising, but it will be quite hard to conjure up $2 billion — or much more, if the IRS revokes Harvard's nonprofit status, forcing it to pay taxes and removing the tax-deductibility of its donations.

But Harvard seems to have good prospects in court. Law professors have argued that Trump's rapid revocations of funding may well be illegal, and a politicized use of any IRS will likely bring court scrutiny too. The conservatives on the Supreme Court certainly have their gripes about elite universities, but they may blanche at Trump's apparently illegal attempts to burn them to the ground. (For what it's worth, four of the nine Supreme Court justices went to Harvard Law School, and four others went to Yale Law.)

Furthermore, Harvard's influence doesn't stem primarily from its federal funding — it comes from its prestige. And that prestige won't go away because of crude political assaults; indeed, it may be enhanced by the university's vow to stand up to Trump. While Harvard's reputation has been somewhat hurt amid the controversies of recent years, a principled stand against an unpopular and undemocratic president could in some ways prove rejuvenating.

Advocates like Rufo fixate on universities as the enemy who must be attacked or overhauled to smash progressives' cultural power. But in doing so, they overestimate the power of intimidation tactics and underestimate the importance of persuasion. If Trump's attacks on Harvard are widely viewed as an illegal abuse of power, they won't work. Put another way: University power brokers were deeply divided over Israel and Gaza, but now they're united against Donald Trump.

And while elite universities are clearly important and influential, the right-wing worldview in which they conceptualized and imposed wokeness on America seems to me extremely oversimplified. Was it that Harvard radicalized its students into becoming woke? Or did a new generation of Harvard students consuming lots of social media simply find left-wing views newly appealing, and act accordingly? Did Harvard change the kids, or did the kids change Harvard?

Beyond Harvard, though, other universities may well be in a tougher spot. It does seem clear that the federal government is no longer a partner that can be relied on for federal funding. If Trump can yank away billions of dollars in grants for political reasons, future Republican presidents — potentially, for instance, Vance — should be expected to do the same.

The previous status quo was that elite universities didn't particularly have to care whatsoever about what conservatives thought of them. The spectrum of relevant opinion that they took into account ranged from far-left activists to centrist socially liberal donors. Trump has changed that, and now everyone hoping for federal funding will have to look over their shoulder.

Of course, though Harvard's critics are most fired up about wokeness and Israel, the ultimate victims of all this will be scientific and medical researchers — as well as anyone who would have benefited from their findings. Funding for Harvard studies on tuberculosis, cancer treatment, and ALS has already been clawed back. The ultimate upshot of this agenda is to smash US scientific and medical expertise to own the libs.

﻿The world is steadily moving away from fossil fuels.

by  Sean Collins

The Trump administration came to power and promised to shift the US's energy policy to one centered on the mantra “drill baby drill.”

That raised the question — will President Donald Trump undo all the progress the US has made in recent years transitioning to renewable energy? 

To find the answer, Vox's climate and tech teams worked for weeks reporting a series of stories all about where the world stands with respect to renewable energy technologies, what might hasten or slow progress, and what the green revolution will really look like.

They found that humanity has reached what they call “escape velocity” when it comes to the green energy revolution. I recently talked with climate editor Paige Vega about how her team came to this conclusion, and what it means for the future. 

Check out all the excellent Escape Velocity stories here! I hope this Q&A brings additional insights. 

Where are we right now with energy under the new Trump administration?

Donald Trump's administration has made several moves to dismantle a suite of environmental regulations and really slow down climate progress, including taking us out of the Paris agreement. 

He's moved really, really quickly to incentivize this vision of an energy future that takes us back to reliance on fossil fuels. And he seems to want to advance a version of American energy dominance that represents a retroactive vision.

Despite all that, in a new project, your team explains that Trump's efforts might be diminished by the fact that we've hit a kind of “escape velocity” on climate?

That's right. Trump campaigned on all of the things he's beginning to implement now, and we know how his first term went. However, we've really gotten to this point where market forces, economics, and scalability of green technologies are converging to give climate progress enormous momentum. 

For instance, we're seeing the price of solar energy come down drastically, and that's making it a very attractive and cheap energy source. Companies and countries that are building new facilities and structures now, or that are looking to add energy to the grid, are finding that the easiest thing for them to do is to tap into energy sources like solar or wind, because they're abundant and very, very cheap.

We've also seen a ton of advancement in batteries and grid scale energy capacity. For a long time, one problem with solar or wind energy was that they are intermittent energy sources. It was difficult to power a home using wind energy when it wasn't windy. 

But now, we've enhanced our ability to create what are essentially giant batteries that can store energy from intermittent energy sources. And we've done that rapidly — since 2021, the utility scale battery capacity, meaning the ability for us to build big batteries and how much energy capacity they have, has accelerated at a rate of more than 30 times.

And that means now we have a lot more capacity to harness the energy from a very windy day and store it when we need it. 

So, we chose Escape Velocity as the name of our project because we think of this as a moment in which — like a rocket with all of this momentum that's like about to leave the atmosphere — we're on a trajectory to leave behind the energy regime of the past and move towards something else.

That's astounding about the batteries. What led to such rapid advances? 

It's really a case of technological innovation being stoked by the low cost of solar and wind. The price of harnessing that energy dropped so much that there was suddenly a strong market incentive, global dynamics and good policies in place for companies to really figure out this battery thing. 

Tell me more about the economic forces here.

There's a couple of different parts to that, and we have to widen the lens a little bit beyond America.

The cheapness of solar and wind are one part of the picture. Many states have capitalized on that type of energy, and still remain committed to it, despite what the federal government is trying to do right now.

In part because of that, there's an entire labor sector that is building up around this massive shift towards clean energy. We're seeing fewer jobs in fossil fuels, while in 2023, nearly 150,000 new clean energy jobs were created in a single year alone. 2021 was actually a really important year — that year clean energy jobs outnumbered jobs in fossil fuels. 

There's also the whole movement towards electric vehicles, and the expansion of infrastructure to support getting people out of gas-guzzling cars. America is in an interesting inflection period for this: If Trump succeeds in taking away the incentives for people to buy EVs, that could have a negative effect on the industry here in America. But those rebates were actually pretty narrow anyway, and we're seeing more and more people invest in hybrid cars. 

There's a lot of consumer desire and interest and excitement around different alternative types of vehicles that are hitting the market, worldwide. In China, there are several companies — mostly famously BYD — that are making really attractive and affordable consumer cars that are entirely electric. Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles are picking up in Mexico, Pakistan, and in European countries, too. And that's because these vehicles are cheap and easy to charge. 

You mention a lot of other countries there. Is the US in danger of getting left behind under Trump?

Regardless of what the US does, the rest of the world is going to zoom ahead with this. The United States actually has a strong hand to play here, but right now we're actively sabotaging it.

There is a real risk that we come to a situation where much of the world has cheap, clean energy that's out of reach for Americans. 

China in particular has clearly seen the writing on the wall, is investing in clean energy as well as the infrastructure to support EVs, and so on. They have the infrastructure to manufacture the batteries and technology the transition requires. And so they're a leader in this space. 

Now is actually a good time for the US to make a shift. We're at a time where much of our energy grid and our transmission lines are aging. They need to be refurbished, and that's going to be really, really expensive. To do the necessary work would mean pouring a lot of money into an energy system that was designed to utilize fossil fuels and not to harness the potential of emerging energy sources.

If we're going to spend so much money doing that, why not use the money instead to realize a version of a US power system that is better able to harness renewable energy? There is no avoiding the fact that we're going to have to switch over to these renewable energy sources at some point. 

Might some states decide to make this transition on their own, regardless of federal policy? 

We're seeing some Republican politicians standing up for certain provisions within the Inflation Reduction Act — Biden's huge climate law — that invested billions of dollars into making that shift to renewables. And that creates an interesting tension with the White House.

Places like Alabama, Kentucky, and Texas, all predominantly red states, are seeing a real boom in the shift to clean energy jobs. And some red states get an important share of their power from solar and wind — Iowa, for example, gets 60 percent of its energy from wind alone.

Because of all this, I think we may see Trump becoming more open to maintaining certain federal clean energy policies than we think, maybe by rebranding them. We already see Trump embracing a few types of renewable energies, like geothermal and nuclear, which seem to be in Trump's good graces. 

I think politicians, governors across the country, nonprofits, and businesses have figured out that Trump's dislike of renewable energy is partially a branding issue, and you see different entities trying to repackage these technologies in a way that they think Trump would like better. 

That's a hopeful note.

I think readers can find a lot of hope within our package of stories, and a lot of rebellion in it. Escape Velocity is really all about rejecting the idea that climate action lives and dies by who holds power for just four years. The future is still being shaped.

The future for our planet looks bleak. Here's why it's not.

by  Paige Vega

Donald Trump made his energy plans pretty clear during the campaign: more fossil fuels, fewer environmental protections, and a full-on retreat from global climate cooperation. 

Nearly 100 days into his second administration, he has moved with dizzying speed to fulfill those promises. 

On Day 1, he pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, making it the only country to walk away from the global pact to limit warming (again). His administration slashed or froze funding for clean energy development — particularly wind — that Congress had already approved. At the same time, Trump has aggressively pushed fossil fuel expansion, declaring a national “energy emergency” to ram through oil and gas projects, and has even proposed reversing the Environmental Protection Agency's foundational finding that greenhouse gas emissions are dangerous — a move that would rip the legal underpinnings out from decades of climate law.

And, of course, with the help of Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, the machinery of climate action is being actively dismantled: Thousands of public servants have already been fired, programs axed, climate references scrubbed from websites.

But here's the thing: As damaging as Trump's actions have been, the climate fight isn't over — far from it. Trump's actions might delay our efforts to confront climate change, but the reality is that progress might actually be unstoppable.

We've reached a hopeful inflection point where the economics and technology of clean energy have gathered enough momentum that not even the politics of 2025 can halt it. Hence the name of Vox's new package: Escape Velocity. 

Simply put, clean energy is no longer just the right thing to develop — it's good business. Wind and solar? Among the cheapest sources of electricity in the world. Batteries and electric cars? Getting better and more accessible by the year.

That doesn't mean the fossil fuel industry isn't still powerful — it is. And fossil fuel subsidies are alive and well. But the progress we've made isn't the kind you can reverse with a single election.

The energy economy is transitioning. Technology is advancing. The market is shifting. Our politics might feel stuck, but in many important ways, we continue to move forward.

And that matters, because every fraction of a degree of warming that we can avoid means lives saved, futures preserved, and more natural disasters averted.

This year is the halfway point of this century to 2050, the year stamped on so many of the world's most critical climate targets. It's a good time to ask whether the energy transition is moving fast enough to help us get there — and what hard-won progress is likely to outlast even the most determined opposition?

With Escape Velocity, the Vox climate team set out to answer those questions. We looked at the unexpected places where progress is still happening, the tech that's quietly changing everything, and the tectonic shifts that have changed the economic calculus of a warming world.

The climate fight was never going to be easy. Trump in many ways will make it harder. But contrary to the headlines, it has not been lost. And in many ways that matter, it's being won.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Nvidia is the original hardcore tech company. Alums say CEO Jensen Huang's demanding pace reigns.","https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-hardcore-intensity-culture-mission-driven-jensen-huang-2025-4","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Nvidia doesn't need a big cultural shift to get workers to be hardcore. It's been there for years.

Companies like Shopify, Microsoft, and Meta are ramping up the intensity for workers, pushing the need to get ahead in AI and drive efficiency. The shift inside tech companies has led to a culling of ""low performers,"" inflexible return-to-office mandates, and a reduction in perks.

Nvidia's staff has grown immensely in the past few years, and its market capitalization is on a wild roller coaster ride. But the tentpoles of the company's culture go back much further than the AI boom. The company and its CEO, Jensen Huang, are also the subject of two books released in the past four months, which corroborate what former Nvidians have told Business Insider.

Nvidia has a demanding work culture that trickles down from its famous CEO, providing a foil for the tech firms that aspire to be hardcore but do so by fiat.

""Basically, every single person in Nvidia is directly accountable to Jensen,"" said Stephen Witt, the author of ""The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World's Most Coveted Microchip.""

Nvidia declined a request for comment from BI.

Nvidia has an extremely horizontal structure, with dozens of people — about 60 — reporting directly to Huang.

He sets the direction and the goal, but the Santa Clara, California, company also has a defining mantra: ""The mission is the boss,"" Tae Kim wrote in his book ""The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant.""

Nvidia shies away from short-term goals, Kim said. There's a central goal or mission, but planning and strategizing are constant processes that don't focus on management incentives or satisfying a hierarchy.

Project leaders may suddenly find themselves reporting directly to Huang. These newly anointed direct reports are dubbed ""pilots in charge"" and are subject to his wrath and carry his weight, Kim said.

A former Nvidia employee who asked to remain anonymous to discuss internal matters said everyone in the company must be prepared to answer Huang in detail.

""His ability to track small details across countless projects is incredible,"" a former director told BI.

This method of extreme accountability means Nvidia hasn't had to rein in employees as many other companies have postpandemic. Nvidia is still remote-friendly, for example. But meetings are far from relaxing.

Huang is known to publicly discuss failures and disagreements to benefit the group rather than spare feelings. If he suspects someone isn't on top of their work, a public cross-examination may ensue. Perks are few, but that's always been the case, two former Nvidians told BI.

The ""mission is boss"" ethos helps Nvidia avoid the pitfalls of large firms, which often struggle to make quick decisions, let alone pivot when needed, Kim wrote.

""Jensen really doesn't tolerate"" nonsense, a former engineer from Nvidia's early days told BI. This intolerance makes playing politics nearly impossible, they added.

""It's not just, 'You did something wrong.' It's, 'You did something wrong that was self-serving' — that's the typical problem in big companies,"" they said.

The philosophy is that the mission can change, but as long as everyone serves it rather than their manager, the company should thrive. Nvidia's pivot to focus on machine learning was even communicated in 2014 in a companywide Friday-night email. By Monday, Nvidia was an AI company, Witt wrote.

Huang is known to send more than 100 emails a day, which brings another ""Jensen-ism"" into play. (Kim's book has an entire appendix of Jensen-isms.)

The 62-year-old CEO often refers to Nvidia's modus operandi as ""speed of light."" That's how fast Huang wants everything at Nvidia to progress. He's publicly used the phrase to refer to hiring processes and fixing technical problems.

Witt thinks that Nvidia's email culture may have inspired a memorable moment from the early days of the White House DOGE office. On a Saturday, Elon Musk requested that every federal government employee send a five-point email recounting what they had done that week. Huang has requested these emails from his staff since 2020.

Kim said at least 100 of Huang's daily diet of emails are ""top five"" emails.

The irony in Nvidia's position among the Silicon Valley elite is that the ""mission is boss"" mentality and the constant email status updates mean a lot of Nvidians have flexibility that most of Big Tech, including Nvidia's largest customers, have abandoned in 2025.

The hours can be long at Nvidia, which also stems from Huang. Sixty-hour weeks are the norm, and 80-hour weeks are likely at crucial times, a contrast to companies that feel the need to delineate exact office hours.

""I don't even know when Jensen sleeps,"" another former Nvidia director said.

Many Nvidians are still able to work from wherever they like. The reason is twofold, Witt said.

""One of the reasons he's so big on work-from-home is because it gives women, and especially young mothers, the opportunity to continue their work without their careers getting interrupted,"" Witt said.

Inspired by his wife, Lori Huang, an electrical engineer who dropped out of the workforce after becoming a mother of two, Huang is aware that some valuable engineering brains find balancing work and family difficult.

""It works really well at Nvidia,"" Witt said. ""You know if you're dropping the ball at Nvidia, the spotlight is turning directly at you, more or less instantly. There is nowhere to hide if you are shirking your work at Nvidia, and I think that makes work-from-home work better for them.""

If there's one hallmark of the new era of hardcore tech culture, it's layoffs. Rolling layoffs are constantly whirring in the background of tech workplaces in 2025.

That's where Nvidia diverges from the pack.

The company hasn't had layoffs since 2008, and despite the hard-charging atmosphere rife with accountability, the turnover at the company is minuscule — under 5% annually for the past two years.

Witt said that's in part due to a self-selection dynamic. Engineers who like a no-nonsense atmosphere where technological supremacy is the focus naturally gravitate toward the company.

""He can get these guys to work for Nvidia on little more than a dream, but those guys will do it because they know the circuits; they know the technology,"" Witt told BI. ""And they know that Jensen's always at the cutting edge, even if it's not making money. They'll do anything to be at the cutting edge.""

But another reason many Nvidians spend decades with the company may come from Huang's competitive anxiety.

""When Nvidia is evaluating an engineer, they won't think just about what they're worth,"" Witt said. ""They'll think about what it's worth to keep that person away from the competition.""

Huang, though, has offered a different explanation.

""I don't like giving up on people because I think that they could improve,"" Huang said at a Stripe event last year. ""It's kind of tongue in cheek, but people know that I'd rather torture them into greatness.""

DOGE is taking America back to the 1800s, one agency closure at a time

If Elon Musk's effort to remake the federal government was ever really about ""waste, fraud, and abuse,"" those DOGE days are over. His quasi-agency has made huge and unprecedented changes to what the federal government does. But ask an economist, historian, or political scientist why, or what it all means, and you'll get a sad-sounding laugh in response.

One thing is clear: There were never many savings to be found. Last year, Musk predicted he could cut $2 trillion from the federal budget. (That was always going to be tough, mathematically, given that the government's entire discretionary budget is $1.7 trillion.) In January, Musk revised his estimate down to $1 trillion. Earlier this month, he revised the revision down to $150 billion.

On the other hand, DOGE has been very good at reducing the number of people who work for the government — as many as 216,000 federal employees and contractors are already out, with more dismissals in the works. Musk has gutted or eliminated agencies that prevent disease, protect us from pandemics, provide aid to our allies, ensure the safety of our food and medicines, and safeguard Americans against toxic chemicals. Every one of those efforts is a proven multiplier of our tax money — every dollar we spend on them redounds to the US economy. Which means that even if Musk succeeds at slashing government spending, he'll actually be adding to the federal deficit: DOGE cuts to the Internal Revenue Service alone are estimated to cost America some $500 billion in lost tax revenue every year.

So if DOGE isn't saving us money, what's the reason for all the cuts? It can't be motivated by the cliché that ""government should be run like a business."" No successful business runs on the kind of bedlam being sown by Musk. What, in short, is going on here?

Here are four possible explanations for what DOGE is actually up to. Maybe none of them are right. Or perhaps they're all accurate, to varying degrees. But one thing is certain: Each of them provides a more plausible insight into what DOGE is doing than the official explanation of saving taxpayers money.

For the past decade and a half, rich guys in Silicon Valley have been trying to leave it all behind — government regulation, wokeist diversity efforts, naysaying journalists, even the Earth itself. Broadly speaking, they call this idea ""exit."" In a 2009 blog post, the influential investor Peter Thiel declared that it was time for tech entrepreneurs to abandon the concept of democracy and start their own city-states. A companion piece to that post — written by Patri Friedman, grandchild of the free-market economist Milton Friedman — peddled the idea of ""seasteads,"" floating cities in the ocean, beyond the jurisdiction of any nation. Musk, meanwhile, launched a company devoted to taking a select sliver of humanity to Mars, and the Exit crowd went all in on cryptocurrencies — money without a pesky state attached.

In a book published in 2022, the venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan laid out a blueprint for Exit. ""Technology has enabled us to start new companies, new communities, and new currencies,"" his website declared. ""But can we use it to start new cities, or even new countries? This book explains how to build the successor to the nation state, a concept we call the network state.""

In a sense, DOGE is serving as a sort of advance guard for Exit. It's cutting away every government function that isn't useful to a future network state (stuff that protects the vulnerable and supports the needy) while retaining the resources needed to found Exit-style cities (the blockchain, census data, border control). Casey Lynch, a geographer at the University of Girona who studies Exit politics, says that's in line with how Exiteers think: ""The only things the government should be doing are administrative functions necessary to maintain the market. And the only kinds of government services that are necessary are those related to things like upholding financial transactions, fighting identity theft, and protecting property rights.""

This, in essence, is the new Exit: Don't secede from the government — absorb the government, digest it, and excrete a new one. A few groups have even met with the Trump administration to get his support for launching what they're calling ""Freedom Cities."" Like a Thiel-backed prototype in Honduras, these enclaves would be economically autonomous zones, free from government limits on Exit passion projects like longevity treatments or nuclear fusion research. Srinivasan has proposed making the area around Musk's SpaceX facility in Texas into one, and other folks have proposed building one in Greenland — after it's acquired by the United States, of course. The move is supported by Ken Howery, a college pal of Thiel's who is Trump's nominee to serve as ambassador to Denmark.

Traditional libertarians believe that people and markets function just fine — better, even — with minimal government oversight. That's what Ronald Reagan's cowboy-inflected individualism was all about: shrinking government and letting the markets do as they wanted. But Reagan was careful to leave untouched two cornerstones of federal governance: Social Security, to protect against dissent from within, and a hefty nuclear arsenal, to guard against threats from without.

Silicon Valley libertarianism scraps the social safety net and the nukes. It's closer to the venture investor Mark Andreessen's vision of ""techno-optimism,"" where digital technologies and unfettered markets solve every human problem. It's not just having Amazon replace the post office, or bitcoin taking the place of banks — it's ""deleting"" regulations across all of government, no matter how critical they are to America's health and safety and financial well-being.

In this explanation, DOGE is attempting to turn back the clock to the regulation-free excesses of the Gilded Age. In the 1910s and 1920s, America was dominated by industrial oligarchs, plagued by race and class struggles, and free from laws that kept food safe and the air and water clean. It took a spectacular market crash, and a Great Depression, to usher in the modern age of federal oversight.

DOGE effectively wants to return America to the days before the New Deal, when industrialists could do as they pleased. Musk, in fact, has called for a ""wholesale, spring cleaning"" of all federal regulation. ""If it's not possible now, it'll never be possible,"" he said during a midnight call in February. ""This is our shot. This is the best hand of cards we're ever going to have. And if we don't take advantage of this best hand of cards, it's never going to happen, so we're going to do it.""

Perhaps that techno-libertarian vision — of a digitized world without government — is the entire point of DOGE. ""You strip government down to remove all the parts of it that are resisting you,"" says David Lewis, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University, ""and rebuild it in a way that makes it, in your view, more efficient and responsive to you."" That's actually more authoritarian than libertarian. But it does make government smaller — and weaker. And the weaker government is, the more the powerful can call the shots.

Tyler Cowen, a leading thinker on the right, has criticized what he calls ""the libertarian vice."" Libertarians love it, he says, when the state fails — even if the private sector can't or won't step in to fix things.

But what if Musk's libertarian vice is actually plain old greed? Consider some of the specific agencies DOGE has slashed. Why cut NASA, a broadly popular and relatively inexpensive operation? Well, without NASA to launch rockets, it would be left to private companies like SpaceX to get stuff into outer space. The same is true of DOGE's cuts to the Office of Vehicle Automation Safety, which has ordered dozens of Tesla recalls and delayed the rollout of self-driving software. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have collected a dozen examples of DOGE targeting agencies that are trying to regulate Musk. One thing DOGE hasn't gone after? SpaceX's contracts for military space launches — jobs worth $5.9 billion to the world's richest man.

Musk isn't the only Silicon Valley beneficiary of DOGE's assault. The IRS is turning to Palantir, the security and data company cofounded by Peter Thiel, to assemble all its data into one giant, easily surveilled bucket. The company is also handling the data back end for ICE's planned mass deportations. The Justice Department, meanwhile, is disbanding its team of lawyers responsible for going after cryptocurrency crime. So maybe DOGE is just an inside job — a case of technologists using their access to Donald Trump to loot the Treasury and line their own pockets.

Maybe DOGE is just really, really bad at its job. I mean, why would anyone cause this much chaos for so little demonstrable gain?

""It is tempting to think there is some strategy behind it,"" says Zachary Liscow, a Yale professor who served as chief economist of the Office of Management and Budget during the Biden administration. ""But these are just not competent people. They often don't have a plan, or it's often not well thought out.""

There's certainly a lot of evidence that DOGE is incompetent. It's staffed by a bunch of kids from Musk's world who bring virtually no experience in either government or business to the job. Its reports on the cuts it's making have been hysterically inaccurate. It has cut things it didn't know it was cutting — like the agency responsible for making sure nuclear reactors don't melt down — and then scrambled to restore them after the fact. And by grinding away at the government's ability to do anything, it's introduced a crippling level of turmoil and uncertainty to America, both at home and abroad. ""It's definitely making us less effective,"" says Liscow.

And that's the bottom line, really, when it comes to DOGE. At a basic level, Musk's assault on the federal government represents a rejection of modernity itself. ""You can't do modern life without modern regulation,"" says Lewis, the political scientist. ""Transportation systems, energy systems, waste systems, internet systems — all of those things require government interventions and monitoring to work effectively."" If Musk makes good on his promise to pull the plug on every regulation in sight, the world as we know it would effectively shut down.

I said this sounded like the Gilded Age, but in some ways DOGE is turning the clock back even further. Before the Civil War, the federal government was far weaker and more diffuse than it is today. Individual states competed over tariffs and railroads and lots of other stuff we now think of as national functions. Companies could employ children at starvation wages, dump whatever they wanted into America's streams and rivers, and sell quack remedies that were more likely to kill you than cure you. That's roughly where a DOGE-denuded federal government puts us. Forget 1920 — think 1850.

Musk seems to think America's administrative infrastructure is bureaucratic frippery. To him, just having it is wasteful. ""There are more federal agencies than there are years since the establishment of the United States,"" Musk observed during an interview with Tucker Carlson. ""Which means that we've created more than one federal agency per year, on average. That seems crazy."" Carlson responded by pulling his ""That's insane!"" face for the camera, as if Musk had just invented arithmetic.

But that math is not math. Times, as they say, change. Look at all the things we depend on today that weren't even fathomable at the nation's founding: cars and planes and polystyrene and aspirin and the internet and high fructose corn syrup and phones and recorded music and electricity. We've created way more technological marvels than federal agencies. A National Transportation Safety Board is a small price to pay for the wonders of intercontinental flight.

And it isn't just that the world is more complicated than it was in 1776 or 1850 or 1920. It's that most of the advances we enjoy today were, in one way or another, created because of government, not in spite of it. An enduring and reliable state — one that invests in innovation, ensures economic stability, and makes sure everyone plays by the rules — is literally what makes technological progress possible. Musk can't take the government all the way back to the 18th century, even if he'd like to. But if he makes good on his promises with DOGE, America's future may end up looking a lot more like its past.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","More than 100 public software companies are getting 'squeezed' by AI, according to a new study","https://www.businessinsider.com/software-companies-squeezed-by-ai-alixpartners-2025-4","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

A foundational shift is underway in enterprise software, and it's being driven by generative AI.

The rise of reasoning models and AI agents is beginning to erode the core assumptions that have defined the software-as-a-service business model for decades, according to a new study released on Monday by AlixPartners.

The consulting firm warned that this is squeezing more than 100 mid-market software companies, which are stuck in the midst of a powerful trend.

These companies are caught in a ""big squeeze,"" pressured on one side by nimble, AI-native entrants that can replicate applications at a fraction of the cost and on the other side by tech behemoths, such as Microsoft and Salesforce, that are pouring billions of dollars into the AI arms race, AlixPartners said.

""We believe many mid-size enterprise software companies will face threats to their survival over the next 24 months,"" the firm added ominously. It declined to identify specific companies, given the sensitive nature of its findings.

The most mature uses of AI in enterprise software today include copilots for software coding, such as GitHub Copilot from Microsoft, and support chatbots like Zendesk's Answer Bot. But these could be just the beginning. Generative AI is advancing from narrow use cases to the broader ""logic and presentation layers"" of software, the very foundation that traditional SaaS tools are built on, AlixPartners explained in the study.

This means AI agents are no longer just assistants within applications; they are becoming the applications themselves. These agents are capable of handling complex tasks, such as scheduling meetings, analyzing reports, and creating code, with little need for a graphical interface or structured workflow. And because they can run across various data types without needing extensive data normalization, they could render some traditional SaaS layers redundant.

""This shift could eliminate the need for many enterprise software companies that thrived in the traditional SaaS architecture,"" AlixPartners said.

This puts mid-size SaaS vendors in a tricky position, the firm explained, citing a recent analysis it conducted of 122 publicly listed enterprise software companies with annual revenue below $10 billion.

It found that sales growth has slowed considerably lately. For instance, the percentage of high-growth companies in this group decreased from 57% in 2023 to 39% in 2024. This year, industry analysts are expecting further declines, indicating that only 27% of companies will be in the high-growth category.

AlixPartners also highlighted that software customers are moving around more than before. The median net dollar retention rate of enterprise software companies dropped from 120% in 2021 to 108% in the third quarter of 2024, the firm noted, citing data from Bank of America. (NDR is a common way to measure customer stickiness. When it's above 100%, that indicates revenue from existing customers is growing, while an NDR below 100% suggests revenue is declining from these sources.)

Many of these companies are now being undercut by AI-powered challengers with lower costs and faster iteration cycles. Simultaneously, larger players are integrating AI into their broader platforms, offering bundled functionality at lower price points through economies of scale, according to the consulting firm.

Klarna's recent decision to drop Salesforce and Workday in favor of smaller AI-powered vendors and in-house agents is a sign of where this trend may be headed, AlixPartners noted.

Traditional SaaS depends heavily on the user interface, structured data workflows, and seat-based pricing. But AI agents don't need dashboards, and they can function without rigid data hierarchies. This calls into question the relevance of the SaaS model itself, according to AlixPartners.

Some companies are already pivoting. Salesforce and ServiceNow have begun experimenting with outcome-based pricing for AI agents, where fees are tied to results, not user counts.

Among those 122 mid-sized software companies, AlixPartners found that half expect significant changes to business models in the next year.

At the same time, the compute costs associated with running AI agents can be significantly higher than for classic SaaS tools, making profit margin compression a potential threat. Software providers may need to rethink infrastructure strategies, possibly shifting to more efficient inference architectures, industry experts have warned recently.

Meanwhile, higher interest rates and tightening capital markets in recent years have put the onus on SaaS profitability, not just growth. Software companies have responded by cutting costs, optimizing portfolios, and rethinking pricing strategies.

According to the AlixPartners report, more than 60% of executives are now focused on AI as a growth driver. Unlocking that growth requires more than just product tweaks, it may require transformation across operations, go-to-market models, and customer relationships, the consulting firm suggested.

So what's the path forward? The report discusses several strategic imperatives. Here are a few:

In a world where generative AI tools can write or replicate software pretty well, differentiation must come from speed, relevance, and efficiency, not UI design or legacy feature sets.

The software era isn't ending. But the SaaS era, as we know it, is evolving. The next generation of enterprise tools may not be applications, they could be agents. And only the most adaptable companies will make the leap, according to AlixPartners.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I'm a machine learning lead at Adobe. I got ahead by prototyping fast — and by embracing vulnerability.","https://www.businessinsider.com/career-adobe-machine-learning-ai-prototyping-fast-vulnerability-tech-2025-4","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Surabhi Bhargava, a machine tech lead at Adobe's San Jose office. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified her employment.

In just five years, I went from an entry-level machine learning engineering role to a machine learning tech lead at Adobe. It's been quite the journey.

What's been key for me is that I always had the chance to work on Adobe's most relevant AI projects.

AI has advanced rapidly over the last five years. I started with computer vision, moved to natural language processing, and now I'm focused on generative AI.

The key to my advancement has been consistently finding the right opportunities, being in the right place at the right time, and sometimes starting projects from scratch.

A key aspect of working in this industry is translating ideas into real products.

You've probably heard the phrase ""show, don't tell."" People often share ideas but don't usually have proof of concept or something tangible people can interact with.

Having something real that others can test goes much further than just talking about ideas.

I've always made it a point to translate my ideas into something people can try. I'd create initial prototypes and give them to product managers or senior folks. If they liked it, we'd move forward with developing the product.

If not, I'd get feedback and useful information to iterate it further.

It doesn't need to be an entire product or have a shiny user interface — just something tangible they can engage with. A simple front-end that lets them test the backend tech works just fine.

This approach helps me build faster, get feedback faster, and share ideas more broadly, which builds credibility.

When people work on similar projects and need collaborators, you want to be the first person they think of. Having visible work behind you makes that much more likely.

Building connections at work is valuable, but it wasn't natural for me to go up and talk to someone randomly.

I had to push myself out of my comfort zone. What I found was that the more vulnerable I was — whether talking about the challenges I was facing or the opportunities I was seeking — the more others opened up, too. This wasn't just with my manager — it was across the company.

As a minority in tech, having a strong support system, like fellow women engineers, was also important.

Being open about my struggles and ambitions encouraged others to share their experiences and offer valuable help. The key was always bringing that advice back to my work and growth.

People don't do that enough. You won't always get what you ask for, but you definitely won't get it unless you ask. This applies not only to career progression but also to life advice.

Vulnerability helps create those connections — people are more likely to support you when you let them in. Be open, reach out without hesitation, and help will come in unexpected ways.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Beating the system or cheating it? I set out to learn the ethics of secretly working multiple remote jobs.","https://www.businessinsider.com/ethical-secretly-work-multiple-remote-jobs-contract-conflict-interest-2025-4","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 08:03:00 GMT","

Some Americans are secretly working multiple full-time remote jobs simultaneously. Whether it's beating the system or cheating depends on who you ask.

Over the past two years, I've interviewed more than two dozen ""overemployed"" people, many of whom work in the IT and tech sectors. These people have doubled and tripled their earnings by juggling multiple roles simultaneously, and used their extra income to travel the world, buy expensive weight loss drugs, and pay off their student debt.

These stories have drawn a wide range of reactions from readers. Some people have commended these job jugglers for finding a way to maximize their earnings and job security. Others have argued that these workers are taking advantage of their employers — getting full-time pay without giving full-time attention — and holding jobs that unemployed Americans need.

I asked four ethics academics and consultants to weigh in on the debate. The consensus: Secretly juggling multiple full-time remote jobs isn't ethical, but the motivations behind it are understandable.

Several of the sources Business Insider spoke with said the ethics question often starts with whether an employee has a contract and what it says.

Todd Haugh, an associate professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University, said that if an employee's contract stipulates that they must work exclusively for their employer, it'd be hard to argue that it's ethical for them to work another job.

However, Haugh said most workers in the US are ""at will"" employees who don't have formal employee contracts, which generally allows them to be fired or quit at any time. He thinks many job jugglers are likely breaching their employer's implied expectation that they'll focus fully on only one job during work hours. Even if a worker doesn't have a formal contract that prohibits job juggling, Haugh said they could be fired if they're found out.

""We expect that if you took a job with one company, you work for just that company,"" he said. ""You're going to give your full attention, time, and energy to that particular company.""

Jeffrey Moriarty, executive director of the Hoffman Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University, feels similarly.

""When you promise to work during certain hours for an employer, you implicitly promise not to work for another employer during that time period,"" he said, adding that job juggling likely involves lying and deception, behaviors generally frowned upon from an ethical standpoint.

Moriarty said workers likely wouldn't appreciate it if their employer started violating implicit agreements without their consent. For example, by paying them in a ""wheelbarrow full of pennies"" instead of the direct deposit they assumed was a given, he said.

Elizabeth Anderson, a professor of public philosophy at the University of Michigan and author of ""Value in Ethics and Economics,"" said she believes lying is generally wrong, but an employer isn't entitled to know whether someone is working multiple jobs unless it's explicitly prohibited in an employment contract.

""As long as the salaried employee is working hard enough not to get fired, the employee has done everything they owe to their employer and is not obligated to reveal that they are moonlighting for someone else,"" she said.

Additionally, she doesn't think it would be unethical for an employee to evade a question about their work status or offer ""truthful but misleading"" information.

In the case of contract workers, who are often hired temporarily for a specific purpose, Anderson said job juggling is ethically acceptable unless it is explicitly prohibited in a formal contract.

""Their employer has no loyalty to them — else they'd be permanent — so no loyalty is owed back,"" she said.

Overemployment could open the door to other ethical trouble, along with questions about loyalty.

Chris MacDonald, an associate professor at Toronto Metropolitan University who also consults on ethics, said it could create a conflict of interest if a person juggles multiple jobs and the employers are in the same field, presenting a different set of ethical concerns.

Meanwhile, Anderson said it would be wrong to work for a second employer from the first employer's office, rather than from a separate workspace, she added. And if an employee is paid by the hour, they should only bill for the time actually spent working for that employer.

While some job jugglers might think it's fine to have multiple jobs if the work gets done, MacDonald said it's probably wrong unless they've asked their employers first. Additionally, he said there could be times when performing well at two or more jobs isn't realistic.

""When two bosses both give you urgent deadlines on a Friday afternoon, who will you be loyal to?"" he said. ""You're likely going to have to lie to one of them, and probably fail in your responsibilities to them as well.""

However, not every overemployed person will agree. In fact, Haugh said job jugglers likely have little trouble coming up with their own justifications for their working arrangements.

""Individuals are very good at viewing their own behavior as ethical,"" he said. ""They come up with lots of good stories about why it's OK to do a thing, when really, if you step back objectively and look at it, oftentimes it's a lot harder to defend.""

In Black Power Scorecard, Andre Perry highlights effective local policies to invest in Black communities.

Photographer: Paul Morigi/Brookings

In Brookings Institution scholar Andre Perry's 2020 book Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities, he coined a phrase that for a moment caught fire: “There's nothing wrong with Black people that ending racism can't solve.” That book took on the problem of unfair appraisals for Black-owned homes and the undervaluing of properties in majority-Black neighborhoods.

In his follow-up, Black Power Scorecard: Measuring the Racial Gap and What We Can Do to Close It, released April 15, he takes a more expansive view, examining the many factors that lead to not just the artificial depreciation of Black properties, but of Black lives in general.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

A federal judge has once again blocked Department of Government Efficiency staffers, operating inside the Social Security Administration, from accessing sensitive personal data of millions of Americans.

U.S. District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander on Thursday granted a preliminary injunction to block the so-called DOGE from further accessing sensitive personal data stored by the agency. As a result, DOGE will have to comply with certain legal requirements when accessing SSA data. The order applies specifically to SSA employees who are working on the DOGE agenda.

The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; the AFL-CIO; American Federation of Teachers and Alliance for Retired Americans.

They are represented by national legal organization Democracy Forward.

The plaintiffs argue DOGE's actions violate the Privacy Act, Social Security Act, Internal Revenue Code and Administrative Procedure Act.

Defendants in the case include the Social Security Administration; the agency's acting commissioner Leland Dudek; SSA chief information officer Michael Russo and/or his successor; Elon Musk, senior advisor to the president, and DOGE acting administrator Amy Gleason.

The order blocks the agency and its agents and employees from granting access to systems containing personally identifiable information including Social Security numbers, medical records, mental health records, employer and employee payment records, employee earnings, addresses, bank records, tax information and family court records.

DOGE and its affiliates must also disgorge and delete all non-anonymized personally identifiable information in their possession or control since Jan. 20, according to the order. They are also prohibited from installing any software on Social Security Administration systems and must remove any software installed since Jan. 20, the order states. In addition, the defendants are blocked from accessing, altering or disclosing the agency's computer or software code.  

""The court's ruling sends a clear message: no one can bypass the law to raid government data systems for their own purposes,"" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, in a statement.

""We will continue working with our partners to ensure that DOGE's overreach is permanently stopped and that people's rights are protected,"" Perryman said.

The injunction does allow DOGE staffers to access data that's been redacted or stripped of anything personally identifiable, if they undergo training and background checks.

A temporary restraining order, which was issued by Hollander on March 20, is vacated and superseded with this order. The Trump administration had unsuccessfully appealed the temporary restraining order.

""We will appeal this decision and expect ultimate victory on the issue,"" White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston said in an email statement. ""The American people gave President Trump a clear mandate to uproot waste, fraud, and abuse across the federal government. The Trump Administration will continue to fight to fulfill the mandate.""

The Social Security Administration did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

In this article

The Federal Trade Commission on Monday sued Uber, accusing the ride-hailing and delivery company of deceptive billing and cancellation practices tied to its subscription service.

The agency claims Uber violated the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act by providing misleading information about its Uber One subscription service, failing to provide a simple way for users to cancel their membership, and charging them without their consent.

""Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,"" FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. ""The Trump-Vance FTC is fighting back on behalf of the American people.""

The complaint marks the first FTC action against a major tech company since President Donald Trump began his second term in January. The FTC has several ongoing lawsuits against tech's megacap companies, including Meta, Google and Amazon. Some cases were brought during President Joe Biden's presidency, but Trump's FTC was aggressive during his first term, most notably going after Meta.

Uber and CEO Dara Khosrowshahi each reportedly donated $1 million to President Trump's inaugural fund, joining a lengthy roster of tech companies and executives attempting to cozy up to the incoming administration.

Noah Edwardsen, an Uber spokesperson, said in an email that the company is ""disappointed"" by the FTC's complaint, but that it's confident the courts will rule in its favor.

""Uber One's sign-up and cancellation processes are clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law,"" Edwardsen said. ""Uber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can now be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less.""

Uber One, launched in 2021, costs $9.99 a month or $96 a year and offers perks like fee-free delivery and discounts on some ride bookings, delivery and pickup orders. The company had about 30 million Uber One subscribers as of December, according to its latest annual report. 

In its complaint, the FTC argues that Uber advertises its subscription as offering ""savings of $25 a month"" without calculating the monthly cost of its membership. It also accuses Uber of charging consumers before their billing date.

When users try to cancel their Uber One subscription, Uber makes it ""extremely difficult,"" while some users are told to contact customer service representatives to proceed with their cancellation, but are given no way to contact them, the FTC alleged. Some users claim that Uber charged them for another billing cycle after they canceled their Uber One membership, the agency said in its complaint.

Ferguson told CNBC last month that the agency will continue to closely scrutinize major tech companies.

""I've said since day one Big Tech is one of the main priorities of the Trump-Vance FTC,"" Ferguson said. ""It's one of the reasons the president appointed me to this position.""

Khosrowshahi said in January in an interview at the Wall Street Journal's Journal House in Davos that the company wants ""to engage with every government we are a part of,"" adding that a ""diversity of voices"" in government can be a positive, the Journal reported.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's purse was stolen Sunday night while she was dining at a restaurant in downtown Washington, D.C., two law enforcement sources confirmed to CNBC.

Noem's bag contained roughly $3,000 in cash, which she had withdrawn to treat her family to dinner and Easter gifts and activities, a DHS spokesperson said Monday.

The bag also contained Noem's passport, makeup, blank checks, her driver's license, keys and medication, according to CNN, which first reported the theft.

The U.S. Secret Service has reviewed security footage that shows an unidentified white male, who wore a medical mask, snatching the bag, CNN reported.

Noem, asked about the theft during the White House Easter Egg Roll later Monday morning, said that it is ""not resolved yet.""

She told NBC News that the Secret Service is aware of the incident, but that she has not yet spoken to the agency about it.

The Secret Service is still gathering information about the theft, a spokesperson for the agency told CNBC.

President Donald Trump on Monday ratcheted up his pressure campaign on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a ""major loser"" and warning that the U.S. economy could slow down unless interest rates are lowered immediately.

""'Preemptive Cuts' in Interest Rates are being called for by many,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump claimed that there is currently ""virtually No Inflation"" in the U.S., and that costs for energy and ""most other 'things'"" are on the decline.

""With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,"" Trump wrote.

Trump's latest salvo against Powell — whom he appointed during his first administration — came as the president and his team are studying whether they can legally fire the central bank leader before his term expires in May 2026.

Powell has flatly stated that the president cannot remove him under the law.

Any attempt by Trump to fire Powell would likely trigger a steep sell off in U.S. equity markets, Evercore ISI's vice chairman, Krishna Guha, told CNBC on Monday.

""If you start to raise questions about Federal Reserve independence, you are raising the bar for the Federal Reserve to cut. If you actually did try to remove the Federal Reserve chairman, I think you would see a severe reaction in markets with yields higher, dollars lower and equities selling off,"" Guha said on ""Squawk Box.""

""I can't believe that that's what the administration is trying to achieve,"" Guha said.

The stock market, already reeling from heightened uncertainty and other concerns stemming from the Trump administration's sweeping tariff plans, sank further Monday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 750 points, a nearly 2% drop, within the first hour of trading, while the Nasdaq fell 2.6%.

The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, slid to its lowest level since 2022. The churn in global markets has sent investors flocking to safe-haven assets such as gold, which hit a record high price on Monday, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield crept up.

Trump's latest attacks on Powell followed the central bank leader's suggestion last week that the president's trade war will constrain growth and could fuel inflation.

Tariffs are ""likely to move us further away from our goals ... probably for the balance of this year,"" Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.

Powell also stopped short of suggesting that interest rate cuts were on the horizon.

""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" he said.

— CNBC's Alex Harring contributed to this report.

Correction: Krishna Guha is vice chairman of Evercore ISI. An earlier version misstated his title.

Companies large and small are turning to special U.S. Customs-approved sites to avoid, at least temporarily, the payment of new tariffs implemented by President Trump.

These locations, called foreign trade zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses, are specially designated, secured storage or manufacturing sites approved by U.S. Customs where freight is not subject to U.S. duties or excise taxes. Duties are only paid by the importer when the goods are transferred out of the FTZ or bonded warehouse for U.S. market consumption. 

""A year ago, an FTZ was a nonstarter because of the investment a company would have to make,"" said Jackson Wood, director of industry strategy for Descartes Global Trade Intelligence, which provides FTZ technology system assistance. ""Now they are crunching the numbers to see if it makes financial sense, and for some it does,"" Wood said, including smaller companies that are starting to consider FTZs as tariff rates soar. 

There is a 90-day pause in place for most countries before new tariffs hit, though tariffs for Chinese goods are now as high as 145%.

FTZs enable U.S. importers and manufacturers to store imports of finished goods for an indefinite amount of time without paying trade duties. Freight imported under bond and placed in a bonded warehouse can be stored for up to five years starting the day it was imported into the country. Depending on the day the freight is moved out of an FTZ or bonded warehouse, importers might be able to pay either reduced customs duties, taxes, or fees, or none at all — a strategic approach to import management also known as an ""inverted tariff.""

The deferment of duties, taxes and fees normally applicable upon importation can significantly enhance a company's financial position by providing cost savings, operational flexibility, and improved cash flow.

Jeffrey J. Tafel, president of the National Association of Foreign Trade-Zones, says his organization started to see an increase in membership during the 2024 presidential election, and registrations have continued to pour in, with membership is at an all-time high.

""With tariff changes happening so quickly, there are companies that are looking for FTZ storage space in order to defer the duties until they are able to decide how they want to proceed with the merchandise, much of which was purchased before the tariffs were known,"" said Tafel. ""Any time tariffs are in the news, we see an increase in interest in all programs that help U.S. companies mitigate the impact.""

Tafel said there is also increased interest regarding FTZ grantees, which are authorized by the Foreign-Trade Zones Board to establish, operate, and maintain a foreign-trade zone, with inquiries up as much as two to four times what is typical.  

FTZs were created by Congress in the 1930s to incentivize domestic investment in U.S. The foreign-trade zones program employs more than 550,000 American workers across all 50 states and Puerto Rico, and in virtually every industry sector. 

Companies can choose to not ship goods at all, and recent data out of Asia shows a steep decline in manufacturing orders and freight vessel sailings. Bringing the goods in, and using duty-free zones, is the other option.

""Recent tariff changes have made FTZs more appealing, as other duty reduction or recovery options, like duty drawback, are not eligible for the new tariffs,"" said Chelsea Pavona Gardner, a Maersk spokeswoman for North America. ""As a result, companies that previously dismissed FTZs are now considering them as a viable strategy,"" she said.

""We're at the point where we have a combination of clients waiting the next 30 days to see what happens,"" said Janet Labuda, head of customs and trade issues at Maersk. ""We have others taking product and moving into bonded warehouses for 30 days or so to see if any of this blows over and then extract it out at the duties being charged that day,"" she added.

Setting up an FTZ can be costly, with charges for professional services to navigate the initial process and approval of the zone usage, as well as trained staff and dedicated IT systems to manage the zone once operational.

According to Gardner, using an FTZ depends more on the scale of a company's import activities rather than the industry itself, but the primary users of FTZs in the past have been consumer goods and retail, automotive, aerospace, and electronics.

In addition to warehouse storage, manufacturing plants, or portions of plants, can become an FTZ in cases where a company's components have a higher tariff than the finished good. Once the finished good is released from the FTZ, the company pays a lower tariff. There is also an option for companies to have Customs approve the scrap of any leftover material not used in the manufacturing process, which would not be subjected to duty. This exemption can also include exporting the product to another country.

Jordan Dewart, president of Redwood Logistics Mexico, said his company has been fielding many prospects and requests for FTZ services. While the Trump administration has said it is in talks with 75 countries for trade deals since announcing new tariffs, Dewart said the surge in FTZ interest is a sign that importers are worried about how long the trade war could last. ""It seems customers are looking for a solution in case the tariffs stick long term,"" he said.

Chipotle Mexican Grill will open its first location in Mexico early next year as the latest stage in its international expansion.

The company announced Monday that it has signed a development agreement with Alsea, which operates Latin American and European locations of Starbucks, Domino's Pizza and Burger King, among other chains.

After the initial restaurant opens in 2026, Chipotle plans to explore ""additional expansion markets in the region,"" which could mean broader Latin American development.

The deal to expand in Mexico comes as President Donald Trump wages a trade war with the country, straining the relationship between the two neighbors. Avocados from Mexico were originally subject to a 25% tariff until he paused new duties on goods compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. While Chipotle has diversified its avocado sourcing in recent years, it still imports about half of its avocados from Mexico.

In recent years, Chipotle has been trying to expand internationally, after decades focusing almost entirely on its U.S. business. The company operates 58 locations in Canada, 20 in the United Kingdom, six in France and two in Germany. Chipotle also currently has three restaurants in Kuwait and two in the United Arab Emirates through a deal with Alshaya Group.

Chipotle is betting that Mexico's familiarity with its ingredients and appreciation for fresh food will win over consumers, according to a statement from Nate Lawton, Chipotle's chief business development officer.

But U.S. interpretations of Mexican food don't always resonate in the market; Yum Brands' Taco Bell has twice attempted to expand into Mexico, but both efforts failed quickly.

Gold prices broke $3,400 on Monday, hitting a new record as President Donald Trump's threats against the Federal Reserve's independence and his tariffs shake investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

Gold futures jumped 2.91% to close at $3,425.30 per ounce, with investors buying the precious metal as the dollar hit a three-year low. Gold has jumped about 30% since the start of the year and about 8% since Trump unveiled his sweeping tariffs on April 2.

The president ramped up pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Monday, calling him a ""major loser"" and demanding that the central bank lower interest rates now.

Trump said last Thursday that Powell's ""termination cannot come fast enough,"" after the U.S. central bank chief warned that the president's tariffs will likely increase inflation in the near term. Trump is looking into whether he can fire Powell, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Friday.

Gold has been on a tear this year as confidence in the U.S. falls and central banks buy up the precious metal. Citi sees gold prices rallying to $3,500 over the next three months as investment demand outstrips supply from mining.

""We estimate that tariff-related US and global growth concerns are likely to continue to combine with strong central bank and other institutional demand,"" analysts led by Kenny Hu told clients in a recent note.

As tech's megacap companies enter first-quarter earnings season this week, get ready to hear one word on repeat: uncertainty.

President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again approach to tariffs has created market chaos this month — including five days of massive moves for the Nasdaq — as investors try to gauge the future impact on revenue and earnings for American companies that rely on imports.

Beyond the increase in costs are the follow-on effects, such as the likely drop-off in ad spending that comes with tighter budgets and the potential slowdown in consumer spending that could result from higher prices and rising unemployment.

Trump's tariffs face almost universal disapproval in the corporate world, which became clear as trillions of dollars in value evaporated in a matter of days, and some of the president's most vocal supporters, including Elon Musk, expressed opposition.

Beyond being bad for business, the tariff picture changes by the day, making it almost impossible for companies to plan for the future when considering where to manufacture, whether to continue hiring and how aggressively to market products.

On April 9, following four days of market turmoil, Trump dropped tariffs to 10% for most trade partners (while increasing the levy on China to 145%) for 90 days to allow negotiations with those countries. Since then, the Trump administration has signaled that phones, computers and chips would be exempted from the new tariffs, but the president then added to the confusion by casting doubt on the duration of the exemptions, which were viewed as a boon most notably for Apple.

When Tesla kicks off tech earnings on Tuesday, followed by Alphabet on Thursday, executive teams will likely face forward-looking questions that may be difficult to answer.

Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple are all slated to report results next week. Chipmaker Nvidia reports in late May.

As of Thursday's close, the Nasdaq was down 16% for the year and 6% in April. The first quarter was the worst for the index in almost three years.

Here are some of the key issues facing each tech megacap, in order of when they report:

Tesla's Tuesday report lands against a murky backdrop for the electric vehicle maker.

The stock is down 40% for the year so far after closing out its worst quarter since 2022 in March. The big story has been Musk's many distractions outside of Tesla, most notably his work slashing the federal government as part of the Trump administration.

Tariffs are also a problem, as the company relies on suppliers in Mexico and China for items like automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells, among other parts essential for the production of its cars. Tesla has sought an exemption from the U.S. trade representative for equipment imported from China that it uses in its factories.

On the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja cautioned shareholders that the Trump administration's tariffs would have an ""impact on our business and profitability.""

For the first quarter, analysts are projecting revenue growth of less than 1% from a year earlier, followed by a slight year-over-year slippage in the second quarter. Investors will want to see if Musk can provide any clarity on how costly tariffs could be going forward. Musk has made his thoughts on the matter fairly clear, calling Trump's top trade advisor and tariff proponent Peter Navarro a ""moron"" and ""dumber than a sack of bricks.""

Tesla's business was already under pressure before tariffs and uncertainty roiled markets. In early April, the company reported 337,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, a 13% decline from the previous year. To win over customers in the face of a Musk-induced backlash, and to get customers to buy inventory cars when a new Model Y is on the way, the company had to offer an array of incentives and discounts in the first quarter.

Piper Sandler analysts last week revised their Tesla price target lower, saying after the first-quarter whiff on deliveries that ""gross margin is probably trending near multi-year lows.""

Google parent Alphabet faces an online ad market that's on edge due to concerns about how Trump's tariffs will affect the economy and business spending.

A note last week from Piper Sandler pointed to fears of an 18% impact to growth forecasts for the 2025 global ad market. Chinese discount e-commerce apps Temu and Shein, which have been big advertisers in the U.S. in recent years, are of notable concern, and Temu has already pulled way back on spending.

Retail represents at least 21% of Google ad revenue, according to estimates by Oppenheimer & Co., which said that Meta has even more exposure to ad pullbacks.

Investors are equally concerned about the cloud business, as Alphabet is a massive spender on imported data center infrastructure, and is going even bigger to keep up with the artificial intelligence boom. The company has said it plans to spend $75 billion this year, mostly going toward servers and data centers to power AI and its cloud business.

It's unclear whether Google will adjust that figure, but such a move may be necessary. Mizuho analysts wrote on April 8 that roughly 25% of Google channel partner customers have reduced spending on the company's cloud, and ""we expect that mix to increase to 50% from elevated customer hesitation"" after the tariff announcement.

Though Alphabet doesn't make a large chunk of its revenue from consumer hardware, it does produce its Pixel and Fitbit products abroad and runs its services on the most popular phone carriers. Pixel products are manufactured in India, after the company began diversifying its supply chain away from China.

Meta has a small hardware business, focused largely on selling virtual reality devices. That's not the biggest concern for investors.

Rather, like with Google, it's the potential impact of the tariffs on the economy and the willingness of businesses to spend on digital ads. In Meta's case, that means ads on Facebook and Instagram.

Meta acknowledged the negative impact of a U.S.-China trade dispute in its latest annual report, noting that an action ""that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue"" would ""adversely affect"" financial results. Meta's China revenue was $18.35 billion in 2024, representing a little over 11% of total sales.

Analysts say Temu and Shien represent the bulk of Meta's China sales. Bank of America analysts wrote in a recent note that Meta could face ""3% revenue exposure to Temu and Shein in the US"" due to the tariffs. While the ""tariff situation still remains fluid,"" the firm said companies will reduce online ad spending due to a weakening economy. The analysts reduced their estimate for 2025 revenue by 4.4% to $179.8 billion.

Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a recent note that the China trade war will hurt Meta more than Google, because it's ""more exposed to discretionary spending"" and China. The firm warned that companies are more likely to cut ad spending on social media than search, based on a March survey of advertisers from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.

Where costs could be a concern for Meta is in the data center, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year that the company would spend $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, calling it a ""defining year for AI."" The bulk of that infrastructure has to be imported from Asia, and analysts will have plenty of questions for the company about how much more it will have to spend to continue its AI advancements.

Microsoft makes PCs and video game consoles, but it derives most of its revenue from selling software. The company buys lots of hardware to operate cloud services for its clients, transactions that are subject to significantly higher costs due to tariffs.

In early January, Microsoft announced it was aiming to spend more than $80 billion this fiscal year on data centers capable of handling artificial intelligence workloads.

Where investors may be most concerned for Microsoft is in the company's expansive customer base and whether Trump's trade policies will lead clients to cut spending on products.

""There's not a direct tariff impact, and so what we talk about is indirect,"" said Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Piper Sandler. He recommends buying Microsoft shares.

Recent surveys indicate that software sales cycles are lengthening and interest in buying new software is waning, Bracelin said. Other analysts have said Microsoft, along with Salesforce, are among the software vendors that are best able to handle higher tariffs.

""We see MSFT and CRM as two of the names best positioned to weather this macro storm as they are already back at/near 2022 trough levels and can adjust spending/capex levels for this 'new reality' if needed to preserve"" earnings and cash, Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note earlier this month.

Amazon's position as an e-commerce juggernaut gives it hefty exposure to potential tariff headwinds, and not just because of consumer spending.

More than 60% of Amazon's sales are from items sold by third-party merchants, and many of those sellers source their products from China. The remaining 40% comes from vendors Amazon purchases from directly.

Within days of Trump's new tariffs, Amazon canceled some of those merchandise orders from vendors in China, while Amazon sellers have said they're considering raising the price of their products.

Investors will be listening for any commentary around the impact of tariffs on its online stores business, especially as Amazon's summer Prime Day discount event nears. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC last week that the company will work to keep prices low on its website, but that sellers may need to ""pass the cost"" of tariffs on to consumers.

""Amazon is probably the best-positioned company in retail and e-commerce to take advantage of the chaotic situation from tariffs and shifting global supply chains,"" Barclays analysts, who have a buy rating on Amazon, wrote in a recent report. ""The pandemic was a precursor of this, during which Amazon was able to gain share and move quicker than peers despite its massive size.""

The company's advertising unit could be ""pressured more if trade wars get worse,"" analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald, who also recommend buying the stock, wrote in a note on April 15. Most of Amazon's ad revenue comes from sponsored product ads that appear in search results on its website. Businesses could pull back on their ad spend as they look to conserve costs or reduce traffic to products sourced from China.

And like the other hyperscalers, Amazon has all of the potential added costs associated with tariffs on advanced chips and other data center equipment, depending on what products end up getting exempted. Amazon Web Services is the market leader in cloud infrastructure, ahead of Microsoft and Google.

Apple has outsized exposure to Trump's tariffs, as the company generates about three-quarters of its revenue from selling devices that are mostly manufactured in Asia. While Apple got an apparent reprieve when the Trump administration suspended tariffs on computers from China earlier this month, the company still faces significant uncertainty with the possibility of another Trump shift.

Apple has tried to hedge its China risk in recent years, bolstering manufacturing capacity in countries including Vietnam and India. Officials in India said that Apple loaded planes full of iPhones made in the country and sent them to the U.S. in response to tariffs.

Wall Street has been dumping shares of the iPhone maker, sending the stock down 8% in March and another 11% so far this month, a recognition of how damaging long-term tariffs would likely be on Apple's business.

CEO Tim Cook, along with many of his tech counterparts, has tried cozying up to Trump, donating to his inauguration in January and attending the event in Washington, D.C. But investors have yet to hear how Cook and the rest of the management team plan to deal with the increased costs, how the company is managing inventory and how it will all add up to affect margins.

Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, are key to the AI infrastructure buildouts across the tech industry. While semiconductors have a tariff exemption, many of the AI servers that have driven the recent boom have been shipped to the U.S. as mostly finished computers, putting them at risk of tariffs.

Since an AI server can cost upward of $50,000, even small tariffs could have a big impact on costs. And the almost tenfold increase in Nvidia's stock price over the past two calendar years has baked into it an assumption that sales and profit margins will keep inflating.

Investors will want to hear from CEO Jensen Huang about his relationship with Trump, given the potential importance of that dynamic.

Nvidia said last week that it would produce its ""AI supercomputers"" in Texas, days after Huang met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Nvidia also said it would buy and package chip production services from companies in Arizona. The company said it would ""produce"" a half-trillion dollars in AI infrastructure over the next four years.

The White House praised the move, and said in a press release that Nvidia was leading an ""American-made chips boom."" Nvidia's plans for U.S. production will rely on the company getting exceptions for many of the parts it will need to build the computers.

Nvidia's concern with the government isn't just about tariffs. The company said last week that it will take a quarterly charge of about $5.5 billion tied to exporting H20 graphics processing units to China and other destinations.

During President Joe Biden's administration, the U.S. restricted artificial intelligence chip exports and then updated the rules to prevent the sale of more advanced AI processors. The H20 is an AI chip for China that was designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. It generated an estimated $12 billion to $15 billion in revenue in 2024.

Tributes and condolences poured in from around the world following news of the death of Pope Francis, who died on Monday at the age of 88.

Francis, who was elected the Catholic Church's 266th pope after the retirement of Benedict XVI in 2013, was the first Jesuit pope and the first pope from the Southern Hemisphere, born in Argentina to Italian-Argentinian parents.

He made waves during his papacy as a reformer who often rattled the church's most conservative quarters, but found popularity among progressives who embraced his championing of social justice and support for marginalized groups.

Francis' last official meeting was with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Easter Sunday, just one day before his passing.

In a post on X, Vance wrote: ""I just leaned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him. I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I'll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful. May God rest his soul."" 

The White House's official X account posted two photos of the pope, one with President Donald Trump and his wife Melania, and the other with Vance, alongside a caption that read: ""Rest in Peace, Pope Francis.""

Trump on his Truth Social account, meanwhile, posted: ""Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!""

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni posted an emotional message on her official Facebook account that read: ""Pope Francis has returned to the Father's house. A news that pains us deeply, because a great man and a great pastor leaves us. I have had the privilege to enjoy his friendship, his advice and his teachings, which never diminished even in times of trial and suffering.""

French President Emmanuel Macron, in a post on X, wrote: ""From Buenos Aires to Rome, Pope Francis wanted the Church to bring joy and hope to the poorest. May it unite people with each other and with nature. May this hope continually revive beyond him. My wife and I send our thoughts to all Catholics and to the grieving world.""

Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof on X described Francis as ""in every way a man of the people.""

The U.K.'s King Charles issued a statement from the royal family, saying that he and the Queen ""will be mourning the devastating loss of this faithful follower of Jesus Christ"" and that the late Pope would be ""remembered for his compassion, his concern for the unity of the Church and for his tireless commitment to the common causes of all people of faith.""

Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor of Germany, posted a note of condolences describing Pope Francis' ""tireless commitment to the weakest in society, to justice and reconciliation.""

Polish President Andrzej Duda praised the Vatican leader as being ""guided by humility and modesty.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in a statement on X, hailed Francis' ""humility and love so pure for the less fortunate,"" adding that her ""thoughts are with all who feel this profound loss.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his condolences in a post on X, saying that the Pope ""knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity. He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support.""

Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed his ""deepest condolences to the Christian world and especially the Christian communities in Israel - the Holy Land - on the loss of their great spiritual father, His Holiness Pope Francis."" The Pope had long decried violence in the Middle East and called vocally for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

A statement posted to the Egyptian presidential spokesperson's Facebook page said that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi ""mourns with deep sorrow the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis, Pope of the Vatican, who left our world, leaving behind a great humanitarian legacy that will remain etched in the conscience of humanity."" The post described Francis as a ""champion of the Palestinian cause"" who called for an end to conflicts and ""achievement of a just and lasting peace.""

Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, also offered his condolences to Christians all over the world on the passing of Pope Francis, according to an NBC translation of a Telegram post from Iran's semiofficial news agency Fars News.

Prime Minister of India Narenda Modi said he was ""deeply pained by the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis,"" and that ""his affection for the people of India will always be cherished."" 

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva issued a lengthy and heartfelt post on X, writing, ""Today, humanity loses a voice of respect and acceptance of others,"" and highlighting Francis' efforts to bring the issues of climate change and economic inequality to the Vatican. He declared seven days of mourning in Brazil.

Caudia Sheinbaum, president of Mexico, called Francis ""a humanist who stood for the poor, peace, and equality"" and who ""left behind a great legacy of true love for one's neighbor.""

""For Catholics and non-Catholics alike,"" Sheinbaum added in her post on X, ""this is a great loss."" Brazil and Mexico are home to the world's largest Catholic populations by country.

New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon wrote on X that he was ""saddened"" to hear of the Pope's passing, and described his legacy as that of ""an unwavering commitment to the vulnerable, to social justice and to interfaith dialogue."" 

Correction: Emmanuel Macron is president of France. An earlier version misspelled his name.

Bitcoin and crypto prices are treading water after U.S. president Donald Trump's trade war sparked market chaos that's threatening to spiral into a full-blown “U.S. dollar confidence crisis.”

The bitcoin price has plummeted from its January peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, dropping along with the stock market, as crypto hurtles toward a $19 trillion “tipping point.”

Now, as billionaire Ray Dalio warns the U.S. is teetering on the verge of a financial crisis and recession that could be worse than 2008, the White House has confirmed Trump is exploring whether he can fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell—something that could trigger an “apocalyptic scenario"" for markets.

“The president and his team will continue to study that matter,” Kevin Hassett, Trump's economic adviser, told reporters at the White House when asked if firing the Fed chair was an option and if Trump has the authority to remove Powell.

This week, Trump posted to his Truth Social account that “Powell's termination cannot come fast enough” after Powell reiterated his intention to keep interest rates on hold due to uncertainty over Trump's tariff trade war.

Last month, influential Democratic Party senator Elizabeth Warren said Trump could try to fire Powell, ominously warning, “nobody is safe.”

“It would be a huge, huge shock,” Bilal Hafeez, chief executive of investment research company Macro Hive, told The Telegraph newspaper. “Overall, it would almost be like an apocalyptic scenario for the market.”

04/21 update: The bitcoin price has shot higher after U.S. president Donald Trump doubled down on his calls for immediate, “preemptive” interest rate cuts, suggesting Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell surprised markets with September's rate cut in order to help the Democratic Party in November's election. 

“'Preemptive cuts' in interest rates are being called for by many,” Trump posted to his Truth Social account.

The bitcoin price has climbed to over $88,000 per bitcoin, up from April lows of under $75,000. 

“With energy costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other ‘things' trending down, there is virtually no inflation,"" Trump wrote. 

""With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a slowing of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, now,” Trump wrote, adding Europe has “already 'lowered' seven times.”

Stock markets have opened lower on Wall Street, led by Nasdaq and tech company declines, while the U.S. dollar has hit fresh multi-year lows against other major currencies. 

The gold price has surged to over $3,400 a troy ounce, a new record, as traders cash out of equity and into the traditional safe haven.

“Bitcoin and gold are surging in tandem this morning as the market digests yet another shock move from the U.S. president Donald Trump—this time, an apparent outright threat to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell,” Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. 

“This has caused the U.S. dollar to plummet to a three-year low, but both gold and bitcoin are emerging as safe havens.”

Trump's barrage of global trade tariffs have blown up the established order of international trade, fuelling market uncertainty and driving investors out of risk assets such as bitcoin and crypto.

The bitcoin price has diverged from gold, which has rocketed to all-time highs as traders flee to the traditional safe haven, though some have predicted bitcoin will ultimately benefit and begin trading as “digital gold.”

“Powell continues to sit on the fence with the ‘we'll wait and see' approach because he still believes tariffs will lead to higher inflation,” bitcoin and crypto investor Lark Davis wrote in his Wealth Mastery newsletter.

""Only time will tell but firing Powell risks bringing even more uncertainty to markets. However, intervention of some kind will be needed at some point, whether it's rate cuts, quantitative easing or Trump softens. Or a mix. It's a matter of when, not if.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

STOCK OF THE DAY: Why This Big Retailer Is Dodging Tariff Trouble



The U.S. dollar index tumbled to a three-year low early Monday, while the S&P 500 fell sharply. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed, as government bond investors demand a higher return. Meanwhile, gold and bitcoin are shining as investors shun U.S. financial assets.

The financial market turbulence unleashed by President Donald Trump's trade policies, which already forced him to suspend reciprocal tariffs north of 10% for 90 days, may prove to be the Achilles' heel that compels a more fundamental retreat. It also is highlighting the internal contradictions of Trump's policies, including his desire to protect the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency, while erecting a wall of tariffs that keeps both global trade and capital at bay.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies, fell 0.9% to 98.49 after hitting its the lowest point since February 2022. The 10-year Treasury yield rose four basis points to 4.37%.

By itself, a lower dollar isn't necessarily a bad thing. Many economists think the dollar is overvalued. The worry is that investors are fleeing the safest U.S. assets at a time of rising recession risk. That's when investors would normally gravitate to the dollar and Treasuries, which move in the opposite direction of Treasury yields.

Practically speaking, the economic drag from a falling S&P 500 will be compounded because higher longer-term Treasury yields raise borrowing costs for mortgages and auto loans. But the worry is that a shift in global capital flows could turn into a financial market rout.

Financial flows into U.S. markets have been the other side of the coin of the annual U.S. goods deficit that reached $1.2 trillion in 2024. The U.S. net international investment position sank to -$26.2 trillion at the end of 2024. That's how much more foreigners hold in U.S. financial assets than overseas positions held by Americans.

Trump has bemoaned that $26 trillion figure as a curse. He expects his ""medicine"" of Trump tariffs to create a U.S. manufacturing boom and shrink the trade gap. But his plan lacks a short-term bridge to get from here to there without risking a financial market drubbing that compounds the hit from tariffs. That could trigger a recession that hurts demand, delays investment and makes federal finances even less sustainable.

Many of the factors that contributed to U.S. financial market outperformance, attracting foreign funds, are suddenly under threat. In addition to wide trade deficits, that includes wide fiscal deficits that added fuel to the economy. Pro-growth immigration policies, an antidote to an aging workforce, and an independent Federal Reserve have also been seen as underpinning America's economic strengths.

The gold futures price surged 3.25% to a record $3,437 per ounce on Monday. Gold got a further lift after Trump renewed his attack of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, demanding ""preemptive cuts"" in interest rates to stave off economic weakness. Powell has thus far taken a cautious line on further rate cuts amid concern about the inflationary impact of Trump tariffs.

Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM) rose 1.7% Monday, hitting a fresh high. AEM stock is on IBD Leaderboard.

The bitcoin price, which used to trade a lot like the Nasdaq, rising in a risk-on environment, has recently been acting like a hedge against a weak dollar. Bitcoin is up 3.2% over the past 24 hours to $87,357, according to CoinDesk.

Strategy (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, popped 1.1%, off morning highs.

The S&P 500 is slumping 2.4%, adding to losses after Trump attacked Powell as a ""major loser."" Through Thursday, the S&P 500 was 14% below its Feb. 19 all-time closing high, but up 6% from its 2025 closing low on April 8, before Trump's delay of reciprocal tariffs.

The S&P 500 finished the holiday-shortened weak 8.65% below its Election Day close.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Strategy's Bitcoin Buying Spree Has Minimal Impact on Prices, TD Cowen Says","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategy-bitcoin-buying-spree-minimal-155316018.html","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:53:16 GMT","

Oops, something went wrong

Despite its growing footprint as a major corporate holder of bitcoin (BTC), Strategy's large-scale purchases of the cryptocurrency appear to have little, if any, influence on its price, according to a research paper by TD Cowen.

The findings published Monday challenge a popular theory among skeptics — that Strategy's aggressive buying spree is helping prop up bitcoin's value, and that without its continued demand, prices would falter. But based on the data, that argument doesn't hold much weight, the analysts said.

Strategy recently issued another 1.8 million shares under its at-the-market (ATM) offering, raising an additional $842 million in net proceeds. The funds were used to purchase 6,556 bitcoins, boosting the firm's bitcoin yield this quarter by 1% to 12.1%. However, when measured against the broader bitcoin market, these purchases are just a drop in the bucket.

According to the TD Cowen analysis, Strategy's bitcoin buys have typically accounted for just 3.3% of weekly trading volume on average. Over the past 27 weeks, the company's total activity amounted to 8.4% of volume — but this figure was skewed by a handful of weeks where its buying briefly surged past 20%. In eight of those weeks, Strategy didn't buy any bitcoin at all.

“Our conclusion is that in most periods, it doesn't appear plausible that Strategy's purchases could have had a sustained, material impact on the price of bitcoin,” TD Cowen analysts wrote.

The analysis further tested the relationship between Strategy's bitcoin purchases and market prices — and found it to be statistically weak. The correlation coefficient between Strategy's weekly bitcoin buy volume and BTC price at week's end came in at just 25%. When comparing purchases to weekly price changes, the correlation rose only slightly to 28%.

Given a correlation coefficient close to 0 suggests no or weak correlation, these results indicate little to no link between Strategy's actions and short-term market movements — let alone any kind of sustained price influence, the paper said.

Another common critique is that Strategy frequently purchases more bitcoin than is mined in a given period, implying it's creating upward price pressure. While technically true, the analysis shows this argument misunderstands how the bitcoin market works.

Over the past six months, secondary bitcoin trading has outpaced mining volume by nearly 20 times. Even removing Strategy's purchases from the equation, secondary market activity still exceeds new supply by 17 times. In that environment, miners and buyers alike are price takers — not setters.

“As we have seen, its purchases represent a very small percentage of total bitcoin trading volume; thus the idea that it is somehow having a profound or even notable impact on bitcoin price action seems incongruous, to us,” TD Cowen said.

While Strategy's influence on the bitcoin market may be overstated, the value it's generated for shareholders is harder to ignore.

Last week's purchases created an estimated incremental gain of 5,281 bitcoins, bringing quarter-to-date gains to nearly $600 million. Since the beginning of 2023, Strategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by 306%, while only expanding its fully diluted share count by 94% — a strong showing for a company using bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset.

With $1.53 billion in remaining ATM capacity and board approval for a larger share authorization, Strategy is well-positioned to continue this strategy — without disrupting the very market it's betting on.

“We expect Strategy will continue to drive positive BTC Yield for the foreseeable future. While BTC Yield will likely fall to the extent bitcoin continues to rise in price, the dollar value of incremental gains from Strategy's Treasury Operations could remain highly advantageous to shareholders,” the analysts wrote.

Zora, a social media platform that automatically turns every post into a token on Coinbase's Base chain, is launching its own token on Wednesday. This comes amid a “content coin” campaign from the creator of Ethereum layer-2 network Base, Jesse Pollak, with many criticizing the founder for his timing.

This all began on Wednesday last week, when Base's official X account created a token on Zora called Base is for everyone which soared to a $16.9 million market cap then crashed 92% to $1.3 million within two hours. It would later hit a new all-time high then plummet again. This crash came as Base continued to create tokens on Zora as Pollak started to explain his “content coin” thesis.

Put simply, Pollak says that content coins are a way to revolutionize the social media economy by paying creators fees—a solution he says that fixes the problem of platforms not properly rewarding creators. His thoughts have now become Base's official stance on the matter.

But detractors, like Pump.fun co-founder Alon Cohen, think that while Pollak's heart is in the right place, the campaign may have come too soon to be fully accepted by the market.

Either way, according to Dune data, Zora activity exploded with daily traders spiking 601% from 40,638 the day before the campaign started to its all-time high on Sunday of 284,931. Throughout this period, Pollak continued to wave the flag for the content coin movement as he posted on social media, went on a press tour, and continued buying tokens.

That's why on Sunday when Zora announced its token would launch on April 23, with its second snapshot capturing much of this newfound hype, many onlookers thought the timing was suspicious.

— zora (@zora) April 20, 2025



“I'm sure it is a coincidence that Zora is [launching its token] less than a week after the ‘coin everything' hard shill campaign,” pseudonymous crypto trader IcoBeast posted on X, formerly Twitter. “The way this plays out is that people who coined things the last few days will get larger than expected allocations to the token and then get a nice pump into day one [Coinbase] listing.”

But Pollak refutes this, claiming that it was a coincidence after all.

“The truth is the effort to coin things from Base went 0 to 1 in [less than a] day,” he wrote on X. “The Zora team didn't know we were coining anything until after it happened. [Zora creator Jacob Horne] had nudged me before paternity leave to do it and I told him I'd figure it out but it took a while.”

the @zora team didn't know we were coining anything until adter it happened@js_horne had nudged me before paternity leave to do it and I told him I'd figure it out but it took a while

glad I did it!

— jesse.base.eth (@jessepollak) April 21, 2025



Later, he explained that while the campaign's execution happened quickly, the team had thought “long and hard” about whether this type of coin was the future.

Speculation intensified when it was found out via CryptoRank that Coinbase took part in at least two funding rounds totalling $52 million, although exactly how much Coinbase invested remains unclear. The Zora tokenomics also reveal that 45% of the supply will go to the team and strategic contributors, many believing this includes Coinbase.

“Base is for everyone was actually just a marketing stunt to pump a token they invested into lmao,” crypto gaming content creator Jesus Martinez posted on X.

Not everyone was so skeptical about the Base and Zora relationship and have just been enjoying the app.

“All you had to do to make it was coining everything for a week only but instead you decided to clown everything from Jesse Pollak,” pseudonymous crypto trader Cbb0fe wrote on X, and was reposted by Pollak. “Get ready to cope hard.”

Neither Pollak, Base, nor Coinbase responded to Decrypt's request for comment.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared a new proposal over the weekend that would radically overhaul the system that powers its smart contracts.



Buterin's suggestion, which he posted on Ethereum's primary developer forum, involves replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the software engine that powers programs on the network, with RISC-V, a popular open-source framework that offers built-in encryption and other benefits. .



The EVM is a key piece of Ethereum's underlying design and has been seen as one of the main elements that helped the network succeed in a crowded field of other blockchains. Many non-Ethereum networks have used the EVM to build their own chains, as has a growing ecosystem of layer-2 networks built atop Ethereum, including Coinbase's Base chain.



The EVM has long played an essential role in Ethereum's development. Other chains that use it can seamlessly connect with apps on Ethereum, and developers on EVM-based networks can transition more smoothly to building applications directly within the Ethereum ecosystem.



Buterin argued that transitioning Ethereum to a RISC-V architecture will “greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer's simplicity.” (The execution layer is the part of the network that reads smart contracts.)



The RISC-V architecture, which has seen limited adoption in other blockchain ecosystems, like Polkadot, could offer ""efficiency gains over 100x"" for certain kinds of applications, according to Buterin. These improvements could reduce the network's costs — long seen as a major barrier to adoption.



Among the primary benefits of RISC-V is its native support for certain kinds of encryption. Transitioning to the new architecture could, in Buterin's view, be a simpler alternative to the community's current plan, which involves rebuilding the EVM around zero-knowledge cryptography.



Buterin's proposal is something developers would tackle over the long term, comparable to projects like the Beam Chain, which is looking to revamp Ethereum's consensus layer.



The RISC-V comes at a time of broader soul-searching for the Ethereum community. Recently, transaction volumes have declined, and Ethereum's token has lagged behind the broader market. 



Earlier this year, the Ethereum Foundation, the primary non-profit that supports the development of the broader Ethereum ecosystem, underwent a leadership transition in an attempt to remedy the impression among community members that the ecosystem lacked a clear roadmap and was losing its lead compared to competitors.

Crypto analyst Incognito has predicted that the Ethereum price could soon rally to as high as $2,700. This bullish prediction comes despite ETH's underperformance so far, with the altcoin's market share already dropping to new lows.

Ethereum Price Could Rally To $2,700 As Wyckoff Accumulation Nears

In a TradingView post, Incognito predicted that the Ethereum price could witness a big move to $2,700 with the Wyckoff accumulation almost over. He remarked that if support holds, the ETH should see a breakout of the falling wedge. The analyst's accompanying chart showed that $2,499 is the target for the falling wedge, while $2,700 is the second target that Ethereum could reach on this breakout. 

However, Incognito warned that this could be a huge trap to shake out sellers, so he advised market participants to be looking to take profits. In the meantime, the Ethereum price could indeed break out to the upside, especially with the Bitcoin price attempting to reclaim the $90,000 level. 

The Ethereum price is likely to reach new local highs if Bitcoin can sustain this bullish momentum, given their positive correlation. In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez remarked that this week would be big for ETH as the TD Sequential just flashed a buy signal, hinting at a potential shift in momentum. 

Martinez also raised the possibility of the Ethereum price recording a new bull rally. For that to happen, he mentioned that ETH needs to break the supply wall at $2,330. The leading altcoin could face significant selling pressure at that range, as 12.62 million addresses bought 68.63 million ETH around that range. 

ETH May Have Already Bottomed

In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that the Ethereum price has already bottomed or may be bottoming out. He revealed that the leading altcoin is progressing within a giant ascending channel on the macro chart. His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rally to as high as $4,200 following this bullish reversal. 

Crypto analyst Hardy also echoed a similar sentiment, suggesting that the Ethereum price has already reached its bottom. He noted that ETH's weekly candle close was bullish and a good indicator of a potential reversal at the key support level around its current price. His accompanying chart showed that Ethereum could rally to as high as $4,300 on this bullish reversal. 

Ethereum price reclaiming the $4,000 level could pave the way for a rally to a new all-time high (ATH). Crypto analyst Crypto Patel predicted that ETH could reach between $6,000 and $8,000 by the end of the year. 

At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $1,639, up almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin's (BTC) price broke above its key resistance level after facing multiple rejections around it the previous week. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices are approaching their key resistance levels; a breakout could signal a rally ahead.

Bitcoin price has faced multiple rejections around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 since April 13. At Monday's start of this week, BTC finally broke above the $87,000 resistance level.

If BTC continues its upward momentum, it could extend the rally to the key psychological level of $90,000. A successful close above this level could extend an additional rally to test its March 2 high of $95,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 57, indicating bullish momentum, as it is positioned above its neutral level of 50.

BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC declines, it could find support around its key level of $85,000.

Ethereum price was rejected around the $1,700 level at the start of the previous week but recovered slightly during the second half. At the time of writing on Monday, it trades at around $1,640, approaching the $1,700 resistance level.

If ETH continues its recovery and closes above $1,700, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $1,861.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 44 and points upward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bearish momentum. The RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the bullish momentum to be sustained.

ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if ETH continues its correction, it could extend the losses to retest its daily support level at $1,449.

XRP faced rejection around the daily level of $2.23 on April 13 and declined 3.75% last week. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers the $2.11 level.

If XRP breaks and closes above $2.23, it could extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50 before $3.00.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 49, around its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bearish momentum. The RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the bullish momentum to be sustained.

XRP/USDT daily chart

However, if XRP continues its decline and closes below its 200-day EMA, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.77.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The cryptocurrency market sparkles with altcoins like Sui, Stacks and Fartcoin extending gains on Monday. Sui breaks above a critical descending trendline, but the 100-day EMA crossing below the 200-day EMA signals potential bearish hurdles.

Bitcoin price breaks and trades above its key resistance level of $85,000 at the time of writing on Monday after facing multiple rejections the previous week. Institutional demand shows mild recovery, as it recorded nearly $16 million inflow into Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Funds last week. 

PancakeSwap breaks out, reclaiming $2.00 in support as investors return. The implementation of the tokenomics 3.0 software upgrade will allow access to staked CAKE and cake. PancakeSwap is shifting its focus from a 5% trading fees revenue sharing model to the CAKE token burn mechanism.

Ondo (ONDO) and SUI (SUI) prices gain nearly 5% at the time of writing on Monday, after a slight decline in the previous week. Both altcoins are approaching their key resistance levels; a breakout would indicate a bullish rally ahead. 

Bitcoin price consolidates above $84,000 on Friday, a short-term support that has gained significance this week. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued to weather storms caused by US President Donald Trump's incessant trade war with China after pausing reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on April 9 for other countries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Massive Altcoin Rallies Imminent Amid Surging Global Liquidity, According to Analyst TechDev","https://dailyhodl.com/2025/04/20/massive-altcoin-rallies-imminent-amid-surging-global-liquidity-according-to-analyst-techdev/","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:01:15 GMT","

A closely followed crypto strategist and trader believes that the time for altcoins to shine is close at hand.

Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 520,200 followers on the social media platform X that two macroeconomic factors are flashing bullish for altcoins based on historical precedent.

The trader shares a chart suggesting that altcoins tend to explode whenever global liquidity surges and the business cycle bottoms out.

Global liquidity refers to the amount of money sloshing in the world's financial system, while the business cycle tracks the rise and fall of economic activity over time.

Says TechDev,

“Altcoins don't run until liquidity breaks out. It's time.”

Based on the trader's chart, he appears to suggest that altcoins have sparked steep rallies in 2016 and 2020 following a business cycle bottom and a global liquidity breakout.

Turning to Bitcoin (BTC), the trader predicts that the crypto king will also rally due to the bullish alignment of the two macro factors.

“Are you ready?”

Zooming in on BTC, the trader predicts that Bitcoin will hit a massive price target this cycle after breaking out from a cup-and-handle pattern, which is typically viewed as a bullish continuation structure, indicating that buyers are stepping in without waiting for the asset to drop to its price lows.

“After all the rigorous analysis, will be amusing if it ends up this simple…”

Looking at the trader's chart, he seems to predict that BTC can surge to as high as $500,000 by 2026.

At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $85,165.

Crypto ETF issuers are jumping on every opportunity, hoping to take advantage of a more crypto-friendly SEC. 

This year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will have its hands full with ETF applications. On Monday, April 21, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that 72 crypto exchange-traded funds are currently waiting for approval. 

There are now 72 crypto-related ETFs sitting with the SEC awaiting approval to list or list options. Everything from XRP, Litecoin and Solana to Penguins, Doge and 2x Melania and everything in between. Gonna be a wild year. Great roundup from @JSeyff pic.twitter.com/IHTqqxeH35

The list includes altcoins, NFT tokens, memecoins, as well as a leveraged fund that bets on the Melania Trump token. The Melania 2x fund is one of ten leveraged memecoin and altcoin funds by Turtle Capital, registered in the Cayman Islands. Due to the number of these filings, Balchunas predicted a “wild year” for crypto. 

“There are now 72 crypto-related ETFs sitting with the SEC awaiting approval to list or list options. Everything from XRP, Litecoin and Solana to Penguins, Doge and 2x Melania and everything in between. Gonna be a wild year.” 

While the list of ETF filings is diverse to say the least, there are clear leaders in the space. Notably, altcoins like XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) are in the lead when it comes to the number of individual filings. Specifically, by April 15, there were 10 individual filings for XRP and five for Solana. As some of the biggest altcoins on the market, they have attracted institutional attention.

At the same time, Litecoin and Dogecoin (DOGE) were tied in third place, with three prospective issuers. Both of these tokens benefit from their decentralization, while Doge also gained mainstream attention thanks to its association with Elon Musk.

ETFs are becoming a key narrative for crypto adoption as they offer an easier way for both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to digital assets. Instead of holding the assets directly, the fund holds underlying assets, while also having to adhere to stringent regulatory requirements over its custody.

Bitcoin once again surpasses $87,000, pulling altcoins BNB, SOL, and XRP in its wake. This bullish move reignites debates about its status as a safe haven asset amidst global economic instability.

The crypto market is experiencing an impressive rebound at the start of the week. The bitcoin price crossed the $87,000 mark during Asian trading, erasing all losses incurred since last Thursday.

This rise is accompanied by notable progress from other major cryptos: Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB), and XRP gained up to 1.5%, while Solana (SOL) surged 5.2% over the week.

This recovery comes in a context where gold, the traditional safe haven, also hits historic highs above $3,380 an ounce.

The correlation between the two assets reinforces the idea that bitcoin is regaining its status as “digital gold,” a narrative that had lost strength in recent years.

Although bitcoin has long been correlated with US equities, it now appears to follow more closely the trajectory of gold, which has served as a safe haven while stock markets declined.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped to its lowest level in three years, pressured by potential interest rate cuts and political uncertainties.

The Trump administration could seek to replace Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve and impose rate cuts, prompting investors to diversify their assets.

“Trade tensions and inflation fears are leading investors to turn to safe haven assets like gold and now bitcoin,” notes Jeff Mei, Chief Operating Officer at BTSE.

A rate cut increases the money supply, which devalues the dollar and potentially strengthens Bitcoin's role as a safe haven.

Despite a drop of over 20% from its peak of $108,000 in January, bitcoin shows signs of resilience. This recovery aligns with the bold prediction of Robert Kiyosaki, author of “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” who anticipates bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2035.

 Paris Blockchain Week 2025 spotlights PoSA merge, Bahamut blockchain, hackathon wins and calls for rules on digital assets worldwide. 

 

Paris Blockchain Week 2025 gathered the industry's leading voices for important announcements, lively discussions and high-level networking. The event brought together about 9,600 attendees from 95 countries to discuss Web3 innovation at the iconic Carrousel du Louvre on April 8-10.

Fastex and Bahamut — an EVM-based, layer-1 public blockchain — drew attention with its approach of weighting validator rewards by onchain activity. On April 8, Fastex Web3 program lead Pavel Aramyan introduced Bahamut's proof-of-stake-and-activity (PoSA) merge to a packed audience. The mechanism builds on proof-of-stake (PoS) by tracking how often each validator's smart contracts are used and weighting block-proposal odds accordingly.

“What sets Bahamut aside is the consensus mechanism where validators have the opportunity to deploy their smart contracts and tie them directly to their validator nodes,” Aramyan explained. “Whenever these smart contracts are used, validators accumulate ‘activity' — a rating influencing their chances to propose blocks and earn greater rewards.”

Expanding on the core event, a multitude of side events enriched the experience of Paris Blockchain Week visitors. During the Paris Blockchain Week Hackathon (April 5-6), organized by BizThon with the Solana Foundation and XRPL Commons, developers explored three tracks at the VO2 Offices, including a dedicated Bahamut challenge focused on integrating PoSA into new decentralized applications (DApps).

Eleven talented teams developed solutions on the Bahamut blockchain in a friendly competition for a share of the €10,000 prize pool. Judged by a panel, including Fastex executives Pavel Aramyan and chief business development officer Armen Baghdasaryan, the winning teams emerged with innovative solutions:

1st place (€5,000): Looser Bracket – “Gaming Meets Liquidity”

2nd place (€3,000): Rod For Bahamut – “Boost Smart Contract Earnings with PoSA”

3rd place (€2,000): Monolith – “Memes Coin Launchpad”

Special Recognition: Pixamut – “AI Pixel Wars on Bahamut Chain,” earning priority access to the Bahamut Foundation Grants Program

On April 7, Fastex hosted its “Future Confidence Conference” at the elegant Atica Venue near Notre Dame, outlining a roadmap that features PercentMe — a DeFi lending protocol on Bahamut — along with consumer-facing services such as YoWallet, YoHealth, YoPhone, YoSIM and YoBlog.

Meri Mirijanyan, head of payments at Fastex, emphasized the convergence of traditional finance and crypto, noting that 70% of Fortune 500 companies show growing interest in crypto trends. She explained that Fastex Card can be used for daily transactions anywhere Mastercard is available, adding: “With Fastex Card, we are trying to make the payment process as simple as possible while keeping it as secure as possible.”

On April 9, Fastex chief legal officer Vardan Khachatryan joined the panel “The Influence of Digital Assets in the Global Economy,” stressing that clear stablecoin rules are essential if mainstream institutions are to adopt tokenized money. Alongside representatives from Animoca Capital, Flipster, Freedx and Paybis, he underscored the significance of clear regulatory frameworks to support broader digital asset integration.

The Paris Blockchain Week closed at the iconic La Machine du Moulin Rouge, where more than 2,000 registered guests — developers, founders, investors and policy-makers — gathered under the venue's famous red windmill. Sponsored by Fastex, the event shifted PBW's energy from conference halls to dance floors; house and downtempo sets filled the main room while smaller lounges offered space for quieter conversations and last‑minute deal‑making.

              Highlights            



                        On-chain tokenization is shifting from concept to reality, enabling real-world assets like fiat, real estate and securities to be represented as programmable digital tokens on the blockchain.                      


                        Tokenization offers new capital and liquidity strategies through real-time, cross-border and programmable money movement.                      


                        Despite regulatory fragmentation and digital identity concerns, adoption is growing due to tokenization's potential for speed, cost efficiency, transparency and automation.                      

The convenience, security and speed of digital innovation have reshaped the way businesses and individuals transact.

Now, money and assets are undergoing their own fundamental transformation.

It's all happening by way of tokenization on the blockchain. On-chain tokenization is moving from concept to practice, with players like Visa, Mastercard, J.P. Morgan and other commercial banks exploring or piloting real-world tokenized payment and financial systems.

For chief financial officers and corporate treasurers, tokenization isn't just a tech issue; it could represent a capital strategy shift.

As recently as Friday (April 18), Vera Capital announced a partnership with Blocksquare to tokenize “a substantial portfolio of commercial and multifamily real estate assets” across the United States, having already tokenized a $5.4 million commercial property in Fort Lauderdale.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also wants all assets to be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.”

At its most fundamental level, tokenization refers to representing real-world assets, such as fiat currency, deposits, securities and investment contracts, as digital tokens on a distributed ledger. These tokens can then be transferred, programmed or settled in ways traditional systems don't allow.

Tokenization isn't a cryptocurrency play. Tokenization helps give businesses and financial services stakeholders a way to move value faster, cheaper and more securely across different networks. It's about modernizing the movement of money and assets while democratizing investment access to institutional-grade products.

Unlike traditional digital assets, which are typically ledger entries in a private system (like a bank or card network), on-chain tokens are blockchain-native. They can be programmed, split, audited or transferred with a few lines of code, and often faster than traditional methods allow.

These tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) can be anything: fiat currency (like dollars or euros), real estate, equities, loyalty points or invoices.

Payments giants aren't waiting on regulators to get started prototyping. Last year, Visa tested the settlement of stablecoins. J.P. Morgan's JPM Coin is now facilitating billions of dollars in daily transactions, primarily for institutional clients.

“Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS this month.

“When we started the business in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens,” he said. “Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.”

As appetite grows from corporate treasurers for 24/7 programmable money, tokenization could provide tangible benefits to companies managing global supply chains, complex vendor networks or digital platforms. While tokenized payments are not a panacea, they can help to solve specific, persistent pain points in the global movement of money.

Cross-border payments, treasury management and programmable contracts are among the emerging real-world use cases for on-chain RWA.

Traditional correspondent banking networks are fragmented and slow. Tokenized fiat or deposits on a shared ledger allow for near-instant cross-border transfers, potentially collapsing multiday settlement windows into minutes or seconds. This is among the main benefits of stablecoins, an increasingly popular payment mechanism that involves the tokenization of fiat and other reserve backings.

At the same time, multinational corporations can struggle with liquidity fragmentation across jurisdictions. Tokenized deposits can be moved 24/7 across entities or regions, enabling just-in-time funding and optimizing working capital.

Blockchain-based smart contracts can also allow conditional or milestone-based payments to execute automatically, which could prove useful for trade finance, supply chains or royalty payments. Ultimately, tokenization's benefits such as real-time liquidity, conditional payments and borderless value exchange can create competitive advantages.

Two primary roadblocks to scalable utility across the enterprise are regulatory fragmentation and digital identity.

Regulatory alignment remains patchy, especially across borders. Cybersecurity and smart contract auditing are still evolving. And adoption depends not just on technology, but on user trust and industry coordination.

Sensitive financial data and transactions may be increasingly exposed to public scrutiny on-chain, so there's a pressing need to address privacy and identity challenges within crypto.

However, the marketplace isn't standing still, and work is being done to overcome these challenges. For forward-thinking finance leaders, it could be worth entertaining that the next decade of payments may be built not just with APIs and rails, but with tokens, smart contracts and interoperable ledgers.

Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have created CHASER, a new blockchain-based incentive system that makes mobile crowdsensing easier and safer. Mobile crowdsensing is a method of collecting data using mobile devices and everyday users. However, traditional systems often face problems with privacy, data security, and too much centralized control.

From Overwhelmed Supermarkets to Self-Checkout Efficiency

To understand CHASER's benefits, imagine a traditional crowdsensing platform as a supermarket managed by one cashier. If that single cashier gets overwhelmed or compromised, the entire operation can halt. CHASER, however, turns this scenario into a self-checkout marketplace. In this setup, smart contracts work like automated, unbiased cashiers that handle transactions fairly, privately, and without slowdowns.

Empowering Participation: Fairness, Transparency, and Rock-Solid Data Security

CHASER stands out because it promotes high user participation by ensuring fairness and transparency. It protects user identities with advanced encryption methods, keeping personal data safe. This results in a more reliable and efficient data collection process that can benefit many areas, from urban planning to environmental monitoring.

“CHASER is more than just a new system—it's a transformative leap that ensures every participant's contribution is valued and securely managed,” says Prof. Yuan Luo, the lead researcher.

Raising the Bar: Enhanced Social Welfare with Unmatched Reliability

The research shows that CHASER benefits all participants and boosts overall social welfare. This means the people who provide data and those who collect it enjoy better outcomes than older systems (i.e., PROM-F, PROM-M, and RBSM). CHASER uses strong anonymity and data protection measures to prevent misuse of sensitive information, and it consistently achieves a task completion rate above 80%, even on a large scale, proving its reliability.

Seamless Automation: Harnessing Blockchain and zk-SNARK for Swift, Secure Transactions

The researchers implemented smart contracts within a blockchain framework to automatically manage tasks, payments, and verifications. This automation reduces human errors and speeds up the process. Additionally, CHASER uses a unique cryptographic method known as zk-SNARK, which allows for quick transaction verification while keeping users anonymous.

Overall, the study marks a significant step in developing decentralized systems that balance user incentives, data protection, and operational efficiency—a key milestone in applying blockchain technology to everyday challenges.  The complete study is accessible via DOI: 10.1007/ s11704-024-3542-1.

You've built a blockchain solution that you're truly proud of. Your team knows the value it brings. Other blockchain enthusiasts are excited by it. However, you have one significant problem: gaining buy-in from the mainstream market.

Despite the significant growth the crypto and Web3 space has experienced in recent years, it remains a relatively fringe industry. On top of this, it's highly complex and esoteric to the vast majority of people. That means that unless your solution is very straightforward, most non-natives will be scratching their heads at your company, wondering why they should care.

If you really want your blockchain solution to break through to broader markets and expand its user base, you need to rethink how you communicate its value.

The first mistake many blockchain companies make (and most traditional businesses, for that matter) is assuming everyone cares about the same things they do. Unfortunately, that is simply not the case.

Blockchain natives are well-acquainted with terms like “decentralization,” “immutability,” and “trustless systems.” They know that these concepts represent potentially revolutionary improvements to traditional systems. But for non-natives? These words could be in another language.

Mainstream audiences and everyday people not involved in the Web3 space don't wake up thinking about consensus mechanisms. They wake up thinking about their problems. Because of this, you need to create two distinct communication approaches:

For blockchain natives, it is essential to highlight technical innovations, network effects, and protocol improvements. These informed audiences appreciate the “how” of your solution.

For mainstream markets, it's best to focus on the tangible benefits that your solution provides. Instead of the tech, talk about the “so what.”

The truth is that most people don't care HOW things work. They just want to enjoy the benefit. The vast majority of people are unaware of (and uninterested in) how refrigeration technology works, but they appreciate having fresh food that lasts longer and cool beverages.

That's exactly how you need to approach blockchain marketing with mainstream audiences. The technical complexities that make developers geek out will never resonate with the masses. They don't need to understand distributed consensus to appreciate that their financial information is safer and cannot be tampered with.

This approach is practical because it directly addresses what people truly care about in their daily lives. When you translate technical features into real-world benefits, you're speaking a language everyone understands: “What's in it for me?”

The main point to keep in mind here is that this benefit-focused communication doesn't need to diminish your amazing technology. It actually showcases its actual value by highlighting the tangible differences it makes in people's lives. This is how you overcome the blank stares and start generating genuine interest from non-blockchain enthusiasts.

Most blockchain projects quite rightly devote their time and resources to development and technical specifications. For better or worse, that means that marketing often becomes an afterthought, something you'll get to “once the product is perfect.” But even the most revolutionary and innovative technology won't sell itself, especially when it's complex.

There's a good chance your developers might struggle to explain your technology without diving into technical jargon. Your existing team might also lack experience reaching mainstream audiences and marketing products.

This is where partnering with a blockchain PR company can help to bridge the gap between your technical expertise and the communication needs of broader markets.

A good blockchain PR firm won't just blast out press releases into the void and call it a day. They will gain a deep understanding of your value proposition and help craft tailored messaging approaches for different audiences. They will know which publications reach blockchain enthusiasts and which ones influence mainstream consumers.

This allows you to focus on what you do best without worrying that your crypto public relations approach is being neglected. After all, if you want to find success, you need to be pushing forward with both sides of that coin at the same time.

Suppose you want the value of your solution to be understood by as many people as possible. In that case, you need to make connections to concepts they already understand. Analogies are your friend here.

If you're creating a decentralized finance application, don't start by explaining smart contracts; instead, begin by defining the underlying concepts. Instead, start by connecting to familiar financial concepts that everybody will understand.

“Remember how online banking changed how you manage money? We're taking the next step by removing the middlemen who take fees from your transactions.”

If you're developing a supply chain solution, connect it to consumer concerns about product authenticity: “Have you ever wondered if that expensive product is really authentic? Our system gives you a complete, tamper-proof history from factory to store.”

These aren't just simplifications. They help to bring a clear and concise benefit/use case to the hard work you're doing.

Lastly, it is essential to be honest about the image problem that mainstream audiences may have with cryptocurrency. Your potential customers have likely seen headlines about hacks, scams, market volatility, and environmental concerns. They've almost certainly heard stories from friends who lost money in crypto investments, struggled with complicated wallet setups, or have unfortunately been hacked.

Many blockchain companies make the mistake of ignoring or dismissing these concerns as misunderstandings. But that's precisely the wrong way to go about it.

As a flag bearer for the blockchain space, it is in your best interest to tackle these perceptions directly. If someone asks about security, don't just say “blockchain is secure” – explain specifically how your solution protects users in language they understand. If they worry about environmental impact, be honest about your energy usage and any steps you're taking to minimize it.

This transparency builds credibility. It shows you respect your audience's intelligence and concerns. It also allows you to distinguish your solution from others that might have contributed to negative perceptions.

Breaking into mainstream markets isn't about turning everyone into blockchain experts. Most people won't be interested in the technical details that blockchain-natives obsess over – and that's perfectly fine.

What they do care about is whether your solution improves their lives in some meaningful way. Can they trust it? Is it easy to use? Does it solve a problem they actually have?

The companies that succeed in mainstreaming blockchain won't be the ones with the most elegant code or the most innovative consensus mechanisms (though those things do matter). They'll be the ones who successfully translate their technical achievements into benefits that resonate with everyday people.

 The pseudonymous co-founder of Dead Bruv, said the initiative was about trying to “make NFTs fun again” and was sparked by a joke that turned into a “lightbulb moment.” 

A doomsday-themed Solana NFT project is looking to sell 100,000 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to buy a Cold War-era nuclear bunker in Rutland, England.

Dead Bruv, the creators of the narrative-driven NFT project Meatbags, plan to mint 100,000 NFTs, with Meatbags holders being airdropped 10,000. The the rest will be sold off starting April 21, starting at $14 a pop, according to a post on the Meatbags X account. 

Holders will gain entry into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), called the Billionaire Bunker Club, a “fully decentralized, community-governed real-world asset onchain,” which will vote on what happens with the bunker if the effort to buy it is successful. 

A few ideas floated by the NFT project include a “members-only survival resort with Doomsday DJ,” a location to hold end-of-the-world festivals, or “an Airbnb with caviar tastings and canned bean room service.” 

UK online auctioneer SDL Property Auctions has the bunker Dead Bruv is hoping to buy listed for a guide price of 650,000 British pounds ($862,257), and an auction date scheduled for April 24. 

The real estate listing says the bunker is located on 1.4 acres near a former reservoir and already has the relevant permissions for the winning bidder to convert it into a house. 

The bunker was built in 1960 to act as a monitoring post during the Cold War and was decommissioned in 1968. It was one of 1,500 tasked with reporting any nuclear bursts and monitoring any radioactive fallout, according to SDL Property Auctions.

Cointelegraph contacted SDL Property Auctions for comment. 

Robert, the pseudonymous co-founder of Dead Bruv, said in an April 18 statement to X that the initiative was about trying to “make NFTs fun again” and was sparked by a joke that turned into a “lightbulb moment.” 

“There's not much to compare this to, but these are the kinds of things that made me fall in love with NFTs in the first place. Taking risks. Getting creative. Pushing the boundaries of what this tech can do to create something completely new, absurd, and incredible,” he said. 

“When something comes from a place of, this is completely insane, we gotta do it, that's when I know we're onto something,” Robert added. 

This isn't the first time a DOA has turned to crowdfunding to buy an expensive item. ConstitutionDAO managed to raise about $47 million in Ether (ETH) in 2021 to purchase an original copy of the United States Constitution, which was going under the hammer at auctioneer Sotheby's.

Ultimately, they were unsuccessful. The winning bid was $43.2 million, and the DAO was limited to a bid of $43 million by Sotheby's to factor in taxes and the costs required to protect, insure and move the Constitution. 

Meanwhile, LinksDAO secured the winning bid to purchase Scotland-based Spey Bay Golf Club in May 2023. The DAO claims it added the US-based Hillcrest Country Club to its holdings in February.

An apocalyptic-themed Solana-based NFT project is aiming to sell 100,000 virtual tokens to buy a Cold War nuclear bunker in England. The innovative venture combines virtual ownership with physical real estate in what could potentially be a new trend for blockchain communities.

Dead Bruv, creators of the NFT collection called Meatbags, announced they will mint 100,000 tokens starting April 21. According to posts on the Meatbags social media account, prices will start at $14 each. Current Meatbags holders will receive 10,000 of these tokens through an airdrop, while the remaining 90,000 will be available for public purchase.

The nuclear bunker being considered for sale occupies 1.4 acres of ground adjacent to an old reservoir in Rutland, England. SDL Property Auctions placed the property up for auction with a guide price of £650,000 (around $862,257) and organized the sale to take place on April 24.

Meatbags, grab your masks and your bug out bags. April 21, we're kicking off #buythebunker—the weirdest crowdfunded property purchase on the internet ever 🧵 pic.twitter.com/WV0WPyYbva

— MEATBAGS (@mfmeatbags) April 19, 2025



Constructed in 1960 as a Cold War monitoring post and deactivated in 1968, the bunker was among 1,500 buildings charged with reporting nuclear bursts and monitoring radioactive fallout. The building already has the necessary permissions for conversion into a house, the auction listing states.



Token holders will become members of the “Billionaire Bunker Club,” a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that will make decisions on how to utilize the bunker if the NFT project buyout is successful. The group refers to itself as a “fully decentralized, community-governed real-world asset onchain.”

Robert, the pseudonymous founder of Dead Bruv, detailed in an April 18 announcement how the project started out as a joke that turned into a serious undertaking to bring “NFTs fun again.”

We're making fucking history with this one. A Web3 and crypto first—for the culture.

— Robert (@rbrtmb) April 18, 2025

In the event that the bunker buy is successful, the Meatbags community has proposed a number of possible uses including a members-only “survival resort with Doomsday DJ,” or an Airbnb with “caviar tastings and canned bean room service.”

Since the military coup in 2021, various armed opposition groups, fragmented ethnically and geographically, have come together to unseat the Tatmadaw – Myanmar's military – from power. Their stated aim is to establish a democratic federal National Unity Government (NUG) in its place.

As of 2025, the NUG's armed wing – the People's Defence Forces – and its allies maintain the upper hand against the Junta, claiming control over two thirds of the country's townships. The European Union recognizes the NUG as the legitimate government of Myanmar.

Meanwhile, accusations of war crimes, including of a sexual nature and bombing schools, have been made against the Junta and its associated paramilitaries. More recently, the Junta has been accused of conducting air strikes in areas hard hit by the 7.7 magnitude earthquake in March 2025. Many jurisdictions, including the United States and Singapore, have imposed sanctions or restrictions on financing the Tatmadaw.

With financing being key to the success of any armed rebellion, the Junta has clamped down on the opposition fighters' ability to access funding from both within Myanmar and the outside world.

To evade these restrictions, the NUG, in mid-2022, opted for a unique solution hardly ever observed before in a conflict setting: it tokenized the Myanmar Kyat – the national currency – and issued it in the form of a crypto token to populations under its control.

The Digital Kyat (DMMK), hosted on the Stellar blockchain and held on a digital wallet app called NUGPay, has its 1:1 peg with the Myanmar Kyat black market rate guaranteed by the NUG – making it, essentially, a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC). In mid-2023, amid a weakening Kyat, the NUG also issued nUSDT, a token replicating the USDT stablecoin and pegged 1:1 with the USD.

Users from both within Myanmar and abroad can make payments or donations to each other in DMMK or nUSDT through accounts on the NUGPay mobile app, using QR codes and @ handles – similar to other established payment systems in east and southeast Asia such as Alipay.

Public block explorers suggest that DMMK transaction volumes have reached 2.3 trillion as of March 2025, worth almost half a billion dollars at current black market rates. However, both NUGPay and publicly accessible blockchain data suggest that the app has around 38,000 accounts – indicating that wider usage among the general population is limited.

Given the blockchain-based nature of the Digital Kyat CBDC, Elliptic has the capability to trace DMMK and nUSDT transactions. The tracing of blockchain-based CBDCs is a major step for the blockchain analytics industry as over 100 countries are actively researching, developing or piloting their own CBDC projects to make international trade and retail payments more efficient. 

This is despite privacy concerns in the US, where the Trump Administration has barred the creation of a Digital Dollar.

Furthermore, Elliptic has identified close to 150 People's Defence Forces (PDFs), military fundraisers and pro-opposition diaspora groups seeking donations through NUGPay.

In a year where the NUG seeks to deal the knock-out blow against the Junta while also managing major natural disasters, tracing the DMMK enables us to shed light on one of the world's lesser-known conflicts – with major geopolitical implications for the region and beyond.

Below, we explore how effective this digital payment solution – itself “created to safely support the needs of the revolution” according to the NUG's Ministry of Finance – has been at fuelling the opposition's battlefield successes.

You can read our earlier coverage about how the DMMK has been used to bypass aid restrictions in response to the March 2025 earthquake here.

Opposition-aligned armed groups and diaspora organizations alike have been running increasingly creative social media campaigns to entice donations to their NUGPay wallets.

AI-generated campaign posters, cat memes, cartoons and even a youth song contest have been used to collect DMMK. Lotteries for Teslas, holidays and jewellery are also commonplace. Donors of notable sums are frequently rewarded with certificates in their name, displayed proudly on the recipient organization's social media page.

Our analysis suggests that DMMK and nUSDT donations to domestic and diaspora fundraisers, PDFs and other allied armed groups, the NUG's administrative institutions, civil disobedience movements and disaster relief initiatives have topped $11.5 million since November 2023, across over 53,000 individual transfers.

Though not as much as the $100 million+ donated in crypto to Ukraine after Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion, the DMMK nevertheless reinforces the power of blockchain technology in national emergencies and war. The volume of donations is still comparable to other uses of crypto in crisis situations, such as the $12.5 million donated to Turkey after the 2023 earthquakes. 



Our analysis also reveals that DMMK and nUSDT donations have remained largely consistent over time, even though there is a slight downward trend between late 2023 and 2025. This is in contrast to Ukraine, where donations sharply declined after the first few days of the invasion and never recovered.



The committee representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw – the opposition Union Parliament of Myanmar to which the NUG is accountable – has established an official fundraiser page that lists close to 300 vetted donation campaigns.

These operate across multiple countries, including Myanmar itself, Australia, the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, Canada and Japan. Among them are food kitchens, overseas concerts, medical networks and women's organizations.

Our analysis shows that Singapore-based groups have been by far the most successful – receiving over $3 million in DMMK/nUSDT donations, followed by Australian ($500,000) and UK-based ($240,000) organizations. Many of them have in turn forwarded donations to groups based on the ground.



Elliptic Investigator shows Singapore and Australia-based diaspora organizations donating DMMK and nUSDT to armed groups within Myanmar.

Armed groups on the ground have predominantly called for donations to purchase military equipment and food supplies. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been in particularly high demand, with some fundraisers existing with the sole purpose of procuring drones for the front lines.

Some armed groups have also financed the creation of their own 3D printed weapons and drones. According to past reports, these include the prominent Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF) in the south-east of the country – which has raised over $160,000 in DMMK and nUSDT.

Tracing the financial aspect of this war is also important for other reasons. Many armed groups, including the above-mentioned KNDF, operate in regions with burgeoning industrialized fraud, so-called “pig butchering” and labor trafficking activity.

In particular, the town of Myawaddy in Karen State is home to hundreds' of thousands of victims of labor trafficking, forced to conduct digital scams from dedicated scam compounds. Some of these compounds, such as the notorious KK Park, function as entire towns in themselves with a range of facilities for forced workers and organized criminals.

Various armed and political Karenni groups have been affiliated in the past with these compounds. For instance, local media reported in 2023 that the opposition-aligned Karen National Union was linked to contracts and leases involving KK Park in Karen State. The same outlet later reported that the group had pledged to probe five of its officials for alleged involvement. 

More recently, in light of pressure from China and Thailand, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army and Border Guard Force have been raiding certain compounds and freeing thousands of workers.



China's traditional backing for the Junta has fuelled anti-Chinese propaganda by opposition groups.

Though such cases do not yet show any association with DMMK transactions, our ability to trace them nevertheless provides an additional level of pre-emptive visibility should that situation ever change.

Becoming a medium for making everyday payments and paying taxes, DMMK has also been used by various NUG ministries, including the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs & Disaster Management. The Union Parliament in exile also owns a public NUGPay wallet.

When Typhoon Yagi caused extensive damage and flooding in the Mandalay and Magway regions in September 2024, the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs launched a Disaster Relief Fund NUGPay wallet alongside its own, receiving over $700,000 in donations overall.

One week after the March 2025 earthquake, a special Goodwill Fund set up by NUGPay itself received $20,000.

In states and regions almost completely under control of opposition forces, some townships have started soliciting DMMK donations to begin setting up new local layers of government. Elliptic has observed this practice predominantly in Chin State, where groups such as the Chin Defence Force have consistently had the upper hand for some time.

It should be noted, however, that the extent of NUGPay usage across regions differs based on the stability of the conflict situation and the strength of the affiliation between resident armed groups and the NUG. The usage numbers, in the low 30,000s, indicate that sustained use has not been established in all areas where the NUG is nominally in control.

To aid areas where NUGPay use is scarce, Dr. Tu Hkawng, the NUG Union Minister of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation, has publicized his NUGPay wallet for donations to armed groups in Kachin State – suggesting that some entities there may have never used NUGPay before.

The below map shows the amount and distribution of funds received by entities where we have been able to determine their specific geographic areas of operation. 



Though the DMMK is certainly a unique case, CBDCs are not necessarily a novel technology. According to the Atlantic Council, 10 states – including Norway, Ukraine, Australia and Bhutan – are currently exploring the establishment of a blockchain-based CBDC, predominantly to digitize payments and to streamline trade and cross-border transfers.

However, unlike the DMMK (which is operational), these projects are all in the proof-of-concept or research phase. Presumably, none are being developed with financing conflict in mind. 

You can read more about CBDCs at Elliptic's knowledge hub.

Elliptic's tools now have the capability to trace and screen transactions occurring in both DMMK and nUSDT. In addition, close to 150 entities engaging in civil war fundraising have been labelled in our tools.

Whether you're a VASP or a law enforcement agency – and regardless of where your jurisdiction stands on the conflict – this capability matters. Here's why:

Noting that prevention is the best cure, we consistently monitor unique and emerging crypto use cases to ensure that any potential compliance or sanctions risks are pre-emptively addressed. 

Our support for DMMK and nUSDT also underscores our industry-leading coverage of assets and blockchains. As of 2025, our tools are able to screen and trace over 50 blockchains.

The digital euro, the future digital currency issued by the European Central Bank, is set to profoundly transform the European monetary landscape. According to the ECB, this CBDC could replace up to 50% of cash in circulation and significantly impact bank deposits! Thus marking a strategic turning point for Europe in the face of digital assets.

The digital euro, the central bank digital currency (CBDC) promoted by the European Central Bank (ECB), could profoundly change the use of money in the eurozone. Although its official launch is only about 6 months away, the ECB is already anticipating its effects on banknotes and bank deposits.

In its latest report, the institution estimates that 5 out of 10 euros in physical banknotes could be replaced by digital euros. Furthermore, 3 out of 10 of these new “digital euros” would come directly from citizens' bank deposits.

The ECB has considered three levels of adoption: low, medium, and high. In the most limited scenario, 15 billion euros worth of banknotes would be replaced. In the case of massive adoption, this figure would rise to 256 billion euros. However, even in this hypothesis, the circulation of the digital euro would remain marginal compared to the 1,567 billion euros in banknotes currently circulating in the eurozone.

Unlike the United States, where President Trump recently banned the development of a digital dollar while supporting cryptocurrencies, Europe is actively pushing the digital euro. ECB board member Piero Cipollone considers this project a matter of strategic sovereignty.

The ECB also warns against risks related to technological dependency on this new currency. The Polaris Project, led by the Bank for International Settlements, aims to strengthen the resilience of CBDC infrastructures against cyber threats.

Scheduled for October 2025, the digital euro represents much more than a simple monetary innovation: it is a structural change that could redefine how Europeans use and store their money. Between digital sovereignty, geopolitical competition, and banking transformation, Europe seems determined to move forward on the path of CBDCs.

A theme that I have written about a lot around here is that US banking seems to be getting narrower. Traditionally, banks are in the business of (1) taking deposits and (2) making loans, and that is a famously risky combination: If all the depositors want their money back, the bank doesn't have it, and there can be a destructive bank run. There are various ways to mitigate this problem — liquidity regulation, deposit insurance, the central bank as a lender of last resort — but it keeps popping up.

There is one theoretical way to get rid of the problem entirely: You could separate the business of taking deposits from the business of making loans. Some companies — call them “narrow banks” — could be in the business of taking deposits and just holding onto them, in literal piles of cash or more plausibly in the form of electronic reserves at the Federal Reserve. Other companies — call them “loan companies” — could be in the business of making loans, but not using deposits as funding. Those companies could raise funds from investors who knowingly take the risk of making loans and lock up their money for the long term. Deposits would be safe, loan funds would not be subject to runs, and the central risk would be removed from banking.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Revolut: 'I was careful and followed instructions closely, but still lost my crypto'","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93gydxj8n7o","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 01:04:27 GMT","

Trading cryptocurrency was just a bit of fun for Tzoni Raykov, but losing $1,500 worth to an administrative error has left him with serious concerns about his treatment by the industry.

The oil engineer has held an account with Revolut for several years - using its app to split bills with friends after going out for dinner or drinks. They would pay each other using traditional currency, like the pound sterling or US dollar.

But after seeing the e-money firm advertise its cryptocurrency services, he decided to give it a try.

What Tzoni thought would be a straightforward transfer of cryptocurrency coins has left the Bulgarian national angry and out of pocket.

His experience highlights some of the frustrations people have had using cryptocurrency where many of the customer safeguards which underpin standard online banking transactions, some mandated by law, do not apply.

""When they treat you like this, it makes you feel like you can't do anything,"" he told BBC News. ""Like you are powerless.""

While the cryptocurrency market is dominated by Bitcoin, there is a plethora of other digital currencies, including USDC - which Tzoni had already amassed in a separate crypto account.

His frustrations began in February when he decided to transfer some of his USDC coins to his Revolut account.

As a precaution - which Revolut suggests doing - he first sent 10 of the coins, worth $10. It was a success and the funds were credited to his Revolut account.

Days later he tried to make a larger transfer of what he thought was 1,500 USDC. The transfer was completed but, this time, the funds were not credited to his account.

Tzoni says the problem occurred because Revolut's deposit instructions were unclear.

When you transfer cryptocurrency from one account to another, you have to select a network to send it through - like choosing which courier service to use when sending a parcel.

Revolut's deposit instructions say to transfer USDC to it, you have to use a network called Polygon. In his first, successful, deposit Tzoni selected one called ""Polygon PoS"".

In the second deposit, when he tried to transfer 1,500 USDC, he selected a different network - ""Polygon (bridged)"". 

He thought it would work just as well but says instead it caused the coins to be converted into USDC.e - a different cryptocurrency. 

This is what Revolut received. The company does not handle USDC.e coins.

After seeing his Revolut account had not been credited with the 1,500 coins, Tzoni contacted the Revolut support team.

In messages seen by BBC News, they told him the issue seemed to be with ""the specific type of Polygon network used, which led to the conversion"".

In another, he was told: ""The app currently specifies 'Polygon' without differentiating between standard and bridged options. I'll note your feedback for future improvements.""

Tzoni thinks if Revolut's deposit instructions had been more specific, his problem would have been avoided.

When approached by BBC News about this case, Revolut gave a different answer.

The firm said the problem was not because Tzoni had used the wrong Polygon network - which he claimed turned his coins into USDC.e.

The deposit failure was ""not because the network itself had 'converted' the token"", it said, without explaining why its support team had suggested to Tzoni that it was.

Revolut told us the deposit ultimately failed because the USDC.e coins it received were not supported by the company's technology.

It said: ""As is standard industry practice due to the significant technical challenges involved in supporting every combination of token and chain, the recovery of these unsupported assets does not sit within Revolut's scope.""

It means the 1,500 USDC.e coins have not been credited to Tzoni's account or sent back to him.

To Tzoni's mind, this isn't acceptable treatment from a company of Revolut's size and reputation, which handles normal banking deposits as well as cryptocurrency, stocks and commodities.

Revolut says it has 10 million users in the UK while last year it was granted a provisional banking licence, paving the way for it to become a fully fledged UK bank.

When using a High Street bank, a mistaken transfer of traditional currency would usually be resolved with the money being reverted back to the customer.

This was established in 2014 in a voluntary code of practice that most UK banks signed up to. There is no such equivalent in the cryptocurrency industry.

After contacting Revolut several times in recent weeks, Tzoni has been told the coins are effectively lost.

""They are waiting for me to get bored and give up, to accept the money is gone. But I won't,"" Tzoni said, pointing out the coins are in the Revolut system. ""It is ridiculous that they can behave like this.""

While Tzoni's loss of cryptocurrency is significant to him, the sum is tiny compared with the size of the industry, which has risen sharply in value over the past 18 months.

The global market peaked in value at $3.9tn last December, following the re-election of Donald Trump. Since then it has fallen by $1.1tn, according to tracking website CoinGecko.

Government policies in the US and other countries are also changing to favour the cryptocurrency industry, even though it has suffered several scandals.

FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency firms, went bankrupt in 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried, its chief executive, was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year for defrauding customers of billions of dollars.

Investigators also found FTX was using QuickBooks, a popular accounting software designed for individuals and small businesses, to manage the money.

John Ray III, a lawyer tasked with recovering funds from FTX for defrauded customers, told a bankruptcy court: ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.""

He later told a congressional hearing: ""Nothing against QuickBooks. It's a very nice tool, just not for a multibillion-dollar company.""

A couple of months ago Bybit, the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange by some estimates, was tricked out of $1.5bn worth of coins by hackers thought to be working for North Korea.

The firm had been using Safe, a free digital storage software popular with individuals who want to store cryptocurrency on their own devices, as part of their business operations.

Following the theft, Bybit's chief executive said they ""should have upgraded and moved away from Safe"" earlier.

One of the problems with cryptocurrency firms, says Prof Mark Button, who researches cybercrime, is they can grow very quickly, which means they don't always keep up with the accounting and security challenges of managing so much money.

""For me it illustrates that if we are going to be serious about cryptocurrencies in the future… there needs to be some kind of regulation.""

In Tzoni's case, it might have been easier for him to get his cryptocurrency back or be compensated if there were laws stating what firms need to do if they are sent a coin they don't handle.

Higher industry standards might also have prevented him making such a transaction in the first place.

Mykhailo Tiutin is chief technology officer at AMLBot, a company that analyses how risky cryptocurrency transactions are.

Their service runs checks similar to those supported by banks, where details for a transfer, such as the account holder's name, sort code and account number, are verified.

He says cryptocurrency is safe enough for the average person to use but that they should be careful about which products and services they choose. He says he has also lost cryptocurrency after making an administrative mistake.

""You have to do your own research,"" he told us. ""The successes and the losses are ultimately at your own risk.""

The MP's office says ""steps were taken quickly to secure the account and remove misleading posts"".

Figures from Action Fraud shows cryptocurrency fraud is on the rise, a police force says.

Bitcoin miners will go to remote locations to take advantage of cheap electricity.

Aleksej Besciokov is wanted by the US for allegedly laundering money and violating sanctions. 

Hackers from the infamous Lazarus Group are in a cat-and-mouse game to launder their stolen funds from the ByBit heist.

 Gold-backed stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to physical gold reserves and designed to maintain a stable value. The concept of gold-backed digital currencies dates back to the early days of cryptocurrency, with developers aiming to create a reliable store of value. Each gold-backed stablecoin represents a specific quantity of gold. For instance, one token might be linked to 1 troy ounce of gold. A troy ounce is a unit of weight used explicitly for weighing precious metals like gold, silver and platinum; it is equal to 31.1034768 grams. A third party typically holds the gold reserves to ensure security and transparency. The issuing entity is responsible for maintaining an equivalent amount of physical gold for every token in circulation. The token's price remains closely aligned with the market value of gold. Buyers pay gold's spot price for a token. Similarly, if the stablecoin fails, the tokenholders can redeem their tokens for the gold. Practically, the gold is liquidated for electronic fiat transfers.Regulators classify gold-backed stablecoins as commodity-backed stablecoins or asset-referenced tokens (ARTs), depending on jurisdiction. Examples of gold-backed stablecoins include Tether Gold (XAUT), Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Alloy (aUSDT).Did you know? On April 1, 2025, Tether Gold (XAUT) traded at $3,165. Its market capitalization was about $780.3 million, with a daily trading volume of $11.03 million.

 Gold-backed stablecoins combine the stability of gold with the flexibility of digital assets. Their blockchain-based nature offers benefits beyond traditional paper gold. Here are a few advantages of gold-backed stablecoins:Flexible alternative to physical gold: Gold-backed stablecoins function as blockchain-based representations of gold, offering a more efficient and flexible alternative to holding physical bullion. Instant global trading: Unlike traditional gold ownership, these tokens can be stored in cryptocurrency wallets from which you can transfer instantly and trade globally with a nominal transactional fee.Access to DeFi applications: They also enable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, expanding their usability beyond traditional gold investments.Better security: Physical gold is vulnerable to theft, loss and damage. Gold-backed stablecoins, stored on blockchain networks, can be more secure.Programmability: Gold-backed stablecoins are programmable because they exist on blockchain networks such as Ethereum. This allows them to interact with smart contracts and work with decentralized apps (DApps).Divisibility: Splitting physical gold or even paper gold is challenging. However, you can split a single token into several decimal places, which can be recorded on the blockchain.Make gold more accessible: Gold-backed tokens enable you to easily access gold. An ounce of gold may be expensive, but you can easily buy 0.001 of a token. Interoperability: When you release a token on a widely used network like Ethereum, it is instantly operable with DApps, DeFi platforms and wallets supported by the network.Diversification of funds: Investing in gold-backed stablecoins enables you to diversify your funds. It is a unique type of asset that protects you against currency value drops.

 USD-backed stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to the US dollar. Each token is typically backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars or cash-equivalent assets held in reserve by a financial institution or trust.For every USD-backed stablecoin issued, the issuing entity must maintain a corresponding reserve amount to guarantee its value. This ensures that holders can always redeem their tokens for an equivalent dollar amount. Examples of USD-backed stablecoins are Tether (USDt), USDC (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD), all of which are used in trading, payments and DeFi.You can buy and sell stablecoins through crypto exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. To purchase, create an account, complete verification, deposit fiat or crypto and choose a stablecoin such as USDt or USDC. To sell, go to the trading section, select your stablecoin, and exchange it for fiat or another crypto. Some wallets and peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges also support stablecoin trading.Did you know? The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulations (MiCA) have forced crypto exchanges to delist USDT and other non-compliant stablecoins, resulting in a growing market for Euro-backed stablecoins. USDC continues to be a prominent USD alternative in the region.

Did you know? The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulations (MiCA) have forced crypto exchanges to delist USDT and other non-compliant stablecoins, resulting in a growing market for Euro-backed stablecoins. USDC continues to be a prominent USD alternative in the region.

 USD-backed stablecoins offer several advantages, making them a critical part of the crypto ecosystem. By combining the reliability of fiat currency with the efficiency of blockchain, USD-backed stablecoins play a vital role in digital finance. Here are a few advantages of USD-backed stablecoins:Steady value: Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, which experience high volatility, stablecoins maintain a steady value, making them an ideal unit for payments, particularly in exchange for goods and services.Liquidity and accessibility: USD-backed stablecoins are widely accepted across crypto exchanges, payment platforms and DeFi applications. This allows traders to move funds quickly between assets without converting crypto back to fiat currency, reducing transaction costs and delays.Transparency: Issuers generally provide regular audits and reports on their reserves, which enables users to verify that actual USD holdings back each token. This transparency builds trust among users, issuers and regulators.Fast, low-cost international payments: Operating on blockchain networks, USD-backed blockchain networks facilitate fast, low-cost international payments without relying on traditional banking systems. This makes them a preferred option for remittances and cross-border trade.Safe haven during market downturns: USD-backed stablecoins offer stability during periods of market volatility. Investors and traders often convert volatile crypto holdings into stablecoins to protect their value without exiting the crypto market entirely.Still, please note that stablecoins may depeg occasionally because of several macro and microeconomic factors. Macro factors include changes in economic conditions, such as inflation or an increase in interest rates. Micro variables involve differences in market conditions, such as changes in the underlying collateral and problems with liquidity. When Silicon Valley Bank failed in March of 2023, the USDC stablecoin deviated from its peg because $3.3 billion of its reserves were held there.Did you know? Stablecoins are of four types: fiat-collateralized, crypto-collateralized, algorithmic and commodity-collateralized. Algorithmic stablecoins have gradually gone out of favor.

 Gold-backed and USD-backed tokens are stablecoins, yet they differ in several ways. This comparison explores the fundamental differences, focusing on their backing assets, price stability, liquidity, adoption and primary use cases:Backing asset: Physical gold vs fiat reservesGold-backed and USD-backed stablecoins differ primarily regarding the collateral that supports their value. Gold-backed stablecoins are tied to physical gold, usually at a fixed ratio, while some USD-backed stablecoins are backed by a reserve of US dollars, short-dated and cash deposits.Price stability: Long-term vs short-termThe value of gold-backed stablecoins fluctuates depending on the market price of gold, which can experience short-term volatility but tends to appreciate over the long run. USD-backed stablecoins maintain a 1:1 peg to the dollar, ensuring more predictable short-term stability. Their value remains steady unless external factors, such as regulatory changes or mismanagement of reserves, impact the peg. Liquidity and adoption: Use of USD-backed in DeFi applicationsUSD-backed stablecoins are more liquid and widely accepted in the crypto ecosystem, including exchanges, payment systems and DeFi applications. They are frequently used for trading and lending. Moreover, many countries in Latin America, such as Bolivia, have adopted USDC for payments. Gold-backed stablecoins, while useful for preserving value, are less commonly integrated into DeFi protocols due to low liquidity concerns.  Use cases: Value storage Gold-backed stablecoins serve as a hedge against inflation, appealing to investors seeking growth. USD-backed stablecoins are preferred by investors seeking stability and value storage. USD-backed stablecoins are used for everyday transactions, trading and financial services, thanks to instant liquidity and ease of use.Regulatory considerations: ComplianceGold-backed stablecoins and fiat-backed stablecoins differ in regulation due to their underlying assets. For instance, specific regulations such as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) and the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act have emerged in the US for USD-backed stablecoins. However, no specific regulations exist for gold-backed stablecoins as of March 31, 2025, though they are expected to adhere to the usual banking and financial regulations.

 Two factors favoring gold-backed stablecoins are their inflation-resistant properties and long-term stability.

The current dispensation views USD-backed stablecoins as a potent tool to maintain the status of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency. While the Trump administration has been crypto-friendly since it took over, its support of the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act, which await Congressional approval, is further testimony of this approach.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emphasized stablecoins as a strategic tool for sustaining the dollar's reserve currency status.

According to Keiser, China and Russia collectively hold around 50,000 tons of gold, more than officially reported. If true, this gold could be used to roll out gold-backed stablecoins.If gold-backed stablecoins gain wider adoption, they could challenge the US government's efforts to maintain dollar dominance through stablecoins.

Gold-backed stablecoins resemble the gold-backed US dollar before 1971. That was the year when President Richard Nixon abolished the convertibility of the US dollar to gold. XAUT has enjoyed a 15.7% price increase year-to-date, suggesting the growth potential of the bullion-backed stablecoins.While gold-backed stablecoins present a compelling alternative, the battle for dominance between gold and USD-pegged stablecoins remains ongoing, influenced by geopolitical factors, financial policies, and market demand.

        Share    

DeFi Technologies has announced the development of Kenya Digital Exchange, a regulated platform earmarked for the tokenization of real-world assets.

Announced on April 21, Kenya Digital Exchange is a collaboration between DeFi Technologies and its subsidiary Valour Inc., as well as SovFi and the Nairobi Securities Exchange.

KDX offers a new exchange that will allow for the trading of various tokenized products, including equities, debt, funds and commodities. 

“This partnership marks a bold and strategic leap toward the future of African capital markets,” said Frank Mwiti, chief executive officer of the NSE.

KDX will help unlock new investment opportunities for users, increase market access and bring benefits tokenization and trading to more users across the continent. 

Notably, KDX will tap into blockchain technology, including Hedera (HBAR), to bring these benefits to users.

“By collaborating with NSE, we will empower investors with new asset classes, driving economic growth, and positioning Kenya as a leading financial hub in Africa,” said Olivier Roussy Newton of DeFi Technologies.

The partnership comes several months after an initial collaboration between Valour and the NSE, which will see exchange-traded products by Valour go live on the Nairobi Stock Exchange. 

Per the details in the latest press release, the ETPs are set for NSE-listing before the end of the third quarter of 2025.

Meanwhile, KDX is set for phased rollout, with the first of three phases implemented by the end of 2025. The last phase is expected in the first half of 2026.

The new digital exchange will feature a revenue model that includes trading fees, listing fees, deposit/withdrawal fees, and margin trading. 

KDX also plans to accrue revenue from lending, staking, token launches, custody and initial exchange offerings among many other initiatives.

The launch of KDX looks to tap into a market boasting over 6 million crypto users, and one that accounted for over $18.6 billion in transactions in 2022.

Circle, the firm behind the $60 billion USDC stablecoin, is launching a new payments and cross border remittance network on Tuesday — the company's “next product move” — from its plush New York City headquarters, high on the 87th Floor of One World Trade Center.

The launch event is aimed at banks, fintechs, payment service providers, remittance providers and USDC strategic partners. It will feature Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire sharing his vision for the stablecoin giant's next move within the payments space, according to an invite seen by CoinDesk.

New and incipient regulations around the globe are opening up the stablecoin space, where Circle has shared the limelight with larger rival Tether. It makes sense then that Circle — a firm that has successfully pivoted during its years in the crypto space — should look to consolidate its position and return to its roots as a payments company.

“Circle is launching a payments network that is initially targeting remittances but is ultimately aiming to rival Mastercard and Visa,"" said a person familiar with the plans.

Stablecoins have reached an adoption level where the technology could disrupt global money transfers in a way similar to WhatsApp and international calls, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz said in recent report.

In a recent interview, crypto custody tech specialists Fireblocks pointed to billions being moved around by payments services providers doing things like cross border payments using stablecoins like USDC and USDT.

Circle was in the news most recently, after the firm announced plans to go public in the U.S., only to postpone the date of its IPO thanks to choppy and uncertain market conditions.

Circle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

We are never shy about holding ETH to account as crypto's second largest asset and the DeFi intuition gateway for traditional investors. But mainstream adoption requires a growth story, and so far this year ETH is (put kindly) failing to lead. 

ETH sits in 16th place in the CoinDesk 20 YTD performance leaderboard, down 53%. Going back a year, the numbers look similar: 15th place and down 50%. Its market cap has dwindled so much relative to XRP that both are expected to be capped in the upcoming CoinDesk 20 reconstitution, a first.

ETH's woes are news to few in the industry, but for us as index and product builders for ""5%-ers,"" it begs the question: is ETH still special? A distinguished provenance can only take you so far. ETH continues to dominate its on-chain categories (even before adding in L2s) and is arguably the second best brand name in crypto. There are even thoughtful ideas about ETH's end-state as an essential supporting component of our blockchain future; we hear expressions like, ""Ethereum will be the clearinghouse of DeFi.""

But mainstream adoption requires a growth story.

We have observed over the last few weeks that bitcoin has shown impressive resilience to fragile global markets. This past week was no exception, and as we pointed out last week, expectations for higher inflation – now echoed by Fed Chair Powell – could help support movement into bitcoin.

But the crypto market's dependency on bitcoin to lead prices higher is one we hope the digital asset class outgrows. ETH can reassert a leadership position, as it briefly did in the weeks following the U.S. election. If not, CoinDesk 20 investors have exposure to much of ETH's competition.

Bitcoin (BTC) outshined the otherwise volatile alternative cryptocurrencies early Monday as the dollar index (DXY) crashed to a three-year low on reports that President Donald Trump is exploring ways to remove the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.

BTC rose over 2% to $87,200, hitting the highest since April 2, according to data from CoinDesk. The move marked a bullish resolution to the recent consolidation between $83,000 and $87,000. Major alternative cryptocurrencies such as payments-focused XRP, Ethereum's ether and Cardano's ADA rose over 1% each, lagging BTC.

In forex market, hedge funds sold the U.S. dollar against major currencies, including euro, yen and the Aussie dollar, driving the dollar index to 98.5, the lowest since April 2022, according to data from charting platform TradingView. The DXY has declined by 10% in three months. Weakness in the dollar typically eases financial conditions, greasing risk-taking in financial markets.

Meanwhile, gold's rally continued, with the per ounce price reaching a record high of $3,382, taking the year-to-date gain to 28%. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq traded 0.5% lower. 

Observers suggest that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett's comment on Friday regarding Trump's intention to remove Powell likely triggered the selling of the dollar, along with upticks in BTC and gold. 

""The move in bitcoin to $87,000 appears to be driven by a sharp drop in the U.S. dollar and a +2% rally in gold, both triggered by Trump's push to replace Fed chair Powell. While a trade deal with Japan may be announced soon, the key catalyst today is the perceived threat to Fed independence,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, told CoinDesk.

Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday that ""Powell's termination cannot come fast enough,"" while reiterating calls for lower interest rates on the following day. Early last week, Powell said that the Fed would wait for more data on the economy before changing the borrowing cost while warning of stagflation.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that a move by Trump to terminate Jerome Powell would undermine the credibility of the Fed.

Publicly-listed Metaplanet announced fresh bitcoin (BTC) purchases on Monday as BTC went above $87,300, reversing last week's loses.

Metaplanet picked up 330 BTC bring its overall holdings to 4,855 BTC, worth over $420 million, based on current prices.

This is the Japanese firm's third bitcoin purchase this month, even as broader markets reel from tariff concerns amid a general lack of optimism. Earlier this month, Metaplanet became the tenth-largest public holder of BTC.

However, Metaplanet is not the only Japanese firm raking up bitcoin.Fashion brand ANAP Holdings purchase approximately 16.6591 BTC, valued at around 200 million yen (approximately $1.4 million), last week.

The holdings will be overseen by its subsidiary, ANAP Lightning Capital. The company plans to conduct quarterly market value assessments of its BTC holdings, with any gains or losses reflected in its profit and loss statements.

Its BTC yield from quarter-to-date is at 12.1% so far, with the previous quarter's yield at 95%. BTC Yield is a custom metric used by the firm to assess the performance of its strategy. This measures the growth of bitcoin per fully diluted share.

Bitcoin has fared relatively better than U.S. equities in such a time of financial instability. U.S. equities lost $5.4 trillion in value in two days after President Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs earlier in April, which sent the Nasdaq tumbling down 11% at the time. BTC fell a relatively smaller 6%, in comparison.

Metaplanet's stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is up nearly 0.9% since open.

 Incoming US Treasury buybacks and a weakening US dollar may bolster Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against turbulence in the traditional financial system. 

Investors seeking Bitcoin exposure may be running out of time to purchase below a six-figure price, as US Treasury buybacks may signal the next leg up for the world's first cryptocurrency.

This might be the “last chance” to buy Bitcoin (BTC) below the $100,000 mark, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer of Maelstrom.

“Seriously fam, this might be the last chance you have to buy $BTC post, hinting at incoming “treasury buy backs” as the “Bazooka” for Bitcoin's price trajectory.

Treasury buybacks refer to the US Treasury Department repurchasing its outstanding bonds from the open market to increase liquidity, manage federal debt or stabilize interest rates.

These operations can inject liquidity into the financial system, often benefiting risk assets like Bitcoin.

Other analysts predicted that the growth of the fiat money supply will be Bitcoin's main catalyst in 2025.

The growing money supply may push Bitcoin's price above $132,000 before the end of the year, according to Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision.

However, global trade war concerns may limit investor appetite until the US and China reach a trade agreement.

Bitcoin briefly rose above $87,700 for the first time in nearly three weeks, since US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal import tariffs on April 2.

“Looks like Bitcoin is pumping on continued Dollar weakness,” wrote André Dragosch, the European head of research at Bitwise, adding that the US Dollar Index “just touched the lowest level since March 2022.”

The weakening US dollar may reinforce Bitcoin's appeal as a safe-haven asset, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told Cointelegraph, adding:

Despite the recent correction, Japanese and UK-based investment firms are investing hundreds of millions into Bitcoin, signaling continued institutional adoption that may accelerate Bitcoin's four-year cycle.

 Ethereum Foundation co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak said the organization's recent shift allows Vitalik Buterin to spend more time on research and exploration. 

The Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit organization developing the Ethereum ecosystem, is shifting its focus to user experience and layer-1 scaling challenges following its March leadership reshuffle. 

On April 21, the Ethereum Foundation co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak shared an X post detailing how the organization has changed since its change in leadership structure. 

Stańczak said the change aims to give Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin more time for research and exploration rather than dealing with day-to-day tasks and crisis management. 

“Each time Vitalik shares insights or communicates a direction, he accelerates major long‑term breakthroughs,” he wrote. 

Stańczak added that Buterin's recent posts had advanced promising avenues and helped realign the community around the organization's core values. 

On March 1, the Ethereum Foundation announced that its core researcher Hsiao-Wei Wang and Stańczak, the CEO of Nethermind, would become the co-directors of the organization from March 17. 

Since the changes in the organization's leadership structure, Buterin has stepped back from daily operations. He has since published proposals addressing the Ethereum network's privacy and performance limitations.

On April 11, the Ethereum co-founder unveiled a privacy roadmap for the network. In the post, Buterin proposed having features that anonymize user transactions. Buterin said the features should be “ideally turned on by default.” 

Besides the privacy of transactions, Buterin also shared a post addressing Ethereum's speed and efficiency. On April 20, Buterin proposed a change in the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) contract language to improve the efficiency and speed of the blockchain's execution layer. 

Stańczak said that while Buterin's proposals will “always carry weight,” they are supposed to start conversations and encourage progress in different research areas. The executive said the community can either refine or reject the ideas.

The Ethereum Foundation will shift much of its research to “near-term” goals, including addressing user experience and scaling challenges in upcoming protocol upgrades, Stańczak said. 

Stańczak added that the foundation will concentrate on layer-1 scaling, support for layer-2 scaling, and user experience improvements such as interoperability in the Pectra, Fusaka and Glamsterdam upgrades. 

While the focus shifted to near-term results, the executive said the team is also looking into ways to bring in more long-term projects. 

“Posts from our top researchers help some of them to ship within one or two years through initiatives such as next‑generation execution and consensus layers,” Stańczak said. Cointelegraph contacted the Ethereum Foundation for comment but did not receive a response by publication.

 XRP price chart analysts are noting Wyckoff reaccumulation and falling wedge patterns that are painting a bullish target above $3.50. 

XRP (XRP) has dropped nearly 40% since hitting its multi-year high of $3.40 three months ago. 

Still, its ability to hold above key technical support levels, combined with a potentially market-shifting derivatives listing, has prompted some analysts to maintain a bullish outlook for the months ahead.

From a fundamental perspective, XRP may receive a boost from the anticipated launch of XRP futures contracts on the Coinbase Derivatives platform, scheduled for April 21 under the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) oversight.

This development may inject fresh liquidity and institutional interest into the market, helping catalyze the technical breakouts projected above.

XRP's ongoing consolidation phase resembles a classic Wyckoff reaccumulation pattern, according to technical analyst Charting Guy.

The Wyckoff reaccumulation pattern is a mid-cycle structure that often precedes the next leg of a broader uptrend. It suggests that smart money is absorbing supply during the cooldown, setting the stage for a potential breakout.

XRP established support and began consolidating in late 2024, marking Phases A and B of the Wyckoff reaccumulation pattern. In early April 2025, the price formed a “Spring” followed by a successful “Test,” signaling seller exhaustion.

As of April 21, XRP is attempting to break above the descending “Creek” trendline. 

A breakout would confirm a “Jump Across The Creek” (JATC) and entry into Phase D. If confirmed, XRP could enter Phase E and rally 70% toward $3.55 in the coming weeks, a level aligning with the pattern's Last Point of Support (LPS).

A Fibonacci retracement graph drawn from $3.55-swing-high to $0.14-swing-low presents $5.65 as the upside target for June if XRP price breaks above $3.55.

The upside outlook aligns with XRP's prevailing falling wedge pattern, as spotted by chartist “Jobcfx” on X.

Notably, the bullish reversal structure has been narrowing since February 2025. A breakout above the wedge's upper trendline, currently around the $2.20-2.40 area, would signal the start of a new rally.

Falling wedge breakouts typically target a move equal to the pattern's maximum height. 

In XRP's case, if it breaks above $2.20, the projected upside target for May lands near $4.00, aligning with the Wyckoff reaccumulation's Phase E breakout zone.

Interestingly, Bitcoin (BTC) is also forming a falling wedge pattern on its chart. If confirmed, a bullish breakout in Bitcoin could act as a catalyst for the altcoin market, potentially accelerating XRP's upward momentum as well.

 The SEC under US President Donald Trump announced it would closie its investigation of Uniswap and lawsuit against Consensys in February, roughly a month after the donations. 

New filings from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) reveal that several cryptocurrency firms and their executives made significant contributions to US President Donald Trump's inauguration fund after the results of the 2024 election. 

According to FEC filings made public on April 20 by the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams donated more than $245,000, Solana Labs donated $1 million, and software firm Consensys sent $100,000 in January to support the then-president-elect's inauguration. Many major crypto firms had previously announced their support of Trump through donations to the inaugural fund, including Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Kraken, Ondo Finance, and Robinhood.

Altogether, the fund reported more than $239 million in net donations between Nov. 15 and April 20 from companies and individuals. These included $1 million from McDonald's, $1 million from Meta, $1 million from Apple CEO Tim Cook, $1 million from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and various contributions from Delta Air Lines, ExxonMobil, FedEx, Nvidia, PayPal, Target, and Coca-Cola. 

Since Trump took office on Jan. 20 and appointed Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the agency has dropped multiple investigations and enforcement actions against crypto firms, including those that donated to the president's 2024 campaign or inauguration fund. In February, Uniswap reported that the SEC had dropped its probe into the firm, and Consensys founder Joseph Lubin said the agency had agreed to end a separate lawsuit. 

Trump's memecoin, launched on Jan. 17 on the Solana blockchain — along with his wife Melania's, which was available a few days later — has many in the crypto industry and members of Congress voicing concern over conflicts of interest potentially arising from the president appearing to capitalizing on his position.

Trump's family is also behind the launch of World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm responsible for a US dollar-pegged stablecoin at a time when lawmakers are considering legislation to regulate the technology.

In addition to the Consensys case, the SEC said it intended to drop enforcement actions or investigations into Ripple, Kraken, Robinhood Crypto and Coinbase. The three firms donated a combined $9 million to the inauguration fund.

The 2024 US election cycle saw crypto-backed political action committees (PACs) spending more than $131 million to influence races in crucial congressional districts. The Fairshake PAC has already said it had more than $100 million available, in part from contributions from Coinbase and Ripple, to spend on the 2026 midterms.

Public Health Focuses on Childhood, Magnetic Poles Once Wandered, and Colossal Squid Discovered

This week's news roundup covers measles and whooping cough cases, evidence of a carbon cycle on Mars and the first glimpse at a colossal squid in its natural habitat.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of the latest science news.

First, some public health updates. Measles is continuing to spread in the U.S., with 712 cases confirmed so far in 2025 as of April 11, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For reference, there were just 285 confirmed cases in all of 2024. The CDC has confirmed two deaths from measles this year and is investigating a third.

Last week the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met after its planned meeting in February was postponed. During the meeting last Tuesday a scientist leading the CDC's measles response said the number of measles cases is likely underreported.

But measles isn't the only illness that's increasingly putting kids at risk. Cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, are up more than 1,500 percent nationwide compared with 2021, according to recent reporting by ProPublica. Deaths from whooping cough are also on the rise.

Caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, whooping cough spreads easily between humans. Even people with mild symptoms can pass the microbe along, and the resulting illness can be much worse in vulnerable individuals like babies. While some infants will have cold symptoms, others may develop pneumonia and difficulty breathing.

The best way to prevent the spread of pertussis—and to avoid serious symptoms—is with the DTaP or Tdap vaccine, both of which offer combined protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The CDC recommends that all children get doses of the DTaP vaccine at two months, four months, six months, sometime between 15 and 18 months, and again sometime from age four to six. Kids should then get a Tdap booster from age 11 to 12. The CDC also recommends that people get a Tdap booster while pregnant—ideally between 27 and 36 weeks—to help confer immunity to their newborns. If you're an adult who's never been immunized against pertussis, you can get a Tdap shot at any age. You can also opt to get a Tdap jab when it's time for a tetanus booster in case your immunity against whooping cough has waned.

According to ProPublica, vaccination rates among kindergarten students have fallen for measles, mumps and rubella; pertussis; diphtheria; tetanus; hepatitis B; and polio.

In other public health news a new CDC study published last Tuesday shows a rise in the autism rate in children. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is helmed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., put out a statement about the report that claimed it showed “a persistent rise in [autism spectrum disorder] prevalence [and] an alarming escalation in case severity,” but this contradicts the conclusion of the study's own authors. The report suggests that rates of autism spectrum disorder are likely rising because early detection is improving, especially in groups that previously had less access to diagnostics. Kristin Sohl, who chairs the Autism Subcommittee of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on Children with Disabilities, told CNN that the results of the report were “encouraging.”

Looking back to simpler times, a study published last Wednesday in the journal Science Advances explored how ancient humans survived something called the Laschamp event. This incident about 41,000 years ago was a geomagnetic “excursion,” which is where the Earth's magnetic poles move around. While the North and South poles didn't completely flip, they did kind of wander. The planet's magnetic field was much weaker than usual during this period. According to the authors of the new study, it was running at something like 10 percent of its current strength. Given that Earth's magnetic field helps protect us from cosmic radiation, it's likely that people were exposed to more UV light as a result.

During this time Homo sapiens seem to have started using the naturally occurring pigment ochre more often, according to the study. Ochre has been shown to provide sun protection. The researchers also saw an uptick in humans' use of caves in times and places that solar radiation would have posed more of a threat.

Speaking of cosmic happenings: another study from last week's Science Advances describes a planet with an unprecedented orbit.

The story starts with a pair of rare “failed stars” about 120 light-years away. They're both brown dwarfs, which sit somewhere between gas giants and small stars on the planet-to-star spectrum. Brown dwarfs interest scientists because they seem to form the way stars do, but they don't actually manage the hydrogen fusion that gives stars their light. Back in 2020 this couple made the news because scientists caught one of them eclipsing the other. Eclipsing brown dwarf pairs are really rare, and the passage of one star in front of the other helps scientists make certain observations to calculate their masses.

Now this binary system is proving to be even more rare than we thought: it features a planet that orbits perpendicularly around them, instead of orbiting roughly along the same plane on which the brown dwarfs themselves orbit. That's never been seen in a binary star system before.

Still in space, but much closer to home, scientists have found new evidence that Mars once had a carbon cycle. In a study published last Thursday in Science, researchers report that the Curiosity rover dug up a mineral called siderite when drilling the Gale crater. This mineral is made of iron and carbonate, and it indicates that carbon once moved through the Red Planet's environment similarly to how it does on Earth. That supports the idea that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere that could support liquid water.

And speaking of making a splash, we'll end on a fun note with a very, very tiny colossal squid. The species, which was first discovered a century ago, has never been caught on camera in its natural habitat. Now, using a remote-controlled vessel at 1,968 feet [600 meters] below the surface, scientists have finally spotted a colossal squid in the comfort of its deep-sea home. This one is young, so it's only about a foot [30 centimeters] long. But it could grow to be as long as 23 feet [seven meters] in adulthood and might weigh as much as 1,100 pounds [500 pounds]. You can check out the footage for yourself on our YouTube channel. You'll find a link in our show notes.

That's all for this week's science news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday.

Quantum Randomness Could Create a Spoof-Proof Internet

Quantinuum's 56-bit trapped-ion computer has succeeded in demonstrating randomness in quantum circuits to establish secure, private connections

By Gayoung Lee & Lee Billings 

Quantinuum's vacuum chamber.

Quantinuum

The allure of quantum computers is, at its heart, quite simple: by leveraging counterintuitive quantum effects, they could perform computational feats utterly impossible for any classical computer. But reality is more complex: to date, most claims of quantum “advantage”—an achievement by a quantum computer that a regular machine can't match—have struggled to show they truly exceed classical capabilities. And many of these claims involve contrived tasks of minimal practical use, fueling criticisms that quantum computing is at best overhyped and at worst on a road to nowhere.

Now, however, a team of researchers from JPMorganChase, quantum computing firm Quantinuum, Argonne National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Texas at Austin seems to have shown a genuine advantage that's relevant to real-life issues of online security. The group's results, published recently in Nature, build upon a previous certification protocol—a way to check that random numbers were generated fairly—developed by U.T. Austin computer scientist Scott Aaronson and his former postdoctoral researcher Shih-Han Hung.

Using a Quantinuum-developed quantum computer in tandem with classical, or traditional, supercomputers at Argonne and Oak Ridge, the team demonstrated a technique that achieves what is called certified randomness. This method generates random numbers from a quantum computer that are then verified using classical supercomputers, allowing the now-certified random numbers to be safely used as passkeys for encrypted communications. The technique, the team notes, outputs more randomness than it takes in—a task unachievable by classical computation.

Using the pictured quantum computer model developed by the computing firm Quantinuum, a team of physicists and engineers demonstrated a technique that achieves what is called certified randomness.

Quantinuum

“Theoretically, I think it's interesting because you need to put together a lot of technical tools in order to make the theoretical analysis fly,” says Hung, now an assistant professor of electrical engineering at National Taiwan University. “Random-number generation is a central task for modern cryptography and algorithms. You want the encryption to be secure and for the [passkey] to be truly random.”

When it comes to Internet security, randomness is a weapon—a mathematically impenetrable shield against malicious adversaries who seek to spy on secret communications and manipulate or steal sensitive data. The two-factor authentication routinely used to protect personal online accounts is a good example: A user logs in to a system with a password but then also uses a secure device to receive a string of randomly generated numbers from an external source. By inputting that string, which can't be predicted by adversaries because of its randomness, the user verifies their identity and is granted access.

“Random numbers are used everywhere in our digital lives,” says Henry Yuen, a computer scientist at Columbia University, who was uninvolved with the study. “We use them to secure our digital communications, run randomized controlled trials for medical testing, power computer simulations of cars and airplanes—it's important to ensure that the numbers used for these are indeed randomly generated.”

In more cryptographic applications, on the other hand, it's not enough to just generate random numbers. We need to generate random results that we know for certain are the outcome of an unbiased process. “It's important to be able to prove the randomness to a skeptic who does not trust the device producing the randomness,” says Bill Fefferman, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the new work. Implementing such protocols to check each and every outcome would be “impossible classically,” Fefferman says, but possible with the superior computational potential of quantum devices.

“Quantum computers and quantum technologies offer the only way to reliably generate and test randomness,” Yuen says. Unlike classical computers, which depend on binary “bits” to process information, quantum computers operate on qubits, which can have an infinite number of possible orientations when existing in a superposition state. These qubits allow quantum computers to process exponentially larger loads of data at much faster rates.

Jen Christiansen

The quantum computer involved in the latest demonstration uses 56 such qubits to run the protocol developed by Aaronson and Hung. The gist of the procedure is relatively straightforward. First, the quantum computer is given a complex problem that requires it to generate random outputs, in a process called random circuit sampling. For a small enough quantum computer, usually under 75 qubits, these outputs can be traced on classical computers to ascertain that the results couldn't have been generated classically, explains Christopher Monroe, a quantum computing expert at Duke University, who was not involved in the study.

Verifying this is the next step in the protocol, but it includes an added caveat: time. The quantum computer must generate its outputs faster than they could be mimicked (or “spoofed”) by any known classical computing method. In the team's demonstration, the Quantinuum system took a couple of seconds to produce each output. Two national laboratory supercomputers subsequently verified these outputs, ultimately devoting a total of 18 hours of computing time to generate more than 70,000 certified random bits.

These bits were certified using a test that gives the outcomes something called a cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) score, which checks how “ideal” the randomness of the distributions is. A high XEB score coupled with a short response time would mean that a certain outcome is very unlikely to have been influenced by any interference from untrusted sources. The task of classically simulating all that effort to spoof the system would, according to Aaronson, require the continuous work of at least four comparable supercomputers.

“The outcome of the [certified randomness test] is governed by quantum-mechanical randomness—it's not uniformly random,” Aaronson says. For example, in the case of Quantinuum's 56-qubit computer, 53 out of 56 bits could have a lot of entropy, or randomness, and that would be just fine. “And, in fact, that it's not uniform is very important; it's the deviations from uniformity that allow us to test that in the first place that yes, these samples are good. They really did come from this quantum circuit.”

But the fact that these measurements must be additionally verified with classical computers puts “important limits on the scalability and utility of this protocol,” Fefferman notes. Somewhat ironically, in order to prove that a quantum computer has performed some task correctly, classical supercomputers need to be brought in to pick apart its work. This is an inherent issue for most of the current generation of experiments seeking to prove quantum advantage, he says.

Aaronson is also aware of this limitation. “For exactly the same reason why we believe that these experiments are very hard to spoof using a classical computer, you're playing this very delicate game where you need to be, like, just at the limit of what a classical computer can do,” Aaronson says.

That said, this is still an impressive first step, Fefferman says, and the protocol will be useful for instances such as public lotteries or jury selection, where unbiased fairness is key. “If you want random numbers, that's trivial—just take a Geiger counter and put it next to some radioactive material,” Aaronson says. “Using classical chaos can be fine if you trust the setup, but doesn't provide certification against a dishonest server who just ignores the chaotic system and feeds you the output of a pseudorandom generator instead,” Aaronson adds in a reply to a comment on his blog post about the protocol.

Whether the protocol will truly have practical value will depend on subsequent research—which is generally the case for many “quantum advantage” experiments. “The hype in the field is just insane right now,” Monroe says. “But there's something behind it, I'm convinced. Maybe not today, but I think in the long run, we're going to see these things.”

If anything, the new work is still a formidable advance in terms of quantum hardware, Yuen says. “A few years ago we were thrilled to have a handful of high-quality qubits in a lab. Now Quantinuum has made a quantum processor with 56 qubits.”

“Quantum advantage is not like landing on the moon—it's a negative statement,” Aaronson says. “It's a statement [claiming that] no one can do this using a classical computer. Then classical computing gets to fight back.... The classical hardware keeps improving, and people keep discovering new classical algorithms.”

In that sense, quantum computing may be akin to “a moving target” of sorts, Aaronson says. “We expect that, ultimately, for some problems, this war will be won by the quantum side.But if you want to win the war, you have to do problems where the quantum advantage is a little bit iffier, where it's a little bit more vulnerable.”

Proposed Trump Cuts to NOAA Threaten Hurricane Hunters and Toxic Algal Bloom Monitoring

The Trump administration has proposed gutting NOAA's cooperative institutes, which study everything from improving lifesaving weather forecasts to monitoring fish stocks

CLIMATEWIRE | Researchers in Oklahoma are hard at work on a new lifesaving weather forecasting system. In Michigan, they're keeping tabs on toxic algae blooms. In Florida, they're studying tropical cyclones by flying into the hearts of hurricanes.

These are just a handful of the hundreds of research projects ongoing at NOAA's cooperative institutes, a network of 16 science consortiums involving 80 universities and research institutions across 33 states.

But many CI scientists are worried their work — and their jobs — may soon be on the chopping block.

A new proposal from the White House Office of Management and Budget would dramatically reorganize NOAA and gut most of its climate research programs in fiscal 2026. Part of that plan includes terminating funding for NOAA's cooperative institutes and its 10 laboratories, which are heavily staffed by CI researchers.

The plan, presented last week in an OMB document known as a “passback” memorandum, is technically still hypothetical. While passbacks typically outline the priorities eventually included in the White House's budget proposal each fiscal year, Congress must ultimately approve the president's request.

But even if Congress rejects the cuts that the Trump administration proposes for fiscal 2026, experts worry that funding for the remainder of fiscal 2025 is still in question.

“Once a certain amount of damage is done, it's not recoverable.”  —Waleed Abdalati, director of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)

Congress last month passed a continuing resolution to avert a shutdown and fund the government through the end of the current fiscal year. But the bill provides little guidance for agencies on how exactly they must use their funds.

“The administration can largely move money however it wants within the agency,” said Waleed Abdalati, director of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) housed at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “That's the authority Congress afforded them by not articulating more detail in its agency budgets.”

In theory, some experts say, that means the Trump administration could direct agencies to shuffle their funds in ways that would diminish or eliminate programs previously funded in fiscal 2024.

And the OMB passback suggests exactly that: directing NOAA to align its 2025 spending with the plan laid out in the memo — even though that proposal has not yet been approved by Congress.

“OMB expects that the Department will exercise all allowable authorities and flexibilities to align the 2025 operating plans with the 2026 Passback,” the document states.

There's no indication that NOAA has yet complied. And it's unclear whether this direction would legally sidestep Congress' authority to direct the appropriation of funds.

But if the agency began implementing the passback's plan this year, a broad swath of programs could see their funding suddenly curtailed — including the cooperative institutes.

Meanwhile, some CIs across the country have not yet received any of their 2025 funds. Some are still waiting on some of their 2024 money, due to a variety of payment delays. Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — head of the agency that houses NOAA — is personally reviewing all funding commitments above $100,000.

“The money is very slow in coming, and a number of institutes are at great risk of not having the funding after a couple months from now,” Abdalati said. “If that's the case, we're required to either lay off or furlough people until the money comes.”

Even if Congress restores funding for 2026, cuts and layoffs in the near term would be devastating, he added. Long-term datasets would be disrupted. Many staffers likely would seek new jobs, taking their knowledge and experience with them.

“Once a certain amount of damage is done, it's not recoverable,” Abdalati said.

Meanwhile, CI directors say even short-term interruptions in their research could threaten the safety of the communities they serve.

CIGLR — the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, housed at the University of Michigan — keeps tabs on toxic algae in lakes Erie and Huron, where nearby communities are well acquainted with the dangers. A harmful algal bloom sparked the Toledo water crisis of 2014, in which 400,000 residents in and around the Ohio city had no safe drinking water for two days.

But because of the ongoing funding delays, “we're looking at having to lay off a substantial number of our workers in the next few months,” said CIGLR director Gregory Dick.

And it's possible the institute will have to halt its algal monitoring program. If that's the case, the region may be less equipped to predict and prepare for events such as the Toledo water crisis.

“One of my big fears is that we'll be more vulnerable to such incidents,” Dick said, adding that the program “seems like it's in limbo — it's complete uncertainty.”

The cooperative institutes are one part of NOAA's broader research ecosystem and just one of many proposed cuts across the department.

The passback memo calls for the elimination of NOAA's entire Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), which facilitates a variety of Earth system studies. Alongside the CIs, OAR houses 10 laboratories and a number of other programs including its global ocean observing and monitoring program; its ocean acidification program; and its Sea Grant program, which partners with 34 universities on marine research and education initiatives.

But the CIs play a special role in NOAA science — and in its impact on U.S. communities — experts say.

“The CIs are 50 percent of everything we do in research,” said Craig McLean, NOAA's former top scientist. “They are of equal vitality and importance to the NOAA mission as every NOAA scientist — many of whom have come from the CIs.”

The CIs exist via a particular type of federal funding award known as a cooperative agreement, which operates much like a grant but involves close collaboration with federal employees. Each agreement is awarded on a five-year basis, with the potential to renew for another five years. After that, universities must compete again for a new award.

Still, many cooperative institutes have been around for decades — CIRES, the oldest and largest, was established in 1967. Many involve multiple university partners and employ dozens or hundreds of staff. And many maintain long-standing data collection programs with major impacts on human societies.

CIMAR, for instance — the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research, housed at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa — monitors “basically the entire ecosystem of the tropical Pacific,” said its director, Douglas Luther. That includes everything from the life histories of marine animals to the ocean's rising sea levels.

And CIMERS at Oregon State University — the Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystem and Resources Studies — keeps tabs on everything from salmon stock in the Pacific Northwest to the movement of ships in the remote Arctic Ocean. It's also active in ocean exploration, mapping parts of the seabed where methane reserves or critical minerals may be abundant.

[The cuts represent a] ""complete sabotaging of American weather forecasting. It would totally change the game in terms of our prediction.” —Marc Alessi, a science fellow with the Union of Concerned Scientists

These studies help keep the U.S. competitive with other global science leaders, said CIMERS director Francis Chan.

“There's a new science race going on,” he said. “People are thinking about what are the different ways of using the ocean.”

Other CIs help improve the forecasting tools used by NOAA's own National Weather Service.

Scientists from the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies are key members of NOAA's famed Hurricane Hunter missions, which fly specialized data-collecting aircraft through tropical cyclones.

Meanwhile, scientists at the Cooperative Institute for Severe and High-Impact Weather Research and Operations (CIWRO), are developing products to help meteorologists spot dangerous weather events with more advance warning. One of these is Warn-on-Forecast, an experimental system designed to rapidly incorporate radar and satellite observations into a high-resolution model, producing updated forecasts about every 15 minutes.

And it's showing promise.

As twisters whirled across the central U.S. last month, amid an outbreak that killed dozens in the Southeast and Midwest, Warn-on-Forecast predictions helped accurately predict a storm track in the Missouri Ozarks with about two hours of lead time, according to CIWRO's director, Greg McFarquhar.

The forecast, combined with other data, prompted National Weather Service staff to contact emergency managers on the evening of March 14 and warn them that long-track tornadoes may be forming. NWS followed up shortly afterward with a Special Weather Statement, narrowing down the tornado tracks to nearby Carter and Ripley counties.

When a strong tornado touched down shortly afterward, more than 125 people already had checked in at a nearby Carter County shelter. There were no fatalities reported in the aftermath of the event.

Traditional forecasting tools typically predict tornadoes with an average of only 13 minutes of advance warning, according to NOAA. The extra time afforded by new tools like Warn-on-Forecast “makes a huge difference in terms of people being able to get out of the way of these tornadoes,” McFarquhar said.

With funding delays dragging on and existential cuts looming, scientists say these research projects are all in jeopardy.

Some CI directors told POLITICO's E&E News that their institutes likely would shut down without NOAA funding. Larger institutes like CIRES said they might continue to exist in a diminished form — but the loss of NOAA resources would take a huge toll.

“We wouldn't be as robust,” said Abdalati, the CIRES director. “And honestly it would be, I think, a big loss to the American people — because we do things that matter, that are important.”

Much of the Trump administration's attacks on NOAA research center on climate science. The conservative policy blueprint Project 2025 referred to the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research as the ""source of much of NOAA's climate alarmism” and called for much of its work to be dissolved — a plan reflected in the OMB passback memo.

But CI scientists note their projects delve far beyond climate change research. And many have implications for the economy, national security and competition with countries such as China — priorities the Trump administration has claimed to support.

“I think that's the part that worries me,” said Chan, the CIMERS director. “Are people making decisions because they don't have the full picture of what science is doing? If that's the case, we're open to providing information.”

The cuts proposed in the OMB passback memo have sparked widespread backlash among science advocates.

The American Meteorological Society warned in a statement that eliminating NOAA's research arm would have “unknown — yet almost certainly disastrous — consequences for public safety and economic health.”

The cuts represent a ""complete sabotaging of American weather forecasting,” said Marc Alessi, a science fellow with the nonprofit advocacy organization Union of Concerned Scientists. “It would totally change the game in terms of our prediction.”

Some lawmakers in Congress have raised similar concerns.

Nine Democratic representatives from New Jersey submitted a letter last week to Lutnick decrying the proposed cuts, which they argued would endanger their state and its nearly 1,800 miles of coastline. They expressed particular concern about the proposed elimination of NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. The lab is a leading developer of the atmosphere and ocean models that inform weather forecasts.

“Without their work, Americans will not receive accurate weather or tidal predictions, impacting our safety, economy and national security,” the letter stated.

Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado said in a statement to E&E News that worsening droughts and wildfires across the western United States mean that the ""work our scientists and civil servants do at NOAA is essential to U.S. national security and the personal safety and daily lives of Americans.”

Colorado is the only state to house two cooperative institutes, and it's home to the largest of the CIs.

Despite these kinds of concerns, McLean, the former NOAA top scientist, said the response from Congress hasn't gone far enough. Some CIs — like the extreme weather-focused institute in Oklahoma — are housed in red states, where Republicans in Congress have so far raised few objections to cuts at NOAA.

“On the Republican side, they're cowering behind Trump's voice and they're not raising any alarm,” McLean said. “And they're going to watch many assets and attributes in their states go away.”

Keeping Kids Interested in Science Is a Matter of Language

As children get older, their understanding of science and being a scientist changes. The words adults use are a critical part of keeping them engaged in discovery

One of the most fun parts of being a parent has to be watching children discover the world around them. After all, children are endlessly curious, and part of the fun is seeing the wonder on children's faces as they discover even simple objects and ideas.

“What's that in your hand? Is it—a ball? Do you think it will roll down this hill?” you might say to your toddler, then enjoy the shouts of delight as they explore just that.

This is science in action—making an observation, testing an idea, seeing what happens and then asking the next question.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Yet over time parents can find that their child might be less interested in exploring the world around them, and less likely to explore the underlying “why.” That is, kids seem less interested in science. Why does this happen?

Of course, there are a number of different factors at play, but in the research my colleagues and I have done, what might surprise some folks is that this loss of interest may partly come from subtle language cues children hear. And the language cues don't come from just parents; they can also come via media they consume or in school that treats science as an identity rather than a process. All kids can do science, but over time, they begin to think of being ascientist as something only reserved for certain kinds of kids.

Here's what we've learned, and here are some steps you can take to keep the curiosity alive and the science flowing.

The typical language that many adults use with children might be to say, “Let's be scientists today!” (to promote curiosity) or “You're such a good scientist!” (to praise their child). But this kind of language that focuses on science as an identity, rather than a set of activities and actions that people do, can be demotivating. For example, girls (but not boys) as young as four persisted longer when cued to participate in science activities by saying, “Let's do science” rather than “Let's be scientists.”

The idea here is that when thinking of a scientist, children might be calling to mind a (white) man. So if they don't fit those identities, they might disengage from an activity designed “for scientists.” Relatedly, children might believe that being a scientist requires special intellectual abilities—ones they believe that certain groups like (white) men have, but not others.

These stereotypical beliefs that science is reserved for only certain kinds of people emerges surprisingly early. By first grade, girls say they are less interested in computer science and engineering. Perhaps more on the nose, when asked to draw what a scientist looks like, children tend to draw men, though this has improved over time. Such stereotyping has a cumulative effect, such that by high school, girls who are at the 80th percentile of science ability (an index of standardized test scores and high school STEM GPAs) are equally likely to major in certain STEM majors as boys in the lowest percentile.

The good news is that these subtle linguistic cues can also be harnessed to promote engagement with science in surprisingly potent ways. Cuing science as actions that we do, for example, seems to protect children's interest and motivation to engage with science over time. Even outside of more controlled lab settings, students whose teachers use more action-focused language (e.g., let's do science) persisted longer in a novel science game compared to students whose teachers used more identity-focused language.

So now you are perhaps thinking, “Great, I will just focus on doing science and the actions that make up the scientific process!” And certainly that is likely to be effective even as children transition from childhood to adolescence and into early adulthood. But it's also true that, around adolescence, your kids are actively trying on and ultimately forming different identities for themselves. So while identity-focused language about science might be demotivating for young children, identity-focused language may help teens stay interested in science. For example, cueing a future identity (e.g., scientist, doctor) that is based on science motivated middle schoolers to do more homework, and was associated with higher grades. That might be because if teens think of themselves as scientists, then they are willing to do what it takes to be whom they want to become.

Ultimately parents want their children to enjoy learning, exploring and figuring things out for themselves. Those activities also just happen to be critical pieces of the scientific process. Emphasizing these actions when children are younger might help them persist in hard tasks or lessons. But as children get older, gain experience in these activities and start forming ideas of whom they want to become, emphasizing future identities that are science-dependent might also be helpful in maintaining an interest in science.

How these two versions of subtle language cues might work together (or not) is yet to be tested, but perhaps this is some science to be done by your future scientist.

Elon Musk is sitting on a lot of inventory. 

It's no surprise that we've reported on Tesla's current struggles quite frequently in recent weeks. Things continue to deteriorate, with the Cybertruck being one of the leading causes for concern. Many of you will know that Tesla is sitting on inventory, which isn't ideal—especially when we take into account that most of the inventory is made up of old vehicles. 

For those not in the know, old inventory is particularly problematic in Tesla's case, as these older vehicles are not eligible for the federal tax credit awarded to many who purchase electric vehicles (EVs). Electrek reports that some of the old stock may even include foundation series trucks reserved for early adopters of the Cybertruck. Regardless, Tesla's recent promotions of improved financing options for the vehicle, along with five-figure discounts, point to sales struggles. 

Despite the doom and gloom that seems to be happening behind the scenes at Tesla, it's only reduced its Cybertruck inventory by 100 units in the last month. However, it appears that the brand will be throttling production down further in the near future. Business Insider reports that the Texas Gigafactory is not operating at full capacity anymore, and has pivoted some Cybertruck workers to the Model Y production line.

For context, Elon himself said Giga Texas was capable of churning out 200,000 Cybertrucks annually, with the manpower to up that to 250,000 units if needed. To parse that out a little bit further, 200,000 units per year would mean roughly 16,667 units per month and over 4,000 units a week. So, you might be wondering: how many Cybertrucks has Tesla moved in the first quarter of this year? Forbes reports they've only sold 6,406. Thanks to Tesla's most recent recall notice, we also know that they've sold less than 50,000 trucks altogether.

This curbs any ideas that Tesla's more affordable rear-wheel-drive (RWD) Cybertruck could save the day. We use “affordable” lightly, as it's slated to start at $72,000—that's $10,000 cheaper than the AWD spec—and features considerably fewer amenities.  If you ask us, it seems as if most everyone who wanted Tesla's steel-clad truck has bought one. And it's not looking like current events are bolstering the brand's sales numbers, either.

Many outlets throw around the fact that Tesla took 1 million reservations for the Cybertruck. While that's a nice round figure, it's not rocket science that it doesn't necessarily equate to 1 million orders. A recent Wired article mentioned that, typically, about 2 to 16 percent of reservations transfer into actual vehicle sales. If we assume Cybertruck was at the top of the range, retaining 16 percent of people who made reservations, that would equate to 160,000 sales. Tesla is currently hovering around 50,000 vehicles, which is closer to the 5 percent mark.

The Cybertruck reminds us a lot of the case of Segway. When Dean Kamen unveiled his “Segway Human Transporter” in the early 2000s, the bubbly startup was telling everyone that Segways would transform the way we navigate cities. He was so confident in the device that he claimed it would replace cars for inner-city travel. The initial goal was to move 40,000 units per year, targeting between 50,000 and 1,000 units sold in the first 13 months. Sound familiar? Now, they're merely a fringe mobility solution that you'll occasionally see doing tours of your city. 

We should clarify that the Cybertruck's waning popularity isn't as dire a scenario as it sounds for Tesla and Giga Texas. Yes, there's no getting around the fact that they've spent billions building the Gigafactory down south, but production won't just stop altogether. They'll likely continue to pivot production towards more profitable vehicles like the Model Y.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Think the Secrets of Our Universe Could Be Contained in One Tiny Qubit","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64524905/secret-universe-qubit/","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

“Give me a qubit for long enough and a probe in which to measure it, and I shall extract the geometry of our world.”

Is there a chance that the secrets of our universe are contained in some of its smallest, newest components: the quantum bit, or qubit? In a recent paper exploring the spirit of this question, uploaded to the preprint server arXiv, quantum physicists James Fullwood and Vlatko Vedral suggest that spacetime itself may be a large-scale rendering of tiny quantum changes within time that could be found on these microscopic devices. After all, qubits are simple enough to be one logical bit in a quantum computer, but robust enough to embody quantum mechanics principles like superposition. 

The theory sounds (and is!) far out, but it joins a growing discussion about the nature of spacetime. As quantum and classical physicists continue to search for the union between their separate sets of ideas, we know after nearly 100 years of work that spacetime is more of a shorthand for something we don't understand yet. Cosmologists continue to wind time backward as best they can, but there's much we will never be able to study or verify about where our universe came from—or what it really is or isn't.

“There is a growing consensus in theoretical physics that spacetime is not a primitive notion,” Fullwood and Vedral explain, meaning that the universe is not as intuitive, or apparent, as people have guessed by looking at the sky. Is there an “I think, therefore I am” Descartes moment for the universe?

In their research, the scientists found that a single qubit acting within its phase space (the mathematical set of all the physical states a system can take) over time draws out what is known as a three-dimensional Euclidean space—one which has comparable qualities to the universe overall. The shape created had those same qualities regardless of the qubit's starting position, meaning that the complex waveforms created by a single qubit's behaviors over time and within space did not matter.

Curiously, the scientists say that this setup of one qubit is the only one they can imagine where a specific quantum function called the two-time correlation function matches with a particular measurement of Euclidean geometry. In the world of quantum physics, descriptions of systems are often very abstract, with calculations that can rise into many dimensions. In this case, the qubit's behavior lines up with the way we describe spacetime using regular Euclidean geometry.

To illustrate the theory, Fullwood and Vedral used a ‘toy model' of a one-qubit universe. A toy model is an extremely simplified version, usually to show one or two key mechanics without other variables. The toy qubit universe “serves as a reservoir from which an observer may extract the information necessary for a geometric structure to emerge,” they concluded. “[T]he question remains as to how the metric of spacetime [emphasis theirs] may emerge in such a framework, and more generally, how gravity may enter the picture.”

This paper is intended as a letter, meaning that is a shorter piece meant to appear in a peer reviewed journal with a small page limit. If it's peer reviewed and published, the work could slot into future research and lead to further conclusions about gravity and other missing pieces. Often, the hope is to give colleagues a tool or thought exercise that will shake loose the next step toward a bigger breakthrough—like using a system of two equations to substitute and solve for two variables.

The researchers hint at this themselves with a concluding thought:

“Archimedes is said to have summarized his discovery via the poetic statement ‘Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.' [W]e summarize this Letter with the following statement: ‘Give me a qubit for long enough and a probe in which to measure it, and I shall extract the geometry of our world.'”

Metrics details

Dementia is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Here we tested the effectiveness of blood pressure (BP) reduction on the risk of all-cause dementia among 33,995 individuals aged ≥40 years with uncontrolled hypertension in rural China. We randomly assigned 163 villages to a non-physician community healthcare provider-led intervention and 163 villages to usual care. In the intervention group, trained non-physician community healthcare providers initiated and titrated antihypertensive medications according to a simple stepped-care protocol to achieve a systolic BP goal of <130 mm Hg and a diastolic BP goal of <80 mm Hg, with supervision from primary care physicians. Over 48 months, the net reduction in systolic BP was 22.0 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) 20.6 to 23.4; P < 0.0001) and that in diastolic BP was 9.3 mm Hg (95% CI 8.7 to 10.0; P < 0.0001) in the intervention group compared to usual care. The primary outcome of all-cause dementia was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the usual care group (risk ratio: 0.85; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95; P = 0.0035). Additionally, serious adverse events occurred less frequently in the intervention group (risk ratio: 0.94; 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98; P = 0.0006). This cluster-randomized trial indicates that intensive BP reduction is effective in lowering the risk of all-cause dementia in patients with hypertension. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03527719.

Metrics details

Nutrient stress represents an important barrier for anti-tumour immunity, and tumour interstitial fluid often contains metabolites that hinder immune function. However, it is difficult to isolate the effects of tumour nutrient stress from other suppressive factors. Thus, we used a chemically defined cell culture medium based on the metabolomic profile of tumour interstitial fluid: tumour interstitial fluid medium (TIFM). Culture of CD8+ T cells in TIFM limited cell expansion and impaired CD8+ T cell effector functions upon restimulation, suggesting that tumour nutrient stress alone is sufficient to drive T cell dysfunction. We identified phosphoethanolamine (pEtn), a phospholipid intermediate, as a driver of T cell dysfunction. pEtn dampened T cell receptor signalling by depleting T cells of diacylglycerol required for T cell receptor signal transduction. The reduction of pEtn accumulation in tumours improved intratumoural T cell function and tumour control, suggesting that pEtn accumulation plays a dominant role in immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment.

Metrics details

Single-cell CRISPR screens such as Perturb-seq enable transcriptomic profiling of genetic perturbations at scale. However, the data produced by these screens are noisy, and many effects may go undetected. Here we introduce transcriptome-wide analysis of differential expression (TRADE)—a statistical model for the distribution of true differential expression effects that accounts for estimation error appropriately. TRADE estimates the ‘transcriptome-wide impact', which quantifies the total effect of a perturbation across the transcriptome. Analyzing several large Perturb-seq datasets, we show that many transcriptional effects remain undetected in standard analyses but emerge in aggregate using TRADE. A typical gene perturbation affects an estimated 45 genes, whereas a typical essential gene affects over 500. We find moderate consistency of perturbation effects across cell types, identify perturbations where transcriptional responses vary qualitatively across dosage levels and clarify the relationship between genetic and transcriptomic correlations across neuropsychiatric disorders.

Metrics details

Cytosine base editors (CBEs) show promise for multiplex gene knockout applications, but impure edits, indels and off-targets still frequently occur. We describe here QBEmax, which exhibits high efficiency, low indel and off-targets and high product purity with up to 99.8% of edits comprised of C-to-T. Through molecular dynamic modeling, QBEmax presents as a compact and stable base editor that shields protected bases from undesired repair processes.

The two most common classes of base editors are modular fusion proteins comprised of a deaminase and DNA-binding protein to perform targeted and precise C·G-to-T·A (cytosine base editors (CBEs)) or A·T-to-G·C (adenine base editors (ABEs)) base conversions with high efficiency1,2. In addition to the use of base editors to correct disease-causing genetic mutations, base editors have shown promise as an alternative to nucleases for multiplex gene knockout applications. CBEs can precisely edit arginine, glutamine or tryptophan codons to generate premature stop codons; because this process does not undergo the formation of DNA double-strand breaks, base editing for multiplex gene knockouts minimizes the risk of genomic translocations, cell toxicity and DNA chromothripsis3,4. However, unintended indels and impure base editing byproducts (for example, C-to-G and C-to-A) are still frequently observed when using CBEs. The formation of impure edits could be detrimental and act as a missense mutation in a gene otherwise targeted for knockout. In this regard, an ideal CBE for gene knockout should exhibit properties such as high efficiency, low indel formation, low off-target edits, an expanded editing window to reach more potential bases and, importantly, high product purity for safety purposes.

Because canonical base editors are comprised of different proteins fused together end-to-end, each protein's orientation may not be best to balance catalytic processes including nontarget strand association/dissociation by the deaminase, target base deamination, base protection/exposure and, ultimately, endogenous cellular DNA repair enzymes. Previous engineering studies have demonstrated that either the use of an inlaid deaminase domain or a circularly permuted Cas protein could affect the on-target or off-target editing efficiencies, product purity or editing windows of base editors5,6,7,8,9. However, the combination of these parameters has not been optimized using any one approach. To obtain a more ideal base editor, we hypothesized that we could treat the deaminase and Cas9 protein together as one complex comprised of different domains. Therefore, by shuffling the orientation of domains from both the deaminase and Cas9 together, which combines concepts of circularly permuted proteins and inlaid deaminases, we hoped to identify a CBE that maximizes the beneficial properties of using CBEs for gene knockout.

We first designed four base editor orientations in which a deaminase was internally embedded within a circularly permuted Cas9(D10A) protein10 (Fig. 1a) based on Cas9 positions previously found to be amenable for circular permutation or for inlaying a small peptide10,11. These architectures are hereby designated as Q base editors (QBE1 to QBE4) to reflect the reconstitution process of circularizing domains from the Cas9 protein and inserting a deaminase internally to generate a new start codon (circle with an internal cut resembling the letter ‘Q'). To characterize the properties of different QBE architectures, six different cytidine deaminases (rAPOBEC1 (ref. 1), hA3A, mini-Sdd3, mini-Sdd6, Sdd7 and mini-Sdd9 (ref. 12)) were evaluated.

Plasmids encoding corresponding CBEs were transfected in HEK293T cells and compared with the canonical BE4max architecture13 at two endogenous genomic sites. Deep sequencing revealed that QBE3-based editors showed comparable or higher editing frequencies for four of the six deaminases evaluated; in contrast, QBE1-based, QBE2-based and QBE4-based editors exhibited lower editing frequencies (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). Compared to the BE4max counterparts, the QBE3-based editors showed substantially lower indels, with an average indel reduction of 60.4% for site 1 and 62.6% for site 3 (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). We next measured the edit-to-indel ratios and found that six of the seven editors at site 1, and five of the seven editors at site 3 showed substantially higher edit/indel ratios (Supplementary Fig. 1e,f). We then analyzed the editing window and product purities of QBE editors. We observed higher editing efficiencies at PAM-proximal Cs for QBE3 editors and greatly improved product purities compared to BE4max editors (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). Based on these, we hereby refer to QBE3 as QBEmax (Fig. 1a).

From initial evaluations, we found that mini-Sdd9-based QBE editors exhibited superior editing properties in terms of editing activity, indel formation and product purity. Using mini-Sdd9, we designed seven additional QBEs (QBE5–QBE11; Supplementary Fig. 3a). We found that only one editor, QBE6 demonstrated similar performance to QBEmax in terms of editing efficiency and purity; however, its editing window appeared narrow, so we hereby designate it as QBEn (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). Because of mini-Sdd9-QBEmax's overall superior performance and relatively wide editing window, which is desired for expanding the targeting scope of gene knockout applications with base editors, we selected it for further study.

It was reported that fusing the deaminase to the N terminus of a circularly permuted Cas9 (referred to as CP-BE)5 could broaden the editing window, and inlaying the deaminase within the Cas9 protein (referred to as inlaid-BE)6,7,8,9 could affect the editing efficiency or off-target efficiency. We next compared mini-Sdd9-QBEmax with CP-BEs and inlaid-BEs with Cas9 permutation or deaminases inlaid at positions used in the QBE1–QBE11 editors. We found that all CP-BEs and inlaid-BEs induced more impure products than QBEmax. Notably, QBEmax (which uses positions 1,031 and 1,244 for modular assembly) outperforms individual CP-1031 and inlaid-1244 CBEs when comparing the combination of editing frequencies, indel formation and product purities (Extended Data Fig. 1), suggesting that the modularly designed QBEmax architecture enhances desired properties from each functional domain.

To further profile editing properties of mini-Sdd9-QBEmax, we compared mini-Sdd9-QBEmax with mini-Sdd9-BE4max across 17 endogenous genomic sites in HEK293T cells. We found that, in contrast to mini-Sdd9-BE4max, which biases editing at the PAM-distal region, mini-Sdd9-QBEmax showed a wider editing window as far as C16 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 4). Aggregate analyses revealed a ‘forward-shifted' and wider editing window for mini-Sdd9-QBEmax with target Cs between 4 and 14 being favored (Fig. 1c). We used AlphaFold3 (ref. 14) to predict a mini-Sdd9-QBEmax–sgRNA–target DNA ternary structure and compared it with that of the corresponding BE4max architecture (Fig. 1d). We found that these structures revealed the deaminase in mini-Sdd9-QBEmax being more closely associated to PAM-proximal Cs, while in BE4max, more closely associated to PAM-distal Cs, which is consistent with experimental results from genomic edits.

The average editing frequencies across 17 genomic sites for mini-Sdd9-QBEmax and mini-Sdd9-BE4max were 52.4 ± 2.4% and 54.5 ± 2.2%, respectively (Fig. 1e). Mini-Sdd9-QBEmax induced lower indels at 16 of 17 sites tested, with average indel frequencies decreasing by 56.5% from 2.8 ± 0.3% to 1.2 ± 0.2% (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 4), which also substantially increases average edit-to-indel ratios (Fig. 1g). We next evaluated cytosine base editing product purities, which is calculated as the proportion of ‘C' edited to ‘T' as opposed to ‘G' or ‘A', for each position within the protospacer and aggregated all sites together. Importantly, mini-Sdd9-QBEmax exhibited superior product purities (99.4% ± 0.4%) at all positions within a C1–C16 editing window compared to that of mini-Sdd9-BE4max (95.5% ± 2.8%; Fig. 1b,h and Supplementary Fig. 4). To test the versatility of the QBEmax, we evaluated mini-Sdd9-QBEmax in additional mammalian cell lines, including A549, HeLa and HCT116. QBEmax exhibited higher or comparable editing efficiencies, improved product purities and decreased indels in all cell lines tested (Extended Data Fig. 2). These results highlight QBEmax in achieving efficient and precise base edits at a flexible editing window with minimal indel and byproducts.

Chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T) therapy has demonstrated success as a cancer immunotherapy for hematological malignancies. Many clinical trials and research studies have found that multiplex knockout of genes related to immune rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) would further benefit CAR-T therapy in terms of both durability and potency. Encouraged by the performance of mini-Sdd9-QBEmax, we next sought to perform multiplex gene knockout to simultaneously edit genes that could compromise the efficacy of CAR-Ts. Five genes, PD-1 (ref. 15), CISH16, Fas17, TGFBR2 (truncating off the endodomain)18,19,20 and TRAC21, were selected, which all previously demonstrated potential in improving CAR-T performance when knocked out or downregulated.

We first identified all possible SpCas9 protospacers with an NGG PAM and target C located within codons encoding tryptophan (W), arginine (R) or glutamine (Q), so that a cytosine base edit would generate a stop codon (TAA, TAG or TGA). We obtained 46, 21, 16, 30 and 4 protospacers for PD-1, CISH, Fas, TGFBR2 and TRAC, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). We next filtered for potential off-target sites (mismatches ≤ 3) and ultimately selected 16 targets for PD-1, 9 for CISH, 10 for Fas, 10 for TGFBR2 and 3 for TRAC. Lastly, we included one additional target for CISH, PD-1 and TRAC, which disrupts a splice site to perform gene knockout as reported previously21,22 (Fig. 2a).

Light blue boxes indicate exons of genes, and short red lines represent the position of selected protospacers. b–d, Average editing frequencies of desired editing efficiencies (b), indels (c) and ratio of base edits to indels (d) induced by mini-Sdd9-BE4max and mini-Sdd9-QBEmax editors for PD-1 (n = 17), CISH (n = 10), Fas (n = 10), TGFBR2 (n = 10) and TRAC (n = 4) genes; each dot represents the mean for three independent biological replicates for a specified target site and the violin plot shows base editing frequency distribution with medians and quartiles. e, Percent of edited reads with C-to-T or C-to-R conversions at target genes indicated with values and error bars representing the means and s.e.m. for three independent biological replicates across all target sites for PD-1 (n = 17), CISH (n = 10), Fas (n = 10), TGFBR2 (n = 10) and TRAC (n = 4) genes; significances are indicated between BE4max and QBEmax by exact P value using two-tailed Student's t-test. f, Schematic representations of potential editing outcomes induced by C-to-T, C-to-G and C-to-A conversions of tryptophan (W), arginine (R) and glutamine (Q). g–i, Desired editing efficiencies (g), indels (h) and percent of edited reads with C-to-T or C-to-R conversions at target genes indicated (i) induced by mini-Sdd9-BE4max and mini-Sdd9-QBEmax editors during multiplexed base editing of five genes; values and error bars represent the means and s.e.m., respectively, for four independent biological replicates. j, Single-cell colony analysis of multiplex base editing distributions in unsorted and sorted cell populations. k, Schematic representation of the experimental design for the R-loop assay. l, Frequencies of C-to-T conversions at the dSaCas9-induced R-loop sites; values and error bars represent the means and s.e.m. for four independent biological replicates. m, Number of C-to-U RNA variants induced by the editors indicated; values and error bars represent the means and s.e.m. for two (Cas9(D10A)) or four (BE4max and QBEmax) independent biological replicates, significances are indicated by exact P value using one-way ANOVA Tukey's multiple comparisons.

HEK293T cells were transfected with mini-Sdd9-BE4max or mini-Sdd9-QBEmax together with each sgRNA plasmid. We then analyzed desired editing efficiencies (calculated as percent C-to-T for stop codon creation), indel frequencies, desired edit-to-indel ratios and product purities. We found that mini-Sdd9-QBEmax achieved comparable or slightly higher average desired editing at the target base for all sites aggregated for each of the five genes (Fig. 2b). Average indel frequencies for all sites aggregated decreased by 76%, 75%, 59% and 71% for PD-1, CISH, Fas and TGFBR2, respectively (Fig. 2c). The average indel frequency at TRAC was 0.8 ± 0.15% for mini-Sdd9-BE4max and 1.0 ± 0.34% for mini-Sdd9-QBEmax due to one outlier at TRAC-site 3 whereby mini-Sdd9-BE4max and mini-Sdd9-QBEmax exhibited 1.4 ± 0.18% and 2.9 ± 0.22%, respectively. Cumulatively, the desired edit-to-indel ratios induced by mini-Sdd9-QBEmax were 3.26, 3.99, 2.02, 9.91 or 1.99-fold higher than that of mini-Sdd9-BE4max (Fig. 2d). Importantly, average product purities at the target cytosine base for stop codon creation by mini-Sdd9-QBEmax and mini-Sdd9-BE4max were 99.7% versus 95.7% for PD-1, 99.7% versus 97.7% for CISH, 99.7% versus 96.5% for Fas, 99.8% versus 98.0% for TGFBR2 and 99.5% versus 95.8% for TRAC (Fig. 2e). This increase in product purity minimizes the formation of missense mutations from imprecise C-to-G or C-to-A edits (Fig. 2f). When analyzed individually, mini-Sdd9-QBEmax induced lower indels at 47 of the 51 target sites and higher product purities at 45 of the 51 target sites (Extended Data Figs. 3–7).

For each gene, we identified one ideal guide and next edited PD-1, CISH, Fas, TGFBR2 and TRAC simultaneously for multiplex gene knockout. We transformed plasmids for each of the five sgRNAs together with QBEmax or BE4max editors into HEK293T cells. We observed that mini-Sdd9-QBEmax exhibited comparable or higher editing compared to mini-Sdd9-BE4max across all five sites in HEK293T cells in the absence of any selection pressure (Fig. 2g). Notably, mini-Sdd9-QBEmax achieved lower indel formations (Fig. 2h) and exhibited superior product purity (Fig. 2i) at all five genes. To validate that all five base edits occurred in a single cell, we sequenced 48 and 112 QBEmax-transfected single-cell colonies arising from unsorted or sorted cell populations, respectively. We found that 21 (43.8%) and 100 (89.3%) cell colonies exhibited all five genes edited, respectively, demonstrating successful multiplex base editing by QBEmax in a single cell (Fig. 2j). To further evaluate the potential of QBEmax, we co-electroporated QBEmax and all five sgRNA plasmids into an immortal Jurkat T cell line. In these T cells, QBEmax also exhibited superior editing efficiencies, improved product purities and decreased indels, which is similar to its performance in HEK293T cells and further supports the versatility of QBEmax for safe and robust base editing in clinical applications (Extended Data Fig. 8).

Because DNA off-targets are a major concern for base editing therapeutic applications, we next evaluated Cas-independent DNA off-target effects of mini-Sdd9-QBEmax using the orthogonal R-loop assay23,24,25. We cotransfected a dead-SaCas9 (dSaCas9) and sgRNA to induce the formation of an orthogonal R-loop simultaneously with the multiplexed gene knockout strategy (Fig. 2k). We evaluated five orthogonal sites and deep sequencing at each orthogonal R-loop showed that mini-Sdd9-QBEmax induced lower Cas-independent off-target editing at all five R-loop sites compared to that of mini-Sdd9-BE4max (Fig. 2l). We next evaluated the RNA off-target effects of mini-Sdd9-QBEmax. We conducted whole transcriptome sequencing and analyzed the number of C-to-U variants in QBEmax, BE4max and nCas9 (D10A) treated samples together with a sgRNA plasmid targeting CISH. We found that QBEmax induced substantially lower RNA off-target edits on transcriptome-wide RNA transcripts compared to that of the BE4max without compromising DNA on-target editing (Fig. 2m and Supplementary Fig. 5). The robust desired editing efficiencies, minimized indels, high product purities and decreased DNA and RNA off-target effects portray QBEmax as an ideal base editor for multiplex gene knockout applications.

We next sought to probe the molecular basis by which mini-Sdd9-QBEmax embodies its desired properties. We performed molecular dynamic (MD) simulation analyses based on the AlphaFold3-predicted ternary structures of mini-Sdd9-QBEmax or BE4max with a sgRNA and target DNA (Fig. 1d). With these models, all-atom MD simulations of approximately 300 ns were performed (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). We first investigated the conformational stability of these two systems by projecting their free energy landscapes onto corresponding root mean square deviation (RMSD) and radius of gyration (Rg) components. We found that both the RMSD and Rg of mini-Sdd9-QBEmax were lower than that of mini-Sdd9-BE4max, and only one single stable energy state was observed (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 6b). This suggests that the QBEmax architecture better treats the deaminase and Cas protein as one complex so that each domain is oriented compactly within itself. At the minimum energy state, while the deaminase was predicted to be associated with the nontarget strand in both systems (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d), the RMSD of mini-Sdd9-QBEmax system was lower throughout the 300 ns MD process (Supplementary Fig. 6b). When analyzing individual amino acids, we observed that the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the linkers connecting the deaminase to the Cas protein were lower in the QBEmax system (Fig. 3c,d) compared to the BE4max architecture. We speculate a more compact QBEmax architecture that limits the deaminase from sporadically swinging in space, thereby contributing to lower Cas-independent DNA off-target editing, lower indel formation and higher product purity.

During cytosine base editing, intermediate uracil cleavage by endogenous uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) drives the formation of indels and imprecise C-to-G or C-to-A edits1,26. We envisioned that an ideal base editor adopts a compact and protective conformation for the exposed R-loop so that the intermediate uracil base is not excised before cellular mismatch repair resolving a permanent C-to-T conversion. To evaluate R-loop exposure, we performed solvent accessibility analyses using a 1.0 nm probe and found that the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) was increased for C3 and substantially increased for C7 and C8 in the mini-Sdd9-BE4max compared to the mini-Sdd9-QBEmax architectures (Fig. 3e,f), suggesting that these residues are accessible by UNG and ultimately form indels and byproducts. We also speculated that the distance of the UGI to the ssDNA target bases may affect product purity. We evaluated the position and distance of the two UGI domains to the ssDNA target bases in the QBEmax, BE4max or individual CP-1031 and inlaid-1244 CBEs based on molecular dynamic modeling data. We observed that indeed both UGI domains in QBEmax exhibited a relatively shorter distance to the target bases in the ssDNA R-loop region, which suggests an inverse relationship between UGI positioning to product purities and indel formation, as others previously have also identified5 (Supplementary Fig. 6e).

Based on these results, we propose a model for QBEmax base editing. In cytosine base editing using a canonical BE4max architecture, indel formation and impure C-to-G or C-to-A base edits arise from uracil excision and abasic site formation. Because QBEmax exhibits a more compact architecture, limits deaminase swinging and shields the Cas9-induced R-loop, base editing intermediates are protected from cellular UNG excision before Cas9 detaching from the target DNA and subsequent mismatch repair. Therefore, a protective and compact base editor conformation reduces unintended effects driven by DNA repair processes and further promotes desired base editing events (Extended Data Fig. 9).

Taken together, we designed and identified a base editor architecture, QBEmax, which achieves high efficiency on-target editing while decreasing low indel formation, exhibits high edit product purities and minimizes DNA off-targets. The development of QBEmax serves as a promising base editor architecture for developing more efficient and precise base edits toward the use of base editing in multiplex therapeutic applications such as CAR-T immunotherapies. The efficient delivery of QBEmax in vivo will further expand on its use and analysis of desired base editing properties. Advances in protein prediction and MD further help shed light on the molecular basis of genome editors and would greatly aid in future developments of new editing technologies.

The construct fragments were PCR amplified using 2× Phanta Max Master Mix (Vazyme Biotech) and 2× KOD one Master Mix (TOYOBO Life Sciences) and cloned into the pCMV24 backbone, using Uniclone One Step Seamless Cloning Kit (Genesand). Plasmids for HEK293T cell line transfection were extracted and purified using EndoFree Plasmid Kits (Qiangen) or FastPure EndoFree Plasmid Mini Kit DC203 (Vazyme Biotech). The amino acid sequences of the representative vectors used are provided in the Supplementary Note. Primers used for amplicon sequencing were synthesized by the Beijing Genomics Institute and are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

HEK293T, A549, HeLa and HCT116 cells are cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Gibco) and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco); Jurkat, Clone E6-1 cells are cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI, Gibco) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Gibco) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All the cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination with a mycoplasma detection kit (TransGen Biotech). For HEK293T cells transfection, 6 × 104 cells per well were seeded into 48-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates (Corning) in the absence of antibiotic. After 16–24 h, plasmids were transfected into the cells; for single target base editing, cells were transfected with 1 μl jetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus), 375 ng editor plus 125 ng sgRNA plasmids per well, for simultaneous editing of the five CAR-T relevant genes and the R-loop assays, 200 ng of editor plasmid and 66 ng of sgRNA plasmid for each gene was transfected, together with 200 ng of dSaCas9 plasmid and 66 ng of an orthogonal R-loop inducing sgRNA plasmid, at a 60–80% cell confluency. Cells were washed with PBS and followed by DNA extraction 72 h after transfection. To isolate single-cell colonies, transfected cells with or without sorting were diluted and plated into 96-well plates at a density of 0.9 cells per well. The cell colonies were cultured for 2 to 3 weeks and then transferred into 48-well plates to grow for another 5 days before cell lysis, DNA extraction and sequencing of all five targeted genomic loci. Effective editing in a single-cell colony for any individual gene is benchmarked as having an editing efficiency surpassing 50% at the targeted base when analyzed by CRISPResso2 (ref. 27). For the sorted cell population, sgRNA plasmids and a mini-Sdd9-QBEmax-P2A-mScarlet plasmid were transfected and the top 5% of mScarlet-positive cells were collected and diluted into single-cell colonies. For A549, HeLa and HCT116 cells, 5 × 104, 2 × 105 or 4 × 105 cells were seeded into 12-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates (Corning), respectively, in the absence of antibiotic. After 16–24 h, 375 ng of mini-Sdd9-BE4max-P2A-mScarlet or mini-Sdd9-QBEmax-P2A-mScarlet plasmids were transfected into cells together with 125 ng sgRNA plasmid while using 2 μl of jetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus). After 48 h, cells were resuspended for fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For Jurkat cells, 1,000 ng of mini-Sdd9-BE4max-P2A-mScarlet or mini-Sdd9-QBEmax-P2A-mScarlet editor plasmids and 250 ng of sgRNA plasmid for each of the five genes were cotransfected into 4 × 105 cells using Entranster-E (Engreen Biosystem) and the 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza Biosciences) with program DS167. mScarlet-positive cells were collected for DNA extraction.

Cells were collected and resuspended in a culture medium supplemented with 2% FBS in a 0.5 ml volume. Cells were sorted on a FACSAria III (BD Biosciences) cytometer after gating for the singlet-cell population by the mScarlet signal. For RNA off-target analysis, both the fluorescence-positive and negative cells were collected for further paired analysis. A representative flow cytometry gating strategy can be found in Supplementary Fig. 7.

Genomic DNA extraction was performed by the addition of 100 μl freshly prepared lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH8.0), 0.05% SDS and 25 μg ml−1 proteinase K (Thermo Fisher Scientific) directly into the 48-well culture plate after cells were washed once with 1× Dulbecco's PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and then treated at 80 °C in the thermocycler for 20 min.

To profile the transcriptome-wide RNA off-target effects of the QBEmax and BE4max, 2 × 105 HEK293T cells were seeded into 12-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates (Corning) in the absence of antibiotics. After 24 h, 750 ng of mini-Sdd9-BE4max-P2A-mScarlet, mini-Sdd9-QBEmax-P2A-mScarlet or Cas9(D10A)-P2A-mScarlet plasmids were transfected into cells together with 250 ng sgRNA plasmid targeting the CISH-site 1 using 2 μl of jetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus). After 48 h, cells were collected for cell sorting. For each treatment, both the mScarlet-positive and negative cells were collected for paired analyses. RNA samples were sequenced using an MGI T7 (2 × 150 PE) platform at the JMDNA, at a depth of ~45 million reads per sample. Raw reads were cleaned by fastp28. The reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hg38) by Hisat2 (ref. 29) software (version 2.2.1). After removing duplication, variants were identified using strelka30 (version 2.9.10). Finally, C-to-U edits in the transcribed strand were considered for downstream analyses.

Two rounds of PCR were used to amplify a DNA fragment spanning the target site. In the first round PCR, the target region was amplified from genomic DNA with site-specific primers using the DNA template. In the second round, both forward and reverse barcodes were added to the ends of the PCR products for library construction. Equal amounts of PCR product were pooled and purified with a FastPure Gel DNA Extraction Mini Kit (Vazyme Biotech. Inc.) and quantified with a Qubit 4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The purified products were sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform or the BGI G99 platform, and the sequences around the target regions were examined to analyze the editing outcomes. Sequences of the NGS primers and the corresponding amplicons are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Analysis of the base editing outcomes was performed as described previously31.

Initial protein structure models of mini-Sdd9-BE4max and mini-Sdd9-QBEmax ternary complex were predicted using AlphaFold3 (ref. 14), with the optimal model_0 selected as the starting structure for MD simulations. MD simulations were conducted using GROMACS32 (version 2023.1, CUDA) with the Amber99BSC1 force field and the TIP3P water model33,34. In each simulation system, the complex was positioned at the center of a cubic box with a distance of 15 Å maintained between the surface and the edges of the box. Na⁺ and Cl− ions were added to the system to achieve charge neutrality with an ion concentration set at 0.15 M. During the simulation, the particle mesh Ewald method35 was employed to calculate electrostatic interactions and a cut-off distance of 14 Å was used for analysis of short-range electrostatic and van der Waals forces. The LINCS algorithm36 was applied to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms, and periodic boundary conditions were specified in all three dimensions. To optimize the system, energy minimization was performed using the steepest descent method, continuing until a maximum of 2,500 steps was reached or the maximum force <1,000 kJ mol−1 nm−1. Next, 100 ps of NVT equilibration and 100 ps of NPT equilibration were conducted. During the equilibration process, the V-rescale temperature and Parrinell–Rahman pressure coupling methods were employed, with the system's temperature and pressure set to 310 K and 1.0 bar, respectively. After system equilibration, a 300 ns MD simulation was performed.

RMSD and RMSF data were generated using the gmx rmsd and gmx rmsf commands in GROMACS. The SASA data were obtained through the gmx sasa command, with a probe diameter of 1.0 nm, and snapshots of the SASA state were collected every 1 ns within the stable region. All data were statistically analyzed and visualized using R packages ggplot2 (3.5.1) and tidyverse (2.0.0). The free energy landscape data were generated using the gmx sham command with the parameter -tsham set to 310 K. The data were plotted along the two projection components of RMSD and Rg. Visualization of this data was performed using the matplotlib (3.8.2) package in Python37.

GraphPad Prism 9 software was used to analyze the data. All numerical values are presented as means ± s.e.m. Significant differences between controls and treatments were tested using the Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA Tukey's multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and P < 0.01 was considered statistically extremely significant.

The satellite, Aryabhata, provided a huge boost to India's space programme.Credit: NASA/Alamy

In the early hours of 19 April 1975, the mood at the Soviet military launch site of Kapustin Yar — a space test facility north of the Caspian Sea — was heavy with anticipation. Scientists and engineers moved with brisk deliberation, the pre-launch silence was punctuated only by the rustle of paper, the clicking of relays and the careful exchange of words in thick Russian and Indian accents.

The Indian engineers, most of whom were less than 35 years old, had arrived at this remote enclave in what is now southern Russia to hurl their nation's first satellite, named Aryabhata after an ancient Indian astronomer, into space, with the help of a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle. The relatively light satellite — a 358-kilogram payload packed with scientific instruments — had been flown halfway across the continent in a custom-built shockproof container padded with helical springs, designed to shield it from any forces it wouldn't be able to endure.

When Aryabhata arrived at the Kapustin Yar cosmodrome, its constituent parts — bottom shell, instrumentation deck and top shell — were reassembled and carefully inspected. Soviet scientists meticulously checked the satellite's shock resistance, thermal cycles and vibration. To their surprise, it passed the tests with flying colours.

At the time, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was still a young agency with limited experience. For many of the 200-odd scientists and engineers at what was then the ISRO Satellite Centre in Bengaluru, India, the moment marked their first real encounter with orbital space flight. Although they had previously worked on sounding rockets and small collaborative projects, nothing matched the scale or importance of this mission. The modest polyhedral satellite was about to redefine what a low-income country could accomplish.

When the Kosmos-3M rocket roared to life, it carried not just circuitry but also the dreams of a nation not even 30 years free from colonial rule. The launch was a success. As Aryabhata hurtled through layers of piercing cold Soviet air, a space programme destined to become the envy of the world, for its ability to operate on a shoestring budget was quietly born.

Fifty years on, ISRO provides launch services to other low- and middle-income countries, nurturing the space ambitions of many African and Latin American nations. With private for-profit enterprises increasingly dominating the space industry, Aryabhata's legacy offers a valuable counterpoint.

India's space programme showcases the value of public investment in science. The nation's space-related technology has contributed to the development of ultralightweight artificial limbs, health-care devices and water-purification systems, for instance. Perhaps Aryabhata's more immeasurable impact, however, is the boost it has given to national confidence — inspiring a generation of scientists and engineers. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Aryabhata did not just orbit Earth, it orbited India's imagination.

Aryabhata was never meant to dazzle as a payload. Its purpose was humble but profound: to provide hands-on experience in designing, building and operating a spacecraft to a team of young Indian scientists. Its solar panels were modest, its instruments sparse and its spin-stabilization system rudimentary. Yet, all of the spacecraft's components, from its telemetry boards to its thermal insulation, were made in India.

The decision to go low-tech was intentional. U. R. Rao, the project's director, had convinced ISRO's leadership that developing operational communications and remote-sensing satellites was impossible without building experimental ones first. The mission served as an orbital classroom. Its main purpose: training a new generation of space technologists and validating home-grown hardware.

The name of the satellite — Aryabhata — was chosen deliberately. During the initial days of the project, it was called ISRO Satellite-1, or IS-1, internally. The idea to rebrand the spacecraft emerged when then-ISRO chair Satish Dhawan sought then-prime minister Indira Gandhi's input, because the satellite neared completion and its public launch was imminent. Both ISRO and the government wanted a name that embodied India's national pride and cultural heritage.

Gandhi saw scientific modernity as an extension of India's civilizational legacy. After careful consideration, she proposed naming the satellite after the fifth-century mathematician-astronomer Aryabhata, whose pioneering contributions included postulating that Earth rotates on its axis, calculating the value of π to a remarkable precision and laying the foundations of algebra.

The name carried deep symbolism, reaffirming India's rich history of scientific enquiry and linking ancient intellectual achievements to modern technological progress. Politically, it also provided an alternative narrative to the cold war-era space race between the United States and the Soviet Union by reinforcing India's unaligned stance. The country was not following global trends, it was merely reclaiming its own long-standing intellectual prowess.

With symbolism deeply woven into the project, success was crucial. That's why, when Aryabhata started tumbling soon after reaching orbit, the engineers who had clustered around consoles at what was then the Sriharikota Range ground station in India held their breath.

The issue was traced to a faulty valve relay that failed to initiate the satellite's spin, which was crucial for orbital stability. Engineers on the ground sent a correction command and, over four tense days, Aryabhata gathered data on X-ray sources and ionospheric electrons.

By day five of the mission, another snag was detected. A 9-volt power bus, which powered all three scientific experiments (X-ray astronomy, solar γ-rays and aeronomy), had failed. It was then decided to shut down the experiments and operate Aryabhata as a technological test platform. It was a tough but pragmatic decision. The mission's main goal had always been to build capability; the scientific experiments were a bonus. Then, on its 45th orbit, the backup spin system kicked in and the satellite steadied at 50 revolutions per minute. Cheers erupted at mission control. With this, India had not only launched but also controlled its first satellite in orbit. Despite the satellite being scientifically extraneous, it continued to transmit data reliably for the next two years.

Starting today, Bluesky is rolling out a new verification system, complete with the familiar blue check marks popularized by Twitter.

The social platform, which has experienced rapid growth since it opened to the public in early 2024, formerly relied on an unconventional self-verification system where users could “authenticate” themselves by including custom domains in their web handles. Now it's adopting a more proactive and traditional verification strategy, with the Bluesky team identifying notable accounts and bestowing blue check marks.

“It'll be a rolling process as the feature stabilizes, and then we'll launch a public form that people can use to request verification,” says CEO Jay Graber. The highest-priority accounts right now are government officials, news organizations and journalists, and celebrities.

As Bluesky has grown, it has seen an uptick in impersonators posing as public figures, as MIT Technology Review documented last year. To meet growing demand for ways to confirm that accounts are legit, some Bluesky power users have taken it upon themselves to create their own verification systems. As the app continues to attract celebrity users—former president Barack Obama joined earlier this spring—a more formal verification process will help reassure public figures that Bluesky is a safe digital hangout space. “We want to reduce fraud and impersonation and drive a more trustworthy environment on Bluesky,” Graber says.

Rolling out what is pretty close to a dupe of Twitter's original verification system is not groundbreaking stuff. It's savvy, nonetheless. The reason social networks like Instagram and TikTok aped the blue check approach wasn't because they necessarily wanted to copy a rival's features. It was because these symbols had been successfully established as a visual cue that an account had been vetted.

When Elon Musk purged the microblogging platform's legacy blue check marks in favor of a pay-to-play approach, he zapped the symbol's practical value within the X ecosystem and gave grifters and pranksters everywhere a lovely gift. Still, outside of X a blue check remains an easy shorthand for “probably not fake.”

In addition to this traditional, top-down verification approach, Bluesky is also offering “trusted verifier” status to a select group of vetted organizations. These organizations will be given a scalloped blue check mark on their Bluesky accounts. The initial batch of publications selected as trusted verifiers includes The New York Times and WIRED, with more in the works.

Whether an account is verified by Bluesky itself or by these third-party “trusted verifiers,” the blue check mark it receives will look identical. When users click or tap on the check mark, they will see a list of which organizations verified the account. For example, clicking on a blue check next to a WIRED reporter's name would show that WIRED verified their identity and may show that Bluesky and other organizations also verified it. “Multiple organizations can verify one account,” Graber says.

The introduction of the trusted verifier system on top of the conventional, centralized verification offering is a nod to Bluesky's general philosophy of decentralization. It's also, one suspects, a deeply practical move, as the company's head count remains under 25 people.

Bluesky users should begin to see the first official blue check marks today.

Entering the United States has become more precarious since the start of the second Trump administration in January. There has been an apparent surge in both foreign visitors and US visa holders being detained, questioned, and even deported at the border. As the situation evolves, demand for flights from Canada and Europe has plummeted as people reevaluate their travel plans.

Many people, though, can't avoid border crossings, whether they are returning home after traveling for work or visiting friends and family abroad. Regardless of the reason for travel, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials have the authority to search people's phones and other devices as they determine who is allowed to enter the country. Multiple travelers have reported being questioned or turned away at the US border in recent weeks in relation to content on their phones.

While not unique to the US border—other nations also have powers to inspect phones—the increasingly volatile nature of the Trump administration's border policies is causing people to rethink the risks of carrying devices packed with personal information to and from the US. Canadian authorities have updated travel guidance to warn of phone searches and seizures, some corporate executives are reconsidering the devices they carry, some officials in Europe continue to receive burner phones for certain trips to the US, and the Committee to Protect Journalists has warned foreign reporters about device searches at the US border.

With this in mind, here's the WIRED guide to planning for bringing a smartphone across the border. You should also use WIRED's guide to entering the US with your digital privacy intact to get a broader view of how to minimize data and take precautions. But start here for everything smartphone.

Do CBP officials have the authority to search your phone at the border? The short answer is yes. Searches are either manual, with a border official looking through the device, or more advanced, involving forensic tools to extract data en masse. To get into your phone, border officials can ask for your PIN or biometric to unlock the phone. However, your legal status and right to enter the US will make a difference in what a search might look like at the border.

Generally, border zones—which includes US international airports—fall outside of Fourth Amendment protections that require a warrant for a device to be searched (though one federal court has ruled otherwise). As such, CBP has the power to search any traveler's phone or other electronic devices, such as computers and cameras, when they're entering the country. US citizens and green card holders can refuse a device search without being denied entry, but they may face additional questioning or temporary device seizure. And as the Trump administration pushes the norms of acceptable government conduct, it is possible that, in practice, green card holders could face new repercussions for declining a device search. US visa holders and foreign visitors can face detention and deportation for refusing a device search.

“Not everybody has the same risk profile,” says Molly Rose Freeman Cyr, a member of Amnesty International's Security Lab. “A person's legal status, the social media accounts that they use, the messaging apps that they use, and the contents of their chats” should all factor into their risk calculus and the decisions they make about border crossings, Cyr says.

If you feel safe refusing a search, make sure to disable biometrics used to unlock your device, like face or fingerprint scanners, which CBP officers can use to access your device. Instead, use only a PIN or an alphanumeric code (if available on your device). Make sure to keep your phone's operating system up to date, which can make it hard to crack with forensic tools.

You should also consider factors like nationality, citizenship, profession, and geopolitical views in assessing whether you or someone you're traveling with could be at higher risk of scrutiny during border crossings.

In short, you need to make some decisions before you travel about whether you would be prepared to refuse a device search and whether you want to make changes to your devices before your trips.

Keep in mind that there are simple steps anyone can take to keep your devices out of sight and, hopefully, out of mind during border crossings. It's always a good idea to obtain a printed boarding pass or prepare other paper documents for review and then turn your phone off and store it in your bag before you approach a CBP agent.

There are two ways to approach device privacy for border crossings. One is to start with a clean slate, purchasing a phone for the purpose of traveling or wiping and repurposing your old phone—if it still receives software updates.

The device doesn't need to be a true “burner” phone, in the sense that you will be carrying it with you as if nothing is out of the ordinary, so you don't need to purchase it with cash or take other steps to ensure that it can't be connected to you. The idea, though, is to build a sanitized version of your digital life on the travel phone, ideally with separate communication and social media accounts created specifically for travel. This way, if your device is searched, it won't have the back catalog of data—old text messages, years of photos, forgotten apps, and access to many or all of your digital accounts—that exists on your primary phone and could reveal details of your political views, your associations, or your movements over time.

Starting with a clean slate makes it easy to practice “data minimization,” or reducing the data available to another person: Simply put the things you'll need for a trip on the phone without anything you won't need. You might make a travel email address, some alternate social media accounts, and a separate account for end-to-end encrypted communications using an app like Signal or WhatsApp. Ideally you would totally silo your real digital life from this travel life. But you can also include some of your regular personal apps, building back from the ground up while determining on a selective basis whether you have existing accounts that you feel comfortable potentially exposing. Perhaps, for example, you think that showing a connection to your employer or a community organization could be advantageous in a fraught situation.

Privacy and digital rights advocates largely prefer the approach of building a travel device from scratch, but they caution that a phone that is too squeaky clean, too much like a burner phone, can arouse suspicion.

“You have to ‘seed' the device. Use the phone for a day or even for a few hours. It just can't be clean clean. That's weird,” says Matt Mitchell, founder of CryptoHarlem, a security and privacy training and advocacy nonprofit. “My recommendation is to make a finsta for travel, because if they ask you what your profile is, how are you gonna say ‘I don't use any social media'? Many people have a few accounts anyway. One ratchet, one wholesome—add one travel.”

Cyr, from Amnesty International, also points out that a true burner phone would be a “dumb” phone, which wouldn't be able to run apps for encrypted communications. “The advantage that we all have with smartphones is that you can communicate in an encrypted way,” Cyr says. “People should be conscious that any nonencrypted communication is less secure than a phone call or a message on an application like Signal.”

While a travel device doesn't need to use a prepaid SIM card bought with cash, it should not share your normal phone number, since this number is likely linked to most if not all of your key digital accounts. Buy a SIM card for your trip or only use the device on Wi-Fi.

The other approach you can take to protecting your device during border crossings is to modify your primary smartphone before travel. This involves removing old photos and messages and storing them somewhere else, cleaning out nonessential apps, and either removing some apps altogether or logging out of them with your main accounts and logging back in with travel accounts.

Mohammed Al-Maskati, digital security helpline director at the rights group Access Now, says that people should consider this type of clean-out before they travel. “I will look at my device and see what apps I need,” he says. “If I don't need the app, I just remove it.”

Al-Maskati adds that he suggests people particularly remember to remove dating apps and anything related to LGBTQI communities, especially if they consider themselves to be at higher risk of facing a device search. And generally, this approach is only safe if you are particularly diligent about removing every app that might expose you to risk.

You could use your own phone as a travel phone by backing it up, wiping it, building a travel device with only the apps you really need while traveling, going on your trip, and then restoring from the backup when you get home. This approach is doable but time consuming, and it creates more opportunities for operational security mistakes or what are known as “opsec fails.” If you try to delete all of your old, unwanted apps, but miss one, you could end up exposing an old social media account or other historic service that has forgotten data in it. Messaging apps can have easily searchable archives going back years and can automatically save photos and files without you realizing it. And if you back up all of your data to the cloud and take it off your device, but are still logged into the cloud account underpinning other services (like your main Google or Apple account), you could be asked to produce the data from the cloud for inspection.

Still, if you assess that you are at low risk of facing scrutiny during a border crossing or you don't have access to an additional device for travel, modifying your main smartphone is a good option. Just be careful.

Given all of this, you may be hyped up and ready to throw your phone in the ocean. Or you may be thinking there's no way in hell that you're ever going to take the time to deal with any of this. For those in the latter camp, you've come this far, so don't click away just yet. If you don't want to take the time to make a bunch of changes, and you don't think you're at particular risk during border crossings (though keep in mind that it's possible your risk is higher than you realize), there are still a few easy things you can do to protect your digital privacy that are better than nothing.

First, as mentioned above, print a paper boarding pass and any other documents you might need. Even if you don't turn your phone off and stow it in a bag for your entire entry or exit process, you can put it in your pocket and have your paper ticket and other documents ready while actually interacting with agents. And taking basic digital hygiene steps, like updating your phone and removing apps and data you no longer need, can go a long way.

“We all need to be recognizing that authorities may scrutinize your online presence, including social media activity and posts you've published,” says Danacea Vo, founder of Cyberlixir, a cybersecurity provider for nonprofits and vulnerable communities. “Since people have gotten more vocal on social media, they're very worried about this. Some have even decided not to risk traveling to or from the US this year.”

Panasonic-owned hi-fi brand Technics scored a surprise hit with 2023's fantastic EAH-AZ80 wireless earbuds (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The premium pair quickly became a top pick for me, thanks to their stylish looks, great fit and features, and stellar sound quality. So, a first look at the AZ80's sequel at CES 2025 promising even better sound had my heart all in a twitter.

It's always tough to follow a chart topper, but the AZ100 successfully succeed their predecessor in most ways that count, led by richer and more vivid sound from their new magnetic ferro-fluid drivers and revamped acoustic housings. They also bring advanced features like support for Spatial Audio and Bluetooth LE Audio, and stealthier yet still suitably flashy style.

The new fit, while more compact, feels less ergonomic to my ears, and I wish Technics had stepped up the noise canceling more to close in on leaders like Bose's QuietComfort Ultra. Those points aside, the AZ100 are another Technics hit thanks to premium digs and sound quality that stands tall among the very best wireless earbuds you can buy.

As glitzy as the AZ80 are, the AZ100 raise the stakes with a slimmer and sleeker design. The signature sparkling accents that recall Technics turntables return, now with even more metallic floss around the rims and smaller, less obtrusive endcaps. At 6 grams per side, they've lost a gram of heft, but their new shape doesn't slip into my ears with the driving-glove fit of the AZ80, tending to wear a bit more over time. There are also fewer ear tips to try (five compared to seven), but the Technics app assisted me in finding a stable and relatively comfy fit.

The AZ100's charging case is modestly slimmer and drops a full 8 grams to 42, making it among the smallest in its class. That doesn't leave a ton of room for the battery, offering less than two earbud fill-ups on the go. Luckily, the buds themselves pack plenty of playback time, with up to 10 hours per charge with noise canceling for standard Bluetooth, or seven hours with LDAC lossless connection. That's more than you'll get from buds like Bose's QC Ultra or Apple's AirPods Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends), and it's a noticeable upgrade over the older pair.

Technics is no slouch in the feature department, and the latest pair offers just about every modern feature you could want. You'll find all the basics like auto-pause sensors, a multiband EQ, Google Fast Pair, and an Earbuds Finder, with customization available in the Technics app. In fact, virtually everything is customizable for an almost dizzying array of options. If there's something you don't like, from how the buds relay video sync to how your voice sounds on calls, there's likely an adjustment available.

Not everything feels as polished as Apple's AirPods Pro, the software leader in the space. The AZ100's call suppression feature, for instance, does a great job killing ambient noise around your voice (or even the voice on the other end), but it makes you sound a bit sterile and robotic in the process. The app itself sometimes refused to load, forcing me to refresh it, though it was otherwise stable.

Multitaskers will be pleased to see the return of three-device multipoint pairing, letting you easily swap between your computer, tablet, and phone over Bluetooth, with no brand loyalty required. Speaking of Bluetooth, you'll not only get support for regular codecs like AAC and LDAC over Bluetooth 5.3, but also Bluetooth LE Audio, which should futureproof the buds for next-gen wireless streaming.

The AZ100's touch controls are responsive, customizable, and comprehensive, with default options for playback, calling, volume, and ambient audio at the ready. The layout is a tad confusing at first, but I appreciate the ability to accomplish just about any task without grabbing your phone.

I often save the sound performance for last, but the AZ100's sound is too good to hold off any longer. Like most hi-fi buds, they provide a slow and steady revelation of their skills. The further you drill down, the better they sound.

When I first fired them up, I was surprised by the sound signature's warm and almost thick flavor, seeming more reliant on the bass and lower mids than expected. That said, I generally prefer a smoother touch in my hi-fi over sharp and zingy, and it didn't take long to find that the AZ100's warm entrance acts almost like a velvet backdrop on which instrumental textures and effects glitter like jewels in the light.

Like any great pair of headphones, you'll find yourself rediscovering songs you've heard dozens of times. Not everything steps up to a revelatory level, but well-recorded tracks are elevated. One example is St. Vincent's Digital Witness, which sounded almost like an alternative mix with the AZ100. Clark's vocals are haunting, with long reverb trails that hang in the air and slip into the sides of the mix. The groove's right side kick drum felt like it was popping directly in my ear, the horns cut with Sgt. Pepper grit and, for the first time, I noticed the instruments all going flat at the end of their staccato chorus. It's the little things.

The AZ100's new drivers deliver on their promise of cutting distortion, which leaves instruments brilliantly separated and fully exposed. Deep and rich timbres flow across the stereo image or double at the far sides with refined definition. Little moments like an extra breath or the click before a guitar strum surface effortlessly. All instruments sound great, but percussion is particularly lovely, arriving in sandpaper pulses and loads of colors that sneak out from little pockets along the height and width of each mix.

Only Sennheiser's Momentum 4 TW (7/10, WIRED Recommends) keep up for the money. I think the AZ100 has the edge for instrumental textures, while the Momentum sometimes do better carving out darker mixes. I occasionally found the AZ100's bass too heavy, but you can adjust that to order in the EQ, and I mostly just leaned back and let the buds do their thing.

Unlike their sound, the AZ100's active noise canceling is decidedly middle-rung for their class. After nearly two years between releases, a weightier upgrade would have been nice, but even middle-rung in this competitive segment is enough to fulfill most needs. In my AZ80 review, I called their noise canceling powerful enough to have folks sneaking up on you with light music playing, and the AZ100's Adaptive ANC is a skosh better. It satisfyingly silences HVAC hums and other annoyances in your home or office and quickly quells outdoor interruptions like construction work or landscaping.

In A/B testing in my acoustically treated studio with airplane drone effects, the AZ100 fared well against premium contenders like Sony's WF-1000XM5 (7/10, WIRED Recommends), though like the Momentum 4, they're less effective in higher frequencies like keystrokes and voices. The Momentum held an edge over the Technics for lower frequencies, while Beats' new Powerbeats Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) did better with voices and keystrokes. All these models are obliterated by Bose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra, so if you have to have the best, it's an easy choice.

The AZ100's adjustable transparency mode is similarly good-not-great. Exterior sounds are slightly muddled and some higher frequencies are over-accentuated, but it's enough to keep you aware of your surroundings and carry on a conversation with soft music playing. I was pleased to find advanced transparency features like wind buffering and a limiter to suppress sudden loud noises like Apple's and Bose's flagship pairs.

For those who put sound quality first, Technics' AZ100 have few rivals in their class, with the sale-priced AZ80 perhaps the most enticing. If you're after new premium buds with premium sound to match, these earbuds are a top choice from an iconic brand.

I'm well-versed in walking pads (odd, I know, but I review fitness equipment for a living). After testing a ton of them, I really thought I had seen all the category had to offer. That was before I heard about the Urevo CyberPad, which allows users to walk at a 14 percent incline—the highest I've seen on the market.

It has plenty of other cool features (I'll get to those later), but the thing that really makes it stand out is that incline. If you're looking for a walking pad that can give you a more challenging workout, but you don't really want to run, this is the one for you.

The CyberPad setup required exactly zero brainpower (exactly how I like it). I had it out of the box and up and running in minutes. I've tested another Urevo machine and found that one easy to unpack and set up as well; the company seems to do a great job of making products that are ready to use right out of the box. At 70.6 pounds, this machine is on the heavier side, which I expected with the incline mechanism. But it was easy to wheel around and get into place under my standing desk.

The incline tops out at level 9, which, depending on how you have the machine's back feet positioned, is a 9 percent or 14 percent grade. I suspected I might feel a little wobbly trying to type with the incline all the way up, but the machine itself felt incredibly stable.

From a cardio perspective, the 14 percent incline is tough to maintain for long. It really feels like you're hiking. But it's not so challenging that you can't do it while you work. For me, that's a big deal. I like getting my steps in on a walking pad, but sometimes I want to boost my fitness in a more significant way. Sadly, I haven't figured out how to run while I work—even walking at high speeds can make it hard for me to type—but steep hill walking is a great proxy that doesn't make reading or writing any harder. This machine allows you to do it without having to shell out the money or space for a heavy-duty running treadmill.

That being said, if you want a machine you can both walk and run on, this isn't it. The speed only goes up to 4 miles per hour—perectly fine for walking, but it's not fast enough for most people to run on. It also won't be as easy to store as some slimmer walking pads, but again, you can't get this much incline without a higher height (8.7 inches), which might not fit under couches or beds.

As far as other features go, the deck is smooth, steady, and responsive, with a great length of stride space (43.3 inches). It didn't make my feet or knees hurt after hours of walking. It looks and feels durable, too. It isn't the quietest machine, but it wasn't loud enough to be distracting to me or anyone else in my house. It makes a steady, white-noise-like drone.

The pad has a Bluetooth remote and an app (iOS, Android), and I was able to connect both to the machine without any trouble. You can control the pad using either, and the remote has a screen that cycles through the same stats that you can see on the screen at the front of the pad: speed, incline, time, distance, and calories.

The app is easy to navigate, shows your daily step count, and syncs with the machine seamlessly. Even if you start and control the machine with the remote, the app will log your workout data as long as you open and connect to it at some point during your walk. That isn't the case for many walking pads that have companion apps. The Quick Start function lets you walk freely and adjust the settings from your phone, and there's also the option to follow along with virtual walks with pretty scenery.

The app also allows you to control the lights that run along the rails of the CyberPad. You can set it to be any color of the rainbow and to remain solid or follow various patterns. It's absolutely not a necessary feature (and you can turn it off), but it felt like a fun way to customize what's usually a fairly boring-looking piece of equipment.

All in all, the CyberPad is a solid machine that I would recommend to anyone who's looking to upgrade their home office with a walking pad. It'll give you a great workout, without ever taking you away from your work (even if you might do that sometimes, anyway).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Massive Screen for Live Sports Puts You in the Best Seat in the Stadium","https://www.wired.com/story/cosm-live-sports-immersive-experiences/","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

An early February 2024 game between English Premier League contenders Liverpool and Arsenal was set to be a vital clash that would help determine the eventual league champion. Liverpool held a narrow lead in the league, but an Arsenal victory would draw them within just two points of overtaking their rivals in the standings.

I was lucky enough to be watching this vital match up close and decided to brag a bit: I texted a friend, a keen EPL fan, with a couple pictures of my pitch-side view. He was jealous, naturally, and also probably a bit confused at why a limited soccer fan like myself would be flying thousands of miles from my home in the western US all the way to the UK to watch a match between two clubs I have no connection to.

But it was a ruse!

I wasn't across the pond, even if the pics I sent my buddy sure looked like it. I was just 20 minutes from my home in Salt Lake City at the Cosm Experience Center, a facility on the University of Utah campus with a 65-foot, 8K screen. The game didn't just look real from pictures; it felt real for large chunks of the livestream, with the massive wraparound screen and thumping spatial audio system providing sights and sounds that truly made me feel like I was in the stadium.

My silly little trick isn't remotely novel, whether at this smaller SLC venue or one of Cosm's two larger locations in Los Angeles and Dallas, where the company showcases its “shared reality” immersive experiences. Cosm reps tell me people take photos of the screen all the time, searching for some way to adequately capture the feeling of being at one of the broadcasts. Like The Sphere, the wildly popular venue in Las Vegas, it's a jolt to feel such realism from digital displays—and to experience the roar of the crowd and a communal experience that's a far cry from simply watching the game at home.

Cosm offers multiple viewing angles for soccer games.

Cosm represents a growing trend in live sports experiences. The company made headlines when tickets for game 1 of the Yankees-Dodgers matchup in the 2024 World Series at its LA facility sold out in just seven minutes. Now the company is pioneering first-of-their-kind broadcasts across other leagues, including the NBA, NHL, and UFC.

I recently went back to the SLC facility for another demo. What I saw was a window into an immersive future—in sports, entertainment, and education—which can be accessed through any screen, from a towering Cosm dome to the phone in your pocket.

Cosm's history is fascinating, and it touches on the earliest days of immersive projection systems.

The company's roots in immersive tech date back decades, when said tech was pioneered for planetariums. The Cosm brand was born in 2020 when a leader in planetarium projection technology partnered with major entities in computer graphics and virtual reality. The name Cosm is derived from the collision of the Colosseum and the Cosmos.

Cosm proved its abilities in the immersive space through streaming feeds for VR coverage of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games and the 2022 FIFA World Cup, then opened its first official venues with large screens in LA and Dallas in 2024.

Those venues hold around 1,400 people, according to Cosm; the SLC venue I visited is much smaller, but has a similar setup. A lobby with huge LED screens welcomes visitors; classic stadium concessions are readily available, including seat-side delivery; like a real arena, seating is split into multiple levels.

Once I got inside, in front of me was that massive 8K screen—other Cosm venues use screens with even higher resolutions, including up to 12K—that took up my entire field of view and then some, wrapping around the sides of the venue and up over my head. The picture quality was insane; Cosm tells me its venues are the first true “black domes” in the industry, a design which minimizes issues like cross-reflection (an effect where light bounces off a display's surface in unpredictable ways, causing diminished clarity and brightness) and allows for incredibly rich visuals. When combined with the use of high-quality LED lights for the actual displays, the resulting visuals are breathtaking.

“The system contrast is 10 times that of what you can achieve with any projector,” Cosm chief operations officer Kirk Johnson tells me.

For sound, Cosm uses an array of speakers—16 speakers plus four subwoofers at the SLC facility; 38 speakers and 15 subwoofers at the LA and Dallas locations—affixed at various points directly behind the LED displays, which are permeable to allow sound through them. This allows Cosm to make noises and effects sound like they're coming from any part of the room, even seemingly behind me.

During hockey games, Cosm's camera angles can virtually put you right on the ice.

On the sports side, both the NBA (Cosm's first league partner) and NHL experiences are amazing. Cosm can put you courtside for NBA games, both at center court and on either baseline. The NHL program feels a touch more immersive than that, even, particularly a corner view that's technically from outside the glass, but truly makes you feel like you're standing on the rink itself.

UFC was another highlight. Cosm's standard UFC viewing angle is a perch just above the octagon, as if you were sitting on a magic carpet hovering a few feet off the ground; it's a far better view than I've ever seen on a UFC pay-per-view. “We had a few fights where there was blood on the lenses,” Cosm president and CEO Jeb Terry tells me.

If the crowd in an actual arena is doing the wave during one of the livestreamed games, fans inside the Cosm venue will join in as it reaches their section.

There are other views for UFC events as well, including octagon-side. Between bouts, it pans back to a wide shot in the stands.

“I feel like I have a seat in the crowd,” says Alon Cohen, UFC senior VP of research and development, of what it's like to watch a match at a Cosm venue. “It gives you a different experience than if you put on a set of VR glasses. It gives you a different experience than going to a Sphere where everything's so big.”

The view for UFC matches hovers over the octagon.

While the Sphere comparison is unavoidable at first, Cosm doesn't really consider the concert venue a competitor. They do such different things, even if both are enabled by incredible visual technology. “We both believe in an amazing human experience powered by technology, something that will wow you,” Terry says.

The non-sports experiences I sat through were just as impressive, including beautiful views of a performance of Cirque du Soleil's “O” stage show. Maybe most impressive, though, was Cosm's suite of tools that straddle between the worlds of entertainment and education.

First, Cosm brought me inside a true-life rendering of the Sistine Chapel. An engineer floated around the chapel using nothing but an Xbox controller; it felt like I was inside a drone flying around the room.

Cosm then showed me a bird's-eye rendering of the building we were sitting in and its surroundings; think Google Maps, but on steroids. From there, the view zoomed out as we were transported several hundred miles to the LA Cosm facility, with every inch of earth between the two locations mapped on the screen. We then zoomed out even further to see the entire country, then the entire world, the entire galaxy, and the entire known universe.

All of this is brought to life on Cosm's giant screen using a software platform called Digistar. It was originally developed to power computer graphics projections for planetariums in the 1980s and has evolved into a fully modern digital animation platform. (The company that developed Digistar is one of the handful that merged in 2021 to form Cosm.)

The system engineers tell me the Digistar software accurately maps every piece of space debris over one meter in size, including billions of stars and data points. Cosm folks tell me kids love this exercise of flying around the universe; it left my head spinning a bit.

With many of Cosm's main offerings, sports especially, it's about more than just the graphics and the visual quality. It's the communal experience. The Cosm folks tell me that if the crowd in an actual arena is doing the wave during one of the livestreamed games, fans inside the Cosm venue will join in as it reaches their section. When a UFC fight ends in a knockout, everyone jumps out of their seat like they would if they were actually there.

“You feel like you're in this space with people where that's the appropriate reaction,” Cohen says. “The reactions you [get in Cosm] are the reactions you get in the arena.”

The actual Cosm facilities, however, are just one piece of the company's overall role in the immersive space. The company hopes to eventually get its flavor of content into other facilities and onto other platforms.

Cosm's tech also powers planetariums around the world.

Even as it has expanded into sports and other forms of entertainment, Cosm has maintained a strong foothold in planetariums and similar educational venues. Europe's first ever LED dome, the Prague Planetarium, integrates Cosm's CX System backend technology. The company has been involved with facilities like the Arizona Science Center, the MOSI Saunders Planetarium in Tampa Bay, Florida, and the Shanghai Astronomy Museum. Cosm's tech powers over 700 planetariums around the world.

Among its most recent ventures was at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, where in December 2024 Cosm helped convert the Texas museum's decommissioned Omni IMAX theater into a 360-degree immersive dome, complete with 12,000 LED panels. This dome hosts all sorts of content, from Cosm-produced films to various educational programs for all ages; that same zoom-out-to-the-entire-universe feature I saw at my demo is a regular part of programming, for instance.

“It doesn't just function as a regular screen. It can sort of be anything and do anything,” says Nikki Diller, VP of collections, interpretations, and programs for the museum. “People say the sky is the limit. I say the known universe is the limit, because that's part of what our planetarium software can do.”

Like many other entities using the tech, the Fort Worth Museum is still figuring out the best ways to bring it to new audiences. The museum and various other Cosm partners have tried a number of approaches, from live orchestra performances to trivia and karaoke.

Cosm has also positioned itself as a central hub in the growing immersive entertainment space, one that some refer to broadly as “180 video”—a bit of a misnomer, as many of Cosm's programs take up much more than 180 degrees in the field of view. Because Cosm has already done all the backend formatting, the platform can serve as a clearing house for content outside the giant dome setting.

Cosm can easily port its experiences over to VR, for instance. It can also provide ready-made content for smartphone-based “immersive” experiences where users move their devices around to engage with a 3D space.

Fans take in an immersive basketball game at a Cosm venue.

Many of the NBA's courtside VR game experiences, which place viewers right at court level with viewpoints on both baselines and at the center-court scorer's table, are produced by Cosm. On the combat side, the company is involved with VR and phone-based experiences efforts for both UFC and WWE alike.

New immersive Cosm facilities in Atlanta and Detroit are set to open in 2026, the latter of which will contain betting-focused elements, due to the legality of sports gambling in Michigan. Terry says the company hopes to announce several other venues in the near future. Those who have worked with Cosm tend to be extremely optimistic about the company's potential.

“I am bullish on Cosm,” Cohen tells me, before comparing the company's potential to another unique in-person experience, TopGolf; the driving-range chain has over 100 locations around the world. “That's at least how many Cosms there ought to be. These things have a much smaller footprint, they fit in more places. Any major city that has a certain number of people should have a Cosm.”

Bluesky announced on Monday that it is rolling out blue check verification, confirming previous rumors that this feature was on its way to the platform.

Like Twitter's original blue check (RIP), Bluesky's blue check will verify that notable accounts are legitimate, making it easy for users to trust that an account's posts are real. 

In its earliest phase, Bluesky will work with a select few “Trusted Verifiers,” which are independent organizations that can verify accounts as members of their team. For example, a company could verify members of its public relations team with blue checks, making it easier for users to see that these people can be trusted as sources of company news.

Bluesky says that its moderation team will verify each new verification to validate authenticity.

Bluesky already had a form of verification, letting any user set a domain they own as their username. For example, you'd know that TechCrunch's account is real because it is verified with the TechCrunch domain name, which an impersonator would not be able to access.

In the case of public figures like celebrities, journalists, and politicians, this additional layer of verification can help the platform cut down on disinformation from impersonators. According to Bluesky, 270,000 accounts have linked their Bluesky username to a website.

“Domain handles continue to be an important part of verification on Bluesky,” the Bluesky team wrote in a blog post. “At the same time, we've heard from users that a larger visual signal would be useful in knowing which accounts are authentic.”

At launch, Bluesky is not accepting applications for verification, but it said it plans to launch a request form in the future.

Meta is using AI technology to search for kids who are lying about their age on Instagram in order to bypass safeguards, the company announced on Monday. When Meta finds an account that it suspects belongs to a teen, the platform will enroll them into a restricted Teen Account, even if the account lists an adult birthday. 

Teen Accounts, which launched on Instagram last year, enroll young users into an app experience with built-in protections. The safeguards are applied to teens automatically, and limit who can contact a teen on the app and restrict the type of content the account holder can view. Teens under the age of 16 need their parents' permission to change any of these settings. 

Instagram has been using AI to determine age for quite some time, but now the social network confirms it's using the technology to ensure that teens are accessing Instagram via a Teen Account rather than an adult one.

The company told TechCrunch last year that it had planned to do this, and noted that some of the ways it would find accounts that belong to teens who entered a fake adult birthday is by detecting happy birthday posts and receiving reports from other users.

Instagram says that it's taking steps to ensure that its technology is accurate and that it's correctly placing teens into Teen Accounts. However, in case the company does make a mistake, it's giving people the option to change their settings.

“The digital world continues to evolve and we have to evolve with it,” the company wrote in its blog post. “That's why it's important that we work together with parents to make sure as many teens as possible have the protective settings that come with Teen Accounts.”

Instagram also announced that it's going to begin sending notifications to parents that include information about how they can discuss the importance of providing the correct age online with their teens. The platform notes that one of the most important ways parents can make sure their teens are in protected accounts is to check if their account lists their correct birthday. 

Today's announcement comes two weeks after Meta introduced Teen Accounts to Facebook and Messenger. 

Meta says it has enrolled at least 54 million teens into Teen Accounts globally so far, and that 97% of teens ages 13-15 have remained in these protected accounts.

Jeff Bezos-backed Slate Auto has planted multiple concept versions of its EV on the streets of California. It's a marketing tactic that teases the secretive startup's strategy to sell a “Transformer”-like vehicle, people familiar with the company's internal discussions told TechCrunch.

This unconventional real-world tease comes days before Slate's April 24 launch event at Long Beach Airport, according to an invite viewed by TechCrunch.

The Michigan-based startup, founded in 2022, has operated in relative secrecy until TechCrunch published a report revealing Bezos' financial involvement, as well as its plan to price its EV at around $25,000 while encouraging buyers to customize the vehicle to their liking. That base model is referred to as the “Blank Slate” version, according to a trademark application and another person familiar with the company's plans. Slate has also filed for a trademark for the phrase: “We Built It. You Make It.”

The Autopian's David Tracy traveled to Venice, California over the weekend where Slate parked a concept version of the truck made to look like a two-door SUV used by a fake business. Similarly, Reddit users posted pictures over the weekend of yet another version of the truck made to look like a hatchback that almost resembles Rivian's forthcoming R3.

The vehicle Tracy saw up close this past weekend looks just like the two-door pickup truck spotted by a Reddit user earlier this month in Long Beach, but with a hard cover over the bed that gives it more of an SUV shape. The vehicle is covered in a wrap for a fake business called “Rockabye Rides,” which includes a URL that leads to a website that is counting down to Slate's event later this week.

That makes three different silhouettes we've seen of Slate's truck so far — and that adaptability is something the company has privately touted as it locked down well over $100 million in funding, TechCrunch has learned. 

Slate's leadership focused heavily on the “Transformer” metaphor as it wooed investors to fill out its Series B funding round last year, according to a person familiar with the pitches. The company carefully choreographed the meetings around the idea, according to another person familiar with how they went.

This involved showing prospective investors a generic version of the truck, and then leading them to another room while a team quickly customized the vehicle. Then the prospective investors would be brought back to the first room only to find the truck looking completely different. 

Those efforts appear to have been convincing. Guggenheim Partners CEO (and controlling owner of the LA Dodgers) Mark Walter seemingly invested in the round and joined Slate's board, TechCrunch has reported.

A spokesperson for the company didn't respond to a request for comment.

These new photos give a pretty clear view of the exterior of Slate's truck, and the potential level of customization. The interior remains a mystery, and there is no public knowledge about the vehicle's specs. 

The company has briefed a number of automotive journalists ahead of Thursday's event, and Tracy wrote that he's “under a strict NDA” on any of the sepecifics. 

Even still, Tracy wrote that the Slate truck “is unlike any new vehicle I've ever seen not just in my decade as a car journalist, but in my entire lifetime.”

Andreessen Horowitz's hiring spree continues. On Monday, Erik Torenberg announced that the giant VC firm had acquired his Turpentine podcast, with him joining as a general partner.

Torenberg's podcast focuses mostly on interviewing VCs at a variety of firms about their approach to investing. Recent guests include Accel's Andrew Braccia, Seven Seven Six's Alexis Ohanian, and Benchmark's Sarah Tavel and Eric Vishria.

Torenberg said he plans to continue with his podcast, but we'll see if it changes direction. A16z creates a lot of corporate content, including its own podcasts. But the focus tends to be on founders rather than other VCs.

Torenberg makes sense as a hire for a16z, though. Beyond the pod, he was an early employee at Product Hunt and has been a successful angel investor and pro VC in the years since. He has spent the last seven years at firm Village Global. While there, he helped launch On Deck, a program that trains aspiring founders. His investments include Scale AI, Lattice, Figma, Perplexity, Replit, Flexport, and others, he says. 

So he's a fairly classic a16z hire. The venture firm also recently hired former North Carolina congressman Patrick McHenry and, several months ago, former U.S. Marine Daniel Penny

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","AI is pushing the limits of the physical world","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/21/1114764/ai-artificial-intelligence-architecture-building/","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Artificial intelligence is painting pictures, writing novels, making videos, and composing symphonies. Can it change what we build?

Architecture often assumes a binary between built projects and theoretical ones. What physics allows in actual buildings, after all, is vastly different from what architects can imagine and design (often referred to as “paper architecture”). That imagination has long been supported and enabled by design technology, but the latest advancements in artificial intelligence have prompted a surge in the theoretical. 

“Transductions: Artificial Intelligence in Architectural Experimentation,” a recent exhibition at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, brought together works from over 30 practitioners exploring the experimental, generative, and collaborative potential of artificial intelligence to open up new areas of architectural inquiry—something they've been working on for a decade or more, since long before AI became mainstream. Architects and exhibition co-­curators Jason Vigneri-Beane, Olivia Vien, Stephen Slaughter, and Hart Marlow explain that the works in “Transductions” emerged out of feedback loops among architectural discourses, techniques, formats, and media that range from imagery, text, and animation to mixed-­reality media and fabrication. The aim isn't to present projects that are going to break ground anytime soon; architects already know how to build things with the tools they have. Instead, the show attempts to capture this very early stage in architecture's exploratory engagement with AI.

Technology has long enabled architecture to push the limits of form and function. As early as 1963, Sketchpad, one of the first architectural software programs, allowed architects and designers to move and change objects on screen. Rapidly, traditional hand drawing gave way to an ever-expanding suite of programs—­Revit, SketchUp, and BIM, among many others—that helped create floor plans and sections, track buildings' energy usage, enhance sustainable construction, and aid in following building codes, to name just a few uses. 

The architects exhibiting in “Trans­ductions” view newly evolving forms of AI “like a new tool rather than a profession-­ending development,” says Vigneri-Beane, despite what some of his peers fear about the technology. He adds, “I do appreciate that it's a somewhat unnerving thing for people, [but] I feel a familiarity with the rhetoric.”

After all, he says, AI doesn't just do the job. “To get something interesting and worth saving in AI, an enormous amount of time is required,” he says. “My architectural vocabulary has gotten much more precise and my visual sense has gotten an incredible workout, exercising all these muscles which have atrophied a little bit.”

Vien agrees: “I think these are extremely powerful tools for an architect and designer. Do I think it's the entire future of architecture? No, but I think it's a tool and a medium that can expand the long history of mediums and media that architects can use not just to represent their work but as a generator of ideas.”

Jason Vigneri-Beane, Pratt Institute “These images are from a larger series on cyborg ecologies that have to do with co-creating with machines to imagine [other] machines,” says Vigneri-Beane. “I might refer to these as cryptomegafauna—infrastructural robots operating at an architectural scale.”

Olivia Vien, Pratt InstituteFor the series Imprinting Grounds, Vien created images digitally and fed them into Midjourney. “It riffs on the ideas of damask textile patterns in a more digital realm,” she says.



The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

These newer models appear more likely to indulge in rule-bending behaviors than previous generations—and there's no way to stop them.

Having a second screen handy has become a necessity for anyone who is working, gaming, or creating on the go. The MNN 15.6-inch portable monitor sold on Amazon provides an ideal combination of mobility, performance and value that makes it a great accessory to improve productivity. Originally debuted about two years ago for roughly $190, this multi-purpose monitor is now available on Amazon for just $61—a price near a record low and an incredible bargain given its debut price.

See at Amazon

Picture yourself working from a busy coffee shop or a small hotel desk… and your laptop screen by itself simply won't do. Using this monitor, you can quite easily double up on your screen space so that multitasking becomes effortless. Whether you need to consult documents while writing emails, keep a video call on screen while taking notes, or simply prefer to watch a movie on a larger, brighter display, this monitor brings the convenience of your home office wherever you may be. Its 1920×1080 Full HD IPS panel displays sharp and clear graphics with a wide 178-degree viewing angle, which means colors stay true and details remain clear no matter how you tilt the screen.

The MNN monitor also serves gamers and content creators: Hooking up to your laptop, gaming console, or even phone is easy with two full-feature USB-C ports and an HDMI input which support everything from the latest MacBooks to the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation consoles. Plug and play capability means you won't waste time with annoying setups: just plug in one cable and you're ready to go. HDR support and speakers enhance your entertainment experience and turn this slim screen into a great immersive on-the-go gaming or movie streaming companion.

It's also weighs a lot less than many tablets and slips easily into a backpack or briefcase. The included smart cover doubles as a sturdy stand and protective case so that your display is ready for action whether you're working from a park bench or a train seat. And by the way, this lightweight construction doesn't come at the expense of durability.

At $61, this MNN 15.6-inch portable monitor is not only a fraction of its original $190 price but it is also one of the best values you'll find for a portable display of this quality. It's a rare opportunity to grab a high-performance second screen at a price that's almost unheard of (except during Black Friday) whether you're working from home, traveling the world, or just want more space to play and create.

As I reported just last week, cheap-yet-awesome retro handhelds are being marched to the guillotine in the name of Trump tariffs. One of the first companies to have its head on the block is also one of the most prolific. Handheld maker Anbernic told customers Sunday that it would stop all direct shipments to U.S. customers, at least until President Donny finally offers any clarity on how much people will pay in import duties for products from China.

Anbernic is known for its enormous library of handheld video game emulation hardware. These handhelds are able to use console emulators—essentially full video game consoles translated into software—to play new homebrew titles as well as digital copies of older games, known as ROMS. In a page describing the new shipping policy, Anbernic said “due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all shipping from China to the United States starting today. We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse.”

Until today Anbernic let customers ship products either directly from China or from it's U.S. warehouse, where supplies were more limited but products would ship out faster. It's unclear how long the current supply of consoles in the U.S. will last. I reached out to Anbernic for comment, but did not immediately hear back. The handheld maker said it would update customers when it received “confirmed updates regarding import duties.”

Fortunately there's more than one way to get a console from Anbernic. You might still be able to find its products on Amazon, or AliExpress. The dropshipping site typically sells these handhelds for much cheaper than you could get elsewhere, too. The classic Anbernic RG35XX Plus Game Boy-like device goes for $48 on AliExpress, $50 on the Anbernic site, and a whopping $80 on Amazon. As American supplies dwindle we can assume those prices will increase.

While President Donald Trump has imposed a 145% tariff on China—a policy that will inevitably increase prices for U.S. consumers—Trump has also explicitly targeted the “de minimis” exemptions that allowed some China e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein to ship exceptionally cheap products to the U.S. Trump's new trade policies emphasize extra duties on individual products coming from China. That will include a $75 cost paid by customers in May, but that increases to $150 in June. Last week, both Temu and Shein said in near-identical statements they would make “price adjustments” to their products starting April 25 due to “recent changes in global trade rules.”

So while cheap crap is going to get pricier for people in the U.S., the knock against gaming handhelds is felt especially hard. Anbernic has been around since 2017. It was known for launching a metric ton of handhelds every year, from the RG350 in 2020 and the RG351V in 2021 to this year's Game Boy Advance clone, the RG34XX. The company announced its latest product, the RG557, earlier this month and says the device has a more-powerful processor and OLED display.

It's a blow to the retro gaming community. Now we'll have to see how other handheld makers like Miyoo, Ayaneo, TrimUI, and Retroid handle the tariff dilemma. Last week, Retroid told customers on its official Discord that “all shipping agencies will not accept U.S. bound packages from China starting April 25.” While the company's new Retroid Pocket Classic was shipping to those who ordered in the U.S., the Teal, Kiwi, and Berry colorways were all scheduled to ship after April 28. Anybody who placed those orders in the U.S. needed to order another color. Retroid still hasn't offered any word what it will do for future products, but considering the reaction from the rest of this niche industry, it's not looking good.

We're kind of in a no-mans-zone for big deals days. We're well past the winter holiday season and still have over a month before Memorial Day comes up. The good news is that even those these sales events are well off in the distance, you can still find some great deals and discounts on consumer tech if you look hard enough. Take for instance this Samsung monitor. This 27″ FHD display is normally priced at $190, but right now it is part of a limited time deal. This hefty discount brings the price down by 32% to a measly $130—saving you $60.

Measuring in at 27″ with a Full HD resolution of 1080p, this is a perfectly serviceable monitor. It has a refresh rate of 75 Hz. For gamers, you won't be getting ridiculously high detail and frame rates, but what you are getting is a size-able display that does its job for just over $100. It does have AMD FreeSync which can allows for smooth and consistent frame rates at least.

See at Amazon

For non-gamers, this is a great option for someone who deals in spreadsheets that just needs a larger screen than they're laptop has so they can view more at once—or someone who likes to have multiple windows in view at once.

The bezel is nice and thin, so you can experience a near-borderless display. You'll be looking at more picture and less plastic while hanging out on the computer.

As far as ports, on the back you'll find the AC power along with a DisplayPort and two HDMI ports so you can have multiple devices hooked up at once and switch between inputs with ease. The USB hub allows you to plug in your mouse and keyboard directly to the monitor and still work on your laptop. It's sort of an all-in-one docking station for those who aren't looking for a crazy complicated setup but still more than just working off the laptop.

The Samsung FT45 monitor itself has height-adjustable stand which can also be tilted to your ideal viewing angle. It also supports wall mounts or multimonitor setups if you want to mount to a singular arm holding all your monitors.

This monitor is designed to be easy on the eyes. Eye Saver mode and flicker free technology are there to help reduce eye strain, especially during long working hours.

This 27″ Full HD monitor from Samsung is down to a significantly reduced price at the moment. Going for a solid 32% off, the price has been shaved down from $190 to just $130 for a limited time over at Amazon.

We knew it was only a matter of time before prices started creeping up in more obvious ways. The tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have caused rippling effects across many industries, and PC hardware is no exception. Today, we're looking at evidence of price increases related to several Logitech products in particular.

This observation has come to light thanks to YouTuber Cameron Dougherty from the channel Cameron Dougherty Tech. In his recent video, Dougherty reports several notable price increases that have reached as high as 25%. This applies to a handful of Logitech's flagship products. That said, when researching these price increases, it looks like some of them have been discounted over at Amazon, but the price they have been marked down from is definitely higher than the usual rate.

It's also important to note that this isn't a blanket price increase. Some prices have stayed the same, while others have gone down. Similar hikes have been reported from Chinese company Anker. And whether or not the changes are directly due to tariffs or companies capitalizing on demand ahead of currently paused tariffs, these two companies are almost certainly not alone in their price increases.The best way to investigate price changes is to check price archiving tools like PC Part Picker or Camel Camel Camel for products listed over at Amazon. These are some of our favorite tools to use when researching deals and tracking price changes.

We investigated the Logitech claims ourselves and confirmed some of the reported price increases. For example, the MX Keys S keyboard is now listed for $130 on the official Logitech website, an 18% increase. The MX Master 3S mouse has risen 20%, going from $100 to $120. However, the biggest price jump applies to the K400 Plus Wireless Touch keyboard. It's been selling for around $28 lately, but now has jumped up to $35. This is only an increase of $7, but percentage-wise, it's among the most significant increases.

These price increases were not part of any announcement, but were quietly implemented. Again, since the release of Dougherty's video, Logitech has listed a few of these items on sale, but the new price floor for them is consistently higher across multiple vendors. It's unclear whether more of Logitech's hardware is destined to join the wave of increases, but it is very likely given the ongoing tariff situation.

Your next 3D printer might have to come from Facebook Marketplace.

The era of cheap 3D printing appears to be coming to a screeching halt in the US. A perfect storm of newly imposed tariffs is quickly driving costs upward as tariffs on Chinese-made goods, which include popular 3D printers from Bambu Lab, Creality, Elegoo, and Anycubic, have hit a record high of 145%.Bambu Lab's newest printer, the H2D, was launched on March 25 with a starting price tag of $1,899 for the two-color, non-laser unit. It's now listed at $2,399, a 23% increase, while the 40-watt laser unit we reviewed last month will now set you back a whopping $4,399. This is $500 to $900 more than its intended price — a 20% increase.

Tracking the rising cost of 3D printers is a difficult task. Some Chinese manufacturers have not raised their prices, but their goods are also not in stock, making availability another issue 3D printer hobbyists and business owners are dealing with. Notable in this category is the Elegoo Centauri Carbon, which is still listed at its debut price of $299. But it is also listed as a “pre-order” that will only become available in late July.

The Creality K2 Plus Combo, which we reviewed in January, is still holding its original price tag of $1,499, and is listed as shipping from a U.S. warehouse. Tariffs are only applied to items at the time of shipping. While no one wanted to be named, several company representatives at this year's Rapid + TCT event told me they had rushed shipments to U.S. warehouses before the tariffs took effect and are hoping to hold prices down for as long as possible.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

At current prices, the 5070 makes far more sense than the 5060 Ti 16GB.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB are the two most recent GPUs launched by Team Green. Since the beginning of 2025, Nvidia has released five Blackwell RTX 50-series GPUs — six if you want to count the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB as a separate entry.

To say that supplies have been limited and insufficient to keep up with demand would be a gross understatement, but the same applies to any of the best graphics cards right now. In fact, of all the Blackwell RTX GPUs, the 5070 and 5060 Ti are currently the most readily available; just don't expect to find most models at MSRP.Our GPU benchmarks hierarchy ranks all the graphics cards by performance, and naturally the more expensive cards come out ahead of their less expensive siblings. But how do the RTX 5070 and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB stack up? We'll look at the performance, approximate pricing — because no GPU prices are reliably set in stone right now — as well as other aspects of the cards to help you decide which one might be right for your gaming PC.Most of the features between the two GPUs will be identical. Both use the Blackwell architecture and support DLSS 4 and MFG, for example. Still, let's start with the specifications to see how the 5070 and 5060 Ti stack up.

As you'd expect, the RTX 5070 offers more raw performance on paper and in practice. It uses a GPU that's 45% larger, with 41.6% more transistors. More importantly perhaps, it has 33% more SMs, tensor cores, RT cores, and related computational units. It also has 50% more memory bandwidth and a 50% wider memory interface, plus 50% more L2 cache.Memory interfaces don't scale as well as core logic on modern process nodes, and there are other aspects of the Blackwell GPU — the video encoders/decoders, display outputs, etc. — that don't really change, which explains why the chip size and transistor counts don't necessarily scale linearly.Clock speeds aren't quite the same, at least on paper. The 5060 Ti has a 2572 MHz boost clock and the 5070 has a slightly lower 2512 MHz boost clock. But we're also looking at the 5070 Founders Edition with reference clocks, and a PNY 5060 Ti 16GB OC that has a 2692 MHz boost clock. Plugging in those numbers gives the 5070 30.9 teraflops of FP32 compute and the PNY 5060 Ti has 24.8 TFLOPS. That means the 5070 'only' has 25% more compute on paper — which isn't actually all that accurate.In our full suite of gaming benchmarks, the 5070 Founders Edition averaged clock speeds of 2826 MHz while the PNY 5060 Ti 16GB OC averaged 2776 MHz. That means despite theoretically 180 MHz lower clocks, in practice Nvidia's 5070 card came out 50 MHz ahead.

That means the 5070 FE offers about 34.7 TFLOPS compared to 25.6 TFLOPS, a 35.5% advantage. Practically speaking, though, the 5070 should be up to 35% faster in games that are compute bound, and up to 50% faster for games that are memory bandwidth bound — and potentially the 5060 Ti could close the gap if VRAM capacity comes into play.

There are multiple facets of performance to discuss. We'll start with gaming performance, as that's what the majority of people looking at the RTX 5070 and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB care about the most. We have an expanded test suite of 21 games, with 15 rasterization benchmarks and six ray tracing benchmarks — slightly more than the 18 games we use in our GPU hierarchy (we're planning to add these into the hierarchy but haven't tested every GPU yet).The charts group things together by overall performance (geometric mean across all 21 games, where each gets equal weighting), rasterization-only performance, and ray tracing-only performance. We also have separate tables that show the percentage differences below the charts (sorted in reverse order due to the vagaries of Excel).

It's safe to say that neither the RTX 5070 nor the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB are primarily targeted at native 4K ultra gaming. The 1440p result works as a proxy for 4K with DLSS quality mode upscaling, and the 1080p result stands in for 4K with performance mode upscaling, though there would be potential differences. Upscaling does have some overhead, but since we're looking at two Nvidia GPUs we can expect a pretty consistent delta cause by DLSS. CPU bottlenecks would potentially affect performance at lower resolutions as well, which we can see by the results.At 4K, the RTX 5070 leads the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB by 32% on average, with a performance difference of -5% (Indiana Jones and the Great Circle) to +43% (A Plague Tale: Requiem). Indiana Jones is known to want a lot of VRAM — you can even run the ultra setting on cards with less than 12GB — while various other games appear to want more memory bandwidth.Dropping to 1440p, the 5070 lead shrinks fractionally to 31% overall, and this time there are no performance deficits. There may be a few other games out there that can push beyond 12GB of VRAM use, but from our test suite — a rather demanding suite overall, we'd say — 12GB remains sufficient in all games for 1440p, and in all but one of the games for 4K.1080p starts to run into CPU limits, even more so at medium settings, which shrinks the delta between the 5070 and 5060 Ti to 28% at ultra settings and 24% at medium settings. That's still a sizeable gap, with a few of the games showing basically equivalent performance due to the CPU bottleneck (Baldur's Gate 3, Flight Simulator 2020, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Stalker 2 end up tied in one or both cases).Looking at the rasterization and ray tracing performance, overall there's not much difference at the various resolutions and settings. 4K ultra does run into VRAM limits on one of the RT games, so that the gap is slightly narrower there than at 1440p and 1080p, and our RT test suite does end up with lower FPS than the rasterization games at ultra settings. Medium settings with RT enabled actually runs faster on average for our test games, but only Control and Cyberpunk are truly demanding RT games in our title selection.

Our content creation test suite consists of a variety of test that all loosely fall into the ""professional"" category. We have multiple AI tests, 3D rendering benchmarks, video transcoding performance courtesy of SPEC Workstation 4.0, and the SPEC Workstation 4.0 Viewport benchmarks (basically the same tests as SPECviewperf).

As expected, the RTX 5070 generally walks away with the content creation crown. It's 45% faster in the Blender 3D rendering benchmarks, 33% faster in MLPerf text generation tokens per second, and 20–43 percent faster in the Procyon and SPEC AI tests that we ran. The 5060 Ti 16GB did have a faster time to first token in MLPerf, though it's possible that's due to updates to the benchmark (we'll recheck the 5070 in the near future, once our test rig isn't busy).For SPEC Workstation 4.0's Viewport tests, there's another instance of the 5060 Ti 16GB garnering a win — it's 2% faster in Creo. But overall the 5070 still has a 23% lead. Handbrake video transcoding meanwhile ends up as a tie, which is expected as the fixed function encoding and decoding hardware is the same, so the only difference would be GPU clocks during that test.Neither GPU is specifically marketed as a professional solution, though we anticipate there will be professional variants of both chips (with more VRAM and drivers that enable additional accelerations in some of the SPEC Viewport tests). Mostly, the AI results are interesting as a hobbyist solution, though it's possible future games might leverage the AI hardware more.

Which is better: RTX 5070 or RTX 5060 Ti 16GB? Price, as we said at the start, will arguably be the biggest factor in deciding between the RTX 5070 and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB. It's also the one thing that we can't really pin down at present. Since the 5060 Ti launched just a few days ago, pricing and availability are more likely to fluctuate in the near term. The 5070 has been out for a month now, and we have a better idea of what to expect.

First, let's talk about MSRPs and performance. On paper, Nvidia gives the 5060 Ti 16GB a $429.99 MSRP and the 5070 has a $549.99 MSRP — so $430 and $550. That means the 5070 is supposed to cost 28% more than the 5060 Ti 16GB. And based on the performance results, that's exactly in line with what you get.

Linear performance scaling generally means you're better off buying the more expensive card — we would normally expect to see diminishing returns. So if you buy an RTX 5060 Ti 16GB at MSRP and get 0.171 FPS/$ across our gaming tests, versus the RTX 5070 with 0.170 FPS/$, we give the win to the 5070. The reason is because the GPU doesn't exist in a vacuum; there's the rest of the PC to consider.

Alternatively, let's talk current street prices. These will change dramatically over time, but we can currently find an RTX 5060 Ti 16GB for $509.98, or an RTX 5070 for $619.98. That's the second pair of tables in the above gallery, which obviously skews in favor of the 5070 at current prices. And that's what you need to look at, first and foremost.

Finally, imagine a PC where the CPU, motherboard, SSD, RAM, PSU, and case together cost $750 for example. Now you're looking at a total cost of $1,180 for the 5060 Ti 16GB compared to $1,300 for the 5070 build (using the base MSRPs for the GPUs). That works out to just 10% more total money for about the same 25~30 percent performance uplift. It's what the last set of tables above show, and again, it favors the 5070 heavily.

Given the 25~30 percent performance advantage of the RTX 5070 over the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB, spending up to 30% more on the RTX 5070 would make sense. It's the clear winner at current online prices, or at the given MSRPs. In fact, we would argue that it's worth spending up to 40% more for the 5070 compared to the 5060 Ti, as we normally expect diminishing returns.

We don't know where prices will end up, in the U.S. or elsewhere, but you can use the above 30–40 percent figure as a guideline. If the RTX 5070 were to cost $550, we wouldn't recommend spending more than $425 on the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB — and $400 would be better. Conversely, if the best price you can find on the RTX 5070 ends up being $700, then the 5060 Ti 16GB would be worth $500 to at most $540. (And you can replace the dollar signs with whatever monetary symbol you choose.)

Long-term, we expect both GPUs will trend toward about a 30% higher price for the RTX 5070 vs RTX 5060 Ti 16GB. Anything less makes the slower card very difficult to justify, even if it does technically offer more VRAM. So unless you specifically need a card with 16GB, perhaps to run a particular LLM, the RTX 5070 offers the better overall value right now, and will probably continue to do so in the future.

When it comes to the best gaming laptops, there's been a heavy focus on systems featuring Nvidia's GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for the past two years. However, Nvidia launched new “Blackwell” gaming GPUs for laptops as part of the new RTX 50 Series. As a result, a new wave of gaming laptops is starting to hit the market, and Asus is among the first to jump on the bandwagon.

Enter the ROG Strix Scar 16, a 16-inch class gaming laptop featuring an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of RAM, and an RTX 5080 GPU. While the RTX 5080 isn't the top entry in Nvidia's laptop GPU family, as you'll see, it still packs a punch. However, you will pay a significant price premium ($3,299 as reviewed) to enjoy the latest that Nvidia has to offer.

Asus's ROG family of products is often infused with rather outlandish design touches that help them stand out from the crowded field of gaming laptops, and the ROG Strix Scar 16 is no exception. The first thing you'll notice when removing the laptop from the box is the ROG logo on the lid, which initially looks like a standard reflective chrome badge. However, as soon as you turn the machine on, it lights up in all its RGB glory to add color to the black exterior of the laptop.

But that's not the only illumination on the aluminum lid – Asus also has included a diagonal strip of white LEDs that dance around with a scrolling effect when the laptop is in standby mode. Asus calls it AniMe Vision, which features an array of 810 LED lights that shine through the milled holes in the lid. When the laptop is turned on, flashes of light display “STRIX” branding by default. There are several premade animations you can select from, or you can import a GIF of your own to customize your laptop further.

Wait, there's more! An RGB light ring runs around the entire perimeter of the bottom half of the enclosure, and the keyboard features per-key RGB lighting. The ROG Strix Scar 16's lighting can be configured using Aura Sync in Armory Crate.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 features a 16-inch 2560 x 1600 display with thin bezels along the sides. The top bezel is thicker to accommodate the 1080p webcam and infrared sensors for Windows Hello that are front and center. The bottom bezel is larger still, roughly twice as wide as the top bezel, and incorporates ROG STRIX branding.

The keyboard deck and the chassis bottom are constructed of plastic. Although I would have preferred an aluminum unibody at this price point, the plastic at least feels high quality.

A massive touchpad sits below the keyboard and features Asus' virtual NumberPad feature. After pressing NUMLK on the top right-hand corner of the touchpad, it lights up with a full number pad that you can use to make quick entries in apps like Calculator or Microsoft Excel. It works well enough, and I find it a suitable alternative to including a full physical number pad on the keyboard, especially if it's a feature you won't use frequently.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 is a big laptop, and Asus thankfully puts the space to use by incorporating a large assortment of ports for connectivity. You'll find just two USB 3.2 Type-A ports on the right side. However, the bulk of the connections are on the left side, which is home to a proprietary power connector, a full-size 2.5 GbE LAN port, an HDMI 2.1 port, another USB 3.2 Type-A port, two Thunderbolt 5 ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Regarding wireless connectivity, the ROG Strix Scar 16 has an Intel BE200 card, which combines Wi-Fi 7 with Bluetooth 5.4.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 measures 13.94 x 10.55 x 0.90 inches and weighs 6.28 pounds. For comparison, the Razer Blade 16 is 13.98 x 9.86 x 0.69 inches and weighs 4.72 pounds, while the 5.67-pound Alienware x16 is 14.36 x 11.41 x 0.73 inches. The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 weighs 5.4 pounds and measures 14.06 x 10.0 x 1.18 inches.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 features high-end hardware, including an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, a GeForce RTX 5080 laptop GPU, and 32GB of DDR5-5600 memory. The Core Ultra 9 275HX has 8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores. The performance cores have a base clock of 2.7 GHz and a maximum turbo clock of 5.4 GHz, while the efficiency cores have a 2.1-GHz base clock and a maximum 4.6 GHz turbo clock. The RTX 5080 has a 175W TGP and a 1,500 MHz boost clock.

I had time to play various games on the ROG Strix Scar 16, but I spent most of my time running and gunning in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The game is a visual masterpiece with its lush environment, high-quality textures, realistic reflections, and intricate detail of real-world objects. With the resolution set to 1440p and the detail setting cranked to “Ultra,” I averaged between 70 and 100 fps in the game, depending on how much action took place on-screen.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 started strong in our Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest setting) benchmark, delivering 177 fps at 1080p. Performance at 1600p fell sharply to just 112 fps. The Aorus Master 16 (Core Ultra 9 275HX, RTX 5080) took the crown at 1080p (185 fps), and scored slightly more than Asus at 1600p (114 fps). For comparison, the Blade 16 (Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, RTX 5090) delivered 166 fps at 1080p, but vastly outperformed at 1600p (161 fps). The x16 (Core i9-13900HK, RTX 4080) was at the back of the pack, achieving 117 fps at 1080p and 79 fps at 1600p.

Cyberpunk 2077 (Ray Tracing Ultra settings) was the most recent game added to our benchmark suite, so the x16 didn't make the cutoff for testing. However, we do have a showdown between the systems with Blackwell GPUs. The ROG Strix Scar 16 hit 61 fps at 1800p and 35 fps at 1600p. The Aorus Master 16 performed similarly, with 62 fps at 1080p and 38 fps at 1600p. The Blade 16 surpassed those numbers by around 10 percent at both resolutions, with 66 fps at 1080p and 43 fps at 1600p.

Far Cry 6 (Ultra settings) saw another flip-flop in the rankings, with the Aorus Master 16 besting all competitors, including the RTX 5090-equipped Blade 16. It averaged 120 fps at 1080p and 113 fps at 1600p. The ROG Strix Scar 16 was a few ticks behind at 112 fps and 103 fps, respectively. The Blade 16 performed more in line with the x16 at 1080p (each hitting 97 fps), while its 94 fps at 1600p was enough to earn second place.

Red Dead Redemption 2 (Medium settings) proved to be a challenge for the ROG Strix Scar 16, and is a testament to the early driver issues that have plagued Nvidia's RTX 50 Series laptops GPUs (as we noted in our Blade 16 review). The system would not run the benchmark at 1080p resolution. It would, however, run at 2560 x 1600, and we recorded 77 fps at that resolution. The Aorus Master 16 fared even worse, managing just 54 fps at 1600p.

The Aorus Master 16 won the Borderlands 3 (Badass settings) benchmark showdown by default — our Blade 16 couldn't even run the benchmark, achieving a heady 172 fps at 1080p and 121 fps at 1600p. The ROG Strix Scar 16 was the next-closest competitor with 156 fps and 113 fps at 1080p and 1600p, respectively.

We use Metro Exodus for our stress testing, running the in-game benchmark 10 consecutive times using the RTX preset. During the test, the ROG Strix Scar 16's efficiency and performance cores averaged 3.11 GHz and 4.61 GHz, respectively, with a CPU temperature of 74 degrees Celsius. The RTX 5080 averaged 1.845 GHz with a core temperature of 72 degrees C.

Thanks to its use of a Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of DDR5-5600, and a fast Western Digital SN8000S PCIe 4.0 SSD, the ROG Strix Scar 16 proved to be a top performer in our productivity suite.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 quickly shot to the top of the Geekbench 6 synthetic CPU benchmark charts. It recorded a single-core score of 3,071 and a multi-core score of 19,597. This put it slightly ahead of the Aorus Master 16 with the same processor, which came in at 3,049 and 19,175, respectively. The Blade 16 with its Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor was a bit behind the rest of the pack (2,922, 16,025). The x16 was one of the last laptops we tested with Geekbench 5.x, so it is not represented here.

Switching gears to our file transfer test, which involves copying 25GB of mixed-media files, the ROG Strix Scar 16 delivered a speedy 1,841.40 MBps. For comparison, the Omen 16 led the pack at 1,913 MBps, while the Blade 16 came in at 1,729.51 MBps. The Aorus Master 16 was dead last at 665.26 MBps.

We use our Handbrake benchmark to transcode a 4K video file to 1080p, with the Aorus Master 16 and ROG Strix Scar 16 handily besting the competition — it wasn't even close. The former took just 2 minutes and 17 seconds to finish the operation, while the latter took 2 minutes and 22 seconds. The x16 with its older processor took over 4 minutes on the test.

Asus equipped the ROG Strix Scar 16 with a 16-inch 2560 x 1600 display with Mini LED backlighting. Given its gaming aspirations, the panel refreshes at up to 240 Hz, which makes it a great dance partner for the RTX 5080.

Our tests showed that the ROG Strix Scar 16's panel covered 81.2 percent of DCI-P3 and 114.7 percent of sRGB. The Mini LED backlighting allowed the laptop to stand far above its peers in brightness, as we saw 457.2 nits with SDR content. Brightness with HDR content topped 1,200 nits, which tracks with Asus's claim of 1,200 nits.



I played several games on the display, including Forza Horizon 5, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Action was smooth and tear-free, with vibrant colors all around.

Asus outfitted the ROG Strix Scar 16 with a full-size keyboard, offering 2mm of key travel. Four media keys are tacked on to the right side of the keyboard: Play, Pause, Previous Track, and Next Track. There are also five programmable “M” keys at the top of the keyboard deck that correspond with volume up/down, microphone off, power mode (which cycles through Silent, Performance, and Turbo), and a shortcut for Armoury Crate. The function of each button can be configured using Armoury Crate.



Using the keyhero.com typing test, I achieved 90 words per minute at 97.93 percent accuracy with the keyboard. It's not my best performance with a laptop keyboard, as my fingers had to stretch a bit more than I'm used to, which slowed me down a bit.

You'll find a rather large glass trackpad below the keyboard, which I found to operate smoothly, with a satisfying click response. As previously mentioned, the touchpad includes Asus' nifty NumberPad feature, which instantly displays a touch-enabled number pad when you tap the NUMLK.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 features four speakers (two tweeters plus two woofers). I found the audio quite good, with loud and clear volume (I didn't go past 80 percent to save my hearing) and adequate bass.

I played some tunes with the laptop, including “Something in My Heart” by Röyksopp. The electronic drums and bass synth sounded pleasing to me along with the quavery vocals. The real test, though, was with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, where the sound effects were particularly poignant, from the whip cracks to Indy's feverish punches, to the grunts he makes when he jumps from ledges. I still prefer to opt for one of the best gaming headsets when listening to music or gaming, but you won't be disappointed by the audio system in the ROG Strix Scar 16.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 is one of the easiest laptops that I've ever had the opportunity to open. When I first flipped the laptop over to expose its bottom panel, I was perplexed as to how to open it -- there were no visible screws to remove. I started poking around at the rubber feet to see if those needed to be removed, but they wouldn't budge. Then, I noticed a small latch at the front of the chassis with an arrow on it.

I pushed the latch in the direction of the arrow, and it slid over, revealing a red indicator. This red indicator signified that the bottom panel was unlatched. I then slid the panel toward me and was able to lift it off the chassis, exposing the interior. It's a simple system, and I'm surprised that more manufacturers haven't integrated something similar.

With the bottom panel removed, you can access the system's upgradeable components. Unlike more compact ultraportables that have RAM soldered onto the motherboard, the ROG Strix Scar 16 has two SO-DIMM slots — our review unit had both slots occupied with 16GB DDR5-5600 SO-DIMMs.

In addition, two M.2 slots accommodate full-length 2280 SSDs (only one was populated on our review unit). Even better, the ROG Strix Scar 16 supports the PCIe 5.0 interface, although our review unit was equipped with a Western Digital SN8000S 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD. However, it's nice to know that the option is available if you want to upgrade to a faster SSD interface.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 uses a 90 Whr battery. To see how long the laptop can operate on a charge, we ran it through our usual endurance benchmark — our test browses the web, streams videos, and runs light OpenGL tests with the brightness set to 150 nits.



In the end, the ROG Strix Scar 16 lasted 6 hours and 30 minutes. That put it in second place behind the Blade 16, which lasted 7 hours and 21 minutes.

The x16 (5:37) and Aorus Master 16 (5:02) were further back in the pack when it comes to endurance.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 does an excellent job of exhausting heat generated by its top-shelf hardware components with its twin internal fans. While running the Metro Exodus stress test, the bottom of the chassis was warm to the touch but not uncomfortable. The fans audibly spun during the entire test, but the sound was not objectionable and was easily overpowered by the internal speakers (or a pair of the best headphones, if you wish).

Our temperature measurements showed that the keyboard was 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit between the G and H keys, while the touchpad was much cooler at 82.7 degrees F. The underside of the chassis measured 119.6 degrees F, and the hottest part of the keyboard that we measured was between the F5 and F6 keys (120.3 degrees F).

Like most new laptops arriving on the market these days, Asus has outfitted the ROG Strix Scar 16 with a 1080p webcam. Given the $3,300 price tag, it would have been nice to have seen some more impressive hardware – video and images came out slightly grainy, although overall colors and skin tones were accurate.

The camera is more than adequate for videoconferencing, but I'd look for a third-party setup if you're into game streaming.

Asus includes several apps with the ROG Strix Scar 16, including the oft-maligned Armoury Crate. Armoury Crate is an all-in-one software utility for controlling performance profiles to adjust RGB effects for the chassis and keyboard (with Aura Sync). It can even control the AniMe display on the lid using AniMe Vision. AniMe Vision allows you to upload your own GIFs to customize the LED display on the lid.

Other apps preinstalled include MyAsus, which allows you to register your device, perform system upgrades, and run hardware diagnostics. CapCut is a short-form video and graphics editing app, ScreenXpert is a window manager for use across multiple displays, while GlideX is a screen sharing app.

The most annoying preinstalled app, however, is McAfee. The app continually bombards you with pop-ups and warns that your trial period will soon end. I'd immediately ditch the app and rely on Microsoft Defender or any less resource-intensive anti-malware app.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 comes with a one-year warranty from Asus.

The ROG Strix Scar 16 is available in two configurations from Asus, with our review unit being the cheapest offering. The system features an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB DDR5 memory, 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, RTX 5080, and a 16-inch 2560 x 1600 Mini LED 240Hz display. As configured, this system costs a staggering $3,299.99.

Currently, the only other configuration is this same system with an RTX 5090 instead of the RTX 5080 – all other specifications are the same. The premium to jump from the RTX 5080 to the RTX 5090 is substantial, as the flagship system costs $4,299.

Both systems are only available directly from the Asus online store.



The Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 has a strong foundation, with a solid chassis, plentiful ports (including 2.5 GbE), Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, a fast SSD (which is further futureproofed with PCIe 5.0-enabled M.2 slots), and a vibrant 1600p Mini LED panel.

The wildcard with this laptop comes down to the RTX 5080 graphics card. While overall performance was strong, lingering driver issues still prevent consistent playback with some popular video games. It's likely that future driver issues may lessen or even completely resolve these performance and compatibility issues. However, if you're spending over $3,000 on a new gaming laptop, you don't want any barriers to entry in whatever game may be in your library.

 April 21, 2025  

The story of how Erin McKean, MD, ended up in, as she puts it, the “weird small niche field” of minimally invasive, ventral skull base surgeries — operating on sinonasal cancers and pituitary tumors for instance — might never have happened had she not met her mentor.

The first in her family to go to medical school — McKean comes from a long line of public-school teachers and skilled tradespeople — she hadn't even considered pursuing surgery until meeting her mentor at one of her medical school's career exploration events.

“In talking with her, understanding her research — which was super interesting — and then spending time with her in the [operating room] it just opened my eyes like, ‘this is an amazing field,'” McKean said.

Choosing a medical specialty is one of the most important decisions a medical student makes as it has the potential to define their future career. It's “incredibly important” to choose your specialty wisely, said McKean, who also serves as assistant dean for student affairs at University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Some of the most important factors to consider when choosing a specialty may be personal fit and whether the specialty aligns with your passions, skills, and values. Other factors to think about are salary, benefits, and lifestyle, McKean said.

Medical students are also looking at factors like burnout, politics, overall wellness, and community impact, Annelise Silva-Chong, MD, a recent medical school graduate, said in an email. They are also examining where specialty leaders are directing any particular field.

“Of course, students are also looking at how AI [artificial intelligence] will be impacting specialties as well,” she said.

While it's important for medical students to choose a career path that will bring them job satisfaction and personal fulfillment — perhaps a chance to innovate, too — it may also be worth noting which medical fields are the fastest growing and/or appear to have the best job security.

The following three specialties are the fastest growing, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Projections Program. Projections for growth by the year 2033 are as follows: 

Others that are projected for growth are:

With aging, the risks for chronic health conditions such as dementia, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and cancer increase.

According to a report from the American Geriatrics Society, 30,000 geriatricians are likely to be needed by 2030 to take care of about 21 million older adults. Nearly a quarter of the population is expected to be 65 years or older by 2060, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It doesn't look like the need for geriatricians is going away anytime soon. 

The primary care fields of internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics are likely to remain in strong demand over time as well. There will be a projected shortage of between 20,200 and 40,400 primary care physicians by 2036, according to “The Complexities of Physician Supply and Demand: Projections From 2021 to 2036 Summary Report,” published in March 2024 by Association of American Medical Colleges, 

“The job market is huge,” McKean said, “…and we need leaders and innovators in care delivery and interprofessional team leadership.”

“I think with wearable technologies and advanced practice scope for other healthcare professionals, we need team leaders and physicians who can bring all the data together,” she added.

The popularity of emergency medicine went down during the COVID pandemic, McKean said, “but I think its popularity is picking back up.” The popular emergency room medical drama, “The Pitt,” which streams on Max, is probably affecting that, she said, acknowledging that TV shows can affect how medical students choose their specialties “for better or worse.” 

Additionally, “there's all kinds of neat technology for acute assessment,” she said of the field. “I think it's a cool, cool space.”

There have been concerns about AI affecting certain medical specialties that are image-based such as radiology, pathology, and dermatology in recent years. However, the idea that AI would replace these image-based fields was universally rejected by a 2022 panel of experts hosted by The Society of Imaging Informatics in Medicine.

The field of radiology has changed significantly in recent years and is always evolving, said Omer Awan, MD, professor and vice chair of education for the Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine at University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore.

AI has already come to the forefront in radiology and that's because the field is inherently dependent on technology, he said.

“Now, do I think AI will replace radiologists? The answer is a very fervent and absolutely no,” Awan emphasized.

While AI is a tool that should be used under physician guidance, it will continue to augment the field of radiology, he said. For example, AI currently helps radiologists detect breast cancers on mammograms, head bleeds on CT scans, and certain small pulmonary nodules on chest x-rays. “And the list goes on,” he said.

There is lot of apprehension from medical students who may be uncertain about the future of radiology, Awan admitted. “They maybe falsely believe that AI may potentially be a threat to them.”

“But what I want all medical students to understand is that that couldn't be further from the truth. I think that AI will really help us and AI will allow us to do our job better and will actually augment the field,” he said.

Medical students may also wonder which medical specialties have the highest income potential and/or the best work/life balance.

According to Medscape's 2024 Physician Compensation Report, the highest paying specialties include: 

Primary care specialties rank within the 20 lowest paying fields. Internal medicine has an average annual salary of $282,000, family medicine is at $272,000, and general pediatrics comes in at $260,000. Diabetes and endocrinology rank last at $256,000.

“Procedural specialties have the high salary potential in the current model,” McKean said, “but I would say even in primary care, there are folks that are doing lifestyle medicine and incorporating wellness and medi spas into their practice and more holistic medicine. So there are some revenue generators that may flip that on its head.”

The other thing here is for medical students to be aware of their risk tolerance, McKean suggested. If you can't tolerate bad outcomes or adverse events, you should not go into a specialty that focuses on procedures because they are inevitable.

Awan had noticed a trend in the last 5-10 years of medical students seeking specialties that are professionally fulfilling but also provide adequate time outside of medicine. “I think a lot of medical students gravitate towards fields that give a nice work life balance,” he said.

Workload, personal responsibility, flexibility, workplace culture, and supports at work, as well as how well an individual manages time and stress, are all factors that go into work/life balance.

“The Family Medicine Physician Lifestyle, Happiness and Burnout Report 2023,” in which Medscape surveyed more than 9100 physicians across more than 29 specialties, found that doctors from the following specialties were happiest outside of work before the pandemic:

“It's long been said since I was in med school: Stay on the ROAD…Radiology, Ophthalmology, Anesthesiology, and Dermatology,” McKean said about specialties that are best for families.

These fields have traditionally been “where you come in, you're able to do your clinic, do your procedures or whatever for the day, get done at a reasonable time, and not have a lot of inpatient care or high-risk follow-up. And go home and spend time with your family,” she said.

“But there's caveats in every field,” she acknowledged, “and I think you can make any field more intense and any field less intense.”

Family medicine embraces family culture, McKean said, and she admires that.

“If there's some mom who needs to pump or just [have] the ability to like do the things you need to do to be a mom and have that be well accepted, I do see culturally that family medicine is way ahead of most other fields,” she said.

However, McKean does not want to discourage women who want to have children from pursuing fields of medicine that may be seen as less family friendly. “You can find your niche, and you can make it happen in any field,” she said.

“If you find that you are really good in the operating room, and it brings you joy and life, don't discount that either.”

McKean sees herself as a “very proud mom who's also a busy surgeon,” If you want to be a mother and go into surgery, “I still think it's great to be a surgeon, but you do have to accept…some limitations of your time. Your time is stretched,” she acknowledged.

Whatever field of medicine a medical student decides to pursue, be prepared for growth and change, McKean said.

“About 80% of what I do in my practice, I didn't directly train in in med school or residency,” she said. “It's been building on the skills and the education I have. So what's new? What's interesting? Where can you innovate? And what will it look like in 10 years? That's going to be different than what it looks like now.”

A panel of dermatologists reached a consensus on 23 topical ingredients that they considered useful for seven common skin concerns, with retinoids recommended for five of those conditions.

“Given the proliferation of novel and reformulated cosmetic ingredients and the relentless advertising and marketing campaigns touting the benefits of the products that contain them, selecting among such products and deciding which ingredients to prioritize can be a bewildering task even for well-informed patients and their doctors,” the authors wrote. “Patients and their dermatologists can use this information as a starting point for building a skincare routine,” they added.

The study was led by Gabriella V. Alvarez, MD, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, and was published online in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

The study relied on an expert panel composed of practicing cosmetic dermatologists who were also professors, researchers, and teachers of cosmetic dermatology. Additionally, all results were based on expert opinion rather than systematic review or meta-analysis.

The authors reported that no funding was received for this study. Some authors reported receiving consulting, travel, and advisory fees; serving as investigator; and owning stocks in various cosmetic and pharmaceutical companies, including Revision, Sente, and L'Oréal. One author reported being the founder of DAR Companies.

A novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool can help interpret and assess treatment efficacy in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), new research suggested.

MindGlide is a deep learning model that can extract key biomarkers, including lesion load and brain volume changes, from MRI scans acquired during the care of patients with MS.

“Using MindGlide will enable us to use existing brain images in hospital archives to better understand multiple sclerosis and how treatment affects the brain,” first author Philipp Goebl, PhD student, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and UCL Hawkes Institute, both in London, England, said in a press release.

The study was published online on April 7 in Nature Communications.

MS affects over 2.8 million people globally, with a notable burden on younger adults. MRI biomarkers are central to phase 2 and 3 trials, with multicontrast scans used to track new or enlarging lesions and neurodegeneration. However, these protocols are time- and resource-intensive, limiting use in routine care, the investigators noted.

They added that simplified approaches using single-contrast volumetry could help extract meaningful atrophy data from existing clinical scans, expanding research opportunities and reducing trial costs. Routine monitoring focuses on lesion activity, brain atrophy — an important marker of worsening disability — is often underutilized due to scan heterogeneity and lack of automation tools.

MindGlide was developed to address these limitations, enabling detection of clinically relevant biomarkers in “ highly heterogeneous scans independent of contrasts, resolutions, and qualities.”

The investigators trained MindGlide using an initial dataset of 4247 brain MRI scans from 2934 patients with MS across 592 scanners. During this process, the tool trained itself to identify markers of MS.

The goal of the study was to validate MindGlide using 14,952 images from 1001 patients drawn from two clinical trials in primary and secondary progressive MS, as well as a routine-care MS dataset.

When tested against expert-labeled lesion volumes, the model outperformed two state-of-the-art models — SAMSEG, which identifies and outlines lesions and brain structures across MRI contrast, and WMH-SynthSeg, which detects small bright spots on scans — in lesion volume detection, sensitivity, and dice score.

In the clinical trials, MindGlide detected treatment effects on T2-lesion accrual and cortical and deep gray matter volume loss. Results showed that AI tool accurately assessed effects of disease-modifying therapies in clinical trials and routine-care cohorts, particularly neurodegeneration and disease activity.

“The process took 5-10 seconds per image,” investigators noted.

Using dice scores, the tool accurately quantified white matter lesions, cortical and deep gray matter volumes, with MindGlide-derived volumes showing higher correlation with Expanded Disability Status Scale than SAMSEG and WMH-SynthSeg, although “differences were not statistically significant for all comparisons.”

Additionally, MindGlide was better than standard tools in quantifying the differences in lesion volume between treatment and placebo groups in the primary progressive MS trial, with 5.31% in FLAIR and 4.62% in T2, and its results were the closest to ground truth labels from expert neuroradiologists (P < .001 for all).

In contrast, longitudinal SAMSEG overestimated with 10.70% in FLAIR (P = .004) and 8.81% in T2 (P = .001), whereas WMH-SynthSeg underestimated with 2.56% in FLAIR and 2.45% in T2 (P < .001 for both).

“We hope that the tool will unlock valuable information from millions of untapped brain images that were previously difficult or impossible to understand, immediately leading to valuable insights into multiple sclerosis for researchers and, in the near future, to better understand a patient's condition through AI in the clinic. We hope this will be possible in the next 5-10 years,” said Goebl.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was associated with increased risks for various adverse kidney outcomes, including new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD) and worsening kidney function in patients younger than 21 years. Those with preexisting CKD or acute kidney injury (AKI) faced higher risks for severe adverse outcomes such as dialysis or kidney transplant.

“Results of this study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased risk of adverse kidney outcomes, including new-onset CKD and worsening kidney function, particularly among children with preexisting CKD or acute-phase AKI, underscoring the importance of long-term monitoring for kidney health in children and adolescents affected by COVID-19,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Lu Li, MA, of the Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. It was published online in JAMA Network Open.

The study could not definitively attribute the increased risk in patients with preexisting CKD to COVID-19 alone, as other factors may have contributed. Home testing results that were not visible in electronic health records may have led to misclassification in the control group. Hospital-based testing may have introduced bias, as these patients could have been more severely ill.

The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health as part of the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery research initiative. Some authors reported receiving grant support and personal fees from various pharmaceutical companies and institutes. Two authors reported receiving an editorial stipend, and one author reported having a patent with royalties paid.

Keith C. Ferdinand, MD

DISCLOSURES |  April 21, 2025  



Two new options that provide significant blood pressure (BP) reduction — one a novel drug, the other a low-dose triple therapy — and the effectiveness of renal denervation (RDN) for treatment-resistant BP are among the highlights from the 2025 American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session.

Keith Ferdinand, from Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, starts with the late-breaking pivotal phase 2b trial of the aldosterone synthase inhibitor lorundrostat. The drug effectively lowered 24-hour blood pressure in patients who had uncontrolled hypertension while on standard antihypertensive regimen.

Next, he discusses a meta-analysis of low-dose triple-pill combination therapy that showed significant reductions in systolic and diastolic BP. Compared with controls, more patients on the triple therapy achieved target BP, with no increase in adverse events.

He then turns to a meta-analysis of catheter- vs ultrasonography-based RDN trials for hypertension treatment. Although catheter-based RDN was shown to be more effective, Dr Ferdinand questions the benefit of the BP reduction achieved.

He next reports on the PRECISION trial, which found that adding aprocitentan to SGLT2 inhibition reduces albuminuria and systolic blood pressure in people with diabetes.

Finally, Dr Ferdinand reports on a phase 1b trial indicating that the atrial natriuretic peptide MANP is equally effective in African American and non-African American patients with resistant hypertension.

To assess how a patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is faring on therapy, look at the right heart, said Anjali Vaidya, MD, in a presentation at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Cardiology.

When it comes to right heart performance, “the echo doesn't lie,” said Vaidya, a professor of medicine and co-director of the Advanced Pulmonary Hypertension Program at Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia.

Vaidya offered several tools and tips for optimal management of PAH.

Look at right heart performance to assess how a patient is doing on therapy, Vaidya said. She cited a 2017 study showing that differences in right ventricular (RV) morphology, rather than function, could be indicators of increased afterload in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and normal left ventricular function. Additionally, multiple high-risk echocardiographic features representing RV function, tricuspid valve regurgitation, and estimation of right atrial pressure have been shown to predict mortality in PAH, as published in the European Respiratory Journal and American Heart Journal.

Guidelines published in 2022 by the European Society of Cardiology and European Respiratory Society also emphasized the value of various right heart parameters, Vaidya said.

The guidelines included clinical right heart failure, biomarkers such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of BNP, right atrial area, RV function, and cardiac output as indicators of low, medium, and high risk, respectively, of estimated 1-year mortality in patients with PAH.

Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) is another measure of RV function and risk in PAH, Vaidya said in her presentation. In a recent study published in Circulation: Heart Failure, researchers found that dividing TAPSE by RV area provided added value in predicting adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Guidelines published in 2025 by the American Society of Echocardiography for echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults with PAH include novel techniques such as three-dimensional (3D) images to show RV volume and assessment of right atrial function across the cardiac cycle, said Vaidya.

Although 3D imaging is referenced in current guidelines, a new virtual echocardiography screening tool (VEST) developed by Vaidya and colleagues offers broadly accessible PAH screening that is less reliant on advanced expertise in cardiology or echocardiography.

In an initial study published in 2020, VEST was 80% sensitive and 76% specific in predicting PAH hemodynamics. The VEST score is based on three routine echocardiographic metrics: Left atrial size, transmitral E:e' ratio (using tissue Doppler), and the presence or absence of interventricular systolic septal flattening, Vaidya said.

In a 2023 study published in The American Journal of Cardiology, Vaidya and colleagues applied the VEST algorithm to echocardiographic reports several months prior to evaluation at a PAH referral center. They found that more than 90% of patients with PAH had ECG reports with positive VEST scores.

In the most recent research on VEST, published online in the American Heart Journal, Vaidya and colleagues developed an algorithm based on electronic medical record data that was 100% accurate in calculating VEST scores. A score of +3 identified patients at highest risk for PH and for referral to a PH center. The study population included 554 adults who underwent transthoracic ECG with elevated pulmonary pressure estimation. Of the highest risk patients, nearly one third had not been clinically recognized and referred to an accredited center for PH care, Vaidya noted. “Of those who had been evaluated in an accredited PH center, 95% had undergone the gold standard of testing compared to only 37% of those who had not,” she said in the presentation.

VEST can potentially change practice by helping physicians who do not have training and expertise in advanced echocardiography interpretation to recognize patients at high risk for PAH much easier and earlier, Vaidya said in an interview.

“We are studying this with implementation across more health centers for broader applicability to help identify patients who would benefit from expedited PH expertise,” she told Medscape Medical News. More research is needed, but the results support VEST as an accessible and accurate tool for earlier diagnosis and referrals to improve patient outcomes, Vaidya said.

Echocardiography is an excellent screening tool for PH, as it is noninvasive and well-tolerated and carries minimal risk, with no radiation, said Nicholas Hill, MD, a pulmonologist at Tufts Medicine, Boston, in an interview.

Echocardiology provides very useful data in evaluating and monitoring patients with PH, said Hill. “However, there are challenges related to the complex morphology of the RV, patient factors such as obesity or parenchymal lung disease, variability in technical skills of those performing echoes, and interobserver variability between readers,” he said.

“Estimation of RV systolic pressure has inherent inaccuracies and may either over- or underestimate measurements made at right heart catheterization,” he said. “Early detection may be challenging because the right side of the heart may be subtle and hard to detect unless the disease is more advanced,” he added.

The VEST screening tool is based on three routine measurements that are likely to detect fairly early changes, Hill told Medscape Medical News. “It has the potential to facilitate early detection, and it also helps to differentiate noninvasively between groups 1 and 2 PH,” he said.

Although VEST seems to perform well at enhancing detection of PH at a single center, studies at other institutions to test generalizability are important, said Hill. Other potential research might address whether the measurements used in VEST are the best echo measurements for detecting PH and whether combination with other simple non-echo assessments might be assessed, he added.

Vaidya had no financial conflicts to disclose. Hill had no financial conflicts to disclose.

 April 21, 2025  

A French start-up, Robeauté, has raised €27 million ($29 million) to advance the development of its neurosurgical microrobot. This rice-sized device is designed to navigate the brain while avoiding high-risk areas. Its first clinical trial is planned for 2026, focusing on performing microbiopsies on brain tumors.

“The microrobot minimizes trauma and enhances precision during neurosurgery,” Arthur André, MD, neurosurgeon at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, AP-HP, in Paris, France, who participated in the preclinical animal trials, told Medscape's French edition.

While the robot's primary evaluation will focus on cerebral oncology, specifically for performing biopsies, it is also being considered for other applications, such as administering targeted therapies locally and improving the placement of deep brain stimulation electrodes in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Traditional neurosurgery relies on rigid tools, such as electrode holders or needles, which operate in straight lines. “We choose the least traumatic paths, but avoiding functional brain areas remains difficult,” said André, who specializes in minimally invasive procedures.

The risk of altering a patient's motor or cognitive faculties with traditional interventions significantly limits the ability to operate with precision and can even prevent access to certain areas of the brain. In some cases, brain tumors are considered inoperable due to these constraints.

The microrobot is inserted into the brain through a small hole, just a few millimeters in diameter, made in the skull. It can navigate the brain's extracellular matrix and vascular network along curved paths to reach the target sites. The silicone rings of the robot rotate at their tips, gently pushing aside tissues aided by adhesion forces at this scale. Real-time navigation is guided by imaging and ultrasound sensors placed on the skull of the patient.

The rings act like “a small helix that fractures without damaging cells, creating a path through the brain,” explained André. The microrobot moved smoothly at 3 mm/min and followed the same path when exiting.

Below the motor is a compartment that holds small instruments controlled by an external cable. A biopsy is performed using a flexible needle, and a small forceps grabs the tissue, which is either stored inside or pulled out through the cable.

Another unique feature of this microrobot is its trajectory to the target, which is preplanned using AI and MRI scans to avoid high-risk areas of the brain. Surgeons can adjust the movement of the robot in real time using an onboard ultrasound localization system. “The accuracy is within half a millimeter,” André noted.

This integration of imaging and ultrasound allows the robot to navigate in real time inside the brain and reach its target. For oncology biopsies, “we can sample from the tumor site and also study the behavior of cells in the peri-tumoral area,” particularly to assess the immune response and cancer progression.

Preclinical trials, primarily conducted on sheep, have assessed the safety and efficiency of the device. These trials focused on ensuring that there were no side effects, particularly hematomas, after the use of microrobots. The results were promising enough to advance to clinical trials in humans.

To further develop the device, Robeauté plans to open a branch in the United States with the aim of obtaining approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and launching the device internationally by 2030. The first clinical trial, scheduled for early 2026, will be an international study involving the United States, Germany, and potentially France, through AP-HP, André noted.

“The trial will initially evaluate the robot's ability to perform multisite biopsies in oncology. Future applications may include the use of the device to deliver targeted therapies directly to tumor sites, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. Brain oncology increasingly gives way to personalized treatments, such as targeted therapies or immunotherapies, based on the tumor's biological profile. Beyond biopsies, the robot can deliver treatments directly to tumor sites,” explained André.

The applications of this robot extend beyond oncology. It may also play a role in treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. In particular, it could help with the precise placement of electrodes for deep brain stimulation.

“With standard electrode implantation, it is sometimes difficult to find the exact sites to stimulate the subthalamic nucleus. The robot could make this process more efficient, advancing the standard of deep brain stimulation,” said André.

In a press release, Bertrand Duplat, co-founder and CEO of Robeauté, stated, “There is unexplored potential for microrobots in medicine. Current neurosurgery techniques are invasive and can be fatal, and it is difficult for treatments to pass the blood-brain barrier and reach their intended target. We're creating microrobots that will bring unparalleled access to the brain with personalized, precision medicine that can transform treatments and patient outcomes.”

Microrobots incorporate cutting-edge technologies, including a tiny engine, propeller, and steering system, enabling surgeons to track their movements in real time.

In patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who received induction-concurrent (chemo)radiotherapy, persistent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA positivity or its resurgence during treatment was associated with worse survival outcomes, whereas rapid clearance of EBV DNA following induction chemotherapy was associated with better survival.

“Our findings underscore the importance of dynamic EBV DNA monitoring for individualized treatment of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma,” the researchers concluded. “The temporal clearance pattern EBV DNA can offer additional prognostic insights beyond single timepoint measurements in [nasopharyngeal carcinoma]. Persistent EBV DNA positivity and resurgence during treatment are associated with poorer outcomes, whereas rapid clearance following [induction chemotherapy] is indicative of a favorable prognosis.”

The study, led by Zongwei Huang, MD, PhD, Clinical Oncology School of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, China, was published online in International Journal of Radiation Oncology - Biology - Physics.

The exclusion of patients who did not undergo induction chemotherapy might have led to selection bias. Differences in treatment intensity and patient stratification could have affected clinical outcomes. As this study was conducted at a single center, results might not be applicable to a broader population.

The study was supported by grants from the Fujian Provincial Clinical Research Center for Cancer Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy, National Clinical Key Specialty Construction Program, Fujian Clinical Research Center for Radiation and Therapy of Digestive, Respiratory and Genitourinary Malignancies, and other organizations.

 April 21, 2025  

ORLANDO, Florida — Two lasers developed specifically to target the sebaceous gland were cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of acne vulgaris in 2022, but it is unclear whether there are meaningful clinical differences between them.

The good news has been the relatively high rates of efficacy reported with both devices, but Fernanda H. Sakamoto, MD, PhD, Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, in describing their differences, indicated that they are not necessarily interchangeable.

The devices “use the same wavelengths, but they actually employ two different strategies,” reported Sakamoto, who hypothesized in 2012 that laser light targeted at the sebaceous gland would likely be an effective therapy for acne. She listed 1760 nm at that time as a potential therapeutic wavelength for this purpose, and the introduction of the two devices have validated this hypothesis.

Now, 3 years after two 1760-nm lasers have become available for the treatment of acne, Sakamoto provided an update on their utility and relative roles in a symposium on therapeutic lasers at the American Academy of Dermatology 2025 Annual Meeting. 

AviClear (manufactured by Cutera), the first of the sebaceous gland-specific lasers, was introduced a few months before the second, Accure (manufactured by Accure). According to Sakamoto, the studies that led to FDA clearance demonstrated rates of acne treatment efficacy that were at least comparable with those of other options but often with far more durable responses.

These effects are consistent with the expectation that photothermolysis of the sebaceous gland would prevent or reduce sebum production, which is a substrate of Cutibacterium acnes, the inflammation-inducing bacterium considered to be among one of the most common causes of acne vulgaris.

While the wavelength of the laser energy of the two devices is the same, there are multiple distinctions that have the potential to affect efficacy or safety. AviClear features diode delivery of energy in pulse modes and cooling delivered by a sapphire plate in contact with the skin. Accure employs fiber delivery of energy monitored continuously. Once the target temperature is reached, the device provides cool air that blows on the skin. 

At the surface of the skin, AviClear has a single spot size of 3.0 mm but with a seven-spot hexagonal array creating a 10-mm cumulative spot. Accure provides a spot size of 4.7 mm. Treatment depths range from 200 to 750 microns with AviClear and from 450 to 1750 microns with Accure. The greater depth of the Accure device is related to its larger spot size, according to Sakamoto.

However, the clinical significance of the relative differences in spot size or depth of penetration is unclear. Sakamoto listed several other technical differences between these devices but cautioned that they have never been compared head-to-head for clinical endpoints or even surrogate endpoints, such as reduction of sebum.

Both have shown similar effects across skin types, with little or no damage to tissue surrounding the sebaceous gland, according to Sakamoto.

Empirically, the AviClear laser generally appears to be “a little bit faster” for completing a treatment session and might be associated with less pain, she said. Conversely, the continuous air cooling provided by the Accure device is a potential advantage because the cooling plate of the AviClear device begins to warm once placed.

Yet, neither these nor other differences can be verified as clinically meaningful in the absence of direct comparisons, Sakamoto noted. More studies are underway and planned, but she said that published research remains relatively limited for both devices.

In separate 12-week placebo-controlled studies, acne clearance rates have been impressive, according to data cited by Sakamoto. In one of the studies conducted with AviClear, clearance rates reached 89%. In another with Accure, the rate was 78%, but she called these “very similar” in the context of cross-trial comparisons that do not account for baseline severity or other variables.

“But what is really interesting is that both devices have shown very prolonged remission of acne” after treatment is completed, Sakamoto said. In one study, 80% of patients remained in remission after 35 months of follow-up. In another, the remission rate was 50% after 24 months of follow-up.

Likening these sustained acne responses to other skin conditions (such as unwanted hair growth) with prolonged benefit after laser treatment, Sakamoto suggested that acne therapy with lasers targeting the sebaceous gland might prove to be a new benchmark in efficacy.

“This is a new era where we have laser treatments that perhaps will give some sort of cure” in the best responders, said Sakamoto, noting that clearance rates are generally in the vicinity of 40%-60% with pharmacologic agents, and duration of the beneficial effects is shorter.

Other types of lasers delivering energy at different wavelengths as well as other forms of light, including daylight, have been associated with benefit against acne, but the selectivity of the 1760-nm devices appears to explain an added degree of efficacy, she said.

For the treatment of acne, “you should not abandon the older types of lasers,” said Sakamoto, who explained that nonselective devices still have a role in the adjuvant setting when used with selective devices or in combination with anti-acne drugs.

In the absence of head-to-head trials, definitive statements about the relative value of selective 1760-nm lasers are elusive, but Sakamoto said, “I think we will know a lot more as clinicians get more experience.”

Two dermatologists experienced with these targeted lasers agreed with both of the key points made by Sakamoto: These devices are probably not interchangeable, but this has not yet been established with objective evidence. 

In separate remarks, all three experts suggested that regardless of performance on clinical endpoints, such as acne clearance and duration overall, the devices might still differ by acne location or on practical points, such as ease of use. 

“While they share the same wavelength, the technologies differ in ways that could impact clinical outcomes, especially in areas like truncal acne where gland depth varies,” Julie de la Cruz, MD, the first author of a 2024 review article on treatment of acne with 1726-nm lasers, told Medscape Medical News. 

In her own experience, “AviClear seems more user-friendly with fewer consumables, while Accure involves more setup and patient-specific components,” said de la Cruz, who was in training at Rush University, Chicago, at the time the article was written and is now affiliated with Miami Dermatology & Laser Institute in Miami.

She said that she is “looking forward to seeing more data” and agreed that a direct comparison would be valuable.

Macrene Alexiades, MD, PhD, who practices in New York City and is a ssociate clinical professor of dermatology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, was the lead investigator for an AviClear trial including 104 patients with facial acne, published in 2023. She argued that the quality of the data for the two devices is not yet equivalent, although she expects them to perform similarly if a head-to-head comparison is performed.

“While technical comparisons between the devices may reveal differences, I would be surprised to see substantial disparity in clinical efficacy — though comprehensive published clinical trial data on Accure are still forthcoming,” she told Medscape Medical News.

In an early single center open-label 2023 trial of 17 patients aged 18-36 years with acne, Alexiades noted, AviClear demonstrated statistically significant reductions in inflammatory lesion counts — 52% within 1 month and 97% at 24 months posttreatment. In her larger, nonrandomized, open-label study of 104 patients with moderate to severe facial acne (skin types II-VI), treated with three monthly sessions with AviClear, results were evaluated using the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale.

At 26 weeks follow-up, the proportion of patients whose skin was clear (IGA score, 0) or almost clear (IGA score, 1) went from 0% at baseline to 11.4% and 30.4% respectively. At that time, the proportion of patients who had an IGA score of 2 (mild) was 41.8% compared with 1.1% at baseline; 16.5% had an IGA score of 3 (moderate) compared with 77.5% at baseline; and none had an IGA score of 4 (severe) compared with 21.3% at baseline. 

Lesion clearance rates are informative, “but IGA scores reflecting clear or nearly clear skin at long-term follow-up are more clinically meaningful for both dermatologists and patients,” she noted. 

In her clinical practice, AviClear has delivered “consistently excellent outcomes,” Alexiades said. “Typically, 3-4 monthly sessions are followed by an optional booster around 6 months, with few patients needing additional treatments thereafter. Aesthetic benefits, including scar improvement, have also been notable and reproducible,” she added.

 April 21, 2025  

Right after residency, Maryland-based hospitalist Anisha Bassi, MD, took on a 7 days on/7 days off shift. She worked 12-hour days, and if she wanted to boost her income, she would add in an overnight, or a 4 AM to noon.

It was tiring, she said, but she was young, and it still felt easier than the strain of residency she had just finished. Plus, the week-long stretch of downtime allowed her the ability to study for boards.

In working 7/7 shifts, Bassi was part of the most popular scheduling option among hospitalists, according to the 2023 State of Hospital Medicine Report, from the Society of Hospital Medicine (SHM). The shift's popularity has grown steadily, and more than 60% of hospitalists now choose it, typically working 12- to 14-hour days on this schedule.

Many factors go into why hospitalists opt for the 7/7 schedule — and it's highly individualized — but like anything, working this schedule comes with pros and cons.

Like Bassi, Colorado-based Josh Emdur, DO, also worked 7/7 schedules early in his career.

“For me, just out of training, the option was amazing,” he said. “It gave me a chance to work really hard, and then when I was off, I was off.” 

This work hard/play hard routine was ideal for Emdur, a dedicated runner and skier, who also enjoys traveling and finding time to truly unplug. He also liked that 7-day stretches allowed him to know his patients well.

For me, just out of training, the option was amazing. It gave me a chance to work really hard, and then when I was off, I was off.

Josh Emdur, DO

“It's hard to go in for a day of rounding where everyone is new to you,” he pointed out. “It takes you a while to get their medical history and figure out where they should be going next. When you're working 7 days, you have the advantage of getting to know your patients, see them improve, and square everything away before you hand them off.”

According to the SHM report, the average patient stays around 4-5 days, so Emdur's experience lines up in that regard. Another factor that made 7/7 shifts appealing to Emdur was his ability to fully embody the doctor persona while on the clock.

“You focus on your work, and then when you're off, you're completely off and forget about those pressures,” he said. “There aren't many other specialists that have this ability, other than ER [emergency room] docs.”

Bassi appreciated that aspect as well and looked at her 7/7 work as an opportunity to make extra money while figuring out her next career steps.

“I could choose to travel with my time off, or moonlight and make more money,” she said. “It was a great lifestyle.”

That's the sweet spot for 7/7 work, in Bassi's opinion.

“If you don't have a family and you're looking to make good money right out of residency, it's a great option,” she said. “The minute you're finished your shift; you're done and someone else is taking over.”

But once the responsibilities of marriage and parenting kick in, the 7/7 shift can lose appeal for some. That life stage is what led Emdur to switch directions. “I loved my 9 years on that shift, until it stopped working for my family,” he said. “My wife works full time, so working 7 days meant we'd only get every other weekend together, which would have left her to solo parent when I was working.” 

Bassi, too, has long since left the 7/7 shift behind, and now works in private practice. Her year on 7/7s revealed for her that she would be happier in a private scenario as she progressed in her career.

“There are many rules when you work for someone else,” Bassi said. “I wanted independence when I saw patients. Now I function as a hospitalist, but only for my patients, which affords me much more freedom.”

With high rates of provider burnout in play, determining the right schedule for you personally to prevent that scenario is key. Employers are beginning to recognize this, too, and many are increasing the scheduling options for hospitalists. Quality of care is also a factor, and hospitals often include the 4-day average patient stay into that equation.

Working 7 days in a row can be tiring, which is another reason younger hospitalists might find it more appealing than their more experienced peers. For hospitalist Kierstin Cates Kennedy, MD, the chief medical officer at University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital, the idea of 7/7 never appealed. Kennedy's facility offers pattern scheduling, and she typically works 5 days on/2 days off. “After five days, I need a break,” she said. “I don't need to push an additional 2 days.”

After five days, I need a break. I don't need to push an additional 2 days.

Kierstin Cates Kennedy, MD

Emdur, however, said that the quality of care in 7/7 shifts is “very doable.” He points to the long stretch of time off as ample time to recharge, before doing it all again.

Kennedy said that at her facility, most hospitalists work no longer than 6 days at a stretch, unless they strongly wish for more days.

“We've designed that schedule based on the average length of stay,” she said. “If a patient is there on average 4 days, presumably they will only have one doctor, which leaves the patient more satisfied.” 

Another upside to pattern scheduling, said Kennedy, is the ability to set schedules 3 months in advance, which makes taking specific days off more feasible than 7/7. “If you have a wedding coming up, or specific vacation plans tied to your children's school schedule, you can block those days off,” she said. “But if you've got a 7/7 schedule, you need to find a replacement for your shifts.” 

Kennedy said that UAB's nurse practitioners were on a schedule akin to 7/7 and recently changed to pattern scheduling. While they were hesitant at first to make the change, she said they've overwhelmingly bought into the new schedule now that they've tried it. “They learned that it allows for more flexibility,” she said.

One of the other bonuses Kennedy sees in pattern scheduling is that in her facility, it has led to strong retention rates.

“I think that in hospital medicine, at the 5-year mark, many doctors start looking for something different,” she said. “We don't see that, and I think that's due to our scheduling options.”

Kennedy said that attrition remains low at UAB, and most hospitalists remain up until the 7- or 8-year mark. “That's worth thinking about,” she said. “The hard pace of 7/7 has its risks over time. How much longevity can you get from it?” 

While the 7/7 schedule may suit young hospitalists best, Emdur said it can also be a good fit for later career doctors. “Once the kids are away at school, having those stretches of time off can work well, especially if your partner can do it, too,” he said.

No matter what your scheduling preference, hospitalist work can be intense, said Emdur, which makes finding the optimal fit for your lifestyle essential.

Older adults with severe herpes zoster were at a heightened risk of developing dementia, especially those aged 50-65 years, when compared with both matched control individuals from the general population and patients hospitalised for other infections.

""[The study] findings support improving immunisation public health strategies and extending the vaccination recommendations to younger people,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Lorenzo Blandi, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy. It was published online on April 12, 2025, in The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.

This study was limited by its retrospective design and the usage of administrative data. Data about medical treatments received for herpes zoster or vaccines administered to prevent herpes zoster were not extracted. Moreover, data from outpatient services were not considered, potentially affecting the outcomes of the study.

This study did not receive any specific grant from any funding agency.Blandi reported receiving administrative support from the Lombardy Region. The remaining authors declared having no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have influenced the work.

 April 21, 2025  

A recently released statement on Trump administration's drug policy priorities called for a focus on stopping illicit drugs from coming into the United States, prosecuting those responsible for overdose deaths, expanded access to naloxone, and new campaigns “to inform the American people of the dangers of illicit drug use, the hope of a life in recovery, and the ways to prevent an overdose death.”

The administration's plans to address opioid use disorder (OUD) include encouraging state and local authorities to “increase the availability of drug test strips and naloxone” and that it would also support efforts to connect people using drugs to supportive services, diverting them from incarceration.

Released in early April, the Statement of Drug Policy Priorities comes from the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which has traditionally been the locus of addiction policy and has helped guide the response to the opioid epidemic.

The office does not yet have a permanent leader. In late March, President Donald Trump nominated Sara A. Carter, a former Fox News journalist, to the post. Carter, whose appointment requires Senate confirmation, has reported on drug cartels and immigration. 

The White House said in a statement it will seek to ensure that “effective, timely, and evidence-based treatment is available to all Americans who need it,” including expanding access to medications for OUD and strengthening the peer recovery support services workforce.

Brian Hurley, MD, president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), said in a statement that the organization “is pleased to see the Trump Administration prioritize efforts to make evidence-based substance use disorder (SUD) treatment readily available.” 

ASAM urged the White House to also direct the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to modify a regulation that keeps methadone for the treatment of OUD restricted to a single type of federally defined program.

Another priority for drug policy will be drug use prevention. The administration will use evidence-based prevention programs in schools and use social media to promote healthy behaviors, warn of the dangers of illicit drug use, and educate Americans on how to access treatment and recovery services.

In February, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that it estimates there will be a nearly 24% decline in drug overdose deaths for the 12 months ending in September 2024. Provisional data showed that some 87,000 Americans died from a drug overdose from October 2023 to September 2024, down from 114,000 the previous year. The CDC said that would be the fewest overdose deaths in any 12-month period since June 2020.

Meanwhile, the statement from the Office of National Drug Control Policy did not say whether the Trump administration would pursue or block reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule 1 to a Schedule 3 substance, a process that began under the previous administration. In May 2024, the US Department of Justice proposed the reclassification, as reported by Medscape Medical News.

After a public comment period, the DEA was due to hold hearings on the issue in December 2024. Those hearings were postponed and then delayed again in January as multiple parties sued, alleging that the agency had engaged in misconduct.

Two of the parties to the suits, Village Farms International and Hemp for Victory, “are awaiting action from DEA,” according to their attorney, Shane Pennington, with Blank Rome in Houston.

Thirty-nine states, three territories, and Washington, DC, allow the medical use of cannabis, whereas 24 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia allow or regulate recreational use, according to the National Council of State Legislatures.

 April 21, 2025  

A 35-year-old man presented to the emergency room with persistent watery diarrhoea with mucus for 11 days. Initially diagnosed with gonorrhoea, further tests revealed a coinfection with Shigella.

The patient was admitted to the emergency department in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and pain during defecation, along with fever since the onset of symptoms. His medical history included HIV, which was being treated with medication.

The patient reported that his symptoms began on the fifth day of a trip through Portugal and Spain, during which he had consumed raw seafood, unprocessed dairy products, and tap water. Despite these exposures, his fellow travellers remained healthy. His sexual history revealed unprotected intercourse with multiple partners, and he had previously used doxycycline for preexposure prophylaxis.

On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 39.7 °C and tachycardia of 106 beats/min.

Blood tests showed a normal white blood cell count of 5.4 × 10⁹/L (normal range: 4.0-11.0 × 10⁹/L) and neutrophil count of 2.7 × 10⁹/L (normal range: 2.0-7.5 × 10⁹/L). A contrast CT scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed acute proctocolitis. Blood and stool cultures were collected, along with a rectal swab to assess for gonorrhoea, chlamydia, and herpes simplex.

The patient received 1 g of intramuscular ceftriaxone and was prescribed doxycycline 100 mg for 7 days to treat gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Due to persistent fever, he was referred to a Tropical Disease Unit for further evaluation.

Diarrhoea and abdominal pain persisted, although fever and mucus in the stool had resolved. Examination revealed a blood pressure level of 102/66 mm Hg, a heart rate of 77 beats/min, and a body temperature of 37.6 °C.

Notable findings included pain in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen and palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. Stool samples were evaluated for Clostridium difficile infection, chronic or helminthic infections such as strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis, and dengue virus infection.

Stool cultures confirmed positive results for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Shigella flexneri. Shigella infection explained the persistence of symptoms despite treatment for gonorrhoea. The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily). Symptoms resolved within 48 hours.

Shigellosis is an acute diarrhoeal disease transmitted via the faecal-oral route or sexual contact. Indirect transmission, such as through used condoms, is also possible during sexual contact.

Risk groups include travellers to endemic areas, homeless individuals, and children in resource-limited settings, such as daycare. Men who have sex with men are at a higher risk due to reduced immune function.

The disease is caused by four species of Shigella bacteria: Shigella sonnei, S flexneri, Shigella dysenteriae, and Shigella boydii. The incubation period is 1-4 days, and it typically self-resolves within 5-7 days. However, resistance is increasing.

Shigella isolates collected from men who have sex with men in the UK have been reported to have high rates of azithromycin resistance and outbreaks of S flexneri 3a, S flexneri 2a, and S sonnei. Outbreaks of multidrug-resistant S sonnei have been documented in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and S flexneri serotype 1 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Gonorrhoea is caused by gram-negative diplococcus N gonorrhoeae, which has seen a 182% increase in cases between 2010 and 2019. Men who have sex with men are at a higher risk for resistance due to factors such as multiple sexual partners and drug misuse.

Acute travel-related diarrhoea and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common causes of fever in returned travellers. Male travellers are twice as likely to be diagnosed with an STI.

Coinfection should be considered in men who have sex with men who have sex-related gastrointestinal infections. Up to 40% of individual men with shigellosis who have sex also have an STI, such as gonorrhoea.

To summarise, this case report describes a returned traveller who had both shigellosis and gonorrhoea. The authors emphasise that shigellosis should be considered in cases of acute gastroenteritis or proctocolitis, given the range of potential transmission pathways.

This case highlighted the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis for proctocolitis.

A thorough sexual history, overlapping symptoms, and screening for parasitic, enteric, and STI infections are important to identify possible polymicrobial infections in this population.

Medical cannabis use was associated with improvements in health-related quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic illnesses over 12 months, with sustained benefits for chronic pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression, a new study showed.

“Current clinical guidelines support prescribing [medical cannabis] to patients who are interested in trialling it for conditions not responding to conventional treatments, and our findings suggest any improvements would be apparent quickly and maintained long-term,” the investigators wrote.

“Evidence on optimal CBD:THC ratios for different health conditions is emerging and will improve prescribing practices,” they added.

The study was led by Margaret-Ann Tait, The University of Sydney, Sydney Nursing School, Sydney, Australia. It was published online on April 2 in PLOS ONE.

This single-arm observational study could not confirm causality because of a lack of control group, and observed effects may have reflected placebo response. Attrition bias may have occurred as participants who dropped out appeared to have experienced less benefit. Only a small proportion of patients provided reasons for withdrawal, and financial costs may have affected retention, potentially biasing the sample toward higher-income individuals. Data on adverse events were not systematically collected. Additionally, the findings may not have been generalizable to products or administration methods other than those used in the study.

The University of Sydney received funding from Little Green Pharma Ltd to conduct this study. One investigator reported being an employee of the funding company.

A new research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) Volume 17, Issue 3, on March 14, 2025, titled ""Effects of a natural ingredients-based intervention targeting the hallmarks of aging on epigenetic clocks, physical function, and body composition: a single-arm clinical trial.""

A team of researchers, led by first authors Natalia Carreras-Gallo and Rita Dargham, and corresponding author Varun B. Dwaraka from TruDiagnostic, studied how a natural anti-aging supplement called the Cel System might influence the aging process. They found that participants who took the supplement for one year showed a reduction in biological age, along with improved muscle strength and body composition. The study highlights the potential of lifestyle and nutritional supplements to support healthy aging.

""The Cel System supplement range was formulated to target pathways associated with the Hallmarks of Aging when combining Cel1, Cel2, and Cel3 formulas.""

Cel System is a natural supplement made from a mix of plant compounds, vitamins, and antioxidants designed to target the biological mechanisms associated with aging. Over the course of a year, 51 adults between the ages of 54 and 84 participated in the clinical trial. The group included 26 men and 25 women. Researchers tracked changes in biological age using DNA-based tests known as epigenetic clocks, along with physical performance and body composition metrics. Participants were also encouraged to walk for 10 minutes and practice mindfulness for five minutes daily.

Results showed that participants experienced improvements in grip strength, lower body mobility, and reductions in body weight, waist circumference, and body mass index. These physical gains were supported by slower biological aging, as measured by multiple epigenetic clocks. In addition, the supplement appeared to reduce stem cell turnover, a key marker of aging at the cellular level.

The study also reported changes in immune cell composition, suggesting that the supplement may help regulate immune function as people age. Biomarkers associated with liver function also shifted, pointing to potential improvements in organ health. However, levels of inflammation markers did not significantly change.

Analysis of methylation chemical marks on DNA revealed that the supplement influenced gene activity related to stress response, brain function, and cell communication. These molecular-level changes may help explain the broader benefits seen in physical and biological aging measures.

Although this was a pilot study without a control group, the findings suggest that the Cel System supplement shows potential for reducing signs of aging and improving overall health. The authors suggest future randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes to confirm these results and explore the supplement's long-term effects on longevity.

This study adds to growing evidence that targeted natural supplements may slow biological aging and extend healthspan. By combining epigenetic analysis with real-world health data, the findings offer new insight into how nutraceuticals, like Cel System, could promote long-term health and resilience.

A new study has found that over 1 in 5 boys and men in Canada and the United States may meet the diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder, highlighting the urgent need for greater awareness, tailored prevention efforts, and inclusive clinical support for this under-recognized group.

Published using data from The Study of Boys and Men, the research analyzed responses from over 1,500 boys and men aged 15 to 35. Researchers used a validated diagnostic algorithm to assess probable eating disorders and examined key sociodemographic factors. The study found that 21.3% of participants met criteria for any probable eating disorder. Probable bulimia nervosa had the highest prevalence (5.8%), while probable anorexia nervosa was least common (0.34%).

The study revealed heightened risk among sexual minority participants: those who identified as gay and bisexual had significantly higher odds of meeting any eating disorder criteria compared to their heterosexual peers. Higher body mass index (BMI) was also associated with greater likelihood of probable diagnosis.

These findings signal a clear call to action. Boys and men-particularly those who are sexual minorities or in larger bodies-are at increased risk for eating disorders. Yet they remain overlooked in public health messaging and clinical practice.""

The research team stresses the importance of developing prevention and intervention programs that are gender-inclusive and responsive to the unique experiences of boys and men. ""Boys and men often face unique barriers to seeking help for eating disorders, including feelings of stigma and shame, fear of judgment, and a lack of gender-affirming treatment options,"" said Ganson. ""Given the high prevalence of eating disorders in our study, there is an urgent need to reduce these barriers and ensure that all individuals struggling with eating disorders receive timely, compassionate care.""

The study adds to a growing body of evidence urging a shift in how eating disorders are identified and treated across all genders.

Ticks are more likely to carry the bacteria that can cause Lyme disease in areas where pheasants are released, new research shows.

Pheasants are not native to the UK, but about 47 million are released here each year for recreational shooting.

Researchers studied ticks in 25 woodland areas in South West England where pheasants are released – and 25 nearby control sites where no pheasants are released.

They found that Borrelia spp. – the bacteria that can cause Lyme disease – was almost 2.5 times more common in ticks in the pheasant-release areas.

The research was carried out by the University of Exeter and the UK Health Security Agency.

Borrelia bacteria can live in a wide range of hosts, including pheasants, wild birds and mammals – and humans.

Pheasants are known to be 'competent' hosts of Borrelia – meaning they have a relatively high likelihood of contracting and retransmitting the bacteria.

More research is needed, but our findings suggest there may be an increased risk of potential exposure to Borrelia-infected ticks for people – such as gamekeepers – who work in woodlands where pheasants are released in numbers.""

Emile Michels, Centre for Ecology and Conservation on Exeter's Penryn Campus, Cornwall

Researchers tested ticks at different life stages (nymphs and adults) and found that, overall, the proportion containing Borrelia was 7.8% in pheasant-release woodlands, and 3.2% where pheasants were not released.

Dr Barbara Tschirren, also from the University of Exeter, said: ""Our findings are evidence of 'spillback' – where non-native species increase the prevalence of native pathogens.

""This can be an important route for the emergence of zoonoses (diseases that animals can give to humans).""

Dr Jolyon Medlock, head of the Medical Entomology and Zoonoses Ecology team at UKHSA, said: ""While we have observed an increase in the bacteria that can cause Lyme disease in ticks, we do not have data on the resulting impact on human health, including evidence of Lyme infection.

""Following these findings, we continue to work with academic partners to better understand what drives Borrelia transmission, including the roles of climate and environmental change.""

The control sites in the study were one to two kilometres from the pheasant-release sites, so more research would be required to see if Borrelia in ticks declines further at greater distances.

Emile Michels' PhD is funded by the NERC GW4+ DTP scheme.

The paper, published in the journal Ecology Letters, is entitled: ""The release of non-native gamebirds is associated with amplified zoonotic disease risk.""

The incidence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has been escalating annually, positioning it as the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Ursolic acid has demonstrated promising therapeutic efficacy in managing MASLD, thereby justifying the need for an in-depth exploration of its pharmacological mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms by which ursolic acid modulates estrogen conversion in the treatment of MASLD.

Building upon prior studies that have highlighted the potent anti-inflammatory effects of ursolic acid and its specific targeting of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 14 (HSD17B14), this investigation employed a western diet to induce MASLD in murine models with varying severities over different time intervals.

The protein expression of HSD17B14 initially increased, followed by a subsequent decrease. This trend was accompanied by corresponding changes in 17β-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) levels. Intervention with ursolic acid resulted in a reduction in HSD17B14 and E1 levels during the phase of high HSD17B14 expression, while simultaneously elevating E2 levels. In steatotic hepatocytes, E1 promoted cellular inflammation, whereas E2 exhibited anti-inflammatory effects. However, the alleviated effects of E2 were antagonized by HSD17B14. As expected, ursolic acid modulated HSD17B14, thereby mitigating the inflammatory response in steatotic hepatocytes.

HSD17B14, a crucial enzyme regulating the balance between E1 and E2, catalyzes the conversion of estrogen E2 into E1, thereby exacerbating tissue inflammation induced by metabolic stress. Ursolic acid, by modulating HSD17B14-mediated estrogen conversion, appears to ameliorate immune-related inflammation in MASLD.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Muscle building unaffected by vegan or animal-based protein sources","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250421/Muscle-building-unaffected-by-vegan-or-animal-based-protein-sources.aspx","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:17:00 GMT","

A new study asked three questions about muscle protein synthesis in response to a nine-day diet and weight training regimen: First, does the source of protein - plant or animal-based - make any difference to muscle gain? Second, does it matter if total daily protein intake is evenly distributed throughout the day? And third, does a moderate but sufficient daily protein intake influence any of these variables? The answer to all three questions is ""no,"" the researchers found.

Their findings are reported in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise.

""The longstanding belief or the current dogma was that animal-based protein sources were better, particularly for the muscle-building response,"" said Nicholas Burd, a professor of health and kinesiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who led the new study with former graduate student Andrew Askow. This belief was rooted in science: Previous studies that took muscle biopsies after a single feeding found that an animal-based meal provided more of a stimulus for muscle protein synthesis than a vegan meal, Burd said. ""And so, our general hypothesis based on these previous studies was that the animal-based eating pattern would be more effective at supporting the muscle-building response.""

But measurements taken after a single meal might not reflect the effects of consuming a balanced vegan diet over time, Burd said.

One previous clinical trial had looked at muscle responses in vegans and omnivores who ate a laboratory diet and engaged in weight training for 10 weeks. That study found no significant differences in muscle protein synthesis over time. However, volunteers in that study consumed 1.6-1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which is much higher than what is needed to maximize muscle protein synthesis and build bigger muscles with weight lifting, Burd said. It also gave those on the vegan diet the bulk of their plant protein in supplements, which is not a realistic recreation of how vegans normally eat, he said.

Burd and his colleagues wanted to know whether the habitual consumption of a varied vegan or meat-based diet of whole foods - rather than ingestion of just a single meal or getting one's protein from limited sources - would influence the rate of muscle protein synthesis over time. They also wanted to test the hypothesis that a moderate protein intake - in the range of 1.1-1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day - should be distributed evenly throughout the day to maximize muscle growth.

A previous study from Burd's lab found that protein intakes higher than 1.1 g/kg per day make no difference to the rate of muscle protein synthesis when weight training. This amount of protein also is more in line with a typical American diet, and testing what people normally eat is important, he said.

For the new study, the team recruited 40 healthy, physically active 20-40-year-old adults. The participants underwent a seven-day ""habituation diet"" to standardize their nutritional status prior to the clinical trial. Then they were randomly assigned to either a vegan or omnivorous diet. The research team provided all meals, some of which were eaten in the lab while most were consumed at home. Roughly 70% of the protein for the omnivorous meals was obtained from animal sources: beef, pork, chicken, dairy, eggs. The vegan diet balanced the amino acid content of the meals, ensuring that participants consumed complete proteins.

The vegan and omnivorous groups were each divided again into those who ate roughly the same amount of protein at each of three meals and those whose protein intake varied across five meals throughout the day, with a larger proportion of protein consumed toward the end of the day.

All participants engaged in a series of muscle-strengthening activities in the lab every three days. They also wore accelerometers to keep track of their activity levels when not in the lab.

Each day, participants drank ""heavy"" water, which was labeled with deuterium, a stable isotope of hydrogen. The deuterium atoms ""exchanged with hydrogen atoms within amino acids to make them heavy and served as tracers"" that allowed the team to trace their incorporation into muscle tissue, Burd said. Biopsies of tissue from a leg muscle were taken at the beginning and end of the trial.

Burd was initially surprised to see that there were no differences in rates of muscle protein synthesis between those eating vegan or omnivorous diets. He also was surprised to see that protein distribution across the day had no effect on the rate of muscle building given results from past studies of acute responses to dietary interventions and weight training.

""It was thought that it was better to get a steady-state delivery of nutrients throughout the day,"" he said. ""I also thought that if you're getting a lower quality protein - in terms of its digestibility and amino acid content - that perhaps distribution would make a difference. And surprisingly, we showed it doesn't matter.""

Now, Burd says, if anyone asks him what's the best type of food they should eat for muscle building, he'll tell them: ""It's the kind you put in your mouth after exercise. As long as you're getting sufficient high-quality protein from your food, then it really doesn't make a difference.""

The Beef Checkoff program, overseen by the National Cattlemen's Beef Board, supported this research.

California has halted a court-ordered medical parole program, opting instead to send its most incapacitated prisoners back to state lockups or release them early.

The unilateral termination is drawing protests from attorneys representing prisoners and the author of the state's medical parole legislation, who say it unnecessarily puts this vulnerable population at risk. The move is the latest wrinkle in a long-running drive to free those deemed so ill that they are no longer a danger to society.

""We have concerns that they cannot meet the needs of the population for things like memory care, dementia, traumatic brain injury,"" said Sara Norman, an attorney who represents the prisoners as part of a nearly three-decade-old federal class-action lawsuit. ""These are not people who are in full command and control of their own surroundings, their memories — they're helpless.”

Caring for a rapidly aging prison population is a growing problem across the United States. It is twice as expensive to imprison older people than those younger, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers, and prisoners 55 and older are more than twice as likely to have cognitive difficulties as non-incarcerated older adults.

Medical parole is reserved for the sliver of California's 90,000 prisoners who have a ""significant and permanent condition"" that leaves them ""physically or cognitively debilitated or incapacitated"" to the point they can't care for themselves, according to the state parole board. Prisoners who qualify — excluded are those sentenced to death or life without parole — can be placed in a community health care facility instead of state prison.

Attorneys said the roughly 20 parolees the state has returned to lockup need significant help performing basic functions of daily life, with some in wheelchairs or suffering from debilitating mental or physical disabilities. They say outside facilities have the capacity to provide more compassionate and humane care to very ill prisoners.

Kyle Buis, a California Correctional Health Care Services spokesperson, characterized the program as ""on pause"" as patients return to in-prison facilities and as officials anticipate increasing their use of the compassionate release program. Prisoners granted compassionate release have their sentences reduced and are released into society, while those on medical parole remain technically in custody.

""There were multiple considerations that went into this decision,"" Buis said. ""Our growing ability to support those with cognitive impairment inside of our facilities was one factor."" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also cited ""eliminating non-essential activities and contracts"" to save money.

While nearly every state now has a medical parole law, they are rarely used, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. One common reason is eligibility. Texas, for instance, screened more than 2,600 prisoners in 2022 but approved just 58 people. Officials also often face procedural hurdles, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, a national nonprofit research and advocacy group.

Some states, however, have tried to expand medical parole programs. Michigan did so because an earlier version of the law proved too difficult to use, resulting in the release of just one person. New York has some of the nation's broadest criteria for release but is among states struggling to find nursing home placements for parolees.

California's first effort to free prisoners deemed so incapacitated that they are no longer dangerous began in 1997 with a little-used process that allowed corrections officials to seek the release of dying prisoners. But that program resulted in the release of just two prisoners in 2009. The medical parole program was officially created by a state law that took effect in 2011 and was expanded in 2014 to help reduce prison crowding so severe that federal judges ruled it was harming prisoners' physical and mental health.

Nearly 300 prisoners had been granted medical parole since July 2014, state officials reported. The average annual cost per medical parolee was between about $250,000 and $300,000 in 2023, Buis said. And despite lawmakers' expectations when they started the program, he said, Medi-Cal — California's Medicaid program, which is partly funded by the federal government — did not reimburse the state for their care because they were still considered incarcerated.

California has had a rollercoaster relationship with its sole nursing home contractor for medical parolees. The state ended its contract with Golden Legacy Care Center in Sylmar at the end of 2024, Newsom reported in January in his summary of the state's 2025-26 budget.

In 2021, prison officials said they were sending dozens of paralyzed and otherwise disabled prisoners back to state prisons and limiting medical parole, blaming a federal rule change that barred any restrictions on prisoners in such facilities. The move came after state public health inspectors fined Golden Legacy for handcuffing an incapacitated patient's ankle to the bed in violation of state and federal laws.

Golden Legacy did not return repeated telephone and email requests for comment. Buis said state officials ""continuously monitored care at Golden Legacy, and we never had concern for the quality of care provided.""

Attorney Rana Anabtawi, who also represents prisoners in the class-action suit, toured Golden Legacy's medical parole building with Norman in November and saw caregivers offering memory care patients special art classes and a ""happy feet"" dance party.

She felt it ""was a much better place for our patients than being in prison — there appeared to be regular programming aimed at engaging them, there were no officers walking around, the patient doors were open and unlocked, patients had general freedom of movement within their building.""

Over the past several years, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has built up its capacity to service those with severely compromised health. The state created two of its own memory care units in men's prisons, a 30-bed unit in the California Health Care Facility in Stockton in 2019 and a 35-bed unit in the California Medical Facility in Vacaville in 2023. The Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla provides up to 24-hour skilled nursing care for women with life-limiting illnesses including dementia.

Yet Norman fears the in-prison facilities are a poor substitute.

""They're nowhere near enough and they are inside prisons, so there's a limit to how compassionate and humane they can be,” she said.

In addition to the 20 returned to state prisons when the contract expired, Buis said, one was paroled through the standard process, while 36 were recommended for compassionate release. Of those, 26 were granted compassionate release, eight were denied, and two died before they could be considered.

The use of compassionate release increased under a law passed in 2022 that eased the criteria, including by adding dementia patients. Last year, 87 prisoners received compassionate release. By contrast, during the six years before the new law, just 53 were freed. Officials expect about 100 prisoners each year will qualify for compassionate release, Buis said.

Compassionate release would allow them to ""sort of die with dignity,"" said Daniel Landsman, vice president of policy for the criminal justice advocacy group FAMM, previously known as Families Against Mandatory Minimums, and ensure ""that the California prison system is not turning into a de facto hospice or skilled nursing facility.”

Mark Leno, who authored California's medical parole law when he was a Democratic state senator, criticized prison officials for ending their use of the law without legislative approval and instead just terminating the Golden Legacy contract. He also railed against returning very ill patients to prisons, a decision he called ""perfectly inhumane.""

""Is it just cruel punishment and retribution or is this thoughtful execution of the law put in place by the legislature?” he said.

The U. S. Men's National team is two months away from a crucial test in the Gold Cup, a biennial tournament that decides North America's strongest soccer team. The Gold Cup will be the USMNT's last competitive international competition before the United States, Canada and Mexico host the World Cup in 2026, and the pressure is on for it to perform.

So how are USMNT players performing around the world as the Gold Cup draws near?

Chris Richards, Mark McKenzie saw red

It was a rough weekend for American defenders Richards of Crystal Palace and McKenzie of Toulouse, as both earned first-half red card dismissals. Richards' came from accumulated yellows, but McKenzie's —a two-armed wrestle just outside the penalty box — was a clear straight red.

Richards' Palace went on to a 0-0 draw against Bournemouth on Saturday without him, but McKenzie's Toulouse wound up falling 1-0 to Reims on Sunday. Reims' lone goal came from unheralded American striker Jordan Pefok, 28, who made eight appearances for the USMNT under then-coach Gregg Berhalter but hasn't earned a call-up since. He may warrant another look. 

Alex Zendejas racked up assists

When considering USMNT stars who excel at creating goals, Christian Pulisic comes to mind instantly. Perhaps Zendejas, should too. 

The attacking midfielder set up two goals for Club America on Saturday in a 5-0 win over Mazatlan in Liga MX. USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino hasn't shown Zendejas much love since taking the reins last fall, but Zendejas is proving himself to be a perfect candidate for the team's Gold Cup fixtures if America fails to qualify for the concurrent Club World Cup. It will face off against LAFC in the coming weeks to settle the tournament's final spot.

Gio Reyna sparked new transfer rumors

Reyna, one of the USMNT's more talented (and frustrating) stars, is leaving Germany's Borussia Dortmund this summer, but for where? 

Reyna's camp seems to be seriously considering offers from Scotland's Rangers and MLS's LAFC. Rangers, one of Scotland's more storied clubs, could be an interesting destination; it has played second fiddle to its rival Celtic for years and could gamble on a high-risk, high-reward player such as Reyna.

Could LAFC of Major League Soccer be in the mix, too? That's a tougher move to justify. Coach Steve Cherundolo announced he'll leave the club at the end of the 2025 season; it seems foolish to bring in a big-money signing such as Reyna while the head-coaching position remains in flux.

Benja Cremaschi, Quinn Sullivan made their USMNT cases

In MLS play, two young Americans on the USMNT fringe — Inter Miami's Cremaschi and the Philadelphia Union's Sullivan — stood out. Both scored game-changing golazos that lifted their teams over tough Eastern Conference competition. In Saturday matches, unbeaten Inter Miami beat previously unbeaten Columbus while Sullivan had a goal and an assist in a 3-0 win over Atlanta.

Cremaschi has made a few substitute appearances under USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino and took part in his MLS-heavy January camp; Sullivan, meanwhile, has largely gone unrecognized. That should change. He'd be an excellent depth piece for the USMNT's midfield.

From last night: With a goal and an assist in the club's 3-0 victory over Atlanta United, Philadelphia Union midfielder Quinn Sullivan (29 goal contributions) tied Jack McInerney for the most goal contributions in Union history by a player prior to turning 22 years old.[image or embed]

Folarin Balogun eased back into fitness

The USMNT has struggled with its striker position for nearly a decade; dozens of players have cycled in and out without really staking their claim. When English-Nigerian-American triple-international Balogun pledged his future to the USMNT, many thought he'd be the one to step up, but injuries have largely kept Balogun sidelined since his charmed debut in 2023.

That appears to be changing. After suffering a dislocated shoulder in October, Balogun appears to be approaching full fitness. He has made four straight substitute appearances for his club team, AS Monaco, looking dangerous in all of them. If his recovery trajectory holds, he'll be ready to join the USMNT for its Gold Cup run this summer.

Real Madrid's elimination from the UEFA Champions League has amped up the pressure on Carlo Ancelotti, so much so that an imminent sacking is not ruled out.

The Italian coach may well go down in history as one of, if not the greatest Real Madrid manager, but his days at the club are now seriously numbered.

Word has it that losing the final of the Copa del Rey against Barcelona will be the final nail in the coffin for Ancelotti, and it remains to be seen if he remains at the helm beyond next week.

A replacement, thus, becomes the need of the hour but the Merengues have luckily narrowed down and finalised a target a long time ago.

As relayed in a recent report by Rodra, there is consensus in the Real Madrid offices over Xabi Alonso being the team's next manager. They see him as having the ideal profile required to lead a dressing room with multiple heavyweights.

The manager, after all, has left a mark during his ongoing stint at Bayer Leverkusen and has been well known for not only his man management but also his tactics. Further, his ability to handle media pressure with ease arrives as a massive positive.

With Alonso, Real Madrid hope to hit the golden lottery and return to their glory days. Moreover, they hope that the new coach will continue to trust young talents and promote players from the academy, something that has been a rarity in recent years.

The big question that remains, however, is when the manager can arrive in Madrid and get started. The Spanish journalist relays that Alonso will likely land in the Spanish capital only in July, after the end of the FIFA Club World Cup.

If Ancelotti is shown the exit door before that, either Santiago Solari or Raul Gonzalez will take over the reins of the first team as an interim manager and serve as a stand-in. All signs point to the former Real Madrid player being on the sidelines for the beginning of the next season.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice.

Brazilian wonderkid Estevao Willian will not join Chelsea for this summer's Club World Cup, his agent has confirmed.

Estevao is currently plying his trade for Palmeiras and has been tipped as Brazil's most promising talent since Neymar Jr. He signed to Chelsea in June 2024 for a reported £29million, a fee which could rise to £55m with add-ons.

He is set to join up with his new teammates this summer after turning 18, but it was unclear whether he would move in time to participate in Chelsea's Club World Cup campaign in June.

In a new interview, though, Brazilian agent Andre Cury confirmed the player would join up after the competition's conclusion.

Speaking to AS, he said: “Yes, he's arriving after the Club World Cup. 

“He's a world-class player. Very good. A guy who's going to make history here.”

Estevao will instead appear at the Club World Cup for Palmeiras, where he could potentially play against Chelsea, though the two clubs are in different groups.

Cury has masterminded some of the most valuable transfers in football history, including Neymar's moves from Santos to Barcelona and onwards to Paris Saint-Germain.

He added that Estevao, who has already claimed four senior Brazil caps, also received interest from PSG and Bayern Munich, among ‘several' other European clubs.

Estevao's prodigious talent has earned him the nickname ‘Little Messi' in Brazil, and he is expected to link up with Brazil teammate Andrey Santos on arrival at Chelsea. Santos joined the Blues in 2023 and has spent the 2024-25 season on loan at Chelsea's sister club Strasbourg, where he is wearing the captain's armband.

Also joining Chelsea this summer is the similarly prodigious Ecuadorian winger Kendry Paez, who has signed from Independiente del Valle. He was pictured training with Strasbourg earlier this month amid rumours he would spend his first European season on loan with the Ligue 1 outfit.

Enzo Maresca has said he is monitoring the player's progress: “Yes, we are following him. He is doing fantastic - but, unfortunately, he is doing fantastic there and not with us.

“For sure, we are very happy in the way he is doing these things.""

The new-look Club World Cup begins in Miami on June 15, with matches taking place across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Manchester City will also contest the tournament.

Real Madrid's determination to make history by winning the inaugural edition of the renewed FIFA Club World Cup has become a focal point for the club and its manager, Carlo Ancelotti.

According to a report from SPORT, the competition, which will be held between the end of this season and the beginning of the next, represents both a prestigious achievement and a significant financial opportunity for Los Blancos.

The desire to be the first club to etch its name into the annals of the revamped tournament is driven by Real Madrid's historical quest for supremacy.

The club has always prided itself on setting benchmarks in world football, and adding the first renewed FIFA Club World Cup to their trophy cabinet would be another statement of their stature.

Beyond the allure of prestige, the economic incentives are also considerable. Estimates suggest that Real Madrid could pocket as much as €145 million if they are crowned champions.

For Ancelotti, the importance of this tournament could extend beyond mere silverware. It could be the key to his future.

With his contract running until the end of next season, his continuity at the helm may well depend on securing major honours this term.

While the club remains alive in the La Liga title race and has reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League, the Club World Cup offers a unique opportunity to end the season on a high note.

Ancelotti has already led his team to two titles this season, having lifted the European Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup.

However, their failure in the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona remains a sore point. As things stand, the Club World Cup could be a make-or-break moment for the Italian tactician.

Should Real Madrid fall short in their pursuit of domestic and European honours, winning the Club World Cup could still serve as a redeeming accomplishment.

For Ancelotti, the stakes are even higher. Failure to secure significant silverware this season could see him pushed towards the exit door, but the Club World Cup may well offer him a lifeline.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

This alliance has positioned American Airlines at the heart of connecting fans, teams, & stakeholders across Canada, Mexico, and the US for the global football tournament.

American Airlines has officially announced a landmark partnership with FIFA, becoming the official North American airline supplier for the highly anticipated FIFA World Cup 26.

This strategic alliance has positioned the leading U.S. carrier at the heart of connecting fans, teams, and stakeholders across Canada, Mexico, and the United States for the prestigious global football tournament.

A post shared by American Airlines (@americanair)

As the designated airline supplier for North America, American Airlines will leverage its extensive network, encompassing over 2,200 daily flights to the 16 host cities of the FIFA World Cup 26. This robust infrastructure will ensure seamless and efficient travel throughout the event, underscoring the airline's commitment to facilitating major international gatherings and fostering community engagement.

The agreement also entails close collaboration with Qatar Airways, the official global airline partner of FIFA through 2030. While Qatar Airways maintains exclusive international flight rights, the synergistic efforts of both Oneworld alliance partners will provide comprehensive travel solutions for both international and domestic journeys related to the World Cup. This coordinated approach promises a streamlined travel experience for the millions of fans expected to attend.

Speaking on the occasion, Caroline Clayton, Chief Marketing Officer and Senior Vice President of Communications of American Airlines, said, “We are proud to partner with FIFA and look forward to connecting fans to all FIFA World Cup 26 matches. As the home team for this historic event, we look forward to flying fans across North America to experience the passion, energy and diversity of the beautiful game.”

FIFA Chief Business Officer, Romy Gai, added, “Having American Airlines on board as an Official Supplier further enhances our ability to deliver an exceptional FIFA World Cup in 2026.

With American Airlines joining as the Official North American Airline Supplier and Oneworld partner, we believe that, together, through our expansive networks and world-class loyalty programs, we can offer millions of travellers a seamless and rewarding journey to the FIFA World Cup 2026.”

The FIFA World Cup 26 is poised to be a groundbreaking edition of the tournament, featuring an expanded format of 48 participating nations and co-hosted by Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Adding a local touch for American Airlines, its headquarters city of Dallas-Fort Worth will host nine matches, the highest number among the 16 host cities.

This strategic partnership between American Airlines and FIFA represents a powerful alliance dedicated to delivering an unparalleled and world-class experience for fans and participants of the FIFA World Cup 26 throughout North America.

American Airlines is a global leader in the aviation industry. With a vast network, American Airlines offers customers 6,800 daily flights to more than 350 destinations across over 50 countries. As a founding member of the Oneworld alliance, its partners collectively serve over 900 destinations with 14,250 daily flights to approximately 150 countries.

The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) is the global governing body for football, futsal, and beach soccer. FIFA comprises 211 member associations, organised into six continental confederations: CAF (Africa), AFC (Asia & Australia), UEFA (Europe), CONCACAF (North & Central America & Caribbean), CONMEBOL (South America), and OFC (Oceania).

The FIFA World Cup 26 will mark the 23rd edition of the FIFA World Cup, the prestigious quadrennial international men's football championship contested by the national teams of FIFA's member associations. The expanded format will feature 48 teams competing in a total of 104 matches and is anticipated to be the most attended and viewed sporting event in history. The tournament continues to attract significant global brand partnerships, including Lenovo, The Home Depot, Verizon, Lay's, Bank of America, On Location, Aramco, Visa, Qatar Airways and McDonald's, further solidifying its global appeal.

A day at the soccer pitch should offer a nice distraction from trade wars and tariff talk.

Next year's FIFA World Cup, to be jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico and the U.S., will test that theory. Can the U.S., in particular, stage a successful tournament that attracts fans from around the world? Or will tensions, tariffs and deportations alienate visitors and businesses?

U.S. President Donald Trump certainly sees nothing but opportunity ahead for one of the world's biggest sporting events. ""Tension is a good thing,"" he recently said, when asked about the tournament in the Oval Office. ""It makes it much more exciting.""

OK, so the Easter weekend didn't quite bring more twists and turns in the world of European football as it did for the people of Jerusalem when Jesus Christ was said to have returned from the dead, but there was still plenty of drama to be feasted upon.

The title races in Spain and Italy swung to and fro even if those in England and Germany moved one step closer to meeting a finite end, while La Liga gaining an extra Champions League qualification place has added more spice to their mid-table scramble as has been the case in the Premier League.

There's still every chance that Britain's two premier players in Europe, Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham, end the season as champions of their respective countries on the continent, while Scott McTominay has been doing all he can to join them in such a pantheon.

Rodri's season-ending injury means he won't be defending the trophy he won in 2024 - so who are the main contenders to succeed the Spaniard?

If you thought the days of the Ballon d'Or generating headlines were over after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's era of dominance came to an end, then think again. After one of the most closely-fought races for a number of years, Rodri came out on top in 2024, beating Vinicius Jr into second place as Real Madrid dramatically boycotted the ceremony in Paris in protest at their star player missing out.

Unfortunately for Rodri, he will be unable to defend his crown in 2025, with the Manchester City midfielder having suffered a season-ending knee injury in September. The door, then, is open for a whole host of players to succeed the Spain star, and the race for the Golden Ball is heating up as we enter the final weeks of the European campaign.

The 2024-25 season doesn't have the same international tournaments as its two predecessors, and so the destination of the Ballon d'Or will be decided solely by club performances. That opens it up to all sorts of individuals who might not share the same success with their countries as others, while there is also the prospect of the new-look Club World Cup to consider.

So, who are the favourites for the most prestigious individual prize in world football? As always, GOAL is here every step of the way to track the contenders and the pretenders with our Ballon d'Or Power Rankings - check out who is in contention...

PSG's starlet, Desire Doue, has become one of the stars of his team and this season's UEFA Champions League campaign. His skills and ability to blend well with his teammates have turned him into such an exciting player to watch in Europe.

There have been plenty of Doue's exciting and memorable moments in this season's UCL, but one of those UEFA recently highlighted was his roulette. From the clip that can be checked out on the European Football Board's official YouTube channel, you can see how the French international mesmerised football fans.

Doue joined PSG from Rennes in August 2024 for a fee worth 50m euros, not including bonuses. Considering his talent and potential, the French outfit will feel like they got themselves a special gem that can guide them to success.

PSG with Doue will be battling for a place in the UCL final as they advanced into the semifinal after eliminating Aston Villa 5-4 on aggregate. They will be facing another Arsenal for that final match ticket.

Roger Federer competed on the ATP Tour for 23 years against some of the sport's greatest players.

The Swiss star won a mightily impressive 20 Major titles during his time on the ATP Tour, holding the Grand Slam record for several years.

Federer won 16 of his 20 Slams between 2003 and 2010, dominating men's tennis during the 2000s.

He then won just one Major title over the next six years, at Wimbledon in 2012, as his rivals began to catch up.

Returning to the top of the game, Federer won three more Majors across the 2017 and 2018 seasons, enjoying real success at the Australian Open.

It was in 2017 that Federer was asked whether he was enjoying his time more then than he did during the earlier stages of his career.

Speaking to the Tennis Channel following his remarkable start to the 2017 season, Federer replied when asked if tennis was ‘better now than it's ever been'.

“Possibly, you know?” he said.

“I definitely enjoyed the time when I came up on tour and played against my heroes and the guys I knew from TV, that was generally maybe the most exciting time of my career.

“It was disbelief to share the locker room with the likes of [Pete] Sampras, [Andre] Agassi, [Carlos] Moya, [Tim] Henman, [Gustavo] Kuerten, and [Pat] Rafter, I loved it.

“That was a great time, amazing people, you know, unbelievable characters, [Goran] Ivanisevic and [Marc] Rosset, they were just so much fun, it was really genuinely so cool.”

Federer then shared some insight into how tennis had changed during his time on the tour.

“It wasn't so professional like it was today I don't feel yet,” he said.

“I was just looking around like ‘Oh my god', like a kid in a candy store.”

The 43-year-old also reflected on his rise to the top of the game, where he quickly began to dominate the players he admired during his younger years.

“Later on when I got into the domination phase sort of in 2004 just going from one thing to the next and trying to cope,” said Federer.

“Trying to get organized and doing a red carpet, to go and win again, back to another interview, win again, pressure, you know managing that was an amazing time in my life.

“I learned so much in such a short period of time.”

In 2017, Federer named eight players he competed against during the ‘most exciting time' of his tennis career, but how did he perform against them?

The 20-time Major champion secured victories against seven of the eight names he listed, but Federer never beat Pat Rafter.

Rafter recently revealed that he was glad to have retired before Federer entered his prime years.

“Once he sorted that part of his game out [mental strength], oh my god, it was such a good time to leave the game,” said Rafter.

“He wanted me to stay so he could start beating me, and I was just trying to get out of the game as quickly as I could.”

Federer also held a losing record against Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten, whom he played three times in total.

The three-time French Open champion won their sole Grand Slam match at Roland Garros in 2004, taking down Federer in three sets to advance to the last 16.

He did, however, enjoy more success against the American duo of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.

Winning nine of his 12 matches against the pair, Federer proved his Grand Slam credentials by dominating two of the sport's greats.

Federer beat Sampras in a thriller at Wimbledon in their one career meeting, battling through in five sets to qualify for his second career Grand Slam quarterfinal.

When the Swiss legend retired from tennis in 2022, he did so having played and beaten players across several different eras, entertaining millions throughout his career.

His legacy within the sport may never be topped, as fans look back fondly on his time in tennis.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Djokovic & Alcaraz on collision course, Zverev's tough path: Madrid Open draw","https://www.tennis365.com/news/atp-madrid-open-draw-djokovic-alcaraz-set-to-clash-zverev-headlines-top-half","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 10:33:32 GMT","

The Madrid Open men's singles draw has been released – and Novak Djokovic is projected to face Carlos Alcaraz in the last four.

Fourth seed Djokovic has been drawn in the same half as second seed Alcaraz at the Masters 1000 event, meaning the two former champions could be set for a semi-final showdown.

The pair famously met in the last four back in 2022, where Alcaraz prevailed in a three-set thriller on his way to the first of two back-to-back titles on home turf.

Second seed Alcaraz comes into the tournament under a slight injury cloud following an apparent issue in his Barcelona Open final loss to Holger Rune.

The 21-year-old is reportedly undergoing a scan on Monday to determine the severity of a lower back problem, though he may be aided by receiving a round-one bye in Madrid.

Assuming Alcaraz plays, he will start his campaign against one of Zizou Bergs or Yoshihito Nishioka in round two, before a projected meeting against 26th seed Jiri Lehecka in round three.

The Spaniard is then expected to face 15th seed Grigor Dimitrov in round four before a quarter-final against sixth seed Alex de Minaur, in what would be a rematch of their last-eight clash in Barcelona.

However, de Minaur's section is an open one, with 17th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas and 10th seed Lorenzo Musetti also placed here.

If action in Madrid follows the seedings, Alcaraz would then face fourth seed Djokovic in the semi-final, though the Serbian has been handed an intriguing draw.

Djokovic will face a qualifier or Matteo Arnaldi in round two, before a projected third round against 32nd seed Sebastian Baez.

The Serbian is then expected to face 16th seed Frances Tiafoe in the fourth round before a projected quarter-final against fifth seed Jack Draper.

After an opening-round bye, Draper could face Tallon Griekspoor in round two, before a projected round-three encounter versus former finalist and 30th seed Matteo Berrettini, and a fourth round versus 11th seed Tommy Paul.

Meanwhile, the top half of the draw is headlined by top seed Alexander Zverev, who returned to world No 2 on Monday after his triumph in Munich on Sunday.

However, the two-time Madrid champion has not been handed the easiest draw in his quest to capture a third title.

Zverev will face one of Roberto Bautista Agut or Jaume Munar in round two and potentially 28th seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in round three.

That could then be followed by a fourth-round clash versus 13th seed Arthur Fils, who beat Zverev in Miami last month, and then a quarter-final against seventh seed and defending champion Andrey Rublev.

The Russian could face Gael Monfils in his first match and then 25th seed Alexei Popyrin, who beat him in the Canadian Open final last summer, in the third round.

Rublev could then face 12th seed Ben Shelton or 22nd seed Jakub Mensik in round four.

The second quarter of the draw is headlined by third seed Taylor Fritz, who will look to find some form after an injury lay-off at the beginning of the clay swing.

Fritz, who is projected to face Zverev in the last four, begins his campaign against Christopher O'Connell or Camilo Ugo Carabelli.

The US star could then take on 27th seed Hubert Hurkacz in round three and 14th seed Casper Ruud in round four, before a projected quarter-final against Barcelona champion Rune.

Eighth seed Rune faces a tough opener against one of Flavio Cobolli or Fabian Marozsan, before projected contests versus 31st seed Brandon Nakashima and ninth seed Daniil Medvedev.

The top of the ATP Rankings is usually quite rigid. The top few positions can go months without much movement. However, Sunday's action shook up the latest world rankings.

Alexander Zverev moved up one spot to the World No. 2 spot after defeating Ben Shelton in the BMW Open final. It was a much-needed victory for Zverev in the ATP 500 event.

Meanwhile, Carlos Alcaraz fell one spot to No. 3 after losing to Holger Rune in the Barcelona Open. The loss came as a major shock as Alcaraz had dominated on clay, and Rune had not won a title in two years.

Alcaraz's reign as the No. 2 lasted just one week. The 21-year-old surpassed Zverev on April 14, following his Monte-Carlo Masters title. However, that did not last long.

Zverev had been in a tailspin since losing to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final. For the past three months, Zverev has underperformed. The 28-year-old appears to be pulling out of the freefall now.

Both Zverev and Alcaraz will be among the world's top-ranked players competing in the ATP 1000 Madrid Open this week. With Sinner still serving his three-month ban, Zverev and Alcaraz are on opposite sides of the draw.

Other noteworthy changes in the ATP Rankings include Rune jumping four spots to crack the top ten. Rune's ascension pushed Daniil Medvedev down to No. 10.

Additionally, Shelton moved up two spots to No. 13 after his finals run in Munich. Shelton became the first American man to reach a clay court final above the ATP 250 level since Andre Agassi won the 2002 ATP Masters 1000 in Rome.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Holger Rune upset home-crowd favorite Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets on Sunday to win the Barcelona Open for his first title since 2023.

Rune defeated the Spaniard 7-6 (6), 6-2 for his first title since winning in Munich two years ago, and fifth overall. It was the Dane's first ATP 500 title.

“It means the world, it was such a great match,” Rune said. “In the beginning, I was a little bit stressed, because Carlos obviously plays big-time tennis. I had to breathe a lot and find my rhythm. After he broke me, I got more into the match and played my tennis. The first set was a big battle, it was super important to win it and gain the momentum. I'm so proud of myself.”

Alcaraz was coming off a nine-match winning streak that included his first Monte Carlo Masters title last weekend. He was searching for his third title of the year and 19th of his career. He won the Barcelona Open in 2022 and 2023.

Rune, runner-up to Jack Draper at Indian Wells, rallied from a break down in the opener and converted his fourth set point. He cruised in the second set against Alcaraz, who twice needed treatment on his upper right leg.

""I'm very happy with how I stayed composed when it mattered, and I was really brave,” Rune said.

Alcaraz will lose his No. 2 ranking to Alexander Zverev, who won his third Munich title on Sunday.

“Congratulations Holger on an amazing week,” Alcaraz said. ""Coming here and showing a great effort to make the people enjoy watching tennis, I appreciate that. We've been seeing each other since (we were) 12 years old. Time flies. I'm really happy to see us in this position, how far we've (come). Keep going.”

It was the first ATP tour-level final between two players aged 21-and-under since 2022. Both are 21.

By reaching the final in Barcelona, Rune secured a return to the top 10. He will move up to No. 9. The sixth seed in Barcelona, Rune had been forced to retire from his Monte Carlo opener with food poisoning.

Tennis legend Rafael Nadal will receive a tribute at this year's Roland Garros on May 25.

Nadal, one of the most celebrated Spanish athletes in history, retired in 2024 after a career spanning more than two decades. He will see his career celebrated at the inaugural day of French Open Roland Garros, in a ceremony commemorating his dominance of the famous clay court. He will also feature in an exhibition displayed at the tournament's official museum.

The Mallorca-born player holds the record for the most French Open titles, with 14 trophies under his belt. Across his career, he has won 22 Grand Slam titles, making him one of the most successful players in tennis history. His last appearance on the iconic French court took place in 2024 when he was eliminated in the first round.

Roland Garros officials have revealed that this tribute was planned for last year's edition, but it was not confirmed that Nadal would retire, as he eventually confirmed months later.

“Rafa has left his mark on the history of the French Open in so many ways, that's why a tribute ceremony will be held in his honour,” Roland Garros director Amélie Mauresmo said. “We want the tribute to be special, exceptional. We want it to be a surprise for everyone.”

The countdown to the 2025 French Open has started, and the entry lists for the men's and women's singles tournaments were recently released. As expected, all top players have confirmed their presence in the second Grand Slam tournament.

For the men's, top seed and World No. 1 Jannik Sinner will play in only his second tournament after his doping violation suspension expires. Sinner won the year's first Major at the Australian Open.

The women's tournament could have the most interesting twist, and there is an increasing possibility that we might see a new champion. Iga Swiatek, winner of four French Opens, is yet to lift a title with almost four months of the season gone. Of relevance, Swiatek lost to Jelena Ostapenko for the sixth time without reply in her first clay tournament of the year in Stuttgart.

Aryna Sabalenka and Madison Keys contested the year's first Grand Slam in Melbourne, with the American memorably ending the Belarusian's two-year stronghold of the Australian Open. Both women will be fancied to reach the deep end of the draw and trouble Swiatek.

Six teenagers feature in the field, evenly split between the men's and women's tournaments. So who are they?

The first name and the highest-ranked teenager in the world is Mirra Andreeva. The young Russian will turn 18 at the end of April. Remarkably, this will be her third main draw appearance at the French Open. She reached the semifinals last year after completing a massive upset over Sabalenka in the quarters.

The highest-ranked teenager on the ATP Tour is Jakub Mensik. The 19-year-old sits at a career-high ranking of No. 23. His first ATP title was at the Masters 1000 level in Miami, beating his childhood idol Novak Djokovic in the final. Mensik has never played at the French Open in the past.

Perhaps the most anticipated debut appearance in Paris will be that of Joao Fonseca. The 18-year-old Brazilian is rapidly rising in the rankings. He broke into the Top 60 and will play in only his second Grand Slam of his young career. His first one at the Australian Open was memorable (he defeated Andrey Rublev in the opening round).

One of Fonseca's former junior rivals will join him in the main draw, and that is Learner Tien. The 19-year-old American exceeded expectations at this year's Australian Open when he reached the second week against all the odds. Tien made quite the splash in Melbourne when he defeated one-time Major champion Daniil Medvedev in an epic five-setter. His high tennis intelligence and craft might help in his adaptability on the red dirt.

A little over a month ago, 19-year-old Alexandra Eala held little hope of playing in the French Open main draw. But a historic run to the Miami Open semifinals transformed her from a relative unknown to mainstream recognition. A Top 100 debut all but guaranteed that the Philippines flag will be raised around the grounds in Paris.

One of the breakout youngsters on the WTA Tour will play at the French Open. Australia's Maya Joint is another Top 100 debutant thanks to her fantastic form in the first quarter of 2025. The 19-year-old won 20 of 30 matches at all levels and soared to a career-high of No. 78. This will be her first participation at the clay Grand Slam.

Alexander Zverev was in control of the No. 2 ranking behind Jannik Sinner for the first three months of the 2025 campaign, but it has been a back-and-forth battle with Carlos Alcaraz since the start of the European clay-court swing.In a furious fight for the No. 2 seed at next month's French Open, Alcaraz took over the second spot in the ATP rankings by winning the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters last week. However, that didn't last long. Zverev's triumph at the BMW Open in Munich combined with Alcaraz's loss to Holger Rune in the Barcelona Open final moved the German back in front.Zverev stands at 8085 points to Alcaraz's 8050.In reality, though, Alcaraz has the inside track on the No. 2 seed in Paris. The 21-year-old has only 200 points to defend between now and then, with the Mutua Madrid Open and Internazionali BNL d'Italia still to play. In 2024 he lost to eventual champion Andrey Rublev in the Madrid quarterfinals and did not play the next Masters 1000 tournament in Rome. Zverev has 1100 points to defend during the same stretch–100 from the Madrid fourth round and 1000 from the Rome title.That means Alcaraz is effectively 865 points ahead of Zverev (900 fewer points to defend minus his current deficit of 35). The goal, of course, is to guarantee being on the opposite side of the Roland Garros draw from Sinner. Despite having been suspended for almost three months now, the reigning U.S. Open and Australian Open champion still owns a significant lead atop the rankings with 9930 points. Sinner is able to return next month in Rome and also has Hamburg on his schedule as he prepares for the season's second Grand Slam.    144Who will win Madrid?

Gareth Ainsworth hailed his Gillingham side as “amazing” after they secured a second-successive home win with a 1-0 League Two victory over AFC Wimbledon.

Joe Gbode came off the bench to score the only goal of the game as the Gills put a major dent in the Dons' automatic promotion hopes with a 10th game without defeat.

Ainsworth, who is yet to lose since taking charge of the club, said: “It was an amazing performance. The players were absolutely outstanding.

“They emptied every last bit of energy they had for me out there.

“I was bringing players off who couldn't walk anymore because they had put that much into it.

“The boys came in on Easter Sunday to work on a new bit of shape which I thought would cause them problems and it did.

“Wimbledon are a very big, physical side but I said if we matched them mentally and physically then we had a chance because we've got good footballers who can play.

“We were winning every header, threw ourselves at every ball. There was a block right at the end where there were two bodies flying at it.

“I'm really proud of the boys. We've got that identity now.

“It was a brilliant goal to win it. Hopefully we will have more days like this. It's not going well, but it's going OK at the moment.”

Johnnie Jackson's side are five points off the automatic promotion pace with only two games to go after winning just one of their last seven.

And Jackson said: “I'm disappointed, naturally. I don't think we did enough.

“It's a tough season. It's a tough league. Listen, these players have given everything to put themselves in this position.

“Realistically, getting in the top three looks very difficult. What we have to do is make sure we get into those play-off positions.

“We have to shake this one off and the players need to be open and honest with themselves.

“There is no time to wallow. We need to get back to work ahead of another big game.

“We need to remember the position we're in and go again.

“We were poor in the second half. We stopped doing what got us success. We wasted possession too many times. We've got ourselves to blame for that.

“The only bit of quality in the game was the goal really. It's a good goal. That's a good bit of quality that we just didn't have.

“I don't think there was anything between the teams except that moment.”

MADRID - Montreal's Gabriel Diallo advanced to the second round of qualifying at the Madrid Open tennis tournament with a comfortable 6-3, 6-3 win over American Nicolas Moreno De Alboran on Monday.

The 23-year-old Diallo, seeded third in the qualifying tournament for the ATP Masters clay-court event, had nine aces to Moreno de Alboran's one.

The six-foot-eight Canadian saved the only break point he faced by converting three of the seven chances he had, including one in the deciding game.

Diallo will face Croatian veteran Borna Coric on Tuesday for a spot in the main draw. Coric defeated Finland's Otto Virtanen 6-7 (1), 7-5, 6-2 on Monday.

Diallo, ranked 78th in the world, made it into two straight Masters-level main draws last month at Indian Wells, Calif., and Miami, losing to France's Arthur Fils in the second round both times.

Felix Auger-Aliassime of Montreal (18) and Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., (29) both have byes in the first round of the main draw in Madrid as seeded players.

In the women's draw, 25th-seed Leylah Fernandez of Laval, Que., has a first-round bye while 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Mississauga, Ont., continues her comeback from injury when she faces American McCartney Kessler in a first-round match on Wednesday,

Holger Rune surged inside the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time since last April with his victorious run at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell.

The 21-year-old Dane snapped Carlos Alcaraz's nine-match winning streak in a gutsy championship-match display at the ATP 500, capping a week in which he rose from No. 13 to No. 9.

In Munich, home favourite Alexander Zverev won his third title at the BMW Open by Bitpanda and with it, reclaimed the No. 2 spot from Alcaraz. ATPTour.com looks at the movers in the PIF ATP Rankings, as of Monday 21 April.



No. 9 Holger Rune, +4 
Just by reaching the final in Barcelona, Rune had secured his ascent to No. 9, returning inside the Top 10 for the first time since the second week of April last year. However, in the first tour-level final between two players aged 21-and-under since 2022, the Dane produced a remarkable straight-sets win over recent Monte-Carlo champion Alcaraz to claim his fifth ATP tour trophy.

No. 2 Alexander Zverev, +1 (Career High)
One week after surrendering the No. 2 spot to Alcaraz, Zverev surpassed the Spaniard to reclaim that position. If Alcaraz triumphed in Barcelona, he would have stayed at No. 2, but he was unable to spoil the party for Zverev, who celebrated his 28th birthday on Sunday.
With his title at the newly upgraded ATP 500, Zverev equalled countryman Philipp Kohlschreiber's tournament-record tally of three crowns in Munich. It marked a 24th tour-level trophy for the German, and first of the 2025 season.
No. 13 Ben Shelton, +2
After his championship-match run in Munich, Ben Shelton has risen two spots to No. 13, just one spot shy of his career-high PIF ATP Ranking. The 22-year-old became the first American to reach a clay final above ATP 250 level since Andre Agassi won the 2002 ATP Masters 1000 in Rome, and will aim to build on his form to earn a Top-10 breakthrough.
No. 58 Fabian Marozsan, +19
Fabian Marozsan surged 19 spots to No. 58 following his charge into the semi-finals in Munich. The Hungarian did not drop a set en route to that point, including victory over fourth seed Ugo Humbert in the second round, but was eventually halted by the top-seeded Zverev.
No. 71 Laslo Djere, +9
Laslo Djere continued his ascent in the 2025 PIF ATP Rankings in Barcelona, where he rose nine spots to No. 71. The Serbian, who started the year at No. 114, made it through qualifying before falling to two-time champion Alcaraz in the second round of the main draw.
Other Notable Top 100 Movers 
No. 25 Karen Khachanov, +2
No. 34 Tallon Griekspoor, +3
No. 49 David Goffin, +3
No. 61 Hamad Medjedovic, +11 (Career High) 
No. 92 Alexander Shevchenko, +12

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Scouting Report: Alcaraz & Zverev lead Madrid field, Djokovic returns to Caja Magica","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/madrid-2025-scouting-report","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:13:33 GMT","

The clay-court season continues at the Mutua Madrid Open, where the world's best players will compete for ATP Masters 1000 glory. The top two seeds, Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz, are both in form. Novak Djokovic has won three of his 40 Masters 1000 trophies at the event.

What should you keep an eye on at the Caja Magica? ATPTour.com examines 10 things to watch in Madrid.

View Madrid Draw Report: Djokovic, Alcaraz fall in same half



1) Alcaraz at home: The second seed won back-to-back titles in Madrid in 2022 and 2023 and he also brings good form to the Spanish clay. Alcaraz is fresh off a title victory at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters and a trip to the Barcelona final. The 21-year-old has won 29 of his 31 clay-court matches in Spain since the start of the 2022 season. He will face Zizou Bergs or Yoshihito Nishioka in the second round.

2) Zverev carries momentum: The German will bring confidence into Madrid following his victory on home soil in Munich, where he defeated Ben Shelton on Sunday in the final. A two-time champion in Madrid (2018 and 2021), Zverev, the top seed who will open against Roberto Bautista Agut or Jaume Munar, will try to snap a streak of two consecutive fourth-round exits at the Caja Magic

3) Battle for No. 2: Zverev and Alcaraz have swapped World No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings twice in the past two weeks. Alcaraz captured the spot after Monte-Carlo and Zverev took it back by lifting the Munich trophy. However, No. 2 is up for grabs in Madrid and throughout the rest of the clay-court season as the stars battle for the coveted top two seed at Roland Garros.

4) Djokovic returns: The former World No. 1 came within one victory of his 100th tour-level title in Miami. Will the Serbian join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) in the 100-titles club by emerging victorious in Spain? Djokovic is returning to the Madrid Masters 1000 event for the first time since 2022, when he fell to Alcaraz in a final-set tie-break in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. The Serbian is in the same half of the draw as Alcaraz.

Watch Djokovic's extraordinary moments:

5) Rublev's happy hunting ground: Andrey Rublev will feel well upon his return to the Mutua Madrid Open, where last year he earned his second Masters 1000 crown. The 27-year-old owns an 11-3 record in Madrid according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, where he has advanced to at least the Round of 16 in all four of his appearances. The seventh seed is in Zverev's quarter of the draw.

Watch 2024 Madrid final highlights:

6) Draper, Mensik pursue more ATP Masters 1000 glory: There have been two first-time Masters 1000 champions this season. Jack Draper powered to glory at Indian Wells and Jakub Mensik stunned Djokovic for the Miami crown. That victory was also the rising Czech's maiden ATP Tour title. 

7) Rune Renaissance: Holger Rune arrived in Barcelona on a three-match losing streak, but got back on track in a big way by lifting the trophy at the Spanish ATP 500. Will he keep it up in Madrid? The Danish star, who reached a Masters 1000 final last month at Indian Wells, is 2-2 at the tournament and will play Flavio Cobolli or Fabian Marozsan in his opener.

Watch Barcelona final highlights:

8) Surging Spaniard Davidovich Fokina: Plenty of attention has been focused on Alcaraz, but he is not the only Spaniard shining this season. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina is 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin thanks to a consistent season. The Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF alumnus made ATP Tour finals in Acapulco and Delray Beach, and also just advanced to a Masters 1000 semi-final in Monte-Carlo. He could face top-seeded Zverev in the third round.

9) Wild cards to try to repeat Miami success: Among the wild cards are Coleman Wong and Federico Cina, who both made breakthroughs in Miami. Wong defeated Daniel Altmaier and Ben Shelton to reach the third round, and 18-year-old Cina ousted Francisco Comesana in Florida for his first tour-level victory. They will face one another in the Madrid first round. The other wild cards are former Top 10 stars Marin Cilic and Pablo Carreno Busta, and Martin Landaluce.

10) Battle for top doubles team: The top two doubles teams in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings are Harri Heliovaara/Henry Patten and Marcelo Arevalo/Mate Pavic. Will either pair triumph in Madrid for the first time? In third place are Britons Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, who made the Monte-Carlo final.

                            2025 Stuttgart
                        

Jelena Ostapenko completed a dream week at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix by taking down No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 6-1 in the final to claim her ninth career Hologic WTA Tour title -- and first on clay since winning Roland Garros in 2017.

Stuttgart: Draws | Scores | Order of play

The fourth time would be the charm either way in the Stuttgart final: either Sabalenka would drive off with her much-coveted first Porsche after three previous losses in the title match, or Ostapenko would post her first win over Sabalenka at the fourth attempt. In the event, it was the Latvian who came out on top of a pulsating, hard-hitting battle -- and she will add a second Porsche to the Cayenne Turbo she already drives at home.

No. 24-ranked Ostapenko, who ended Miami champion Sabalenka's eight-match winning streak, improved to 3-1 overall against reigning World No. 1s. She previously defeated Garbiñe Muguruza at Wuhan 2017 and Iga Swiatek at the 2023 US Open.

Having also ousted Swiatek in the quarterfinals this week (improving to 6-0 against the Pole), Ostapenko became the ninth player to defeat both Sabalenka and Swiatek in the same tournament, sixth since Swiatek first rose to No. 1 in 2021 and first to do so on clay.

Ostapenko's 2025 record now stands at 12-9 overall. She is 4-0 against Top 10 players this year (including three wins this week), and 8-9 against players ranked outside the Top 10.

Ostapenko's overall record in finals is now an even nine wins to nine losses, while Sabalenka has 19 wins to 16 losses. The 27-year-old is the only active player to have reached finals on outdoor hard court, indoor hard court, carpet, grass, green clay, outdoor red clay and now indoor red clay. (Among retired players, this feat has also been accomplished by Maria Sharapova, Justine Henin and Dinara Safina.) Excluding the now-defunct carpet surface, Ostapenko is one of just three active players with titles on outdoor hard court, indoor hard court, grass, outdoor clay and indoor clay, joining Petra Kvitova and Karolina Pliskova.

Ostapenko had garnered just one set in three previous encounters with Sabalenka, and the sets she lost were rarely close: Sabalenka had posted three 6-1 scores against her, and two 6-2 sets. In those matches, Sabalenka's superior serve and more reliable accuracy proved decisive.

This time, the tables were turned. Ostapenko dominated behind her first serve, winning 81% of those points, while also having a greater read on Sabalenka's first delivery than in the past: the three-time major champion won just 53% of her first-serve points. Consequently, Ostapenko was able to sustain pressure on the Sabalenka serve throughout the match, bringing up 11 break points (converting six) while facing just three against her (Sabalenka converted twice).

Ostapenko also delivered superb scoreboard management skills. She raced out of the blocks with a flurry of winners from all corners of the court -- on return, at net, even on defense -- to seize an immediate break for 2-0. But Sabalenka clung on to a pair of tight service games to avoid going down a double break, then unleashed on return herself to level at 4-4. Ostapenko responded with controlled aggression to break again for 5-4, and after 57 minutes served out a thrillingly contested set that could have tilted either way.

Ultimately, from 4-4, Ostapenko would take eight of the last nine games of the match. In the second set, Sabalenka won just 10 points -- four of which came in a single break to love -- and just five on serve. By the conclusion of the contest, Ostapenko was in full flow, closing out a 1-hour, 25-minute victory in trademark fashion with consecutive return winners.

Afterwards, Ostapenko told the press that she had a premonition of victory from the moment she arrived in Stuttgart.

""Honestly, I didn't tell to anyone, I was keeping it to myself, but I felt very confident since the first day,"" she said. ""I had, like, strange -- not strange but in a good way, strange feeling. When I came here, I felt like something is going to happen this week. I pretty much felt that I can win this tournament. Because I think I'm improving day by day and I'm playing better and better. Yeah, I think I deserve it.""

That culminated in a spectacular performance against a player she had never previously beaten.

""Obviously I played her a few times, but I analyzed those matches and I knew what I had to do different today,"" Ostapenko said. ""I think I was more confident and more true player today than before.""

From denim jorts to 'pirate' chic, Agassi changed the fashion game, too.ByBaseline StaffPublished Apr 21, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 21, 2025

Andre Agassi didn't just transform the sport of tennis with his style of play and on-court achievements; the International Tennis Hall of Famer also changed the sport's fashion game as we know it.And fans heared it from the man himself last week as the former world No. 1 revisited some of his most iconic serves— not aces, but 'fits—in a video posted to his Instagram account, revealing that he still thinks fondly of his boldest sartorial stylings even today.Read more: Andre Agassi and Yannick Noah herald new era for the Laver CupAgassi's countdown begins with his self-described ""pirate look"" from the 1995 Australian Open, where he donned baggy patterned shorts, a loose white and burgundy-striped shirt, a matching banada, hoop earring, and goatee for complete privateer vibes. The 54-year-old confessed that the look wouldn't have been out of place in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean franchise which debuted nearly a decade later (and the clip even offered a side-by-side of Agassi and Johnny Depp's character Jack Sparrow, the lead in the film), but he performed his own swashbuckling heist in the final that year in Melbourne.In his Australian Open debut, a memorable occasion that the tournament itself dubbed ""a blockbuster"" that ushered in an era of change, Agassi won his third career Grand Slam singles title by beating top seed and longtime rival Pete Sampras from a set down, and also saved two set points in the third set of the 4-6, 6-1, 7-6(6), 6-4 title match.

While that was a watershed moment for Agassi's career, the look he tabbed at No. 2 in his countdown came when he was a fresh-faced 18-year-old still storming onto the scene: the acid-wash acid jean shorts that Nike made for him for the 1988 US Open.""Tennis hadn't quite seen anybody wearing anything but white with their shirts tucked in"" at the time, Agassi said, and it's arguably the look that has been the most enduring. The men's fashion magazine *GQ* once even wrote: ""What's remarkable about the style choice is that he was actually able to compete in such a restrictive fabric—this was, after all, before stretch denim became the norm.""Agassi repeated the ""jorts"" multiple times, and his top pick featured them, too. His black denim shorts with hot-pink tights, a matching pink-print top and headband, and a pair of Nike Air Tech Challenge 2s famously drew the ire of International Tennis Federation president Philippe Chatrier, also the head of the French tennis federation, at Roland Garros in 1990.

""At the time, [he] was thinking about bringing in a dress code,"" Agassi recalled, ""so I did what any nobel person would do and I called him a bozo in the press conference.

2025 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix: Verstappen leads on the race start as Tsunoda and Gasly collision brings out the Safety Car

“For me, it's just a racing incident,” said Tsunoda after the former team mates came to blows and slid into the concrete wall. “I don't think I could have done better than that, to be honest.

“I tried my best to avoid [him] as much as I can, but also, in that kind of space, it's really hard to avoid [contact]. I don't know what I can do other than that.

“We kind of knew each other, and if you try to go outside from there... other than he goes half of the car at least on the white line, it would have [been a] collision. It's a great shame.”

Asked if both he and Gasly needed to be “more friendly” to each other with the field so congested at the start of the race, Tsunoda added: “Well, yeah... I don't know what I should do.

Tsunoda brands his Lap 1 clash with Gasly ‘a racing incident'

“I was behind [Carlos] Sainz, I was fully in control in terms of speed, it was not like I was nearly crashing into Carlos in front. It's hard to justify which is wrong or better.”

Tsunoda was completing his third race weekend for Red Bull after replacing Liam Lawson ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix. Since the move, he has scored only two championship points – these through finishing ninth in Bahrain – compared to the 51 of team mate Max Verstappen.

Aware of the pressure that can quickly build with sub-optimal results, Tsunoda said: “Every lap for me is very important at this kind of time. It's still the third race and every lap counts to learn something, and it's a shame that something happened like this at this stage.”

""Luther"" extends its domination, while ""Lose Control"" loges a record-breaking 58th week in the top 10.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” rules the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart for a ninth total and consecutive week. The single, whose title honors late R&B legend Luther Vandross, who is sampled on the track, became Lamar's sixth No. 1 and SZA's third. Lamar and SZA each extend their longest career Hot 100 reigns with the song, whose official video premiered April 11.


	Meanwhile, “Luther” passes 24kGoldn's “Mood” (featuring iann dior), which led for eight weeks in 2020-21, for the sole second-longest Hot 100 command among rap hits this decade, after only Roddy Ricch's “The Box,” which dominated for 11 weeks in 2020. (Rap titles are defined as those that have hit or are eligible for Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart.)


	Plus, Chappell Roan ties her best Hot 100 rank, as “Pink Pony Club” rises 5-4; Alex Warren's first top 10, “Ordinary,” reaches the top five (7-5), and hits No. 1 on the Digital Song Sales chart; and Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” at No. 7, breaks the record for the most weeks ever spent in the Hot 100's top 10, as it adds a 58th week in the region, one-upping the run of The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights.”


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated April 26, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, April 22. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	Following the April 11 premiere of its official video, “Luther,” on pgLang/Interscope/ICLG, totaled 67.5 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 7% week-over-week), 25 million official streams (up 10%) and 2,000 sold (up 7%) in the U.S. April 11-17.


	“Luther” rebounds two spots for a seventh week atop the Streaming Songs chart; leads Radio Songs for a third week and rises three places to No. 20, after reaching No. 4, on Digital Song Sales.


	“Luther” concurrently claims a 17th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts.


	Chappell Roan's “Pink Pony Club” clip-clops a spot to No. 4 on the Hot 100, led by 2% gain to 45.2 million in audience. It tops the Pop Airplay chart for a third week.


	The singer-songwriter matches her best Hot 100 rank, first set by “Good Luck Babe!,” which hit No. 4 last September. Her three top 10s have all reached the top five; “The Giver” debuted at its No. 5 peak in March.


	A week after “Ordinary” became Alex Warren's first Hot 100 top 10, the song becomes his first top five hit, lifting 7-5. It surged by 60% to 13.2 million in airplay audience in the tracking week.


	The single also lifts 3-1 to become Warren's first leader on Digital Song Sales (6,000 sold, up 3%).


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, rebounds 8-7, as it tallies a record-breaking 58th week in the top 10, surpassing the run in the region of The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” for the most such frames in the chart's 66-year history. “Lose Control” first set up shop in the top 10 on the list dated Jan. 20, 2024, and has been absent from the tier for only eight weeks since.


Most Weeks in the Hot 100's Top 10:


	Notably, longevity in the weekly top 10 translates to success on the annual year-end Hot 100. Along with “Lose Control” leading for 2024, “Last Night” (2023), “Heat Waves” (2022), “Levitating” (2021) and “Blinding Lights” (2020) also each finished first on its respective year-end ranking this decade.


	“Lose Control” notches an 87th week on the Hot 100 overall, tying Imagine Dragons' “Radioactive,” in 2012-14, for the third-longest stay in the chart's history. They trail only “Heat Waves” (91 weeks, in 2021-22) and “Blinding Lights” (90, in 2019-22).


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” ascends 3-2, following five nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in January. The song swaps spots with Drake's “Nokia,” down a spot from its No. 2 high.


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” drops 4-6 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July. It posts a 41st week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	BigXthaPlug's “All the Way,” featuring Bailey Zimmerman, dips to No. 8 on the Hot 100, a week after it launched at No. 4; Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things” rises 10-9, after it hit No. 2 in March 2024; and, rounding out the top 10, Morgan Wallen “I'm the Problem” slips 9-10, after it debuted at its No. 2 high in February.

Scooter Braun has also taken to social media to defend Goldenvoice CEO Paul Tollett in the wake of the messaging.

	One week after they claimed Coachella censored the pro-Palestinian messaging during their debut at the event, Northern Irish hip-hop group Kneecap ended their second festival date with strong anti-Israel sentiments.

	The Belfast trio performed at the festival's second weekend on Friday (April 18), closing their set by projecting strong messaging in support of Palestinians. “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” the projected messages read. “It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes. F–k Israel; free Palestine.”

	Reportedly, Kneecap's first weekend performance on April 11 was also set to feature the messages, though their sentiments did not appear. The absent messages were brought to the band's attention after word that their chant celebrating the 2013 death of former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was not broadcast during the festival's livestream.


	“Not the only thing that was cut – our messaging on the US-backed genocide in Gaza somehow never appeared on screens either,” Kneecap wrote on socials in response to the incident. “Back next Friday Coachella and it'll be sorted.” According to Variety, the Sonora tent's performances were not broadcast for the second weekend of the festival.


	Alongside the promised return of the messages, the trio also increased their sentiments for the second weekend. While their pro-Palestine and anti-Israel chants remained, the group also used their latest performance to tell the crowd “the Irish are not so longer persecuted under the Brits, but we were never bombed under the f–king skies with nowhere to go.”


	This year's edition of Coachella has not been lacking in terms of artists protesting Israel and sharing their support of Palestine. While Green Day have altered lyrics to reflect the plight of Palestinian children, names such as Bob Vylan and Blonde Redhead have also displayed Palestinian flags during their sets. In the case of the latter, the onstage event was soundtracked by audio of Mahmoud Khalil – the detained Columbia University graduate student currently being held in an immigration detention center following his role in on-campus protests.


	Kneecap's messaging has generated the most notoriety, however, with many artists and fans calling on Coachella organizers Goldenvoice and parent company AEG Presents to comment on the situation. The Hollywood Reporter notes that insiders have claimed Goldenvoice CEO Paul Tollett was “blindsided” by Kneecap's actions.

	











	In a post shared on social media, HYBE America CEO and former talent manager Scooter Braun – who previously staged exhibits in Los Angeles and Israel about the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel – defended Tollett.


	“This is my friend Paul Tollett, the founder of @coachella,” Braun wrote. “He is someone who lives and breathes the festival community. He fights for artists and he fights for all people. When I invited him to the opening of the Nova music exhibit in Los Angeles, he was the first person from the industry to accept. 


	“He came on his own time and spent five hours in the exhibit and then met with survivors of nova and invited them to the festival this year as his guest. He cried with them, he laughed with them, and he continues to advocate for them. 


	“Let's not lose sight of who this man is, and let us stand with him in this moment when a group, without his knowing, took advantage of his festival and created hate in a place that's filled with love,” Braun added.

The conclusion of what was supposed to by Bluesfest's final edition has brought with it the official word that it will indeed continue into next year.


													By
												

	Tyler Jenke



The sun hadn't even set on what was planned to be Bluesfest's final day before the official confirmation was given that the event would live on.


	The long-running festival has become an institution on the Australian festivals calendar across its 36-year history. Names such as Bob Dylan, BB King, Paul Simon, John Mayer, Mary J Blige, and Kendrick Lamar, plus homegrown stars Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil and Tash Sultana, have all performed over the years, with the dizzying lineups also offering chances for rising stars to receive a vital platform.

	However, this year's event – which ran from April 17-20 on Australia's east coast – was initially set to be the final outing for the long-running festival. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“To my Dear Bluesfest Family, and after more than 50 years in the music business, Bluesfest has been a labour of love, a celebration of music, community, and the resilient spirit of our fans,” festival director Peter Noble wrote in a statement last year.


	“But after the 2025 festival, as much as it pains me to say this, it's time to close this chapter,” he continued. “As I said earlier this year at Bluesfest 2024, next year's festival will be happening and it definitely is, but it will be our last.”


	However, in December, Noble had changed his tune, explaining that the decision to call time on the event was an attempt to regain the support of the New South Wales state government, and noted that organizers were already booking acts for their 2026 edition.


	On Sunday, April 20, Bluesfest officially confirmed that the festival would live on, revealing that it would be taking place across the Easter long weekend of 2026, from April 2-5. Additionally, attendees were also given the chance to purchase “pre-early bird tickets,” with the offer expiring at the conclusion of the festival.


	“Please support our festival and guarantee our future by the simple act of buying your ticket at the best possible price at the festival today,” organizers wrote on social media. Traditionally, standard early bird tickets for the next festival are put on sale shortly after the previous event, with organizers expected to do so in the near future.


	The announcement of Bluesfest's 2026 return also took place one day after Noble stood with Senator Sarah Hanson-Young and Mandy Nolan as the Australian Greens party launched their Festivals Support Package on the grounds of the festival.


	The Greens' proposed package to revitalize Australian festivals includes $20 million AUD per year in direct festival grants, $2 million AUD for a comprehensive review of the failures relating to the insurance market that is affecting the live music sector, and a national festival strategy, alongside tax offsets for artists and venues.


	“Our festivals are in crisis,” Hanson-Young said. “Over the past few years we've seen the cancellation after cancellation of loved and iconic festivals. It's clear that the government needs to step in to help the industry.”


	“With rising costs, insurance issues, and festival cancellations across the country, this plan brings hope and much-needed support to keep Australia's festival scene alive and thriving,” Bluesfest organizers added.


	The 2025 edition of Bluesfest featured Crowded House, Chaka Khan and Toto in the headline positions, with a wide variety of Australian and international acts completing the vast bill. Artist details for the 2026 revival of Bluesfest are yet to be announced, though will ostensibly be revealed around August/September, as is traditional for the festival's first lineup announcement

Ernie Hudson is taking over the late Carl Weathers‘ voice role of action figure Combat Carl in Toy Story 5, Deadline has confirmed.


	Prior to his passing due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, pro football player turned actor Weathers voiced Combat Carl in two projects: the 2013 TV special Toy Story of Terror! and 2019's Toy Story 4, which grossed over $1 billion worldwide. He died in February 2024, aged 76.


	While official plot details for Toy Story 5 remain under wraps, ahead of the film's June 19, 2026 unveiling, star Tim Allen said in an interview with WIVB that the film is “a lot about Jessie,” the cowgirl doll voiced by Joan Cusack. “Tom [Hanks] and I do — Woody and I — do realign,” added the actor, who voices Buzz Lightyear. “And there's an unbelievable opening scene with Buzz Lightyears. I can give you that, but I can't give you much more.”

	











	In a separate interview with Collider after completing his first voiceover session on the new film, Allen called the sequel “a very, very clever story” with “a brilliant script,” adding, “It's a really good story, guys. It's really good.”

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Rising screenwriter Jenna Mattison has been tapped to script an adaptation of Decorum at the Deathbed, the 2021 novella from Bird Box‘s Josh Malerman, for the New York Times bestseller's production house Spin a Black Yarn.


	Released exclusively as an Audible Original, Decorum at the Deathbed follows a grieving widow that starts a twisted affair with the detective investigating the mutilated deer that keep appearing in the forest behind her house. But as the relationship deepens he begins to wonder if she's truly a victim or a sociopathic killer. A disturbing and terrifying tale unearthing the dark shadows of the mind and finding redemption in the most unexpected of places. 

	











	The story is described as an elevated psychological thriller — Body Heat meets Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart. The search for a director is underway, with Malerman and his producing partner Ryan Lewis (Bird Box, Incidents Around the House) set to produce for Spin a Black Yarn.

	Mattison is no stranger to bestselling authors, having adapted novels by James Patterson and Sophie Kinsella, as well as being brought on in 2024 to adapt Dying to Be Me, the New York Times bestselling cancer memoir by Anita Moorjani. Currently, she's serving as writer and executive producer on a TV series in development at Universal based on an international bestseller from Patterson. She's also in pre-pro on Haunted, another of her films to be shot in Thailand with the Sundance and Independent Spirit Award-nominated Rosemary Rodriguez (The Walking Dead, The Good Wife) directing. Previously, Mattison wrote, directed and produced The Sound, a psychological thriller released theatrically by Orion and Samuel Goldwn.


	Malerman is best known for his New York Times bestseller Bird Box, the post-apocalyptic horror thriller adapted into Netflix's 2018 film of the same name. Directed by Susanne Bier and starring Sandra Bullock, the feature take stood for a time as the most popular film in the streamer's history, currently sitting at #5 on Netflix's most popular films list. A spin-off sequel, Bird Box: Barcelona, on which Malerman was an EP, premiered on Netflix in 2023.


	Just recently, Malerman set up a feature adaptation of his horror novel Incidents Around the House at Universal, with Jessica Chastain to star and Rob Savage directing, as we were first to report. Atomic Monster and Blumhouse will produce in association with Spin a Black Yarn, with pre-production underway.

	











	Mattison is repped by Gersh, manager Geoff Silverman of Evoke Entertainment, and Cohen & Gardner; Malerman by Ryan Lewis of Spin a Black Yarn, Kristin Nelson of Nelson Literary Agency, and Wayne Alexander of Alexander Lawrence Frumes & Labowitz.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Hollywood workers have committed to a show of force ahead of key hearings this week for the California legislation aimed at expanding and amending the state's Film and Television Tax Credit Program.


	Deadline understands that more than 100,000 letters have been sent to Sacramento in support of SB630 and AB1138, which would not only allocate $750M annually in tax incentives for production in the state but also redefine and broaden eligibility for the program. 


	“The letters are really the indication of the depth and commitment to moving this forward, to letting our elected officials know how important this is to our state and to the working people in this industry,” Rebecca Rhine,  Entertainment Union Coalition President and Directors Guild of America Western Executive Director, told Deadline. “We're at a tipping point here…This funding and this legislation to make the program more competitive is so critical to working families in California.”

	The initiative was led by the Entertainment Union Coalition as part of its Keep California Rolling campaign, which has been lobbying for the passage of SB630 and AB1138. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the sister bills will go before their respective committees for a vote that could send them to the larger legislature for approval.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The letters urge key members of the Senate's Revenue & Taxation Committee as well as the Assembly Arts, Entertainment, Sports, and Tourism Committee to vote the bills out of committee this week in order to put workers one step closer to being able to “continue to contribute and work where I live.”


	“I don't want to change careers, and I don't want to leave the state,” the sample text for the letter, which is embedded in full below, reads. “What I want is the opportunity to work where I live and to continue to be a part of the most vibrant creative community in the world. This iconic industry that has made California home for 100 years. It has been good for my family and good for our state. When our Industry thrives, California thrives.”


	The letter also attempts to illustrate the hardship that many production workers have endured over the last several years, made even worse by the exodus of production to other territories. As their financial incentives have expanded, California's has remained stagnant.

	











	“I feel like we have done everything we can to make elected leaders understand what this bill does, which is retain jobs for Californians, and why it's so important what our industry brings to the state,” Rhine added.


	This is a positive sign for the active legislation, which California lawmakers began weighing last month. Governor Gavin Newsom first announced his proposed plans to up the program's funding from $330M annually to $750M annually in October and, if passed, it will be second in the country only to Georgia, which does not have a cap on its production incentives.


	Some state lawmakers hope the program's revamp will breathe some much-needed life into California's once-bustling film and TV industry, while others expressed some skepticism over whether more than doubling the incentive cap is the most productive use of those funds within the state budget.


	However, sources tell Deadline that this is an incredibly high priority for Newsom and, while passing these bills may ultimately require some wrangling given the current political realities in the United States, he is very determined that this will happen. 


	The Assembly Arts, Entertainment, Sports, and Tourism Committee will vote on AB1138 during a hearing Tuesday at 9 a.m. The Senate Revenue & Taxation Committee are scheduled for a vote on SB630 Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.


The full letter is below.

Dear Chairs Ward, McNerney, Gipson, and Committee Members,My name is **NAME** and I am one of the 165,000 union members of the Entertainment Union Coalition who works in California's motion picture and television industry. I am not just a statistic; I am a Californian who needs your support.I have worked in this industry for **NUMBER** years. I pay taxes, support local businesses, raise my family, engage in my community, and have always been proud of my work and my contribution to making this great State. That's why I am a supporter of the modernization of the California Film and Television Jobs Program in AB 1138 and SB 630. I want to continue to contribute and work where I live.Over the past several years, we have hit very hard times. Jobs are scarce for those of us who have spent decades building our careers and for those of us who are just trying to “ break in.” Industry vendors, large and small, are shutting down across California and once that infrastructure is gone it can't be rebuilt. Those lucky enough to find work in some instances must leave home for months at a time to support themselves and their families. All because production work is leaving California, lured away by other states and countries that understand how valuable our industry is to their economies.Our industry has drastically changed over the 11 years since the original California Film and Television Jobs Act was passed. But both the funding and the program structure have not changed enough to remain competitive.But we have the opportunity to do that right now.I don't want to change careers, and I don't want to leave the state. What I want is the opportunity to work where I live and to continue to be a part of the most vibrant creative community in the world. This iconic industry that has made California home for 100 years. It has been good for my family and good for our state. When our Industry thrives, California thrives.Please vote Yes for AB 1138 and SB 630.We need your support.Sincerely,**NAME**

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Monday announced rules and campaign regulations for the upcoming 98th Oscars, which will be held March 15, 2026. Chief among the changes is a new procedural demand that voters must now watch all nominated films in each category in order to be eligible to vote in the final round. How they expect members to prove they have watched is not spelled out in the AMPAS release today, but this is a key change in rules that never laid it out quite like this before.


	Another — and welcome — key change is that all designated nominees will have their names included on the final ballot. Previously. in many categories. it was just the name of the nominated movie, not the person nominated.

	











	Meanwhile, category rules for eligibility and voting for the inaugural Academy Award for Achievement in Casting have been codified. There will be a preliminary round of voting to determine a shortlist of 10 films, and prior to nominations voting Casting Directors Branch members will be invited to view a “bake-off” presentation of the shortlisted achievements including a Q&A with the designated nominees. There still is no mention about where the inaugural Casting Oscar would be presented, whether on the Oscar show itself, during the Governors Awards, or at some other place.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Other substantive rules changes 

In the rules for film eligibility, the following language regarding Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been introduced, as recommended by the Academy's Science and Technology Council:With regard to Generative Artificial Intelligence and other digital tools used in the making of the film, the tools neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination. The Academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award.For consideration in the Best Picture category, films released from January 1, 2025, through June 30, 2025, must have shown proof of submission for Producers Guild of America (PGA) mark certification or awards-only determination no later than September 10, 2025. Films released from July 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025, must have shown proof of submission to the PGA no later than November 13, 2025.In the Animated Short Film category, voting privileges in the nominations round will be extended to all Academy members who opt in to participate. Members must view all 15 shortlisted films to be eligible to vote in the category.​​​​​​In the Cinematography category, there will now be a preliminary round of voting for the Cinematography award to determine a shortlist of between 10 and 20 films.In the International Feature Film category, the eligibility requirement regarding creative control has been updated to be inclusive of filmmakers with refugee or asylum status.The submitting country must confirm that creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.


	Academy key dates, including submission deadlines and voting periods, for the 2025 Oscars season are as follows: 


	The Academy also updated and clarified formatting and language in the campaign promotional regulations for the 98th Oscars. The regulations specify how motion picture companies and individuals directly associated with Oscars-eligible motion pictures may promote such motion pictures, achievements and performances to Academy members and how Academy members may promote Oscars-eligible motion pictures, achievements and performances.Substantive changes to the campaign promotional regulations include: Oscar-qualifying film festivals may now have access to approved mailing houses to share information about festival programming with Academy members. Public communications (including any social media posts, reposts, shares and comments) may not disparage the techniques used in or subject matter of any motion picture. Any Academy member, motion picture company or individual directly associated with an eligible motion picture found to be in violation will be subject to penalization The latter could be referring to most recently social media chatter about the use of AI for vocal tweaking in The Brutalist and other films during the past Oscar season.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	The first public look at Weapons, Zach Cregger's follow-up after Barbarian, is here. This is not the clip we saw at CinemaCon, by the way, rather pieces of it.


	The voice-over as the camera swirls around a darkened kid's bedroom here sounds like it's from Toby Huss as he tells a concerned parent, “Mr. Graff, I can understand your passion, and I don't mind having these conversations with you, because God forbid, if it was my child, I'd be demanding answers too.”


	The set-up here: children are leaving their houses in the middle of the night, and it's freaking parents out.

	Continues the voice-over, “Those kids walked out of those homes nobody pulled them out.” And then the freak images of young children dashing through the night in their pajamas.

	











	Originally set to come out over MLK weekend 2026, Warner Bros got so excited about Weapons it moved the movie to summer, on August 8, after excellent test scores. The notion is that we're bound for another horror event film after Ryan Coogler's Sinners opened to $48M this past weekend.


	In CinemaCon footage shown earlier this month, we saw mobs of parents at a PTA school meeting losing their minds over their kids gone missing. It's a situation that has Josh Brolin's character yelling for answers, and Julia Garner's concerned parent waking up in night sweats. She happens to walk into a classroom in the middle of the night to find spooky kids at a desk. There's also a lot of twisted, blood-curdling images not shown here, i.e., blood exploding from a head and some red-haired clown kid popping up in the forest.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kristen Stewart Marries Dylan Meyer, Photos Show","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/kristen-stewart-marries-married-dylan-meyer-photos-show/","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:54:23 GMT","

“Twilight” actress Kristen Stewart is married.

According to photos obtained by TMZ, Stewart married Dylan Meyer at her home on April 20, 2025. The “intimate” ceremony took place at Stewart's home, TMZ reported.

The photos show Stewart putting a ring on Meyer's finger, and Meyer appearing to be starting to kiss the actress.

Meyer frequently shares photos and comments about Stewart on Instagram, writing on April 9, “Happy birthday to my favorite person to do nothing, and everything, with.”

With another photo showing the pair together, she wrote, “I think I might chew my fingers off from nerves today but here's a sweet photo @lindseybyrnes took.”

Wedding guests “included ‘Pretty Little Liars' star Ashley Benson and her husband, Brandon Davis,” US Weekly reported. According to US Weekly, Meyer is the daughter of an Oscar-nominated screenwriter named Nicholas Meyer.

In 2019, the pair announced they were dating when Meyer posted a picture showing them kissing to her Instagram page and wrote, “Find me under the covers hiding from the happiness police. 🖤” More than 20,000 people liked that post.

A post shared by Dylan Meyer (@spillzdylz)

According to TMZ, Stewart and Meyer first went to the courthouse to obtain a marriage license before saying their vows at Stewart's home.

Another photo published by the entertainment news site shows the couple embracing in a hug.

According to TMZ, they have been engaged since 2021, and Stewart told Howard Stern that Meyer “popped the question.”  



Page Six reported that Meyer is a screenwriter who met Stewart on a movie set.

They started dating in 2019 after they met at a birthday party for a mutual friend, Page Six reported.

“I very distinctly carved out what I wanted,” Stewart recalled to Stern of Meyer's proposal, according to Page Six. “It was really cute. She did very well.”

According to Page Six, she added on that show, “We're marrying, we're totally gonna do it. I wanted to be proposed to.”

She also added, according to Page Six, “I want to be, like, sort of somewhat reasonable about it, but I think good things happen fast. I have a couple plans that are just the coolest things to do. I'm really impulsive. I don't know when it's going to be.”

According to Page Six, Stewart also declared that she knew she loved Meyer quickly.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","HGTV Exes Christina Haack & Tarek El Moussa Reveal They're on a Blended Family Easter Trip","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/christina-haack-tarek-blended-family-vacation/","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 18:02:00 GMT","

Seven years after former “Flip or Flop” stars Christina Haack and Tarek El Moussa's marriage ended with a contentious divorce, their relationship is in such a good place that the HGTV fan-favorites are enjoying their 2025 spring break as a blended family with their kids, parents, and partners. 

In an Instagram post on April 20, Christina called it “the best spring break I could ever ask for.” That declaration came after multiple posts in her Instagram Stories about the trip. 

“Home for a week,” Haack captioned a pic of a private pool photo and hot tub in her April 18 Instagram Stories, tagging her new beau, Chris Larocca. She also posted a pic of them snuggling on a lounge chair in their bathing suits, with her wearing a backwards baseball cap that said “put it on my boyfriend's tab.”

Soon after, Tarek and his wife (and fellow HGTV star) Heather Rae El Moussa arrived. They also began sharing photos and videos in their Instagram Stories, revealing that they're all vacationing as one big happy family in California's Coachella Valley. 

A post shared by Tarek El Moussa (@therealtarekelmoussa)

Based on photos and videos shared in the trio of HGTV stars' Instagram Stories, the family-friendly vacation has included lots of pool time, golf cart rides in the community of vacation homes where they're staying, and an Easter egg hunt. 

On April 19, the El Moussas, Christina, and Larocca posed for a photo by the pool — the women in bikinis and the guys in t-shirts and swim trunks. Tarek shared the photo in his Stories and wrote, “Kicking off Easter Weekend by the pool 👏☀️.” The two couples were also seen riding in a golf cart together, with Larocca raising his beer to the camera. 

The trip isn't just about couples' fun, though — they have a big group along for the ride, including their kids — Tarek and Christina's 14-year-old daughter Taylor and nine-year-old son Brayden, the El Moussas' two-year-old son Tristan, and Christina's five-year-old son Hudson, whom she shares with ex-husband Ant Anstead. 

The boys have been seen in photos having fun together at the pool, sitting at a table together, lounging in a big bed as Hudson adorably said he was “tired” after “babysitting” Tristan, and happily searching for Easter eggs. 

Though it doesn't appear that Christina's parents are on the trip, the El Moussas' parents have been seen partaking in the fun. On April 19, Tarek's mom, Dominque El Moussa–Arnould, posted Instagram photos of her and her husband zipping around in “state of the art” Skye Performance golf carts with Heather's parents, Teresa and Dan Young. 

Dominique captioned her post, “Wow! The golf carts are just state of the art with technology galore, fun disco lights, first ones with power steering and just all around gorgeous. Having fun with Teresa and Dan! Waiting for the family chaos to arrive 😎”

Meanwhile, Christina also brought her friend Kristin on the trip. On April 19, Haack posted a photo of them by the pool in her Stories and wrote, “What's the best dating site now for my girl @kristinbicoastal?”

A post shared by HGTV (@hgtv)

Though things were rocky for Christina and Tarek when they first split in 2017, they made huge inroads as co-parents over the years. In early 2024, Tarek told EntertainmentNOW that their relationship was the best it had ever been since their divorce. But things further improved as they filmed their hit competition show “The Flip Off” later that year, when the former couple buried the hatchet for good. 

In the premiere episode, which first aired in late January, Christina informed Tarek on-camera that she'd just broken up with her third husband, Josh Hall. The two sat down for a tearful heart-to-heart, apologizing for any past hurts. 

After some highly-publicized bumps in the road, Christina and Heather's friendship also grew through the process of filming. 

In February, Heather told EntertainmentNOW, “We've known each other for six years now; that's a long time. And you know, we're very involved with each other every day because we're raising children together.”

“But filming ‘The Flip Off' brought us even closer together,” she continued, “because we saw each other in a different way. Not just as co-parents, but we got to know each other on a deeper level, where we created more of a friendship.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Guess Who? '80s TV Queen Spotted Looking Totally Unbothered","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/80s-queen-mary-kay-place-spotted/","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 02:26:53 GMT","

So, here's a blast from the past: Mary Kay Place, the Emmy-winning scene-stealer from “Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman” and all-around unsung hero of ‘70s and ‘80s TV, just made a rare appearance in Los Angeles… and fans had to do a double take. Known for her offbeat charm and that quietly powerful on-screen presence, Place was photographed in a casual outfit with a cute puffer vest, a baseball cap on, and seeming totally unfazed by the cameras.

Let's be real: this wasn't a red carpet moment. No stylists. No glam squad. Just a 77-year-old legend running errands like the rest of us. And while some were quick to drop the whole “unrecognizable” headline, longtime fans immediately knew the deal. She's just doing what she's always done; keeping it low-key, staying grounded, and not making a production out of simply existing in the world.

According to Daily Mail, who originally reported on her sighting, Place appeared comfortable and calm, sticking to her signature under-the-radar vibe. And we love that for her. 

If your brain just screamed, “Wait—that Mary Kay Place?!” you're not alone. From her standout role as Loretta Haggers and her role in “The Big Chill” to her brilliant supporting work in “Being John Malkovich,” “Big Love,” and the indie drama “Diane,” Place has never needed flash to make an impact. Her career has been about layered performances, smart character choices, and flying blissfully under the radar while quietly crushing every role she touches.

She's also written for sitcoms (“The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” anyone?) and even snagged a Grammy nom for her country music album called “Aimin' to Please” in the '70s. Range? Please. She invented it.

So no, Place might not be dominating the social media feeds or starring in the big franchise blockbusters; but she's still very much that actress. The kind whose name you might not shout at trivia night, but whose face you immediately trust when it shows up on the screen.

In a world obsessed with reinvention and reboots, Mary Kay Place is a refreshing reminder that you don't have to constantly be “trending” to matter to the world. Sometimes the real icons are the ones who let their work speak for itself… and then quietly go get their groceries.

We see you, Mary Kay. And we're still fans.

On Monday, April 21, The Academy's Board of Governors released a sweeping list of their newly approved awards rules and campaign promotional regulations for the 98th Academy Awards set for Sunday, March 15, 2026.

One of the more fascinating aspects of the new rules is how many directly address the several scandals swirling around last year's Oscar campaign. For instance, in response to all the claims of Best Picture nominees from “The Brutalist” to “A Complete Unknown” using some form generative artificial intelligence, the Academy's Science and Technology Council has approved new eligibility language that reads: “With regard to Generative Artificial Intelligence and other digital tools used in the making of the film, the tools neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination. The Academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award.”

Similarly, in what seems like an allusion to the Best Picture nominees announcement having so many “Nominees to be determined” that the Academy made a t-shirt to tout it, there is now a rule for films released from January 1, 2025, through June 30, 2025, to have to show proof of submission for Producers Guild of America (PGA) mark certification or awards-only determination no later than September 10, 2025. For films released from July 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025, producers must show proof of submission to the PGA no later than November 13, 2025.

Finally, in consideration of how recent contenders like “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” were submitted by the same country their dissident filmmakers took asylum in, the Best International Feature Film category has updated the eligibility requirement regarding creative control in order to be inclusive of filmmakers with refugee or asylum status. The new wording is as follows: “The submitting country must confirm that creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.”

On the side of campaign promotional regulations changes, a new rule that public communications (including any social media posts, reposts, shares, and comments) may not disparage the techniques used in or subject matter of any motion picture, goes hand in hand with the aforementioned AI techniques conversation that sprouted up this past awards season. 

 










Meanwhile, the “subject matter” part of the rule is more evergreen, and not likely a direct response to some of the flack a film like “Emilia Pérez” received. The last line of the rule says any Academy member, motion picture company, or individual directly associated with an eligible motion picture found to be in violation will be subject to penalization.

As for the less referential rules and regulations, the Best Animated Short Film is now available for all Academy members to opt into voting for, as long as they see all 15 films on the shortlist. Speaking of shortlists, there will now be one for Best Cinematography featuring 10 to 20 films determined in the preliminary round of voting. 

The new Achievement in Casting category will also be part of the preliminary round of voting, where a shortlist of 10 films will be determined. The category will also have a bake-off, similar to the Makeup and Hairstyling, Sound, and Visual Effects nominees, where Casting Directors Branch members will be invited to view a presentation of the shortlisted achievements, including a Q&A with the designated nominees. 

Lastly, the Music categories submission deadlines have also been split now, with Best Original Song having a deadline of Wednesday, October 15, 2025, 5 p.m. PT, and Best Original Score having a deadline of Monday, November 3, 2025, at 5 p.m. PT. And on the campaign regulations side, Oscar-qualifying film festivals can now have access to approved mailing houses to share information about festival programming with Academy members.

 










And if it wasn't clear to members before, the Academy has made a definitive procedural change, telling them that they must now watch all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round for the Oscars. All designated nominees will also be included on the final ballot.

The 98th Oscars will air live on ABC on Sunday, March 15, 2026, at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT.

Zach Cregger is building out his “Barbarian” cinematic universe with the highly-anticipated “Weapons.” While little is known about Cregger's latest horror/thriller, New Line Cinema chief Richard Brenner described the film as being “batshit insane.”

Julia Garner stars as a teacher whose entire classroom of kids goes missing in the middle of the night. Josh Brolin is one of the many parents demanding answers. Did Garner's character lure them away? Is this supernatural? And who is orchestrating a slew of murders in town…could it be the children?

 










The logline reads: “Weapons” is a “horror film that follows an entire classroom of children who get out of their beds and disappear one night without a trace. When all but one child from the same class mysteriously vanish on the same night at exactly the same time, a community is left questioning who or what is behind their disappearance.”

Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams, Cary Christopher, Benedict Wong, and Amy Madigan also star. Cregger directs from his own screenplay, and produces alongside Roy Lee, Miri Yoon, J.D. Lifshitz, and Raphael Margules. Brolin and Michelle Morrissey are executive producing. 

The filmmaker's creative team behind the camera includes director of photography Larkin Seiple, production designer Tom Hammock, editor Joe Murphy, and costume designer Trish Sommerville. The music is by Ryan Holladay, Hays Holladay, and Cregger. “Weapons” is a Subconscious, Vertigo Entertainment, and Boulderlight Pictures production. It will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, and released in theaters and IMAX nationwide. 

Cregger's feature debut “Barbarian” was an indie hit grossing $45 million worldwide. He later landed a deal with studio New Line Cinema, and will be rebooting the “Resident Evil” franchise. Cregger previously revealed that A24 and Neon both passed on “Barbarian” before he connected with BoulderLight to produce; New Regency, Vertigo, and Disney later boarded the horror thriller. “Weapons” is said to exist within the same universe as “Barbarian.” 

The “Weapons” cast is also part another cinematic universe: Garner, Brolin, and Wong are all MCU staples, with Garner making her Marvel debut with “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” film. 

 










“Weapons” premieres August 8 in theaters. Check out the teaser below.

The “Ready or Not” sequel starts production Monday, April 21 — that's today — and Searchlight Pictures shares new details about the follow-up to the 2019 box office hit.

The sequel, titled “Ready or Not: Here I Come,” will film in Toronto this spring, with Radio Silence directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett returning for a second helping of the social survival horror comedy starring Samara Weaving. 

Weaving reprises her role as Grace, who in the original film found herself being hunted by her new in-laws at her family's posh estate. Joining Weaving and the previously announced Kathryn Newton are horror movie icons Sarah Michelle Gellar and Elijah Wood in undisclosed roles. But there's more: Shawn Hatosy (“The Pitt”), Néstor Carbonell (“The Dark Knight”), Kevin Durand (“Abigail,” also from the Radio Silence team), and David Cronenberg also join the ensemble.

Horror director Cronenberg recently wondered in conversation with the Los Angeles Times whether “The Shrouds,” his new film out now, could be his last directorial effort. Is he moving more seriously into acting? He's starred as United Federation of Planets official Kovich in only a business suit and glasses on three seasons of “Star Trek: Discovery.” He also had a regular role on the Netflix limited series “Alias Grace” and stars in a number of his own films. (The Vincent Cassel character in “The Shrouds,” not to mention, is a spitting image of the director.)

IndieWire praised the original “Ready or Not” as a mash-up of “Clue” and “The Purge.” The thriller, which opened in August 2019, grossed $57 million worldwide off an estimated budget of $6 million.

For the sequel, returning writers Guy Busick (“Abigail,” “Scream”) and R. Christopher Murphy (“Castle Rock”) penned the script, with producers Tripp Vinson (“Fountain of Youth,” “Murder Mystery”), James Vanderbilt (“Zodiac,” “Fountain of Youth”), Bradley J. Fischer (“Transformers”), and William Sherak (“Abigail,” “Scream”) also returning.

“Ready or Not” below-the-line craftspeople returning include production designer Andrew Stearn (“The Umbrella Academy”), director of photography Brett Jutkiewicz (“Scream”), costume designer Avery Plewes (“Scream VI”), and makeup head of department Colin Penman (“The Apprentice”). New crew include editor Jay Prychidny (“Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice”), hair department head Ryan Reed (“It Chapter Two”), and sound mixer Thomas Hayek (“Thanksgiving,” “The Boys”).

 










Following the success of “Ready or Not,” Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett directed 2022's “Scream” reboot and the sequel “Scream VI” (2023) as well as the vampire horror comedy “Abigail” (2024). Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett were slated to take on “Scream VII” before departing the project and handing it to their friend Christopher Landon, who also exited over creative tussles. Kevin Williamson will now direct that installment.

[Editor's note: The following interview contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Season 2, Episode 2.]

Still reeling from the latest developments on “Severance,” “The White Lotus,” and “Yellowjackets”? Spring TV is already a doozy in 2025, but “The Last of Us” isn't letting up. For Season 2, Episode 2, “Through the Valley,” HBO's wildly inventive mushroom/zombie apocalypse pulled a classic watercooler move and stunned audiences with an unforgettable loss.

“He dies believing he deserves to die, and that's a truly wretched way to go,” writes IndieWire's Ben Travers. Reviewing the episode, Travers described the attack at its center as “astonishing” — with a slew of TV fans agreeing that the sudden demise of Pedro Pascal‘s hero is among TV's most shocking deaths to date.

Yes, Joel — the beloved hunky loner, who drove much of Season 1, and became a father-figure to Ellie (Bella Ramsey), who must now lead Season 2 — is gone. It's a scene so horrifying you might forget it adapts a video game released in 2020. Speaking with IndieWire, knowing this particular character loss has brought rage to the internet before, series co-creator Craig Mazin had already anticipated the fans' grief.

“That's OK,” Mazin said. “I think they might think they're angry with me. That's fine. I think they might just be angry, which is also OK. I mean, this show is designed to provoke some pretty intense feelings, and wherever those feelings go is fine. The most important thing is that they feel something. The worst thing would be if they went, ‘Eh!‘ Then, I would've really failed.” 

But making viewers feel “angry,” “sad,” or even “confused”? That's an artistic win for the showrunner. Mazin stressed the importance of processing Season 2, Episode 2's horrific clincher with patience. He also offered hope that “The Last of Us” could surprise even the most outraged in the end. HBO has already renewed the show for Season 3, expanding the narrative beyond the two-part source material.

“Give yourself time to see how you feel about it a week later, two weeks later,” Mazin said. “And I will say, give the show time. You may think it's going this way, and it ends up going that way.”

Watch the interview in the video at the top of this story.

 










“The Last of Us” Season 2 airs new episodes on Sunday nights at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.

“A Normal Family” begins with the death of a family, but not the one you might expect. Before his film turns its attention to the family alluded to by its title, director Hur Jin-ho revs out the gate with a case of road rage that ends in murder. Or maybe not, if the lawyer defending the driver in question has his way.

A man is dead and his eight-year-old daughter is critically injured in the hospital, but self-interested criminal lawyer Jae-wan (“Kill Boksoon‘s” Sol Kyung-gu) is more concerned with saving the wealthy executive's son who's responsible for the killing. Meanwhile, the attorney's younger brother, doctor Jae-gyu (“Arthdal Chronicles'” Jang Dong-gun), is working tirelessly to save the victim's daughter at a nearby hospital.

The pair couldn't be more different at first, a contrast that becomes sharper during meals they share with their wives and each other in a fancy restaurant each month. It's at one of these somewhat stilted affairs that the brothers realize they're actually both involved in each other's cases, with one imploring the other to do “the right thing.” But as Hur Jin-ho‘s script (which he worked on with “Monster” co-writer Park Eun-kyo) expertly untangles, what might be considered “right” can change in an instant when personal feelings are concerned. 

Because while the adults (pretend to) enjoy a fine dining experience together, their teenage kids — Jae-wan's daughter, Hye-yoon (Hong Ye-ji), and Jae-gyu's younger son, Yang Si-ho (Kim Jung-chul) — reveal themselves to be the kind of people who will soon need to rely on the expertise of a criminal attorney (and perhaps an ER doctor too). 

The seeds are sown early on when Si-ho squashes a bug with his finger and again soon after when he and his cousin secretly watch footage of that opening accident, cheering on the driver like they're watching a livestream of “GTA V.” They practically break out the popcorn, overjoyed at the sight of a man losing control at the expense of another losing his life. Yet not even that can quite prepare you for what they do next.

While their parents bicker over the value of life, Si-ho and Hye-yoon prove that it means nothing to them when they brutally assault a homeless man for kicks on their way home from a party. It's an unforgivable act, one they almost get away with if not for a hidden CCTV camera that brings to mind the work of Austrian auteur Michael Haneke. Like him, Hur Jin-ho is concerned with the fragility of moral standing and how mercurial these not-so-concrete notions of right and wrong can be when evil sleeps just down the hall. 

 










In that light, “A Normal Family” is a far cry from the director's previous work, often characterized as sweetly romantic in the likes of “One Fine Spring Day” (2001), “Happiness” (2007) and “A Good Rain Knows” (2009). Here, Hur Jin-ho strips romanticism away entirely in favor of something far bleaker, a worldview that's as depressing as it is realistic. Every frame is slickly shot and constructed with the camera often held back at a distance from his protagonists, emphasizing the stark coldness that they come to embody, yet there's nothing black-and-white about the moral space they occupy. 

It's in this messiness where “A Normal Family” thrives, even if the family itself does not, especially in the three dinners that form the centerpiece through which every thread of tension is tightly wound. Said tension simmers at first, and not just between the siblings. 

Sol Kyung-gu and Jang Dong-gun are both spectacular, bringing to life decades of brotherly resentment with just a clipped tone or glance. But it's the wives, played by Kim Hee-ae and Claudia Kim, who impress most with the delicate games they play. Kim's Ji-su is the lawyer's much younger trophy wife who Hee-ae's Yeon-kyung takes great delight in cruelly teasing — “Why is this woman present during our family meeting?” — as layers of resentment and jealousy dance between the two.  

 










Every expression and subtle shift in body language is mesmerizing to watch, and the same is true of the dinners themselves where stereotypes crack and then crumble before our eyes when four parents are faced with an impossible choice (“You claim innocence for criminals but you'll report your own kid?”). The pace occasionally lags in between these foundational highlights, but the scenes that connect them remain a necessity, not just because they enrich the dinners with much-needed context, but also because they help differentiate the film from its source material to create something new and culturally specific. 

Herman Koch's original Dutch novel, titled “The Dinner” in English, took place over the course of just one tumultuous meal. Hur Jin-ho could have easily adopted that same route, but instead, he expands the idea across multiple days and locations to interrogate societal principles from a distinctly Korean perspective where the hardships of cram school directly play into the violence. 

With more space to work with, his and Park Eun-kyo's script forges a rhythmic push-and-pull between all parties concerned, dissecting the lives of the rich with a sharp precision. It's impossible to escape the insidious way privilege twists culpability and brokers guilt within the framework of high society and those who profit from it. Can lives be bought? Can good deeds tip the scale? And how responsible are we as parents for the actions of those we raise?

 










It's commendable that a story adapted three times already by various American and European filmmakers can remain as unpredictable as it does here, and the same is true of its refusal to give easy answers. The threat of violence hangs over even the most quiet of moments, and — some shoddy CGI animals aside — the film's grip on that disturbing undercurrent is convincing throughout. That's why the ending works so well, an abrupt climax that's darkly poetic and anything but normal.

Room 8 Films will release “A Normal Family” in NYC & LA on Friday, April 25.

Model/Actriz have shared a new song. “Diva” is the third taste of the New York band's forthcoming new album, Pirouette, following “Doves” and lead single “Cinderella.” Listen to it below.

“The song takes place on a date, and the song references many of the real ones I've been on while on tour,” Model/Actriz frontman Cole Haden said of “Diva” in a press statement. “Specifically, I'm remembering the times where frivolity shifted to mourning as we both realized we may never see each other again once the night is over. What I've learned is that in order to be ‘that bitch,' one must make use of the melancholia.”

Pirouette, the follow-up to Model/Actriz's 2023 debut, Dogsbody, is out on May 2. Revisit the interview “For Post-Punks Model/Actriz, Confrontation Is an Opportunity for Intimacy.”

The history of the ginger root in West Africa is deceptively brief. Introduced by Portuguese traders in the 1700s, the peppery rhizome became a cornerstone of Nigeria's regional cuisines, export economy, and slang. To be “gingered” by someone—as David Adedeji Adeleke often finds himself—is to be exhilarated, invigorated, turned on. Davido's blend of Afropop, R&B, and lovers rock is tailor-made for eye contact across the dancefloor and tumbling into bed in the same night. On 5ive, his fifth studio album, the Nigerian pop superstar surveys the empire he helped build and hungers for more, casting himself as a Biblical David who “meets his Goliath with a melody all his own.” If that sounds weighty after the nonstop celebration of 2019's A Good Time, fear not; this is still Afrobeats' preeminent loverboy. 5ive is an intoxicating breath of ocean air and amor fati that thrives on Davido's magnetic confidence and only falters when he seems to doubt his own star power.

When Justin Bieber dropped a verse on Wizkid and Tems' humid duet “Essence” in summer 2021, white smoke may as well have billowed from the proverbial chimney: Just as reggaetón had conquered the charts during the second half of the 2010s, this would be the dominant pop sound of the nascent decade. While Afrobeats has since spawned global stars and been a frequent point of reference for Western hitmakers like Drake, contemporary Nigerian pop as it was ushered in by the likes of Wizkid and Davido (who share a longstanding rivalry) remains largely undiluted: log drums tango with bouncy synth bass and highlife guitars glide across leisurely dembow rhythms, all at about 100 to 120 beats per minute. 5ive offers several exemplary additions to the canon, including the amapiano-inflected “CFMF” and lead single “Awuke,” a link-up with Jamaica's YG Marley that floats along on a nearly wordless chorus, save the line “You don finish me with love.”

Marley sits among a roster of international guests in an apparent effort to boost Davido's worldwide notoriety. Victoria Monét is a capable sparring partner, trading seductive taunts over nocturnal, Lite-Brite alté on the stunning “Offa Me.” But the presence of Chris Brown on “Titanium” sours the mood. Nigeria's music industry is, by and large, male-dominated, and the three women who appear on 5ive—Monét, Becky G, and Shenseea—hail from Atlanta, Inglewood, and Jamaica. One wishes Davido had opted to share his own A-list shine with more of the homegrown talent, whose presence is a highlight throughout. “Funds,” featuring Nigerian artists ODUMODUBLVCK and Chike, revisits the free-spending playboy of “Fall”—still Davido's definitive song—with a promise to “mismanage my funds on you.” And “With You,” the closing track, weaves singer Omah Lay seamlessly into one of the album's luscious vocal arrangements.

“With You” is livelier and more electrically charged than any song that precedes it, which likewise could be said of this whole record. Davido's last couple of releases—A Better Time in 2020 and Timeless in 2023—rounded out the trilogy he began with A Good Time, but they could trend somber, even reserved. Not so on 5ive, which is all zing, all ginger, full of regal proclamations that “People talk, people talk/But nobody fit fill me position” and that after “12 years I'm still on top.” Tracks like “Holy Water” and “Tek” are subtler displays of dominance, as Davido presides over slinky bangers constructed from, respectively, beatboxed percussion and an interpolation of the “Careless Whisper” sax solo. Having reached Afrobeats' highest echelons, Davido's David and Goliath metaphor might be due for a replacement: By now, the crown is his for the taking.

“I want it now, never, always,” Tashiina Buswa sings on “Look What You Did,” the penultimate track on Ribbon Skirt's debut album, Bite Down. It's a decent summation of her storytelling style: Everything is simultaneously happening, has already happened, hasn't happened yet, and will never happen. Each memory is in constant danger of getting smothered in distortion, trampled by drums, or even warped by Auto-Tune into a funhouse-mirror reflection of itself—so you'd better listen carefully.

Formerly known as Love Language, Ribbon Skirt are the Montreal-based duo of singer and guitarist Tashiina Buswa and multi-instrumentalist Billy Riley; they're named after a traditional Native American and First Nations garment symbolizing resilience and femininity—a nod to Buswa's Anishinaabe heritage. Bite Down is many things: a reevaluation of Buswa and Riley's musical inclinations, a first-person account of inherited colonial trauma, and a refreshing take on some of contemporary indie rock's most overused influences (shoegaze, grunge, post-punk that leans so far into the second word that you might as well do away with the first). Co-produced by Scott “Monty” Munro (of Preoccupations) and Marlaena Moore, and mixed by Deerhoof's Greg Saunier, the record has a grainy, tactile feel reminiscent of Live Through This. Its room tone is as pronounced as any individual instrument; in Bite Down's most emotionally dense moments, you can hear the heat moving between wood and wire.

Ribbon Skirt call to mind the more roughed-up offerings from Michelle Zauner (or the prettier ones from Mannequin Pussy), but more than anyone else, Buswa's modern gothic vignettes and ragged yet pliable vocals recall Wednesday's Karly Hartzman. Buswa isn't one to shy away from morbidity, irreverence, or the occasional primal howl—because some things are better expressed with no words at all. Bite Down embodies the claustrophobia of a present cluttered by the past, of a life interrupted by the stories that'll be told about it. Mundanity and tragedy spill from Buswa's pen with equal urgency. The pile of incident reports grows high with dead uncles, cop cars, White Jesus, nightmares about drowning, and piss in cups.

On the jangly ballad “Off-Rez,” Buswa rejects whitewashed, tokenizing narratives of Indigeneity, her delivery landing somewhere between '90s slacker deadpan and Valley Girl uptalk (“They want 2000s Buffy Marie…They want the pipe and the drum”). As the tactics of colonialism shapeshift, so does Buswa's grief. “Off-Rez” takes aim at the subtly insidious ways that anti-Indigenous racism persists. “I'm gonna break into a dance down the hall/I'm gonna be your brand new headache to solve,” she declares, tossing sand into the gears of bureaucratic systems that “make these Indians run.” An Anishinaabe person living in a major Canadian city, Buswa grapples with a loss of cultural identity on multiple levels. “I wanna preserve every part that makes me” she sings, “Not only know but really feel that I'm free.”

Buswa's anguish is intergenerational and interpersonal, the pain of each one bleeding into the other. “It's getting harder not to feel so abandoned,” she sings on the chorus of “Wrong Planet.” On the following “Mountains,” she rhapsodizes about birthday blues, doomed marriages, and midnight walks to 7/11—all under the same red sky, multiple timelines collapsing into one over a sparse acoustic guitar melody slow-cooked in feedback. She opens Bite Down by asking, “How do you stop someone from rising through the ceiling?” Other questions remain implicit: How do you tell a story without telling it? What happens when storytelling becomes a side effect of living—“automatic, semi-autobiographic”? Later, on “Cut,” Buswa sings, “You say we'll laugh about it someday/I'm never gonna,” anticipating an unpromised future, a step ahead because she has to be.

Typically, when an artist stays out of our view, every public gesture he or she does make is loaded with extra significance. Think of the ways each demo, cover, or bit of extramusical trivia is instantly subsumed into the canons of D'Angelo, Fiona Apple, or Frank Ocean. But given how Corbin, who drifted from SoundCloud stardom to deeper recesses of the internet, has released music—first under a different, instantly infamous stage name, and then in intermittent bursts that suggest a true disregard for self-promotion and self-mythologizing—the temptation is to receive his songs as a series of experiments, tips of an iceberg that will languish in a Google Drive folder until it melts.

The grey cover of his new album, Crisis Kid, seems to threaten that this release might disappear into the digital morass. But the LP is a project of striking ambition. It aims to marry optimistic melodies with writing that probes uncomfortably deep into questions of morality and feelings of existential exhaustion—and almost always succeeds. It's lean and pointed, refusing to sacrifice its depth for a cleaner shape or its hooks for the sake of mood. 

After that initial burst of online notoriety under the Spooky Black moniker, Corbin joined fellow Twin Cities natives Allan Kingdom, Bobby Raps, and Psymun in Thestand4rd. While that quartet only released one album—their moody, insinuating self-titled effort from 2014—they did seem to presage many of rap and R&B's sonic developments over the next decade. This is, in part, because they've had a hand in its creation: Bobby has written and produced extensively for artists like Future, Lil Uzi Vert, and The Weeknd, on whose records his own wailing pleas are wrangled into a more commercial shape, while Psymun has contributed production to a similarly impressive array of headliners. Through these years, Corbin has lingered like a specter on the fringes of Bobby and Psymun's work, his vocals the literalization of the emotional pain their production frequently channels.

Psymun's hand was key in crafting Crisis Kid. He infuses even the most unadorned songs, like “Come Down,” with his wonky melancholy; “Clown On Stage” is languid enough to make the listener want to crawl out of his skin. The wistful guitars and slyly tricky drum programming give nearly every song not only welcome texture, but a foreboding air. That sort of patience with tempo and slipperiness with tone is key for Corbin's project, which relies on his ability to seem impossibly comfortable in the face of despair in some moments, and too overcome to keep in step with the production in others. In fact, flitting back and forth between unflappability and panic is not only an effective mode for Corbin's work, but frequently its subject.

The first line on Crisis Kid is: “God's in a cage, snake in a circle.” A literal tension between human and hell recurs throughout the album, but so does this idea of the fight as a circular one. Surprisingly, given the morose imagery Corbin tends toward—but fitting given the album's often sunny melodies—a sense of perpetual struggle apparently brings him peace, or at least catharsis. “It's all going to burn off anyway,” he sings at the end of that verse. He's talking about skin.

At the album's end, on the Shlomo-assisted “Another Day in Hell,” Corbin lapses into something like self-help exhortation. “You've been under a spell,” he sings. “Do you know we're unwell?” But by the end of that song's extended, single verse, it becomes clear that his idea of hell is being unable to sit alone with oneself, letting the war between nihilism and the desire to escape it tear us apart from the inside. “Gotta relearn how to love,” he had sung one song prior, but it goes beyond that: He's describing a need to rewire hearts and minds, to accept that pain is to be endured and minimized, not narcotized away. When he prescribes solutions, he doesn't sound entirely convinced of his own expertise. But what's the harm in continuing to try?

	The day before he died, Pope Francis met with Vice President J.D. Vance and used his Easter blessing to continue his call for kindness toward migrants.


	Francis encouraged Catholics to be welcoming to people “who come from distant lands” in his Easter blessing. “How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants!” he said.


	“On this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!”


	Francis, the first Latin American Pope, has made not-so-subtle jabs at the Trump administration before. In 2016, Francis called anyone who supports building walls “not Christian” during a visit to Mexico near the U.S. border, at which point Donald Trump made the puzzling statement that when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS they will wish that Trump had been president. More recently, in February, the Pope admonished Vance's use of church doctrine to rationalize the Trump administration's cruel treatment of immigrants. 

	











	The Pope also met with Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019. The Pope gave him chocolate Easter eggs for his children along with a Vatican tie and rosaries. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I know you have not been feeling great but it's good to see you in better health,” Vance told Francis, who had been recovering from pneumonia. The vice president's motorcade was in the Vatican for 17 minutes, according to the Associated Press. 


	Vance had perhaps a more substantive meeting with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's number two official, on Saturday. They discussed immigration. 


	“There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” according to a statement from the Vatican. “Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the state and the Catholic Church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.”

	In February, Francis appeared to slam the Trump administration when he wrote in a letter that church doctrine instructs its followers to be welcoming toward migrants. “I have followed closely the major crisis that is taking place in the United States with the initiation of a program of mass deportations,” he wrote. “The rightly formed conscience cannot fail to make a critical judgment and express its disagreement with any measure that tacitly or explicitly identifies the illegal status of some migrants with criminality.”

	











	“What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly,” he added.


	A few weeks earlier, Vance cited Catholic theology to rationalize prioritizing Americans over non-citizens. “Just google ‘ordo amoris,'” he wrote on X, defending a statement he made on Fox News. Ordo amoris says, according to ancient theologian St. Augustine, that all people are to be loved equally, but that you should prioritize those who have a closer connection to you “since you cannot do good to all.”


	Francis clarified the meaning of the idea in his February letter. “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups … The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the ‘Good Samaritan'… that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.”

	Later that month, at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance referred to himself as a “baby Catholic” and said there are “things about the faith that I don't know.”


	“I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis,” Vance posted on X early Monday. “My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him. I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill … May God rest his soul.”

	Former athlete and current host of the Club Shay Shay podcast, Shannon Sharpe, has been sued for alleged sexual assault and sexual battery in a new lawsuit filed in Nevada.


	The civil complaint filed by Jane Doe alleges that Sharpe, 56, assaulted a woman with whom he allegedly had a “rocky consensual relationship that lasted nearly two years” and began in 2023 when she was 19 years old. The lawsuit claims that Sharpe “violently sexually assaulted and anally raped Plaintiff two different times in Las Vegas, Nev., blatantly ignoring her requests for him to stop” in October 2024, per Variety.


	The complaint also alleges that Sharpe would record and share videos of his sexual encounters with Doe without her consent or knowledge. A September 2024 incident in which Sharpe launched an Instagram Live broadcast while engaging in sexual activity with an unknown person is also mentioned in the suit, though it is clarified that the woman heard on the broadcast is not the woman behind this particular case, per NBC.

	











	In January 2025, the lawsuit details that Sharpe allegedly dismissed requests from Doe to wear a condom or stop having sex with her entirely. “After many months of manipulating and controlling Plaintiff — a woman more than thirty years younger than he — and repeatedly threatening to brutally choke and violently slap her, Sharpe refused to accept the answer no and raped Plaintiff, despite her sobbing and repeated screams of ‘no,'” the complaint states.

	“I didn't get double chins because they ran in my family. I got double chins cause nobody ran in my family.”


	This quip is just one example of the teachings of Toni Fine, 34, a TikTok influencer known for her no-nonsense approach to weight loss. Fine has become recognizable to her 900,000 followers for her speedy Instagram lives, where commenters get specific and often mean digs about their food consumption. “You're hungry at night?” Fine says in one live. “Chew on your pillow. What about running? Run to the kitchen and eat less food.” But on TikTok, without ever posting the hashtag, Fine has become representative of a once-again popular lane for weight focused creators: #SkinnyTok. If the name doesn't clue you in, here's some of the most popular quotes floating around: “Don't sugarcoat that or you'll eat that too,” “What you eat in private will show up in public,” “Food is good for 15 minutes. Now you're big for 15 years,” and “Do you want to look hot on the boat or sink it?” 

	











	Weight loss and disordered eating communities have long had a presence on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Tumblr, YouTube, WeHeartIt, and Instagram. But in the past few years, weight loss content on TikTok was intensified by the development and popularity of GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Wegovy. Many experts and users credit the success of these medications with rolling back the online acceptance of body positivity, replacing the movement with a return to the thinness driven health eras of old. #SkinnyTok — giving brutally honest advice about what people need to do to lose weight — isn't new. It's not even TikTok's only disordered eating community. But as TikTok users begin to flock back to an obsession with thinness, the message behind the so-called encouragement seems clear: it's about making weight loss mean again.


	A quick TikTok search shows over 50,000 videos on the app that use the #SkinnyTok hashtag.  While that counts both supporters and detractors, the top 11 videos using the hashtag are all #SkinnyTok creators or people who praise the community for its help in losing weight fast through tough love. In fact, many of the biggest #SkinnyTok creators promoting these messages don't even use the hashtag. Fine is considered one such tough love creator, but tells Rolling Stone she doesn't see herself as part of the #SkinnyTok community.  She also posts videos about daily gym schedule, which can start as early as 3:40 a.m. and occur as much as three times a week. One of Fine's recap videos from 2023 got so much attention in early April that even tennis pro CoCo Gauff went on the app to call the grueling schedules ridiculous. “Mind you, I'm an Olympic athlete, she said. “This is getting out of hand.”

	Actively seeking out people who will be direct and mean can seem counterintuitive. But part of the draw for #SkinnyTok is that creators often publicly say out loud the thoughts people usually think to themselves, says Dr. Erin Parks, the chief clinical officer of Equip, the nation's largest virtual eating disorder treatment center. “This is harmful for everyone, whether you have an eating disorder or not,” she tells Rolling Stone. “It is taking the depressive, self-critical thoughts that exist in all of our heads and it is amplifying them. I'm worried about the long term harm to our brains as we're laying down these pathways — 'How I look is my worth' and ‘What I eat makes me good or bad' — and reinforcing them again and again.


	#SkinnyTok creators often publicly say that they're not promoting unhealthy or disordered eating habits — they're using tough language to get people to prioritize their health. It's not mean. It's honest. Many of the tactics these creators use also differ from older weight loss recommendations. #SkinnyTok creators, including Fine, tend to prioritize the knowledge and upkeep of food intake and metabolic output rather than counting and restricting calories outright. One of the most popular diets is the macro diet. Macro followers track the macronutrients in their meals — proteins, carbs, and fats — and then make sure that their food stays within a specific percentage for each of these categories.

	Fine says to us that while she uses the macro diet to get people to understand calories, she doesn't promote tracking macros daily, the idea of demonizing food, or a “thin at all cost” message. But what's hard to push back against is that none of this so-called care or gets nearly as much traction as the unhinged and often snappy quotes associated with — and celebrated by — #SkinnyTok. When reached for comment, Fine even agreed that while she believes her messaging is “rooted in care,” many of the soundbites people have begun clipping and editing into giant, fast videos remove nuance and context from her actual advice. 


	For Parks, the idea that #SkinnyTok creators aren't simply telling their followers to eat less, or not at all, doesn't mean the advice isn't full of the same old diet-culture rhetoric. In fact, she calls many of the macro-based diets “the most cognitively complex eating restrictions” she's seen in years. “In the Nineties, it was about eating as infrequently as possible. Now it's eating frequently, but perfectly. The bar has risen yet again,” she says. “We've always had a culture that decides that beauty is whatever the least attainable thing is. Now, it's a militant schedule.” 

	











	Like many digital platforms, TikTok community guidelines prohibit “promoting disordered and dangerous weight loss behaviors,” and will restrict or make videos un-monetizable if they are restrictive or suggest rapid weight loss or ideal body types. When you search for #SkinnyTok in TikTok's official search bar, a note about weight is displayed at the top of the offerings. “You are more than your weight,” it reads, encouraging people with questions to take care of themselves and visit the app's Safety Center Resource for any questions. A spokesperson for TikTok tells Rolling Stone that they consult with public health experts and don't want to guidelines so specific that they prohibit people from discussing their recoveries as well. But #SkinnyTok content itself — which uses demeaning phrases to shame overeaters — is still readily available. 


	Where weight loss content ends and disordered eating content begins can be a nebulous space, making it hard for moderators to remove accounts unless they're specifically flagged by other creators. TikTok community guidelines prohibit “promoting disordered and dangerous weight loss behaviors,” and will restrict or make videos un-monetizable if they are restrictive or suggest rapid weight loss or ideal body types. When you search for #SkinnyTok in TikTok's official search bar, a displayed banner encourages people to take care of themselves. But the content itself — which uses demeaning phrases to shame overeaters — is still readily available.


	Emmeline Clein, the author of Dead Weight — a 2024 essay collection on disordered eating's history and influence on pop culture — tells Rolling Stone that #SkinnyTok takes a “mask off” stance to content that removes some of the wellness language that disordered eating creators often hide behind. But she doesn't see #SkinnyTok as separate from other explicitly “pro-ana” content online at all. 


	“The idea of anorexia as ‘going too far‘ down a given road implies that the person who ends up anorexic started off on the right track,” Clein says. “The media industry's religious devotion to the idea that there is a difference between diet content and eating disorder content is integral to their advertising models. And their continued promotion of beauty standards that are not achievable without great amounts of self harm for most people.” 


	The problem of eating disorders is complex. Treatment ideas are varied. And when pushed, #SkinnyTok creators are adamant in their videos that if there's a problem, it's certainly not with them. But what can't be ignored is that after years of eating disorder rates remaining relatively steady, the numbers have drastically increased, according to Parks. Data from the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) found that more than nine percent of Americans will have an eating disorder in their lifetime, a statistic that's risen in the past five years. Hospitalizations for eating disorders in teen girls doubled during the pandemic, according to Centers for Disease Control data. After opiate addiction, eating disorders are the psychiatric illness with the highest mortality rate in the U.S.

	Clein believes social media platforms have a responsibility to address how their algorithms promote these videos. It doesn't matter whether it's accounts with anorexia in the titles or the new buzzword of the day. “Focusing our rightful ire on creators mistakes the pawns for the players,” she says. “When these platforms ban users or tags that overtly mention eating disorders instead of using the word skinny, they elide responsibility for promoting equally dangerous content under a different banner.”

	Jon Blistein



Neil Gaiman has filed an arbitration claim against one of the women who has accused him of sexual assault, Vulture reports. The author is reportedly seeking over $500,000 from Caroline Wallner for allegedly violating a nondisclosure agreement.


	Wallner, a divorced mother of three, lived and worked as a caretaker at Gaiman's property in Woodstock, New York, from 2014 to 2021. She claims the author began to abuse her in 2018, after Wallner's marriage had fallen apart and her ex-husband left the property. Wallner, who had no income at the time, alleged that Gaiman pressured her into sex in exchange for staying on the property.


	“There were little hints of, ‘we're going to need the house.' And I remember saying, let's talk about it. Let's figure it out. That's when he would just come to my studio and make me give him a blowjob,” Wallner said on the 2024 podcast, Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Wallner also claimed that when she tried to resist the author's advances, Gaiman would suggest that his former wife, Amanda Palmer, wanted to reclaim the home Wallner and her family were living in. “But you take care of me and I'll take care of you,” Wallner said Gaiman told her.

	











	Gaiman has denied Wallner's allegations and claimed she initiated their sexual encounters.  (He's denied all other allegations against him, as well.) In 2021, Gaiman paid Wallner $275,000 for signing a nondisclosure agreement, stopping her from filing a lawsuit or speaking about her allegations publicly. The NDA was reported on when Wallner first spoke on the Master podcast; she has since also discussed her allegations against Gaiman in New York magazine. 


	Gaiman's new claim for arbitration alleges that Wallner violated the confidentiality and non-disparagement clauses of the NDA. He's asking a full repayment of the original settlement, attorneys' fees, and $50,000 for each interview she's given. Wallner's ex-husband is also named in the claim.

	Vincent White, an attorney for Wallner, shared a statement with Rolling Stone: “Mr. Gaiman must feel he has nothing left to lose, I suspect he can feel us closing in on him. The idea that he would try to silence a woman he has already done so much to is disgusting. If we read a similar plot point in one of his stories we would think he was being too heavy handed in fleshing out his villain. Yet here he is, showing us that he was the real monster all along.”

	Representatives for Gaiman did not immediately return a request for comment, though a rep did tell Vulture: “Caroline Wallner's purported claims are completely meritless. We have no doubt that we will prevail in arbitration — and that Ms. Wallner's actions will result in her having to pay Neil's legal fees.”


	While Wallner has been looking for legal remedies to void the NDA, she also filed an arbitration claim of her own against Gaiman last winter. She alleged that Gaiman's lawyers held onto videos, photos, and text messages she'd sent Gaiman during the time of the alleged abuse in violation of a clause in the NDA requiring all parties to destroy such material.

Tax Relief Advocates stages record-breaking aerial display to raise awareness ahead of the April 15 filing deadline

NASHVILLE, Tenn., April 21, 2025 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- What began as two silent lights hovering in the sky over Nissan Stadium quickly turned into the largest drone show ever recorded in Nashville—and an unexpected message to taxpayers.

The Saturday night spectacle, orchestrated by Tax Relief Advocates (TRA), featured synchronized drones forming UFOs, alien figures, and humorous messages aimed at easing tax season anxiety. The light show drew hundreds of spectators and concluded with a message many didn't expect to see: ""Humans, don't get probed by the IRS.""

Tax season can feel overwhelming—especially for those who are already in debt or facing IRS pressure. This event was our way of saying: it's not too late, and you don't have to do it alone.

The high-tech performance was part of TRA's public awareness campaign ahead of the April 15 federal tax deadline. Designed to catch attention and encourage action, the drone show delivered a lighthearted yet timely reminder: individuals behind on taxes or unsure about how to proceed still have options.

""We knew we had to do something bold to break through the noise,"" said Jeff Nickel, Managing Partner of Tax Relief Advocates. ""Tax season can feel overwhelming—especially for those who are already in debt or facing IRS pressure. This event was our way of saying: it's not too late, and you don't have to do it alone.""

The show included a series of tongue-in-cheek displays such as, ""We come from a galaxy far, far away;"" ""Hi Nashville, sorry we got lost in Jersey;"" and ""Dolly, time to come back home.""

TRA, a national firm specializing in resolving tax issues, says its goal is to help individuals navigate audits, wage garnishments, and back taxes with professional support. The company has assisted thousands of Americans in negotiating with the IRS and reaching financial settlements.

For those still unfiled or unsure of their status, TRA encourages contacting a tax professional before the deadline passes.

Those who have back tax debt or need help with their taxes can call 800-511-2153 or visit www.tra.com.

SCEPTICS are encouraged to join an upcoming paranormal investigation to experience the strange and unusual for themselves.

Paranormal INC is heading to Carlisle's Masonic Hall in May to help city residents to discover the secrets of this historic building which dates back to the Victorian era.

The group of five have been involved in paranormal investigations for a while now, having previously worked with another business over in the north-east before deciding to set-up their own company.

Their visit to the hall on May 3 will be the group's second time there but their first visit left quite a strong impression on the investigators who experienced a kettle turning on by itself and heard footsteps and banging.

Jack Bell, a member of Paranormal INC, said: ""I saw my first ever figure of something in the building, it was weird.

""There were only five of us in the building at that point and we're all just sat around talking.

""We're in a bar area where we all got together and have a few drinks. I turned around and towards the bar area, there was just a figure stood there. I had to do a double take. I thought 'oh my God, I've just seen a figure'.""

They make use of a number of different techniques to try and make a connection with the paranormal.

This includes spirit boxes which scan local radio waves which helps spirits to communicate, dowsing rods, EVPs, touch activated balls, and temperature monitors.

But, before they begin using all of that, they encourage people who have joined them on the ghost hunt to make use of their own senses first to see what they might discover.

""One of the things which we try and do first is to not throw equipment at everybody,"" Jack added.

""Try and use your senses because it's probably the best way of doing things.""

Paranormal INC say they will always try and debunk the evidence as it arises to explore what else might have caused a strange noise or something to move.

But, if they can't explain it, the answer could be something more paranormal.

Those attending the event will be able to try out their own investigation making use of the group's equipment but they're also encouraged to bring their own.

And, sceptics are definitely welcome too.

""If you're a sceptic, come along and make the judgement yourself.

""Come along, give it a go, and be open minded with it because if you're not open minded and you're shut off, generally you're going to have a really rubbish night, but stuff can happen.""

Tickets for the event at the Carlisle Masonic Hall can be purchased on the Paranormal INC website for £20 or two for £35.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}","other"

Astronomers at the University of Cambridge in England announced on April 17 that they had found the strongest evidence yet that life may exist somewhere besides Earth.

Using data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the researchers detected atmospheric clues hinting that microbial organisms could be living on the surface of K2-18b, visible in the constellation Leo.

And although the first sign of possible extraterrestrials detected in the cosmos didn't come in the form of little green aliens flying around in saucer-shaped spacecrafts, it doesn't make the recent discovery any less exciting.

In fact, the life that could be — thriving on a distant ocean-covered planet named K2-18b is likely not intelligent at all.

Here's everything to know about the discovery, the exoplanet and the search for life in the cosmos.

A strong possibility exists that extraterrestrial life can be found on a distant exoplanet known as K2-18b.

Using observations from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the researchers were able to find possible hints of molecules and gases that, on Earth, are signs of life.

If anything is indeed living on the planet, it likely would be microorganisms akin to Earth's phytoplankton.

Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside of Earth's own solar system. For that reason, the celestial bodies are sometimes also referred to as extrasolar planets.

Some, called rogue planets, don't even orbit a star, but are floating through the cosmos untethered.

Astronomers have confirmed the existence of more than 5,800 exoplanets, but billions are thought to exist, according to NASA.

K2-18b is considered a Hycean exoplanet — as opposed to a rocky planet — due to its potential to possess a hydrogen-rich atmosphere and surface covered in ocean water.

Since it was discovered in 2015, K2-18b, which orbits a red dwarf star more than 120 light-years from Earth, has captivated scientists who have considered it among the best potential life-harboring ocean worlds.

The first observations in 2019 confirming the possible presence of water were made with the Hubble Space Telescope.

In September 2023, another investigation with Webb — an advanced telescope launched in 2021 outfitted with powerful infrared instruments — revealed something more: traces of carbon-bearing molecules in K2-18b's atmosphere, including methane and carbon dioxide.

These conditions classify the exoplanet as being in what astronomers refer to as the habitable zone — where planets have the right conditions for water, providing a key ingredient for life to flourish.

Astronomers even refer to planets with such conditions as ""Goldilocks"" zones because conditions have to be just right — neither too hot nor too cold — for water to remain in liquid form and pool on surfaces.

K2-18b is 8.6 times bigger than Earth.

The planet's large size — with a radius 2.6 times that of Earth — means the planet's interior likely contains a large mantle of high-pressure ice, like Neptune, according to astronomers.

K2-18b is also smaller than Neptune, making it what astronomers refers to as a ""sub-Neptune"" planet that, while not present in our solar system, is what NASA says is among ""the most common type of planet known so far in the galaxy.”

For the most recent discovery, a team of researchers used a different instrument outfitted to Webb to study the light from K2-18b's parent star as the planet passed in front of it from Earth's vantage.

As starlight passed through the planet's atmosphere, the clues left behind allowed for astronomers to piece together the gases in the atmosphere and detect a possible biosignature. On Earth, the sulfur-based gases they detected are only produced by life, primarily microbial life.

The observations could have occurred by chance or could be the result of previously unknown chemical processes at work on K2-18b, according to the researchers. The team hopes to make follow-up analysis with Webb to reach a more definitive conclusion.

In our solar system, Earth is one of only three planets, along with Mars and Venus, that fall within the habitable zone.

On Mars, two of NASA's robotic rovers are in the process of searching the now-barren planet for clues that life could have existed on its surface.

As of October, NASA has also sent its uncrewed Europa Clipper spacecraft on a far-reaching journey to one of Jupiter's many moons where water is believed to exist beneath an icy surface. Once the orbiter reaches the icy moon Europa in 2030, it will begin scouring the surface from above to look for signs that life could thrive.

Otherwise, NASA, the world's space agencies and other astronomers believe the best opportunity to discover life beyond Earth may exist outside our solar system.

Organizations like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute are dedicated to exploring the cosmos for extraterrestrial neighbors. SETI even harnessed technology to expand its search beyond our own galaxy.

The Institute conducts activities in three arenas: (1) astrobiology, the efforts to find and understand the prevalence of life in general (for example, microbial life under the parched landscapes of Mars or the icy crust of the jovian moon Europa); (2) SETI, experiments designed to detect radio or light signals that would reveal the presence of technically sophisticated beings; and (3) education and outreach projects that inform the public about our research, encourage young people to become more proficient in science, engage the general public in science research, and train teachers in STEM subject areas.

There's no proof any alien civilization has visited Earth. That hasn't stopped thousands of people from reporting UFOs, UAPs and other unusual phenomena.

Historically, Michigan ranks 10th in the U.S. for reports of ""unidentified aerial phenomena"" (UAP) to NUFORC with 3,794 since an incident in 1936. That's just 24 behind North Carolina for ninth place. California ranks first, with 16,735. That is almost twice as many as the second-place state, Florida, which has 8,624 reported sightings.","{'href': 'https://www.freep.com', 'title': 'Detroit Free Press'}","other"

Supernatural may end up returning for season 16, and if it does, there are a few Winchesters that deserve a comeback. Sam and Dean Winchester are the tip of the iceberg in the renowned Winchester family, which viewers were introduced to gradually over fifteen seasons of Eric Kripke's influential show. Running from 2005 to 2020, Supernatural is America's longest-running live-action fantasy show, so the return of the Winchesters would be a grand tradition, and one welcomed by many, many fans. One, in particular, should get some more screen time.

As of the Supernatural season 15 finale, Sam and Dean were both safely ensconced in the afterlife. In a mundane but strangely suitable twist, Dean died in a run-of-the-mill vampire hunt, while Sam survived to live till a ripe old age. Finally passing away and joining Dean and Bobby in heaven, Sam followed his parents, who had also gone to heaven. It's not clear if Supernatural will return for season 16, and if it does, which characters would return to lead it. But if Sam and Dean did, their mother would also have earned another season.

Mary Winchester deserved a better death in Supernatural season 14. Mary is a critical Supernatural character, with the whole first season essentially revolving around her death, in many ways. With season 1's opening episode demonstrating her violent death, Eric Kripke and Sera Gamble spent the whole season exploring the deep scar that this incident had left on her family. Mary's (first) death triggered John Winchester to begin a life of hunting as he searched for the monster that killed her. This, in turn, meant that his sons had to grow up fast, the hunting lifestyle driving a wedge between Sam and Dean.

Mary's return, courtesy of Amara, was a thrilling plot twist and a logical development, thematically.

However, some of the best Mary Winchester episodes were, unexpectedly, later on in the show. No one would have thought, while watching Supernatural season 1 or 2, that Mary would end up coming back. Mary's return, courtesy of Amara, was a thrilling plot twist and a logical development, thematically. It allowed Dean to finally come to terms with her death. That was why it was quite disappointing for her to be obliterated so suddenly at Jack's hands in season 14. Another season of Supernatural may be able to make up for this.

Mary Winchester was one of the best hunters of Supernatural, and this alone is enough reason to bring her back for another season of the show. Although it is totally unconfirmed if a season 16 is on the cards, it would undoubtedly need some strong hunting talent to make it work if it did transpire. Supernatural is based, fundamentally, on ""saving people, hunting things"" — the Winchester family business. So any kind of revival, even if it were a reboot or movie rather than season 16, would need a hunter like Mary.

Eric Kripke's brilliant Supernatural TV series is one of the best dark fantasy shows on screens, but it was full of sad and traumatic moments.

Sam and Dean may have also died too peacefully to be worth a resuscitation. While some may argue that Sam and Dean died in Supernatural anticlimactically in season 15, others believe their deaths were perfect for the show. Sam and Dean were truly epic heroes worthy of any superhero franchise or classic novel, and fans built up a strong attachment to them over the fifteen years they were on air. It would be quite a shame to disrupt their tranquil ending. She, however, had no such tranquil ending. Rather, Mary's death required a closer examination than season 14 offered.

While bothering Sam and Dean in heaven in a hypothetical Supernatural season 16 would risk disturbing their well-deserved peace and a tidy end to their arc, there are ways to bring Mary back that seem logical. Mary Winchester could come back from the dead if Supernatural wanted her back for season 16 in a few ways. Mary made it to heaven in the end with John, the love of her life and the father of Sam and Dean. But Supernatural made it abundantly clear that there are ways back from heaven, even if souls would rather stay there.

Sam and Dean were explored more in Supernatural: The Animation, a Japanese anime produced by Madhouse.

Eric Kripke had a 5-season plan for Supernatural, so it is fitting that Dean died in this season. In episode 16, ""The Dark Side of the Moon,"" Dean was shot by Roy and Walt, and it was later revealed that Dean had died many times before. Angels had resurrected him and wiped his memories of heaven. It is possible for an angel to resurrect Mary. If a new threat arose in the world of Supernatural, an angel with good intentions could send Mary Winchester back to earth to fight it.

Mary Winchester was played by Amy Gumenick and Samantha Smith in Supernatural.

Many characters returned from the dead in Supernatural, and if Mary did it already, she could do it again. Amara, the Darkness, resurrected Mary in season 14. Amara was absorbed into God by the end of Supernatural, and God remained on earth. Although his divine powers had been removed, Chuck Shurley could certainly pose some kind of threat if Supernatural returned. He was proven to be egotistical and could potentially end up embodying some of his older sister's powers of necromancy in a potential season 16, enabling Mary's comeback.

Psychic medium Elena Balm got the first hint that she was different when she was about eight years old.

Balm, who now offers readings and life coaching in Georgetown, said she knew things that other people didn't.

“When I look back, I had this psychic gift around when I was about eight years old,” she told INsauga.com. “I just knew things. But you're a kid, you don't know how to process this information.”

She said she knew her mom would die before her dad and it turned out to be true. Her first encounter with a spirit came a few years later.

“It was the night my grandmother died, and….she visited me the day she died, and she scared the hell out of me so much, so I actually told her to go away, and she did,” Balm said.

For the last 20 years, she has given tarot readings for family and friends but became more serious just recently.

She saw one of her mentors, who's a psychic comedian, and he told her she should work full-time as a psychic medium. The psychic comedian told her this is her calling and purpose.

“So actually, I brought it out to the public for the first time last year, and it's been fantastic,” she said.

When she does a reading now, she starts by communicating with her spirit guides about the person. Balm said there are four ways spirits speak to you —clairessence, you feel things; clairvoyance, you see them or you see things; or clairaudience, you hear them, and then claircognizance is you have a sense of knowing something. Balm said clairessence and clairaudience are strongest for her.

As a psychic, Balm can see into a person's future, and with mediumship, she connects with past loved ones.

“So with a psychic, I'm just connecting with your energy and talking to your spirit guides, and they're telling me what's coming down. Mediumship, I'm connecting with your past loved ones directly,” she said.

Balm has worked on her connection with spirits but she said everyone has intuition.

“It's just whether you want to pay attention to it and develop it,” Balm said.

For example, people often have a “gut feeling” about a person they meet for the first time.

“Always listen to your gut feeling,” Balm said. “That's your intuition. We all have it. It's just whether you want to listen to it or not.”

At times, Bahm said a spirit talks to her because she's open and tuned in. It has even happened while she is at a grocery store or in a restaurant. Occasionally, the spirit pushes her to speak to the stranger in this public place.

“I always start off with, ‘you're going to think I'm crazy, but I'm a psychic medium, and just let you know your father's standing beside you, and he has this message,'” she said.

Balm understands that many people are skeptics. She once had a reading where the man immediately said he was a skeptic. He didn't provide information, which Balm said is fine.

“I remember his father came in through first I gave him some messages,” she said. “And then I took a deep breath, and I said, ‘your son's here,' and he lost it.”

The son had died by suicide and wanted to let the father know he is happy. The son also said he moved his father's tools around because he was a jokester.

“The dad started laughing. He goes, ‘That was my son's personality,'” she said. “‘Yes, I'm missing tools. Tell him to bring them back.'”

She hopes to bring these messages to people who need them.

“My whole goal is, if I can bring you peace and clarity, I've done my job,” she said.

Some things Balm would like people to know about psychic mediums include the fact that they can't read your mind, they can't see their own future and it's not devil's work.

“But the biggest message I want people to know is when your loved ones pass, they're always around you, and they have got nothing but love and light around you,” she said. “They don't hate you or have regrets or they're not mad at you. It's just us humans. We carry that guilt, but your loved ones are always around you. You're never alone. And the greatest gift you can give to your loved ones, live your life. Do what you want to do, stop playing it small.”

Stop worrying about what other people think about you, she said.

“I talk to dead people,” Balm laughed. “How do you think people react to me?”

JD Vance paid tribute to Pope Francis, who died at the age of 88 on Monday. The demise of the Argentine pontiff comes a day after he met the US Vice President on Easter Sunday at Vatican.

Taking to X, Vance said that he just learned of the passing of Pope Francis, adding that his “heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.”

“I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I'll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful. May God rest his soul,” the US VP added.

Vatican announced the death of Pope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church, through a video statement on Monday. His reign was characterized by conflict and division as he worked to reform the embattled institution. He had survived a severe case of double pneumonia.

Vance and Pope Francis' brief meeting occurred on Sunday following a lengthy dispute over the US President Donald Trump administration's plans to deport migrants.

Vance was welcomed in one of the reception rooms of the Vatican hotel. In addition to a Vatican tie and rosaries, the 88-year-old pope presented Vance three giant chocolate Easter eggs for his three young kids, who were not present in the meeting.

Meanwhile, several netizens reacted to Vance's tribute to Pope Francis, with some expressing massive outrage over his meeting with the late pontiff.

“Why the outrage over JD meeting the Pope? I've seen countless comments cursing him, not just for the meeting, but for all sorts of things,” one person asked while responding to hatred comments for the US VP.

Some people even went to blast Vance, saying that “You're not fit to even mention his name.” “Did you feel a bit of guilt for insisting to meet him while he was so fragile?” one more reacted.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) suggested in an interview released Monday that Congress could hold additional hearings on the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and indicated he's been listening to long-festering and debunked conspiracy theories about the government's alleged involvement.

“There are a host of questions that I will be asking, quite honestly, now that my eyes have been opened up,” Johnson told conservative influencer Benny Johnson on his podcast Monday.

Ron Johnson chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

He lauded the 2020 film “Calling out Bravo 7” that questions the official story behind the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7, a 47-story office building that fell hours after terrorists flew planes into the Twin Towers. Ron Johnson also called the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s investigation “corrupt.”

“I don't know if you can find structural engineers other than the ones that had the corrupt investigation inside NIST that would say that thing didn't come down in any other way than a controlled demolition,” Ron Johnson said.

“There's an awful lot of questions,” he continued. “Who ordered the removal and the destruction of all that evidence totally contrary to any other firefighting investigation procedures? I mean, who ordered that, who was in charge? I think there's some basic information. Where's all the documentation from this investigation?”

NIST's investigation found that Building 7 progressively collapsed from a prolonged fire that couldn't be extinguished because of water pressure issues after the building sustained extensive damage. Experts have repeatedly debunked efforts to link Building 7's fall to a controlled demolition.

The senator said he has spoken to former Rep. Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican who left the House in 2007 after an unsuccessful reelection bid, about Weldon's claims that President George W. Bush's administration covered up the government's role and ultimately worked to oust him from Congress. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson interviewed Weldon about his theories last week.

“Now I will work with (Weldon) to expose what he's willing to expose as well,” Ron Johnson said.

A new study finds that fragments of tumor DNA in a patient's bloodstream could show that they are at high risk of a melanoma recurrence.

A simple blood test could reveal who is at high risk of skin cancer recurrence after tumor-removal surgery.

The test can detect fragments of tumor DNA with a simple blood draw to reveal the lingering presence of Stage III melanoma — a metastatic form of the deadliest form of skin cancer — that can't be seen with CT scans. Although the test isn't perfect, it could help flag patients who need aggressive treatment because their cancer is likely to come back.

""We're envisioning the test being used to monitor patients over time (perhaps every month or couple of months in the first 1-3 years after surgery) for an early indication that the melanoma is recurring,"" study senior author Dr. David Polsky, a dermatologic oncologist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, told Live Science in an email.

If the test showed signs of tumor DNA, Polsky continued, the doctor might choose to use more advanced imaging techniques to search for small, easy-to-miss tumors, or they might move to a more aggressive treatment regimen that uses a combination of cancer drugs instead of just one, for example.

Melanoma is a cancer of melanocytes, a type of pigmented skin cell. It accounts for only 1% of skin cancers, but it causes the most skin cancer deaths because it can quickly spread to other organs, or metastasize. Early detection is one of the best ways to boost the likelihood of survival.

Polsky and his colleagues focused on Stage III melanoma, which is melanoma that has spread to nearby lymph nodes, where immune cells are made and stored. Doctors perform surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible before starting medications to kill any remaining tumor cells.

Patients then get CT scans to look for any signs of recurrence, but some patients have tiny deposits of melanoma that are too small to be detected by CT. To catch those deposits earlier, Polsky and his team turned to circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA. These are DNA fragments released from tumor cells during their normal life cycle. The fragments circulate in the plasma — the liquid portion of the blood — and can be detected by telltale mutations that are unique to cancer.

As part of a larger clinical trial of a combination of cancer drugs, the research team studied blood samples from 597 patients who had recently undergone surgery. The participants also had follow-up blood samples taken three months, six months, nine months and 12 months after either starting a treatment or receiving a placebo.

Immediately after surgery, 13% of the patients had detectable ctDNA in their blood plasma. Every single one of these patients experienced a cancer recurrence, the researchers found. Patients were also more likely to see their melanoma return when their ctDNA rose during the follow-up tests or if the ctDNA remained persistently high over the course of the testing.

The presence of the ctDNA predicted the return of the cancer 100% of the time; no one with a positive test escaped melanoma relapse. But the absence of ctDNA did not mean the patients were out of the woods. A negative test was correct 71% of the time in predicting that the person's cancer would not return. But some patients with no detectable ctDNA still saw recurrence.

""[T]he tests are highly accurate when they are positive, but not as accurate when they are negative,"" Polsky said.

The study's results were published April 15 in the journal The Lancet Oncology. The next step, Polsky said, is to make the test available to a clinical molecular pathology laboratory, where it can be used to make decisions about treatment. A clinical trial can then show whether using the blood test leads to better outcomes than not using them — a measure called ""clinical utility.""

""Demonstrating clinical utility of the test would be a major advance for the management of melanoma patients whose disease has spread beyond the skin,"" Polsky said.

A modeling study looked at how anticipated cuts to international HIV funding would affect the rate of new cases and HIV-related deaths in low- and middle-income countries.

Editor's note: This story was first published on March 26, 2025.

We could see up to 10.8 million more HIV cases than anticipated in the next five years if planned cuts to international HIV funding take place.

This surge in infections in low- and middle-income countries would contribute up to 2.9 million more HIV-related deaths by 2030.

These disturbing figures come from a new modeling study published March 26 in the journal The Lancet HIV. The researchers wanted to analyze the potential impact of cuts to international funding for HIV/AIDS programs, which work to prevent both transmission and deaths related to the infection.

As of February 2025, the five top donors of this funding — the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands — have all announced significant cuts to foreign aid that threaten HIV programs worldwide. The study predicts how these cuts would impact low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which since 2015 have relied on international sources for 40% of their HIV program funding.

""These findings are a sobering reminder that progress in the fight against HIV is not guaranteed — it is the result of sustained political will and investment,"" said Dr. Ali Zumla, a professor of infectious diseases and international health at University College London who was not involved in the research.

But equally, ""the projected surge in new infections and deaths is not an inevitability; it is a consequence of choices being made today,"" Zumla told Live Science in an email. ""If these funding cuts move forward, we risk unraveling decades of hard-won progress, leaving millions vulnerable and pushing global HIV goals further out of reach.""

Related: We could end the AIDS epidemic in less than a decade. Here's how.

As of 2023, five donors have supplied more than 90% of the international funding for HIV programs, with the United States providing over 72% of the total. Specific populations at high risk of HIV — including people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, female sex workers and their clients, and transgender and gender diverse people — particularly rely on these international funding sources for access to HIV prevention and testing.

Much of the U.S. funding comes from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which is largely implemented by the Agency for International Development (USAID). However, PEPFAR and USAID were hit by an unprecedented funding pause and staffing reduction in January, following an executive order from President Donald Trump.

PEPFAR later received a temporary waiver to continue some services, including those for antiretroviral therapy (ART), the drugs that keep HIV from progressing to AIDS. These treatments must be taken consistently or the virus will rebound.

""The widespread rollout and uptake of antiretroviral therapy funded by international sources has been one of the most important factors reducing AIDS related deaths in lower income settings,"" said Justin Parkhurst, an associate professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science who was not involved in the study. ART also cuts the number of new infections by suppressing the virus in people living with HIV, thus preventing transmission, he told Live Science in an email.

""In the worst-case scenario, if PEPFAR funding were ceased entirely and no equivalent mechanism replaced it, surges in HIV incidence could potentially undo nearly all progress achieved since 2000.""

However, despite the waiver, PEPFAR's services still haven't resumed as normal, given the waiver didn't trigger immediate funding to eligible programs and many clinics had already shuttered by the time it was issued. Even now, PEPFAR's future after the waiver's expiration remains uncertain.

Following the U.S., the next top four donors for international HIV funding are the U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands. However, as of February 2025, each of these donors has also announced major cuts in foreign aid spending — ""and more might follow,"" the study authors wrote.

Based on the projected cuts being made by the top five donors, the researchers used a mathematical model to predict the rates of new HIV cases and deaths. They focused their model on 26 LMICs, which together receive 49% of international HIV aid, overall, and 54% of PEPFAR aid. They then used the data from these 26 countries to extrapolate to all LMICs worldwide.



The researchers considered several scenarios in their model. The first — the ""status quo"" — served as a baseline, projecting the rates of cases and deaths if recent levels of HIV spending were maintained between 2025 and 2030, rather than cut. In this scenario, more than 1.8 million new infections and over 720,000 HIV-related deaths occurred in LMICs.

In the worst-case scenario the team considered, all PEPFAR funding was indefinitely stopped on Jan. 20, 2025, and no alternative funding sources emerged to fill that gap. Simultaneously, other, non-PEPFAR sources of international funding were also reduced. That scenario led to an estimated 10.8 million more cases and 2.9 million more deaths than the status quo.

This suggests that ""the number of new infections in 2026 could return to 2010 levels, and by 2030 the number of new infections could surpass historical estimates,"" the study authors wrote. ""In the worst-case scenario, if PEPFAR funding were ceased entirely and no equivalent mechanism replaced it, surges in HIV incidence could potentially undo nearly all progress achieved since 2000.""

This worst-case scenario would hit sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) particularly hard — out of eight SSA countries included in the analysis, six receive over 40% of their HIV funding through PEPFAR. Children in the region could see a nearly three-fold increase in HIV infections, the authors predicted.

And outside of SSA, other vulnerable populations, such as sex workers, would be much harder hit by such cuts than the general population, showing up to a six-fold higher increase in cases than other demographics, the data suggested.

The team also looked at a less extreme scenario, modeling what would happen if new funding sources filled the gap left by PEPFAR. In this scenario, they assumed that the gap could be partially filled by 2026 and then fully filled by 2027. If that mitigation were to happen, the number of extra cases drops to 4.4 million and the extra deaths to 770,000 over the course of five years.

So while filling the gap left by PEPFAR would help substantially, that sudden loss of funding would still have devastating impacts, the study suggests.

""Modelling reveals the potential for severe consequences following abrupt stopping, with no notice, of international support aimed at stopping AIDS as a global public health threat,"" Dr. Catherine Hankins, a professor of global and public health at McGill University in Canada who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.

According to the study authors, even if the PEPFAR gap could be filled within two years, the ripple effects would be felt for decades to come. They estimated that it would take 20 to 30 extra years of 2024-level funding to end AIDS as a public health threat.

Ambitious goals set by UNAIDS have aimed to end the threat by 2030. And historic HIV trends suggested that many of the LMICs featured in the new paper could have hit their targets by about 2036, if funding continued at past levels, the authors wrote.

""This study indicates that an abrupt termination of programmes has serious risks to human life,"" Parkhurst said. ""Even for those who believe the US or other governments should reduce foreign aid spending in this area, there can be planning around how to do so without producing serious harm to millions of people around the world who have come to rely on the treatment.""

The study suggests that, if that abrupt stop could be avoided, many lives could be spared.

The researchers looked at what would happen if PEPFAR was reinstated or ""equivalently recovered"" and estimated that there could be 70,000 to 1.73 million extra cases and 5,000 to 61,000 extra deaths, compared to status quo. Those estimates assume that other international funding will still be reduced, but that countries will be able to make up for some of the lost funds domestically.

The new study has some limitations, as ""there is inherent uncertainty in global modelling,"" said study co-first author Rowan Martin-Hughes, a senior research officer at the Burnet Institute in Australia.

The ""most important"" limitation is that there is uncertainty in the HIV fiscal space, although the authors covered some of that unpredictability by looking at a range of possible outcomes, Martin-Hughes told Live Science in an email. There are also gaps in the global reporting of financial data that could affect their model, and the 26 featured countries might not be fully representative of the overall impacts of funding cuts, he added.

However, ""overall, we think most sources of uncertainty are likely to result in underestimating rather than overestimating the real effects of immediate and severe funding cuts to HIV programmes globally, especially in the sub-Saharan African region,"" he said.

In light of the impending cuts, ""it is paramount now to track AIDS mortality and HIV incidence while urgently reversing the cuts, mitigating the effects, and creating new funding strategies to prevent further suffering,"" Hankins said.

Martin-Hughes agreed.

""Governments, donors, and stakeholders must collaborate on feasible mitigation strategies to preserve HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services to avoid a resurgence in the HIV epidemic,"" he said. ""In doing so, the global community can secure both the immediate and long-term stability of resilient health systems so integral to saving lives through HIV epidemic control.""

Global investment, especially from the U.S., has put targets for the elimination of HIV transmission within reach, he said. ""But all of that progress is vulnerable, and could be wiped out within a few years if there are dramatic and unmanaged cuts to HIV services.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","In an Easter post, Trump said the businessmen who've criticized his tariffs are bad at both business and politics","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-businessmen-against-tariffs-are-bad-at-business-and-politics-2025-4","Mon, 21 Apr 2025 06:01:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump said on Sunday that business leaders who oppose his reciprocal tariffs do not appreciate what he is doing for them.

""THE BUSINESSMEN WHO CRITICIZE TARIFFS ARE BAD AT BUSINESS, BUT REALLY BAD AT POLITICS,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Easter Sunday.

""THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND OR REALIZE THAT I AM THE GREATEST FRIEND THAT AMERICAN CAPITALISM HAS EVER HAD!"" Trump added.

Trump announced sweeping tariffs on more than 180 countries on April 2.

A baseline rate of 10% went into effect on April 5, while a higher set of tariffs that varied by country took effect on April 9 before Trump announced a 90-day pause on the same day. Trump's tariffs triggered a massive market sell-off.

Trump did not include any names in his Truth Social post on Sunday, but several prominent entrepreneurs and executives have publicly criticized Trump's decision to impose tariffs on US trading partners.

JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon told the Financial Times in an interview published Tuesday that the uncertainty created by Trump's tariffs was challenging America's reputation as a ""haven.""

""I am not worried about the markets as much as I am about keeping the Western world together, free and safe for democracy,"" Dimon told the FT.

""And that, to me, means you want to strengthen the economic relationships. If there's unfairness, deal with it. But yeah, we should be careful. I don't think anyone should assume they have a divine right to success, and therefore, don't worry about it,"" Dimon added.

Earlier, on April 9, Dimon said in an interview with Fox Business that a recession is a ""likely outcome"" with Trump's tariffs. Trump said in a Truth Social post, hours before announcing a 90-day pause on tariffs, that he had watched Dimon's interview.

Dimon isn't the only business leader who has warned of the risks that Trump's tariffs could have on the economy.

""Shark Tank"" star Mark Cuban has repeatedly panned Trump's tariffs. On April 2, the day Trump announced his sweeping tariffs, Cuban wrote on Bluesky that people should 'buy lots of consumables"" now before prices go up.

""Even if it's made in the USA, they will jack up the price and blame it on tariffs,"" Cuban wrote.

Then, on April 9, hours before Trump rolled back his tariffs, Cuban said businesses probably reacted to the tariffs by cutting jobs to save costs.

""What some people aren't factoring into their analysis is the reality that companies were buying tons of inventory to beat the tariffs. That's cash taken from being able to invest or hire,"" Cuban wrote in a post on Bluesky.

Elon Musk, one of Trump's biggest backers, also broke with the administration's position on tariffs. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO called for a ""free trade zone"" between Europe and the US and slammed Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro, after Trump's tariff announcement.

Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal Musk, was more pointed in his criticisms of Trump's tariffs.

""Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,"" Kimbal Musk wrote in an X post on April 7.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The Trump administration is threatening to stop future federal approvals for transportation projects in Manhattan and may withhold funding if New York City's congestion pricing program continues.

The threat issued on Monday comes after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is implementing the new toll on motorists driving into parts of Manhattan, continued charging drivers after the US Department of Transportation's April 20 deadline to end the program.

Follow:


            The logos of Big Tech companies and key associations were featured prominently Monday at the White House Easter Egg Roll, offering an unprecedented scene and use of the grounds to promote private business.
    


            Children danced on the grass as a military band performed Martha and the Vandellas' “Nowhere to Run, Nowhere to Hide” atop a stage emblazoned with eggs and rabbits sporting the YouTube logo. And dozens of attendees lined up to take a photo in Meta's tent, which featured a White House backdrop and a locator icon in the style of Instagram.
    


            All money raised from the sponsorships will go toward the nonprofit White House Historical Association. But the sponsorship opportunities, which were first reported by CNN in March, have prompted concern from ethics and legal experts, as well as from White House officials on both sides of the aisle, because the solicitations run counter to long-established regulations prohibiting the use of public office for private gain.
    


            Those opportunities included “naming rights for key areas or elements” and “sponsor logos featured on event signage,” according to a document from an outside production company called Harbinger that was obtained by CNN.
    


            The sponsorships underscore the lengths to which businesses have sought to cultivate relationships with the Trump administration — even amid the uncertainty and upheaval of President Donald Trump's tariff policies. That was particularly poignant as a volunteer in a white apron facilitated a photo opportunity while a toddler and his parents rang a mock bell sponsored by the New York Stock Exchange, as the Dow tumbled more than 1,000 points.
    


            Also on Monday, families walked under an arch made of hundreds of fresh carrots featuring “International Fresh Produce Association” branding. A volunteer handed out Slinky toys in a “play garden” space provided by The Toy Association.
    


            A “reading nook” tent was set up with a couch and Amazon signage.
    


            Yet when the time came for first lady Melania Trump to read “Bunny with a Big Heart,” she was far from the branding and logos, at a different reading nook in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, decorated with florals and a pastel White House Easter Egg Roll sign.
    


            Private contributions covered activity booths, artists, music, vendors, staging, equipment and décor, said a source familiar with the planning who was granted anonymity to detail specifics of the funding mechanisms.
    


            Any excess funding raised, that source said, will go toward similar White House events, such as Halloween festivities and the Fourth of July.
