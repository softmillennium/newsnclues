                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stocks and bonds tanked, while the US dollar set a fresh three-year low. The moves came after President Trump further escalated his feud with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, saying on saying on Truth Social that the central bank head is a "major loser" who has taken too long to cut interest rates. These comments shouldn't be confused with Trump saying on social media last week that Powell's "termination cannot come fast enough," again in reference to a lack of rate-cut activity. "A lot of this could just be trying to set the storyline for later on, that if we do go into a recession, it was because the Fed didn't cut rates," Bespoke co-founder Paul Hickey told Business Insider, adding that it "sets the Fed up for being scapegoated down the line." The president has long lambasted Powell for not lowering interest rates. Trump's frustration has gained steam since Powell's latest speech, in which he suggested that the president's tariffs could create policy issues for the central bank. White House interference in Fed leadership isn't seen sitting well with investors, and attempts to politicize monetary policy decisions would likely introduce further uncertainty into markets. Here's more detailed context behind the moves across asset classes: Though most of the trade duties were later paused, tariffs on China have soared even higher, and the resulting trade war has been a challenge for investors to digest. No new trade deals were announced over the weekend to uplift that market's spirits; instead, China warned that it would take countermeasures against any nation that reaches a deal with the US to isolate the country from global trade. Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction to yields, have dropped in recent weeks amid threats to US growth and deep uncertainty around trade. Commentators have observed that instability in the US economic outlook has hurt Treasurys' ultrasafe reputation. It's a dynamic that's played out several times already this year, with tariff uncertainty and policy headwinds sending yields surging. Bond vigilantes may have forced Trump to hit pause on the trade war earlier in the month, but headwinds for US Treasurys also include foreign investors selling and volatility in the so-called basis trade orchestrated by hedge funds. Trump's attacks against Powell will likely only heighten investors' nervousness, keeping yields elevated. The dollar's move lower goes against earlier expectations, as it was implied that tariffs would support currency levels. Crypto also gained, with bitcoin touching $88,000 for the first time since March.</p>

US Jobs Report:

President Donald Trump has initiated sweeping cuts to federal staffing across the country in an effort to reduce waste and government spending.

The broader US federal workforce could shrink by more than 1 million, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, largely reflecting an estimated reduction in those indirectly employed by the government through contracts and grants.

“Given the size of the federal workforce, the reduction in employment levels could have a measurable impact on labor market outcomes,” M. Melinda Pitts, a researcher at the Atlanta Fed, wrote in a blog post published Monday. </p>

A Republican proposal to impose a tax hike on millionaires offers to generate about $400 billion over a decade, according to two new estimates provided to Bloomberg News, providing fresh revenue to partially offset the cost of the party's multi-trillion-dollar tax package.

The Budget Lab at Yale projects that taxing income over $1 million at a 40% rate would generate $420 billion over a decade. The Tax Foundation in its own preliminary analysis finds that the new bracket would raise $358 billion over the same 10-year period, according to Garrett Watson, the director of policy analysis for the think tank. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge has once again blocked Department of Government Efficiency staffers, operating inside the Social Security Administration, from accessing sensitive personal data of millions of Americans. U.S. District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander on Thursday granted a preliminary injunction to block the so-called DOGE from further accessing sensitive personal data stored by the agency. As a result, DOGE will have to comply with certain legal requirements when accessing SSA data. The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; the AFL-CIO; American Federation of Teachers and Alliance for Retired Americans. They are represented by national legal organization Democracy Forward. More from Personal Finance:Estimates point to lower Social Security cost-of-living adjustment in 2026Social Security Administration updates new anti-fraud measuresDisability advocates sue Social Security and DOGE to stop service cuts DOGE and its affiliates must also disgorge and delete all non-anonymized personally identifiable information in their possession or control since Jan. 20, according to the order. They are also prohibited from installing any software on Social Security Administration systems and must remove any software installed since Jan. 20, the order states. In addition, the defendants are blocked from accessing, altering or disclosing the agency's computer or software code. "The court's ruling sends a clear message: no one can bypass the law to raid government data systems for their own purposes," said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, in a statement. "We will continue working with our partners to ensure that DOGE's overreach is permanently stopped and that people's rights are protected," Perryman said. The injunction does allow DOGE staffers to access data that's been redacted or stripped of anything personally identifiable, if they undergo training and background checks. A temporary restraining order, which was issued by Hollander on March 20, is vacated and superseded with this order. "We will appeal this decision and expect ultimate victory on the issue," White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston said in an email statement. "The American people gave President Trump a clear mandate to uproot waste, fraud, and abuse across the federal government.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Monday met with chief executives from three of the nation's top retailers, who came to the White House to discuss how his sweeping tariff plans could impact their import-heavy business models. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and Target chief executive Brian Cornell both attended, as did Home Depot CEO Ted Decker. A White House official told CNBC earlier Monday that a representative from Lowe's would also be at the meeting. After the meeting concluded, an official told NBC News that no one from Lowe's attended. "We had a productive meeting with President Trump and his team and appreciated the opportunity to share our insights," a Walmart spokesperson said. "We had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers," read the statement from Target. "We had an informative and constructive meeting with the President and look forward to continuing the dialogue," Home Depot's statement said. In a statement provided to CNBC later Monday, Trump said that the meeting "went very well," adding, "It was an honor to have them" in the Oval Office. For retailers, tariffs are the latest threat to an already challenging economic landscape, where consumers are looking for low prices after years of high inflation. Yet tariffs will weigh on some retailers more than others. As the nation's largest grocer, Walmart is in a better position than many of its competitors. About two-thirds of what Walmart sells in the United States is made, grown or assembled in America, chief financial officer John David Rainey said earlier this month at an investor event in Dallas. Target, on the other hand, is in a tougher spot. The Minneapolis-based retailer is best known for discretionary merchandise like inexpensive, chic clothes and home goods, products that are typically manufactured overseas. The group, which lobbies for and represents retailers, has released its own estimates of how much more consumers would have to pay for everyday items like sneakers, toasters and mattresses. "More tariffs equal more anxiety and uncertainty for American businesses and consumers," David French, NRF's executive vice president of government relations, said on the day Trump unveiled his "reciprocal" tariff plan, which he has since pared back. "While leaders in Washington may not care about higher prices, hardworking American families do," French said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Married student-loan borrowers won't have to worry about changes that could increase their monthly payments after all. After the American Federation of Teachers sued President Donald Trump's administration for taking down online access to income-driven-repayment applications, the Department of Education wrote in a legal filing that married student-loan borrowers who file separate tax returns would have their combined income counted to calculate monthly payments. The Department of Education corrected that in a legal filing last week, saying the change to married borrowers' payment calculations "was erroneous." Instead, acting Undersecretary James Bergeron said that married borrowers filing separately would have the spouse counted in the family size to calculate monthly payments. The department said it initially removed online access to income-driven-repayment applications as a "required consequence" of a federal court blocking the SAVE plan. SAVE, which was created by then-President Joe Biden to give borrowers lower monthly payments and a shorter timeline to debt relief, has been blocked since this past summer following a lawsuit from GOP-led states. Borrowers enrolled in SAVE are on administrative forbearance pending a final legal decision. They can choose to apply for a different repayment plan if they want to continue making payments and earning credit toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But there's not yet a timeline for when servicers will begin to process the backlog of income-driven-repayment applications. "This timeline is due to the servicers' internal procedures," Bergeron wrote. "Specifically, before servicers can begin to process applications, they must update the processing rules in their systems according to the terms of their contracts with Education."</p>

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's purse containing $3,000 in cash was stolen while she was dining at a popular Washington, DC restaurant over the weekend, an incident now under investigation by the US Secret Service.

Noem was eating with her family at The Capital Burger when she felt what she thought was her grandchild brush against her leg, said a person familiar with the incident. Moments later, she realized her purse was missing, according to the person, who isn't authorized to speak publicly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A foundational shift is underway in enterprise software, and it's being driven by generative AI. The consulting firm warned that this is squeezing more than 100 mid-market software companies, which are stuck in the midst of a powerful trend. These companies are caught in a "big squeeze," pressured on one side by nimble, AI-native entrants that can replicate applications at a fraction of the cost and on the other side by tech behemoths, such as Microsoft and Salesforce, that are pouring billions of dollars into the AI arms race, AlixPartners said. It declined to identify specific companies, given the sensitive nature of its findings. The most mature uses of AI in enterprise software today include copilots for software coding, such as GitHub Copilot from Microsoft, and support chatbots like Zendesk's Answer Bot. These agents are capable of handling complex tasks, such as scheduling meetings, analyzing reports, and creating code, with little need for a graphical interface or structured workflow. And because they can run across various data types without needing extensive data normalization, they could render some traditional SaaS layers redundant. This puts mid-size SaaS vendors in a tricky position, the firm explained, citing a recent analysis it conducted of 122 publicly listed enterprise software companies with annual revenue below $10 billion. This year, industry analysts are expecting further declines, indicating that only 27% of companies will be in the high-growth category. AlixPartners also highlighted that software customers are moving around more than before. (NDR is a common way to measure customer stickiness. When it's above 100%, that indicates revenue from existing customers is growing, while an NDR below 100% suggests revenue is declining from these sources.) Many of these companies are now being undercut by AI-powered challengers with lower costs and faster iteration cycles. Simultaneously, larger players are integrating AI into their broader platforms, offering bundled functionality at lower price points through economies of scale, according to the consulting firm. Klarna's recent decision to drop Salesforce and Workday in favor of smaller AI-powered vendors and in-house agents is a sign of where this trend may be headed, AlixPartners noted. Traditional SaaS depends heavily on the user interface, structured data workflows, and seat-based pricing. But AI agents don't need dashboards, and they can function without rigid data hierarchies. Salesforce and ServiceNow have begun experimenting with outcome-based pricing for AI agents, where fees are tied to results, not user counts. Among those 122 mid-sized software companies, AlixPartners found that half expect significant changes to business models in the next year. At the same time, the compute costs associated with running AI agents can be significantly higher than for classic SaaS tools, making profit margin compression a potential threat. Meanwhile, higher interest rates and tightening capital markets in recent years have put the onus on SaaS profitability, not just growth. Software companies have responded by cutting costs, optimizing portfolios, and rethinking pricing strategies. According to the AlixPartners report, more than 60% of executives are now focused on AI as a growth driver. Unlocking that growth requires more than just product tweaks, it may require transformation across operations, go-to-market models, and customer relationships, the consulting firm suggested. In a world where generative AI tools can write or replicate software pretty well, differentiation must come from speed, relevance, and efficiency, not UI design or legacy feature sets. But the SaaS era, as we know it, is evolving.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Companies like Shopify, Microsoft, and Meta are ramping up the intensity for workers, pushing the need to get ahead in AI and drive efficiency. The shift inside tech companies has led to a culling of "low performers," inflexible return-to-office mandates, and a reduction in perks. Nvidia's staff has grown immensely in the past few years, and its market capitalization is on a wild roller coaster ride. Nvidia has a demanding work culture that trickles down from its famous CEO, providing a foil for the tech firms that aspire to be hardcore but do so by fiat. "Basically, every single person in Nvidia is directly accountable to Jensen," said Stephen Witt, the author of "The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World's Most Coveted Microchip." Nvidia declined a request for comment from BI. Nvidia has an extremely horizontal structure, with dozens of people — about 60 — reporting directly to Huang. Nvidia shies away from short-term goals, Kim said. There's a central goal or mission, but planning and strategizing are constant processes that don't focus on management incentives or satisfying a hierarchy. Project leaders may suddenly find themselves reporting directly to Huang. These newly anointed direct reports are dubbed "pilots in charge" and are subject to his wrath and carry his weight, Kim said. "His ability to track small details across countless projects is incredible," a former director told BI. This method of extreme accountability means Nvidia hasn't had to rein in employees as many other companies have postpandemic. If he suspects someone isn't on top of their work, a public cross-examination may ensue. Perks are few, but that's always been the case, two former Nvidians told BI. The "mission is boss" ethos helps Nvidia avoid the pitfalls of large firms, which often struggle to make quick decisions, let alone pivot when needed, Kim wrote. "Jensen really doesn't tolerate" nonsense, a former engineer from Nvidia's early days told BI. This intolerance makes playing politics nearly impossible, they added. By Monday, Nvidia was an AI company, Witt wrote. Huang is known to send more than 100 emails a day, which brings another "Jensen-ism" into play. (Kim's book has an entire appendix of Jensen-isms.) The 62-year-old CEO often refers to Nvidia's modus operandi as "speed of light." That's how fast Huang wants everything at Nvidia to progress. Witt thinks that Nvidia's email culture may have inspired a memorable moment from the early days of the White House DOGE office. On a Saturday, Elon Musk requested that every federal government employee send a five-point email recounting what they had done that week. Huang has requested these emails from his staff since 2020. The irony in Nvidia's position among the Silicon Valley elite is that the "mission is boss" mentality and the constant email status updates mean a lot of Nvidians have flexibility that most of Big Tech, including Nvidia's largest customers, have abandoned in 2025. The hours can be long at Nvidia, which also stems from Huang. Sixty-hour weeks are the norm, and 80-hour weeks are likely at crucial times, a contrast to companies that feel the need to delineate exact office hours. "I don't even know when Jensen sleeps," another former Nvidia director said. Many Nvidians are still able to work from wherever they like. "One of the reasons he's so big on work-from-home is because it gives women, and especially young mothers, the opportunity to continue their work without their careers getting interrupted," Witt said. Inspired by his wife, Lori Huang, an electrical engineer who dropped out of the workforce after becoming a mother of two, Huang is aware that some valuable engineering brains find balancing work and family difficult. "It works really well at Nvidia," Witt said. There is nowhere to hide if you are shirking your work at Nvidia, and I think that makes work-from-home work better for them." Witt said that's in part due to a self-selection dynamic. "He can get these guys to work for Nvidia on little more than a dream, but those guys will do it because they know the circuits; they know the technology," Witt told BI. "And they know that Jensen's always at the cutting edge, even if it's not making money. They'll do anything to be at the cutting edge." But another reason many Nvidians spend decades with the company may come from Huang's competitive anxiety. "They'll think about what it's worth to keep that person away from the competition." "I don't like giving up on people because I think that they could improve," Huang said at a Stripe event last year. "It's kind of tongue in cheek, but people know that I'd rather torture them into greatness."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The average banker didn't go to Harvard and is less likely to be white than you may think — unless he's the boss. Imagine the average Wall Street worker, and Christian Bale's investment banker character from "American Psycho" might come to mind: conventionally attractive with slicked-back hair, a posh Manhattan address, dual Harvard degrees, and, of course, white and male. What if we told you that front-office workers at four of the largest banks were actually less white than the general public? Or that Baruch College, a public school in New York City, is a more common undergrad alma mater than Harvard? Students who want to become investment bankers, private equity dealmakers, or hedge fund traders now feel they must start checking off a long to-do list as early as freshman year — or risk missing out. The system prioritizes people who are lucky enough to be exposed to the finance industry and its all-important investment banking internship at a young age. See more stories from BI's Path to Wall Street series here, including what it's really like to work for a hedge fund and why young people are flocking to investment banking despite its challenging apprenticeship model. We turned to disparate sources of information to synthesize a picture across four of the largest Wall Street banks: JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs. To determine pay, we consulted the New York State Comptroller's annual compensation report, which relies on tax data. Read on to learn more about the average Face of Wall Street. While an Ivy League degree can help you land a front-office bulge bracket job, it's far from a requirement, the data showed. Nearly as many received their undergraduate degree internationally, which can serve as a proxy for employees who are not from the US. Almost four out of five went to other schools. BI studied the educational backgrounds of the 69 members of the management committees at these four banks and found that 17.4% of them went to an Ivy Plus for undergrad, and a striking 30.4% hailed from an international school. Wall Street's front-office workers hail from a range of undergraduate programs, but there are some top hits. Three of the five most popular undergraduate schools are in New York City, led by New York University, which charges more than $65,000 a year for tuition. Next up is Baruch College, a public school in Manhattan known for spitting out finance talent, and Fordham University, a private Jesuit school in the Bronx. New York City's Ivy League representative, Columbia, didn't make the top five. The study found that 28.3% of these workers have a graduate degree, most likely an MBA, though it could be another degree. The most attended graduate schools among this cohort are largely a who's who of top business schools, with NYU and Columbia taking the lead. Among job switchers, most worked at other bulge-bracket banks led by Bank of America. Note: The above chart shows nominal bonus size and is not adjusted for inflation. Working on Wall Street pays well, with entry-level bankers earning about $110,000 a year, not including bonuses. Bonuses can make up half or more of total pay but will fluctuate depending on how bad or good business was the year prior. In 2024, bank revenues soared, sending Wall Street's bonus pools to an all-time high of $47.5 billion, according to New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli's report. That works out to an average bonus of $244,700 for every Wall Street worker, the report said. Using banker pay data for 2023, BI estimated that the average Wall Street worker earned roughly $529,970 in 2024. One exception is the Asian population, whose representation in finance is about three times that in the country as a whole. Since 2019, the studied banks have become 5 percentage points less white, with all minority categories increasing, led by Asian workers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Wall Street's executive level is whiter than the general population. The four banks are essentially three-quarters white at that level. Asian executives are also more highly represented at that level, with 14.18% of roles. Other minority groups are substantially less represented than they are in the general population, with only 4.74% Black executives, who make up 13.7% of the general population, and 5.23% Hispanic executives, who account for 19.5% of the general population. Despite banks' diversification efforts, white people now represent 74.2% of firms' executive ranks, up from 70.2% in 2019. While the data is separated into different job categories, it doesn't make more granular distinctions between investment bankers and those who work in other fields like technology and marketing. Most of the banks' data comes from 2023 EEOC disclosures with the exception of Citi, which has not released its 2023 disclosure. We've also collapsed the Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and multiracial categories into one "other" category. If you look at the overall gender breakdown, the banks are almost exactly 50/50 male and female, and have been since 2019. But an interesting story emerges when you look at the gender split by rank. The next bar up, professionals, are more male than female (53.3% to 46.7%) but near parity. That share is lower than in 2019, when nearly three-quarters, 74.1%, of top bank executives were male. Editor's note: Revelio Labs' data comes from its internal talent database, which uses public sources like LinkedIn profiles that are standardized through the firm's proprietary algorithms. For this project, Revelio pulled data for roughly 36,500 employees of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citi, and JPMorgan who identified as front-office workers based in the New York area.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some Americans are secretly working multiple full-time remote jobs simultaneously. Whether it's beating the system or cheating depends on who you ask. Over the past two years, I've interviewed more than two dozen "overemployed" people, many of whom work in the IT and tech sectors. These stories have drawn a wide range of reactions from readers. Others have argued that these workers are taking advantage of their employers — getting full-time pay without giving full-time attention — and holding jobs that unemployed Americans need. I asked four ethics academics and consultants to weigh in on the debate. Several of the sources Business Insider spoke with said the ethics question often starts with whether an employee has a contract and what it says. Todd Haugh, an associate professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University, said that if an employee's contract stipulates that they must work exclusively for their employer, it'd be hard to argue that it's ethical for them to work another job. However, Haugh said most workers in the US are "at will" employees who don't have formal employee contracts, which generally allows them to be fired or quit at any time. He thinks many job jugglers are likely breaching their employer's implied expectation that they'll focus fully on only one job during work hours. Even if a worker doesn't have a formal contract that prohibits job juggling, Haugh said they could be fired if they're found out. Jeffrey Moriarty, executive director of the Hoffman Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University, feels similarly. "When you promise to work during certain hours for an employer, you implicitly promise not to work for another employer during that time period," he said, adding that job juggling likely involves lying and deception, behaviors generally frowned upon from an ethical standpoint. For example, by paying them in a "wheelbarrow full of pennies" instead of the direct deposit they assumed was a given, he said. Elizabeth Anderson, a professor of public philosophy at the University of Michigan and author of "Value in Ethics and Economics," said she believes lying is generally wrong, but an employer isn't entitled to know whether someone is working multiple jobs unless it's explicitly prohibited in an employment contract. "As long as the salaried employee is working hard enough not to get fired, the employee has done everything they owe to their employer and is not obligated to reveal that they are moonlighting for someone else," she said. Additionally, she doesn't think it would be unethical for an employee to evade a question about their work status or offer "truthful but misleading" information. In the case of contract workers, who are often hired temporarily for a specific purpose, Anderson said job juggling is ethically acceptable unless it is explicitly prohibited in a formal contract. Overemployment could open the door to other ethical trouble, along with questions about loyalty. Chris MacDonald, an associate professor at Toronto Metropolitan University who also consults on ethics, said it could create a conflict of interest if a person juggles multiple jobs and the employers are in the same field, presenting a different set of ethical concerns. Meanwhile, Anderson said it would be wrong to work for a second employer from the first employer's office, rather than from a separate workspace, she added. While some job jugglers might think it's fine to have multiple jobs if the work gets done, MacDonald said it's probably wrong unless they've asked their employers first. Additionally, he said there could be times when performing well at two or more jobs isn't realistic. "Individuals are very good at viewing their own behavior as ethical," he said. ​​Do you have a story to share about secretly working multiple jobs or discovering an employee is doing so?</p>
