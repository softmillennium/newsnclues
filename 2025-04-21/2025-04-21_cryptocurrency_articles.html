                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stacy Hazinski received one of those annoying text messages that claimed she was about to be charged $114.02 for something she didn't buy. So she called the number, supposedly for her Apple Pay account, to make sure that she didn't get stuck with the bill. One simple phone call set off a scheme that ultimately enabled someone to steal her entire income tax refund and drain her savings account at a local credit union. Filing her taxes early in the year essentially meant little, she told me at her Michigan condo, because now she has nothing to show for it. Her story highlights one huge red flag that consumers must watch out for these days — how scammers are convincing you to take cash to a crypto ATM at the local party store, gas station or grocery. Con artists deceive people with backstories on how they can protect their money or avoid trouble by depositing money in a cryptocurrency ATM. The crooks — who might pretend to be from Apple, Google, an Internet service provider or even law enforcement — do their research and know where these ATMs are in your neighborhood. They'll tell you to withdraw cash from the bank and give you directions to one of these crypto ATMs. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a consumer alert April 8 to warn residents about scammers using bitcoin ATMs to defraud consumers. “Because money sent through bitcoin ATMs is nearly impossible to recover and these machines lack oversight and regulation, they have become an attractive option for criminals engaged in fraud and money laundering,” Nessel said in a statement. Consumers lost $66 million to crypto ATM fraud in the first six months of 2024, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The actual number is likely much higher as such types of fraud often go unreported, according to the FTC. The FTC said the losses involving these ATMs increased dramatically from $12 million in 2020 to $114 million for all of 2023. People 60 and over were more than three times as likely as younger adults to report a loss using a bitcoin ATM in the first half of 2024, according to FTC data. Once the money is deposited into bitcoin, experts warn, it is transferred quickly, making it often impossible to track. Hazinski, 51, heard slew of scary stories on Feb. 28 — starting with a guy named John from Apple and switching over to a guy named Eric who claimed to be from her credit union — on how scammers were in the process of getting their hands on her federal income tax refund, as well as the rest of her savings. As part of the scam, she was told by the guy who claimed to be an employee at the credit union that she would need to transfer her cash into a "security" account to protect her savings from someone who was about to send her money into an account at www.poker.com. Why was her money going to cover some online poker tournament? She got terribly nervous, especially since her savings was limited after she had been out of work for a few months. She was told to go to a Community Choice Credit Union branch first to take out $12,500 where she remembers that the stack of bills was stuffed into zippered bag. The teller put those bills in a paper envelope. After that, he told her that bitcoin is secure and she needed to deposit her money at a bitcoin ATM to protect it from scammers. "So I believed him," she told me as we talked at her dining room high-top table. Instead of winning big, she ended up losing her money on the spot. The Bitcoin Depot ATM stands near the front register, not far from a refrigerated case that sells BB's Buzzin Brews for $8.99 and up, ready-to-mix drinks that often include minibar size bottles of liquor. When I visited the store April 12, I did not see any signs posted on the machine warning of potential scams. When I called the store April 16, I asked to speak to a manager who apparently hung up on me after I mentioned that a woman had lost $17,500 at the bitcoin machine in the store. No one picked up after I tried to immediately call again. The party store had a decent number of customers in it that February afternoon, Hazinski remembered, but no one said a word as she pulled out the two envelopes stuffed with $17,500 from her purse. "I was standing there at least a half hour putting money in that machine," Hazinski said. She had no idea how to use a bitcoin ATM or set up an account. "He's telling me exactly what to do," Hazinski said. At one point, the ATM asked her for a QR code. And con artist told her: "I'll send you the QR code." "What I find out after the fact, right, is the QR code that he sent me went to his account," Hazinski said. She was still in the store when her 16-year-old son Joshua, who attends high school, called her wondering why she wasn't home yet. When she told him what had happened, her son said "Mom, are you kidding me?" The lights came on, and Hazinski knew her son had to be right. The man impersonating a credit union employee had told her earlier that someone would come to her house the next day to give her a new debit card and a new account number. "All the bills, and you have no money," Hazinski said. Hazinski was laid off in August from a job as a robotics engineer, work she has done for some 25 years. Initially, she used that time off to take care of her father who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He's now in remission and she's still looking for work. Hazinski has been on interviews but thinks many companies, including auto suppliers, are holding back hiring in light of the Trump tariffs. She voted for Trump and favors his strategy of raising revenue for the federal government by getting countries to pay higher tariffs. But she's hoping that hiring picks up, too. She's far from the first person to be caught in this bitcoin ATM scam. Crypto ATM abuse has gotten so bad that a top Democratic senator introduced a bill in Congress in February that would protect new customers who are most likely to be fraud victims by setting transaction limits of $2,000 per day, and $10,000 total over the first 14 days. The Crypto ATM Fraud Protection Act — introduced by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee — would require full refunds for fraudulent transactions at crypto ATMs if the new customer makes a report within 30 days. And it would be required that the ATM offer a way for consumers to give live, verbal confirmation for any transaction greater than $500. That scam started when the con artists called and claimed to be a deputy in the Will County Sheriff's Office. Durbin said it was past time to put some "commonsense guardrails in place to stop fraud in this largely unregulated industry." Bitcoin Depot, which operates the ATM along with more than 8,400 kiosks in North America, said the company remains focused on "prevention and user safety as we work to make crypto more accessible and secure." "We display multiple scam warnings throughout the entire transaction process and offer live customer support via phone, text, chat and email to assist users in real-time before they complete a transaction," according to a statement sent to the Detroit Free Press by a spokesperson for Bitcoin Depot. They include warnings to new customers to not use the Bitcoin Depot ATM for payments to any government entities, law enforcement, employers, tech support companies or anyone saying you've been hacked. Do not buy bitcoin for IRS payments, utility bills, or if someone says you have been hacked or are being investigated. That warning also indicates that "losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable and transactions in virtual currency are irreversible." Hazinski told me she did not see any alerts about scams when the con artist on the phone was telling her what to do next. "I did not receive any of those warnings," she later told me by email after I sent her images of the Bitcoin Depot warnings. I initially wrote about crooks using bitcoin ATMs to steal money roughly three years ago. They sent a phony check to her Oakland Township home for her to buy Apple computer products to work remotely as an administrative assistant for a biopharmaceutical company. But first, she somehow needed to deposit money in a bitcoin ATM to prove where she lived before they'd send any equipment. Ultimately, the couple ended up withdrawing $350,000 from various banks and then turning that cash into cryptocurrency, according to the Grand Traverse Sheriff's Department. In 2024, consumers reported losing more money to scams where they paid with bank transfers or cryptocurrency than all other payment methods combined. People reported losing $2 billion through a bank transfer and $1.42 billion through cryptocurrency, according to Federal Trade Commission data. These cryptocurrency-related scams also involved phony investments, not just cash lost at a bitcoin ATM. Once it's in someone else's wallet, experts say, there's nothing you can do to recover your crypto. The Community Choice Credit Union said it consistently shares information to alert consumers about fraud, including the use of bitcoin. Warnings about bitcoin ATM scams, according to the credit union, have been posted on its website and social media pages. “We are extremely concerned and saddened to hear that our member was a victim of fraud,” said Jeff Dubey, vice president of Enterprise Risk Management for Community Choice Credit Union. In a statement sent to the Free Press, the credit union said frontline credit union staff will encourage a credit union member to engage with the risk management team, if the staff suspects someone is a potential victim. The credit union stated that fraudsters are increasingly tech-savvy and can "spoof" financial institution phone numbers and send text messages to take over accounts. "They also commonly employ scare tactics via phone calls, demanding that consumers purchase gift cards, wire funds or deposit cash into bitcoin machines," the credit union stated. Lt. Ben Hancock of the Troy Police Department said right now, scams where crooks are demanding payments by bitcoin or outright cash have seen an uptick lately. On March 16, for example, a 61-year-old man told police that he was contacted by someone who falsely claimed to be from the Department of Justice. As part of the scam, the government imposters told him to wire transfer $33,000 to a Coinbase account. Coinbase is an online platform, which promises that you can buy and sell crypto in "less than 3 minutes." After transferring the money, the victim was contacted again and told he needed to transfer any remaining money he had to protect it. The man did not send any more money. It's another reminder, Hancock said, that scammers impersonate government agencies and brand names we trust. But no legitimate federal agency or business, he said, is going to contact you and demand that money be transferred or paid immediately by cryptocurrency, cash or other methods. "We are still seeing some gift card scams," Hancock said, "but currently bitcoin or other electronic payments seem to be happening more than gift card scams." His advice: Do not purchase bitcoin or transfer money via other means to pay a bill or handle a problem. "Please do your research and contact whatever company these people are claiming to be from directly to confirm they are, in fact, employees," Hancock said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As cryptocurrency makes strides toward real-world spending accessibility, payment card and security solutions provider CompoSecure announced the integration of its Arculus Cold Storage Wallet with MoneyGram Access. The move lets users convert physical cash to digital USDC stablecoins and withdraw cash at MoneyGram locations worldwide, according to a Monday (April 21) press release. Users can also withdraw local currency from their digital USDC holdings at over 440,000 MoneyGram retail locations across more than 200 countries and territories, the release said. Adam Lowe, chief product and innovation officer at CompoSecure and Arculus, said this could be particularly appealing to those who lack access to traditional banking services. “This integration enables people to convert physical cash into digital dollars on the highly performant Stellar blockchain and store those digital dollars securely, giving them complete autonomy and control over their assets.” “Arculus is making it possible to spend stablecoins with a simple tap just like any other payment card. This is the kind of utility that drives real-world adoption and demonstrates how everyday purchases can be made easy, accessible, and secure on Stellar,” Stellar Development Foundation CEO Denelle Dixon said in the release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto analyst Incognito has predicted that the Ethereum price could soon rally to as high as $2,700. This bullish prediction comes despite ETH's underperformance so far, with the altcoin's market share already dropping to new lows. Ethereum Price Could Rally To $2,700 As Wyckoff Accumulation Nears In a TradingView post, Incognito predicted that the Ethereum price could witness a big move to $2,700 with the Wyckoff accumulation almost over. The Ethereum price is likely to reach new local highs if Bitcoin can sustain this bullish momentum, given their positive correlation. In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez remarked that this week would be big for ETH as the TD Sequential just flashed a buy signal, hinting at a potential shift in momentum. The leading altcoin could face significant selling pressure at that range, as 12.62 million addresses bought 68.63 million ETH around that range. In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that the Ethereum price has already bottomed or may be bottoming out. He revealed that the leading altcoin is progressing within a giant ascending channel on the macro chart. Crypto analyst Hardy also echoed a similar sentiment, suggesting that the Ethereum price has already reached its bottom. He noted that ETH's weekly candle close was bullish and a good indicator of a potential reversal at the key support level around its current price. Ethereum price reclaiming the $4,000 level could pave the way for a rally to a new all-time high (ATH). Crypto analyst Crypto Patel predicted that ETH could reach between $6,000 and $8,000 by the end of the year. Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The SEC under US President Donald Trump announced it would closie its investigation of Uniswap and lawsuit against Consensys in February, roughly a month after the donations. According to FEC filings made public on April 20 by the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams donated more than $245,000, Solana Labs donated $1 million, and software firm Consensys sent $100,000 in January to support the then-president-elect's inauguration. Many major crypto firms had previously announced their support of Trump through donations to the inaugural fund, including Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Kraken, Ondo Finance, and Robinhood. Since Trump took office on Jan. 20 and appointed Mark Uyeda as acting chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the agency has dropped multiple investigations and enforcement actions against crypto firms, including those that donated to the president's 2024 campaign or inauguration fund. Trump's memecoin, launched on Jan. 17 on the Solana blockchain — along with his wife Melania's, which was available a few days later — has many in the crypto industry and members of Congress voicing concern over conflicts of interest potentially arising from the president appearing to capitalizing on his position. In addition to the Consensys case, the SEC said it intended to drop enforcement actions or investigations into Ripple, Kraken, Robinhood Crypto and Coinbase. Related: Trump's next crypto play will be Monopoly-style game — Report The 2024 US election cycle saw crypto-backed political action committees (PACs) spending more than $131 million to influence races in crucial congressional districts. The Fairshake PAC has already said it had more than $100 million available, in part from contributions from Coinbase and Ripple, to spend on the 2026 midterms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto ETF issuers are jumping on every opportunity, hoping to take advantage of a more crypto-friendly SEC. This year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will have its hands full with ETF applications. On Monday, April 21, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that 72 crypto exchange-traded funds are currently waiting for approval. Due to the number of these filings, Balchunas predicted a “wild year” for crypto. At the same time, Litecoin and Dogecoin (DOGE) were tied in third place, with three prospective issuers. Both of these tokens benefit from their decentralization, while Doge also gained mainstream attention thanks to its association with Elon Musk. ETFs are becoming a key narrative for crypto adoption as they offer an easier way for both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to digital assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have created CHASER, a new blockchain-based incentive system that makes mobile crowdsensing easier and safer. However, traditional systems often face problems with privacy, data security, and too much centralized control. If that single cashier gets overwhelmed or compromised, the entire operation can halt. In this setup, smart contracts work like automated, unbiased cashiers that handle transactions fairly, privately, and without slowdowns. CHASER stands out because it promotes high user participation by ensuring fairness and transparency. It protects user identities with advanced encryption methods, keeping personal data safe. This results in a more reliable and efficient data collection process that can benefit many areas, from urban planning to environmental monitoring. “CHASER is more than just a new system—it's a transformative leap that ensures every participant's contribution is valued and securely managed,” says Prof. Yuan Luo, the lead researcher. The research shows that CHASER benefits all participants and boosts overall social welfare. CHASER uses strong anonymity and data protection measures to prevent misuse of sensitive information, and it consistently achieves a task completion rate above 80%, even on a large scale, proving its reliability. Seamless Automation: Harnessing Blockchain and zk-SNARK for Swift, Secure Transactions The researchers implemented smart contracts within a blockchain framework to automatically manage tasks, payments, and verifications. Additionally, CHASER uses a unique cryptographic method known as zk-SNARK, which allows for quick transaction verification while keeping users anonymous. Overall, the study marks a significant step in developing decentralized systems that balance user incentives, data protection, and operational efficiency—a key milestone in applying blockchain technology to everyday challenges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>STOCK OF THE DAY: Why This Big Retailer Is Dodging Tariff Trouble The 10-year Treasury yield climbed, as government bond investors demand a higher return. Meanwhile, gold and bitcoin are shining as investors shun U.S. financial assets. The financial market turbulence unleashed by President Donald Trump's trade policies, which already forced him to suspend reciprocal tariffs north of 10% for 90 days, may prove to be the Achilles' heel that compels a more fundamental retreat. It also is highlighting the internal contradictions of Trump's policies, including his desire to protect the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency, while erecting a wall of tariffs that keeps both global trade and capital at bay. The 10-year Treasury yield rose four basis points to 4.37%. That's when investors would normally gravitate to the dollar and Treasuries, which move in the opposite direction of Treasury yields. Practically speaking, the economic drag from a falling S&P 500 will be compounded because higher longer-term Treasury yields raise borrowing costs for mortgages and auto loans. That's how much more foreigners hold in U.S. financial assets than overseas positions held by Americans. Trump has bemoaned that $26 trillion figure as a curse. He expects his "medicine" of Trump tariffs to create a U.S. manufacturing boom and shrink the trade gap. But his plan lacks a short-term bridge to get from here to there without risking a financial market drubbing that compounds the hit from tariffs. Many of the factors that contributed to U.S. financial market outperformance, attracting foreign funds, are suddenly under threat. The gold futures price surged 3.25% to a record $3,437 per ounce on Monday. Gold got a further lift after Trump renewed his attack of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, demanding "preemptive cuts" in interest rates to stave off economic weakness. Powell has thus far taken a cautious line on further rate cuts amid concern about the inflationary impact of Trump tariffs. Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM) rose 1.7% Monday, hitting a fresh high. Strategy (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, popped 1.1%, off morning highs. The S&P 500 is slumping 2.4%, adding to losses after Trump attacked Powell as a "major loser." Through Thursday, the S&P 500 was 14% below its Feb. 19 all-time closing high, but up 6% from its 2025 closing low on April 8, before Trump's delay of reciprocal tariffs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and crypto prices are treading water after U.S. president Donald Trump's trade war sparked market chaos that's threatening to spiral into a full-blown “U.S. Now, as billionaire Ray Dalio warns the U.S. is teetering on the verge of a financial crisis and recession that could be worse than 2008, the White House has confirmed Trump is exploring whether he can fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell—something that could trigger an “apocalyptic scenario" for markets. Last month, influential Democratic Party senator Elizabeth Warren said Trump could try to fire Powell, ominously warning, “nobody is safe.” “Overall, it would almost be like an apocalyptic scenario for the market.” 04/21 update: The bitcoin price has shot higher after U.S. president Donald Trump doubled down on his calls for immediate, “preemptive” interest rate cuts, suggesting Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell surprised markets with September's rate cut in order to help the Democratic Party in November's election. “'Preemptive cuts' in interest rates are being called for by many,” Trump posted to his Truth Social account. substantially lower, and most other ‘things' trending down, there is virtually no inflation," Trump wrote. "With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a slowing of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, now,” Trump wrote, adding Europe has “already 'lowered' seven times.” Stock markets have opened lower on Wall Street, led by Nasdaq and tech company declines, while the U.S. dollar has hit fresh multi-year lows against other major currencies. “Bitcoin and gold are surging in tandem this morning as the market digests yet another shock move from the U.S. president Donald Trump—this time, an apparent outright threat to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell,” Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. The bitcoin price has diverged from gold, which has rocketed to all-time highs as traders flee to the traditional safe haven, though some have predicted bitcoin will ultimately benefit and begin trading as “digital gold.” “Powell continues to sit on the fence with the ‘we'll wait and see' approach because he still believes tariffs will lead to higher inflation,” bitcoin and crypto investor Lark Davis wrote in his Wealth Mastery newsletter. "Only time will tell but firing Powell risks bringing even more uncertainty to markets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, you have one significant problem: gaining buy-in from the mainstream market. Despite the significant growth the crypto and Web3 space has experienced in recent years, it remains a relatively fringe industry. That means that unless your solution is very straightforward, most non-natives will be scratching their heads at your company, wondering why they should care. The first mistake many blockchain companies make (and most traditional businesses, for that matter) is assuming everyone cares about the same things they do. Blockchain natives are well-acquainted with terms like “decentralization,” “immutability,” and “trustless systems.” They know that these concepts represent potentially revolutionary improvements to traditional systems. Mainstream audiences and everyday people not involved in the Web3 space don't wake up thinking about consensus mechanisms. Because of this, you need to create two distinct communication approaches: For blockchain natives, it is essential to highlight technical innovations, network effects, and protocol improvements. These informed audiences appreciate the “how” of your solution. For mainstream markets, it's best to focus on the tangible benefits that your solution provides. The truth is that most people don't care HOW things work. The vast majority of people are unaware of (and uninterested in) how refrigeration technology works, but they appreciate having fresh food that lasts longer and cool beverages. That's exactly how you need to approach blockchain marketing with mainstream audiences. They don't need to understand distributed consensus to appreciate that their financial information is safer and cannot be tampered with. This approach is practical because it directly addresses what people truly care about in their daily lives. When you translate technical features into real-world benefits, you're speaking a language everyone understands: “What's in it for me?” The main point to keep in mind here is that this benefit-focused communication doesn't need to diminish your amazing technology. This is how you overcome the blank stares and start generating genuine interest from non-blockchain enthusiasts. For better or worse, that means that marketing often becomes an afterthought, something you'll get to “once the product is perfect.” But even the most revolutionary and innovative technology won't sell itself, especially when it's complex. Your existing team might also lack experience reaching mainstream audiences and marketing products. This is where partnering with a blockchain PR company can help to bridge the gap between your technical expertise and the communication needs of broader markets. A good blockchain PR firm won't just blast out press releases into the void and call it a day. They will gain a deep understanding of your value proposition and help craft tailored messaging approaches for different audiences. This allows you to focus on what you do best without worrying that your crypto public relations approach is being neglected. After all, if you want to find success, you need to be pushing forward with both sides of that coin at the same time. If you're creating a decentralized finance application, don't start by explaining smart contracts; instead, begin by defining the underlying concepts. Instead, start by connecting to familiar financial concepts that everybody will understand. If you're developing a supply chain solution, connect it to consumer concerns about product authenticity: “Have you ever wondered if that expensive product is really authentic? Our system gives you a complete, tamper-proof history from factory to store.” Lastly, it is essential to be honest about the image problem that mainstream audiences may have with cryptocurrency. Your potential customers have likely seen headlines about hacks, scams, market volatility, and environmental concerns. They've almost certainly heard stories from friends who lost money in crypto investments, struggled with complicated wallet setups, or have unfortunately been hacked. Many blockchain companies make the mistake of ignoring or dismissing these concerns as misunderstandings. But that's precisely the wrong way to go about it. As a flag bearer for the blockchain space, it is in your best interest to tackle these perceptions directly. If someone asks about security, don't just say “blockchain is secure” – explain specifically how your solution protects users in language they understand. If they worry about environmental impact, be honest about your energy usage and any steps you're taking to minimize it. It shows you respect your audience's intelligence and concerns. What they do care about is whether your solution improves their lives in some meaningful way. Does it solve a problem they actually have? They'll be the ones who successfully translate their technical achievements into benefits that resonate with everyday people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum L2 Base Launchpad Zora Announces TGE Amid Jesse Pollak 'Content Coin' Campaign Zora, a social media platform that automatically turns every post into a token on Coinbase's Base chain, is launching its own token on Wednesday. This all began on Wednesday last week, when Base's official X account created a token on Zora called Base is for everyone which soared to a $16.9 million market cap then crashed 92% to $1.3 million within two hours. It would later hit a new all-time high then plummet again. Put simply, Pollak says that content coins are a way to revolutionize the social media economy by paying creators fees—a solution he says that fixes the problem of platforms not properly rewarding creators. His thoughts have now become Base's official stance on the matter. Either way, according to Dune data, Zora activity exploded with daily traders spiking 601% from 40,638 the day before the campaign started to its all-time high on Sunday of 284,931. Throughout this period, Pollak continued to wave the flag for the content coin movement as he posted on social media, went on a press tour, and continued buying tokens. That's why on Sunday when Zora announced its token would launch on April 23, with its second snapshot capturing much of this newfound hype, many onlookers thought the timing was suspicious. “I'm sure it is a coincidence that Zora is [launching its token] less than a week after the ‘coin everything' hard shill campaign,” pseudonymous crypto trader IcoBeast posted on X, formerly Twitter. But Pollak refutes this, claiming that it was a coincidence after all. “The Zora team didn't know we were coining anything until after it happened. Speculation intensified when it was found out via CryptoRank that Coinbase took part in at least two funding rounds totalling $52 million, although exactly how much Coinbase invested remains unclear. “Base is for everyone was actually just a marketing stunt to pump a token they invested into lmao,” crypto gaming content creator Jesus Martinez posted on X. Neither Pollak, Base, nor Coinbase responded to Decrypt's request for comment. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>STAFFORDSHIRE, England, April  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Futurum Gaming has announced the official launch of its debut Web3 title, Race to Infinity, alongside the minting of its Genesis NFT collection and the forthcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) slated for Q2 2025. Designed in collaboration with educational innovator Begenio, it turns curriculum-aligned mathematics into a mentally demanding, strategy-driven experience. “Our goal is to create an ecosystem where learning is seamlessly integrated into the gaming experience,” said Martin Hugo, Project Leader at Futurum Gaming. Traditional learning environments struggle to keep pace with the attention economy. Static lessons, rigid structures, and minimal feedback loops leave many students disengaged. It also redefines the role of assessment by offering real-time feedback and tokenized recognition. Tailored for adult learners, this iteration introduces philosophical puzzles, applied math, and real-world logic, wrapped in a competitive game structure that rewards mental agility with token incentives. NFT, these tokenized assets, function as playable in-game characters and gateways to exclusive digital privileges. Paddles come in four rarity tiers (each represented by a different character), each offering ascending levels of staking benefits and competitive edge. Beyond gameplay, they are fully tradable across secondary markets, introducing collector value and market liquidity into the educational space. The FTRM token will act as the system's fuel, enabling in-game transactions, NFT upgrades, reward mechanisms, and participation in DAO governance. This introduces an economy of learning, where intellectual progression finds reward in tangible assets. “We're also in discussions with SKALE (SKL) to explore complementary infrastructure support that prioritizes interoperability. Our goal is to build a platform that's frictionless, adaptable, and enduring.” The broader architecture supporting this initiative is Futurum Group, an ecosystem builder that backs high-impact projects across education, AI, and decentralized technologies. “We are designing environments where learning isn't a byproduct; it's the product. And we're ensuring that those environments have economic gravity.” The platform's roadmap includes new content releases, deeper integration of community-driven features, and a reward structure that evolves alongside user engagement. The next phase will also see the seamless integration of Immutable's Passport, creating a frictionless onboarding journey for gamers regardless of their familiarity with crypto technologies. Race to Infinity anchors all of these ambitions in one accessible, well-engineered experience. It is, at once, a game, a learning tool, and an invitation to participate in an economy that values intellectual agility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On April 21, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou revealed that around $400 million, around 27.6% of the $1.4 billion in stolen Ethereum, can no longer be traced. This represents a sharp increase from March, when only 7.59% of the missing assets were untraceable. Zhou explained that the surge in untraceable funds stems from using crypto mixers and decentralized cross-chain services. According to him, Wasabi Mixer, a service known for its anonymity features, was used to launder 944 BTC, worth over $90 million. Meanwhile, Thorchain, a decentralized cross-chain platform, facilitated the swap of 531 BTC (equivalent to 18,206 ETH) into Ethereum. After passing through Wasabi, smaller amounts of the crypto were funneled through other privacy-focused platforms, including CryptoMixer, Tornado Cash, and Railgun. The assets were then moved across various crypto platforms like eXch, Lombard, LiFi, Stargate, and SunSwap. Zhou explained that these platforms enabled the attackers to shift assets across multiple blockchains before converting them into fiat via peer-to-peer and over-the-counter exchanges. “[The Bybit] hackers are dumping stolen funds through OTC channels. Our customers in multiple countries or regions have reported relevant cases to us.” Despite the growing portion of untraceable funds, Bybit maintains that most stolen assets remain visible on-chain. Zhou stated that 68.57% of the stolen Ethereum can still be tracked, while only 3.84% of the funds have been frozen. The Bybit CEO pointed out that roughly 343,000 ETH (worth over $960 million) have been converted into about 10,000 BTC and scattered across nearly 36,000 wallets.

The most recent withdrawal was 1,897 ETH, or about $3 million, 10 hours ago. These significant fluctuations imply that powerful investors are lining up for a possible Ethereum rally. The breakout supports the notion that a local trend reversal is gaining momentum, especially when combined with a discernible increase in trading volume. In addition to possibly opening a route toward the $2,200-$2,300 resistance zone, regaining this level would probably pique investor interest once more. This level may serve as a medium-term target for bulls and is also in line with the 100-day EMA. At the same time, the RSI has risen out of oversold territory and is now hovering around 39, suggesting that momentum is building without going overboard. The upward trend coincides with growing on-chain accumulation patterns, particularly by big organizations that have a history of outpacing fluctuations in the market. The ongoing removal of Ethereum from exchanges suggests that there is less short-term sell pressure and that investors are confident in Ethereum's long-term prospects. This whale behavior, whether it be for staking, holding or DeFi-related activity, foreshadows marketwide optimism and might be a trigger for Ethereum's reversal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Circle, the firm behind the $60 billion USDC stablecoin, is launching a new payments and cross border remittance network on Tuesday — the company's “next product move” — from its plush New York City headquarters, high on the 87th Floor of One World Trade Center. The launch event is aimed at banks, fintechs, payment service providers, remittance providers and USDC strategic partners. It will feature Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire sharing his vision for the stablecoin giant's next move within the payments space, according to an invite seen by CoinDesk. It makes sense then that Circle — a firm that has successfully pivoted during its years in the crypto space — should look to consolidate its position and return to its roots as a payments company. “Circle is launching a payments network that is initially targeting remittances but is ultimately aiming to rival Mastercard and Visa," said a person familiar with the plans. Stablecoins have reached an adoption level where the technology could disrupt global money transfers in a way similar to WhatsApp and international calls, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz said in recent report. In a recent interview, crypto custody tech specialists Fireblocks pointed to billions being moved around by payments services providers doing things like cross border payments using stablecoins like USDC and USDT. Circle did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thus marking a strategic turning point for Europe in the face of digital assets. The ECB has considered three levels of adoption: low, medium, and high. In the most limited scenario, 15 billion euros worth of banknotes would be replaced. In the case of massive adoption, this figure would rise to 256 billion euros. ECB board member Piero Cipollone considers this project a matter of strategic sovereignty. The ECB also warns against risks related to technological dependency on this new currency. Scheduled for October 2025, the digital euro represents much more than a simple monetary innovation: it is a structural change that could redefine how Europeans use and store their money. Between digital sovereignty, geopolitical competition, and banking transformation, Europe seems determined to move forward on the path of CBDCs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's (BTC) price broke above its key resistance level after facing multiple rejections around it the previous week. Bitcoin price has faced multiple rejections around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 since April 13. At Monday's start of this week, BTC finally broke above the $87,000 resistance level. A successful close above this level could extend an additional rally to test its March 2 high of $95,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 57, indicating bullish momentum, as it is positioned above its neutral level of 50. However, if BTC declines, it could find support around its key level of $85,000. On the other hand, if ETH continues its correction, it could extend the losses to retest its daily support level at $1,449. XRP faced rejection around the daily level of $2.23 on April 13 and declined 3.75% last week. If XRP breaks and closes above $2.23, it could extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50 before $3.00. Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Since the military coup in 2021, various armed opposition groups, fragmented ethnically and geographically, have come together to unseat the Tatmadaw – Myanmar's military – from power. Their stated aim is to establish a democratic federal National Unity Government (NUG) in its place. Right: Opposition weapons, military equipment and ammunition in eastern Myanmar. Users from both within Myanmar and abroad can make payments or donations to each other in DMMK or nUSDT through accounts on the NUGPay mobile app, using QR codes and @ handles – similar to other established payment systems in east and southeast Asia such as Alipay. Center: A NUGPay-initiated fundraiser for opposition fighters that has raised over $23,000. Right: A NUGPay Goodwill Fund set up after the devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake in March 2025. Public block explorers suggest that DMMK transaction volumes have reached 2.3 trillion as of March 2025, worth almost half a billion dollars at current black market rates. However, both NUGPay and publicly accessible blockchain data suggest that the app has around 38,000 accounts – indicating that wider usage among the general population is limited. The tracing of blockchain-based CBDCs is a major step for the blockchain analytics industry as over 100 countries are actively researching, developing or piloting their own CBDC projects to make international trade and retail payments more efficient. Furthermore, Elliptic has identified close to 150 People's Defence Forces (PDFs), military fundraisers and pro-opposition diaspora groups seeking donations through NUGPay. NUGPay fundraisers of two armed opposition groups (left, middle) and a raffle fundraiser (right). You can read our earlier coverage about how the DMMK has been used to bypass aid restrictions in response to the March 2025 earthquake here. AI-generated campaign posters, cat memes, cartoons and even a youth song contest have been used to collect DMMK. Donors of notable sums are frequently rewarded with certificates in their name, displayed proudly on the recipient organization's social media page. Our analysis also reveals that DMMK and nUSDT donations have remained largely consistent over time, even though there is a slight downward trend between late 2023 and 2025. Among them are food kitchens, overseas concerts, medical networks and women's organizations. Many of them have in turn forwarded donations to groups based on the ground. Armed groups on the ground have predominantly called for donations to purchase military equipment and food supplies. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been in particularly high demand, with some fundraisers existing with the sole purpose of procuring drones for the front lines. Some armed groups have also financed the creation of their own 3D printed weapons and drones. Tracing the financial aspect of this war is also important for other reasons. Many armed groups, including the above-mentioned KNDF, operate in regions with burgeoning industrialized fraud, so-called “pig butchering” and labor trafficking activity. Some of these compounds, such as the notorious KK Park, function as entire towns in themselves with a range of facilities for forced workers and organized criminals. Various armed and political Karenni groups have been affiliated in the past with these compounds. For instance, local media reported in 2023 that the opposition-aligned Karen National Union was linked to contracts and leases involving KK Park in Karen State. China's traditional backing for the Junta has fuelled anti-Chinese propaganda by opposition groups. Though such cases do not yet show any association with DMMK transactions, our ability to trace them nevertheless provides an additional level of pre-emptive visibility should that situation ever change. Elliptic Investigator shows numerous opposition-aligned groups in Karen and Shan states, known hotbeds of organized industrialized scam activity. The Union Parliament in exile also owns a public NUGPay wallet. One week after the March 2025 earthquake, a special Goodwill Fund set up by NUGPay itself received $20,000. In states and regions almost completely under control of opposition forces, some townships have started soliciting DMMK donations to begin setting up new local layers of government. Elliptic has observed this practice predominantly in Chin State, where groups such as the Chin Defence Force have consistently had the upper hand for some time. To aid areas where NUGPay use is scarce, Dr. Tu Hkawng, the NUG Union Minister of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation, has publicized his NUGPay wallet for donations to armed groups in Kachin State – suggesting that some entities there may have never used NUGPay before. The below map shows the amount and distribution of funds received by entities where we have been able to determine their specific geographic areas of operation. Presumably, none are being developed with financing conflict in mind. You can read more about CBDCs at Elliptic's knowledge hub. Noting that prevention is the best cure, we consistently monitor unique and emerging crypto use cases to ensure that any potential compliance or sanctions risks are pre-emptively addressed. As of 2025, our tools are able to screen and trace over 50 blockchains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trading cryptocurrency was just a bit of fun for Tzoni Raykov, but losing $1,500 worth to an administrative error has left him with serious concerns about his treatment by the industry. The oil engineer has held an account with Revolut for several years - using its app to split bills with friends after going out for dinner or drinks. They would pay each other using traditional currency, like the pound sterling or US dollar. But after seeing the e-money firm advertise its cryptocurrency services, he decided to give it a try. What Tzoni thought would be a straightforward transfer of cryptocurrency coins has left the Bulgarian national angry and out of pocket. His experience highlights some of the frustrations people have had using cryptocurrency where many of the customer safeguards which underpin standard online banking transactions, some mandated by law, do not apply. While the cryptocurrency market is dominated by Bitcoin, there is a plethora of other digital currencies, including USDC - which Tzoni had already amassed in a separate crypto account. As a precaution - which Revolut suggests doing - he first sent 10 of the coins, worth $10. It was a success and the funds were credited to his Revolut account. Tzoni says the problem occurred because Revolut's deposit instructions were unclear. In his first, successful, deposit Tzoni selected one called "Polygon PoS". He thought it would work just as well but says instead it caused the coins to be converted into USDC.e - a different cryptocurrency. After seeing his Revolut account had not been credited with the 1,500 coins, Tzoni contacted the Revolut support team. In another, he was told: "The app currently specifies 'Polygon' without differentiating between standard and bridged options. I'll note your feedback for future improvements." When approached by BBC News about this case, Revolut gave a different answer. The deposit failure was "not because the network itself had 'converted' the token", it said, without explaining why its support team had suggested to Tzoni that it was. It said: "As is standard industry practice due to the significant technical challenges involved in supporting every combination of token and chain, the recovery of these unsupported assets does not sit within Revolut's scope." To Tzoni's mind, this isn't acceptable treatment from a company of Revolut's size and reputation, which handles normal banking deposits as well as cryptocurrency, stocks and commodities. Revolut says it has 10 million users in the UK while last year it was granted a provisional banking licence, paving the way for it to become a fully fledged UK bank. When using a High Street bank, a mistaken transfer of traditional currency would usually be resolved with the money being reverted back to the customer. There is no such equivalent in the cryptocurrency industry. After contacting Revolut several times in recent weeks, Tzoni has been told the coins are effectively lost. "It is ridiculous that they can behave like this." Since then it has fallen by $1.1tn, according to tracking website CoinGecko. Government policies in the US and other countries are also changing to favour the cryptocurrency industry, even though it has suffered several scandals. FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency firms, went bankrupt in 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried, its chief executive, was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year for defrauding customers of billions of dollars. Investigators also found FTX was using QuickBooks, a popular accounting software designed for individuals and small businesses, to manage the money. John Ray III, a lawyer tasked with recovering funds from FTX for defrauded customers, told a bankruptcy court: "Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here." He later told a congressional hearing: "Nothing against QuickBooks. A couple of months ago Bybit, the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange by some estimates, was tricked out of $1.5bn worth of coins by hackers thought to be working for North Korea. The firm had been using Safe, a free digital storage software popular with individuals who want to store cryptocurrency on their own devices, as part of their business operations. Following the theft, Bybit's chief executive said they "should have upgraded and moved away from Safe" earlier. One of the problems with cryptocurrency firms, says Prof Mark Button, who researches cybercrime, is they can grow very quickly, which means they don't always keep up with the accounting and security challenges of managing so much money. "For me it illustrates that if we are going to be serious about cryptocurrencies in the future… there needs to be some kind of regulation." In Tzoni's case, it might have been easier for him to get his cryptocurrency back or be compensated if there were laws stating what firms need to do if they are sent a coin they don't handle.

Mykhailo Tiutin is chief technology officer at AMLBot, a company that analyses how risky cryptocurrency transactions are. Their service runs checks similar to those supported by banks, where details for a transfer, such as the account holder's name, sort code and account number, are verified. He says cryptocurrency is safe enough for the average person to use but that they should be careful about which products and services they choose. "You have to do your own research," he told us. Aleksej Besciokov is wanted by the US for allegedly laundering money and violating sanctions. Hackers from the infamous Lazarus Group are in a cat-and-mouse game to launder their stolen funds from the ByBit heist.</p>
