                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) have detected a ring-shaped molecule with 13 atoms, including sulfur, in deep space for the first time. The team behind the discovery of 2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-thione (C₆H₆S) said finding such a complex molecule in interstellar space “closes a critical gap” between previous detections of simpler molecules and the complex building blocks of organic life, which have been discovered in comets and meteorites. Often described by researchers as the “building blocks of life,” the discovery of these organic compounds has hinted that life's ingredients were carried to Earth aboard comets and meteors. Still, the organic molecules observed in earlier studies were simpler, with only a handful of atoms. When these observations detect sulfur-containing compounds in interstellar space, they typically involve six or fewer molecules. Because sulfur is a key life ingredient, the lack of complex molecules in space left a gap in knowledge about the chemistry of life on Earth and how those molecules may affect the possibility of extraterrestrial life. “Large, complex sulfur-containing molecules were expected, particularly due to sulfur's essential role in proteins and enzymes, yet these larger molecules had remained elusive,” the MPE researchers explained. Further analysis revealed that the newly discovered C₆H₆S is “structurally related” to molecules previously identified in an extraterrestrial sample. Strange “Supermazes” Are Stretching Our Understanding of Black Holes Beyond General Relativity When they compared this fingerprint with data collected by the Yebes 40m and IRAM 30m radio telescopes in Spain, they found a chemical similarity, suggesting the new sulfur-containing molecule discovery could be a missing link in origin-of-life and extraterrestrial life studies. When discussing the potential implications of their discovery, the MPE team said their findings suggest more complex sulfur-bearing molecules are still out there waiting to be found. They also believe their finding supports the idea that the fundamental ingredients of life may have formed in interstellar space “long before Earth came into existence.” “This proves that the chemical groundwork for life begins long before stars form,”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stanford University's Dr Gary Nolan has lifted the lid on extraordinary research into unidentified aerial phenomena, revealing claims that CIA personnel suffered bizarre injuries described as 'their brains looked fried.' The revelations suggest that government scientists are investigating events that might involve unknown energy effects, raising questions about potential threats both on Earth and beyond. Dr Nolan, a leading expert in immunology and cellular biology, recounted an unsettling moment when CIA representatives approached him with medical scans. According to Nolan, MRIs and X-rays revealed brain damage in intelligence officers that could not easily be explained. 'Areas of their brains had just been dried,' he said, speculating that the injuries may have been caused by an energy weapon or an unknown electromagnetic effect. The Stanford scientist has spent decades developing techniques to analyse cellular and tissue samples in minute detail, allowing him to study anomalies from potential UAP exposure. Dr Nolan is also known for examining materials that might originate from non-human sources. His work demonstrates the rigour applied to investigating anomalous materials, combining advanced lab techniques with meticulous cross-disciplinary consultation. Nolan's team uses high-parameter mass cytometry and computational models to understand biological patterns, providing a scientific framework for distinguishing unusual injuries or materials from conventional explanations. Despite presenting medical data and potential evidence, Dr Nolan described significant resistance from CIA officials. We don't have anything like that,' he recalled them saying, highlighting the agency's reluctance to acknowledge phenomena outside conventional understanding. The research raises broader questions about the CIA's UAP investigations, including claims that energy effects were capable of disabling weapons systems or interfering with military hardware. Dr Nolan emphasised a disciplined scientific methodology in examining UAP-related injuries and materials. This approach allows him to build comprehensive models of human reactions to anomalous events, bridging data across disciplines such as immunology, genetics, and biophysics. By focusing on data and reproducible analysis, Nolan illustrates that studying UAPs and unusual injuries is not science fiction but a legitimate scientific endeavour with national security implications. In summary, Dr Gary Nolan's revelations expose a hidden dimension of CIA research into UAP phenomena, showing that personnel may have suffered severe neurological effects and that potential alien material is under serious investigation. His scientific approach underscores the need to study these events rigorously, blending biology, physics, and intelligence insights to confront one of the most mysterious challenges facing modern science and security.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Elda Cerrato — Transcend/Transport: Paintings 1965–1976" at Galerie Lelong is the late Italian Argentine artist's first New York show. The path to the first New York solo show for Elda Cerrato (1930–2023), now on view at Galerie Lelong, was a long and winding one. Born in Italy to Jewish parents, Cerrato was a child when her family fled fascism in Europe for South America. Authoritarianism continued to shape her life in adulthood, as Cerrato and her husband and son were forced to leave Argentina to escape persecution at the hands of the country's military junta in 1973. Her best friend was disappeared at that time,” Mary Sabbatino, vice president and partner of Galerie Lelong New York, said at a preview of the exhibition. Photo: by P. Roth, courtesy Galerie Lelong, New York. Living at various points during her career in São Paulo, Caracas, and Buenos Aires, Cerrato was widely celebrated in Latin America. Over 60 years, she had 30 solo shows, including at the Museo de Bellas Artes de Caracas and the Museo de las Américas in San Juan, and 150 group shows, largely in Argentina and Venezuela. The Argentine government honored Cerrato with the Premio Nacional a la Trayectoria Artística, or National Award for Artistic Career, in 2019.

But Sabbatino hopes to lift the artist out of obscurity in the U.S., an effort that started last fall with a solo presentation at New York's Independent 20th Century art fair, and builds on her inclusion in “Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960–1985,” the Hammer Museum's critically acclaimed show for 2017's “Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA.” There are Cerrato's “cosmovision” canvases from the 1960s, which are more abstract, biomorphic compositions done in oil paint, with organic-looking shapes and patterns. These were representations of the universe's underlying invisible energetic forces. Elda Cerrato, Transformación de la energía que ingresa en energía libre, Serie Entes Extraños.

He believed that humans live their lives as if hypnotized, but can awaken to a higher state to achieve their true purposes—a path of spiritual growth he called the Fourth Way. Photo courtesy of Galerie Lelong, New York. “Elda was very involved with consciousness, the idea of a divine which is not religious, but informs all of our interactions,” Sabbatino said. Before taking up the paintbrush, Cerrato studied biochemistry, and an interest in science permeated her work as an artist—but melded with spirituality. When she and her husband were teaching at the National University of Tucumán, in a remote region of Argentina, the faculty believed that they were seeing an alien presence.

Photo courtesy of Galerie Lelong, New York. “There were scientists, mathematicians, and every night, apparently, they had sightings of UFOs,” Cerrato's son, the filmmaker Luciano Zubillaga, told me. “I was too little, so I cannot actually say they were UFOs, but these were very rational people, and everybody witnessed it.” “Elda Cerrato — Transcend/Transport: Paintings 1965–1976” at Galerie Lelong, New York. Photo by Jon Cancro, courtesy of Galerie Lelong, New York. As a child, Zubillaga always knew there was something different about his mom compared to his friends' mothers. “She was a feminist,” he told me, noting that Cerrato also drew inspiration from the female body. But at the time, the estate had made a preliminary deal with a different gallery, and Sabbatino didn't want to interfere.

He told her to give it a year in the city, but home, at that time, was Caracas, and Cerrato felt she had to return. Zubillaga believes his mother would be happy with how her New York moment finally came together in the end: “I think she would take it as natural!” Elda Cerrato, Para una imagen del hombre V, Serie Para una imagen del hombre (For an Image of Man V, Image of Man Series), 1979–80.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"It's a whole new show for me," said Kristian Ventura when asked about his experience filming School Spirits Season 3 during an interview with Collider at Sundance 2026. Of the season's eight episodes, the first three were provided for review, and they were enough to appreciate that School Spirits is heading in a bold, new direction. The foundation of the previous seasons remains, including that teenage angst and coming-of-age sweetness, but it takes on a darker form, one that works admirably thus far. School Spirits Season 2 left us on the jaw-dropping cliffhanger of Maddie (Peyton List) returning to her physical body and Simon (Ventura) getting trapped in a red scar. The third season picks up right there, with Maddie navigating the repercussions of her disappearance in her home life and at school, while Simon takes up Maddie's mantle in the afterlife. It's the first overt role reversal of the season, but there are many more surprises to come, redefining everything we thought we knew about Split River High and its mysterious limbo. Many of the introduced ideas tread on familiar ground, including an ultra-strict authority figure summoned from the nightmares of every high school student, a classic Carrie bloodbath scene, or suspicions of malicious counterparts to our kind ghosts. But that's not to say the show doesn't incorporate these ideas seamlessly into the story; nothing feels forced, and its darker trajectory is cohesive. School Spirits previously teased the addition of Jennifer Tilly, who doesn't quite have a major role in the first three episodes of the season, but her brief on-screen appearances already demand our attention. Her character may begin as an archetype, but disturbing undercurrents to her behavior and demeanor are hopefully setting up the "seriously unhinged" revelation Tilly hints at during the same Sundance interview. The cast join us for an exclusive Q&A about the shows all-new dynamics, character journeys, and what fans can expect this season. Alongside its promising, cumulative darkness are the light-hearted coming-of-age components that make School Spirits the teenage romp that it is, though even these take on a more serious tone. More so than previously, grief, loss, and anxiety during adolescence become bigger themes in the show, where the supporting cast's backstories and identities are fleshed out in moving sequences, particularly Yuri (Cihang Ma) and Rhonda (Sarah Yarkin). While occasionally it can be emotionally overwhelming, there is usually a reprieve through dark humor or the utterly ridiculous, but fitting subplot two of the characters find themselves in — infiltrating a group of teenage mean girls is apparently just as daunting as escaping the afterlife. In many shows with expansive world-building, there is usually a make-or-break point where adding another layer atop an already complex system can either make it far too convoluted or stronger. It seems that School Spirits is reaching that point with its supernatural system, as the first three episodes set up numerous moving parts to its afterlife. Precise and clear storytelling makes the suspense in the atmosphere possible, and if previous seasons are anything to go by, there should be a decent payoff, though it's too soon to tell. As expected, that plays a huge role in Season 3, and the hospital becomes a staple set in the show, contributing to its pursuit of darker (and ironically enough, funnier) material. There are also a couple of new sets in the afterlife that are impressively creepy, truly signaling the series' tonal shift. Thus far, School Spirits is juggling its new rules, locations, and characters with a strong and clear direction, while still balancing these with the emotional texture that resides at the heart of the show. Maddie's interactions with her living friends are filtered through the strangeness of her disappearance and the unresolved issues they had before their communication was abruptly cut off. In Season 2, List's performance was divided between her roles as Maddie and Janet-Maddie, but here, her attention is wholly directed at the bizarre and grueling circumstances Maddie's reappearance has led to. Some of her strongest performances in the show are in these episodes, carried out with an unexpected grit that her character benefits from. Despite that, Simon's new situation and relationships offer a new set of stakes that lean more into the realm of horror than supernatural drama, making for a gripping viewing experience. In the first three episodes, School Spirits Season 3 is clearly gearing up for some kind of supernatural chaos, and its approach thus far has been effective. School Spirits Season 3 cleverly develops its mystery while flipping the script entirely. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

One of the only elements of that finale (available streaming now with a Peacock subscription and Amazon Prime subscription) that wasn't terribly divisive among fans was that Jim Beaver appeared one last time as Bobby in the afterlife. Bobby was a pivotal figure in Sam and Dean's lives before and after his death, and Beaver has opened up about his reaction to his character's demise as well as the one silver lining. While not a series regular from start to finish, Jim Beaver was one of the few Supernatural actors to appear in at least one episode of all fifteen seasons. I learned I would die from the showrunners Bob Singer (my character is named after him) and Sera Gamble, who said, ‘We're going to kill you, but you're coming back as a ghost.' Still, I was disappointed that instead of doing half of a season's episodes, I'd be lucky to do one or two. I can't blame Jim Beaver for being disappointed, especially since Bobby was killed in one of the less popular seasons by one of the least impressive big bads of the series. True to their word, Bob Singer and Sera Gamble brought his character back as a ghost just months after his death in the Season 7 midseason finale, and the actor also went on to portray a version of Bobby from an alternate world. Beaver would eventually be credited in 19 episodes after OG Bobby's death. “Death's Door” broke the usual format of Supernatural by delving into a series of flashbacks as Bobby's mind slowly died, with Steven Williams reprising his role as the late Rufus for Bobby's final bow. To the show's credit, keeping Bobby dead does make his passing in “Death's Door” pack a lot more of a punch than other deaths. I've lost count of how many times Dean was killed before Jensen Ackles performed the final demise, and Misha Collins had several options to choose from when he selected his favorite Castiel death… and that was when there were still several seasons left before the one that actually stuck! (Though it should be noted that he did experience one resurrection after being killed the first time in Season 5.) Jim Beaver was able to reprise his role one last time, although not in Supernatural. For now, you can always revisit all fifteen seasons of Supernatural on Peacock and/or Prime Video after leaving its longtime streaming home on Netflix in late 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The mystery of unidentified flying objects has long fascinated the public, sparking endless debates, documentaries and late-night speculation. Rogan delivered a blunt warning to UFO enthusiasts: unless aliens make a clear appearance, the fascination with unidentified flying objects may vanish. Speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience with comedian Tom Segura, the podcaster expressed disbelief that UFO news is not dominating headlines. For him, the lack of mainstream coverage signals a dangerous decline in public interest, one that could extinguish the UFO craze altogether. Rogan's frustration stems from a growing mistrust in mainstream media. This disconnect, he believes, risks killing the UFO phenomenon altogether. The media's cautious or dismissive approach, Rogan explained, undermines public engagement and leaves people craving proof. Until then, this is dying,' he warned. Segura chimed in, agreeing that audiences crave tangible evidence. The conversation painted a picture of a public ready to embrace extraordinary revelations, but left waiting for confirmation. Rogan suggested that without concrete sightings or government disclosure, the UFO craze is susceptible to fading into the background, eclipsed by celebrity gossip and political drama. He stressed that speculation and unverified reports no longer satisfy the public, particularly in an era of digital misinformation. 'People are losing trust in everything,' Rogan said. He framed this as a turning point for the UFO conversation, suggesting the next decade could see either a dramatic resurgence in interest or a complete collapse of the narrative. In Rogan's view, the stakes are high: without evidence, the mystery of UFOs risks becoming just another forgotten curiosity. As trust in media wanes, people are increasingly sceptical of official reports and scientific pronouncements. This skepticism makes it harder for UFO stories to gain traction. Rogan warned that even when compelling evidence emerges, a divided public may struggle to take it seriously. Rogan argued that the media must either embrace extraordinary stories responsibly or risk losing the public's attention entirely. In his words, 'Without trust, even the most incredible revelation is just noise.' Ultimately, Rogan's message is clear: speculation alone cannot sustain the UFO frenzy. As he told Segura, 'If aliens show up, everyone will pay attention. For those captivated by the unknown, Rogan's warning is a wake-up call.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A meme sparked by an odd conspiracy theory involving the Leviathan, sea beast of biblical legend, has risen on social media. Apparently, the gargantuan sea monster has been awakened from a long slumber. The world is a magical place for some social media users, and Leviathan-enthusiasts saw what they believed to be the creature in a weather map, the post pointing to a shape that resembles a great sea serpent. The last few years has seen fantastical conspiracy theories spread through the internet, cross-pollinating with strands of mythology, theology, digital folklore and ironic memes, resulting in increasingly unreal narratives. An archetypal sea monster, the Leviathan is said to be like a dragon, a serpent or a multi-headed Lovecraftian entity—any version will do, and in this case, theorists have settled on the sea serpent variant. While conspiracy theorists have chosen to take the Leviathan literally, the monster is commonly interpreted as a metaphor, representative of chaos and sin. Outside of the conspiratorial circle, screenshots were shared in disbelief across social media, sparking mockery and memes. On X, many commentators took a liking to the idea of a kaiju approaching U.S. shores, and expressed their support for the sea beast. One user even posted their favorite depiction of the Leviathan, which has taken many weird and wonderful forms over the centuries. The biblical story is about divine order defeating primordial chaos, as the Leviathan is destroyed by God, echoing similar legends across history, such as Thor slaying the World Serpent. Admittedly, that isn't nearly as much fun as the Leviathan waking up near Virginia.</p>

In addition to its regular exhibits, the center has educated nearly 75,000 people in glassmaking through classes, free demonstrations, exhibitions, school partnerships, artist residencies and community events including the popular monthly HOT Jam demonstrations. “My father was an encyclopedia salesman,” he says, “so I had access to a broad variety of images and concepts from A to Z which definitely impacted my style. I drew as a way to decode and communicate the hidden information I was receiving and seeing within my environment.” His current primary medium is acrylic on wood, and he works without preliminary sketches or visual references, preferring to create by following “internal instructions … a subtle voice guiding me toward new techniques or a particular color.” “Practices of Holding: Sibyls Shrine” on view Feb. 4-June 14, opening reception Feb. 4, 6-8 p.m. Curated by Jessica Gaynelle Moss, “Practices of Holding” honors ancestral and living matriarchs with an eclectic array of artwork by Elizabeth Burden, Tiara L.
