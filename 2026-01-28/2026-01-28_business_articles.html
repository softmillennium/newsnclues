                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The central bank announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, as was widely expected. The meeting follows weeks of political pressure from the Trump administration and a recently announced Department of Justice probe. Business Insider will be covering projections from economists, the Fed decision, and market moves all day. While he said it's not okay for him to respond to comments from political officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, he said it was the "most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history," so he felt it was appropriate to attend the oral arguments. He said he was "not going to expand" on his video statement on the DOJ investigation and did not confirm if the Fed has responded to grand jury subpoenas. Powell said he "didn't want to get into" his future at the central bank when asked about remaining on the FOMC through 2028. The Fed is focused on its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment, he said, and the US employment rate has seen "some signs of stabilization." He said that consumer sentiment is "resilient," though job gains have remained low, the housing sector is "weak" and the recent government shutdown weighed on economic activity. The economic situation is becoming more balanced, but there is still a decline in labor force growth due to low demand and declining immigration. The Fed may be holding rates steady, but the central bank did make a notable change to its economic picture this month. In Wednesday's news release, FOMC leaders removed the phrase "downside risks to employment rose in recent months," which has been included in almost every release from the past few months. The committee said that job gains remain low and inflation is still somewhat elevated, but removing the "downside risks to employment" phrase from the Fed's economic assessment is good news for job seekers. It means Powell and company see a labor market in recovery. Powell will begin the Fed's January press conference at 2:30 p.m. The central bank chair will then take questions from journalists. Powell's answers could foreshadow future monetary policy and plans for his final months at the Fed. Major indexes were flat after the Fed opted to keep interest rates unchanged. "Focus, naturally, now turns to Chair Powell's press conference," wrote Michael Brown, senior strategist at Pepperstone. "Powell will likely, again, note that the FFR is now within a reasonable range of estimates as to where the neutral rate may lie, though will probably steer well clear of any questions on his plans post-May, or on ongoing attempts to erode the Fed's policy independence."

"Powell will likely, again, note that the FFR is now within a reasonable range of estimates as to where the neutral rate may lie, though will probably steer well clear of any questions on his plans post-May, or on ongoing attempts to erode the Fed's policy independence." The committee has had a split on interest rates at every meeting since July — and this month is no different. Ten FOMC members, including Powell, voted in favor of the hold, but there were two dissents. Stephan Miran and Christopher Waller preferred a quarter-point cut. The Fed will hold its benchmark interest rate steady between 3.5 and 3.75%, in alignment with expectations. Higher interest rates can help curb rising prices, but still-high borrowing costs could push companies toward layoffs or hiring freezes over time. It's unlikely Americans will feel the impact of a single rate call, but sustained cuts or hikes can have an effect over time. The typically uniform Fed has been increasingly divided in its decisions. Recent Trump appointee Stephen Miran repeatedly voted for steeper rate cuts last year. Others, like Jeffrey R. Schmid, urged a more cautious stance. It's possible that January's rate call will be another split decision for the committee. Top contenders to succeed Powell include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder, Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett, and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is in charge of the process, though any nominees are likely to hit roadblocks in Congress over the DOJ probe. "The hope is that whoever takes Powell's role next will be similarly data driven and level headed," Elizabeth Renter, the senior economist at NerdWallet, said. "A Fed that is vulnerable to political pressure is one that will struggle to be effective at guiding economic stability." Trump has been vocal about his desire for lower interest rates, threatening to fire Powell and dubbing him with the moniker "Too Late." "I'm a smart voice and should be listened to," he said. Everyone could do, I think, a fantastic job," he said, continuing, "It's amazing how people change once they have the job. Stocks were steady ahead of the rate decision and Jerome Powell's press conference. Markets will be listening closely for updates from Powell on where he sees interest rates going through the rest of his term, but also any clues that could hint at what his successor might do. "Markets expect Chair Powell to end his leadership term without cutting rates again. They also believe that his successor will be similarly cautious, with heavy odds (+70 percent) that Fed Funds will be within 25 basis points of 3.0 percent in December 2027," wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, on Wednesday. Ten heads of various world banks released a letter defending Powell, as did a group of state-level treasurers and auditors.

"We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell," the letter from global bank leaders read. The Trump administration accused Fed Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud in August and attempted to fire her, though she has remained in her seat. Her case was heard by the Supreme Court last week, and several judges expressed disagreement with the White House. "Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve," said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee.

Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said it's challenging to know the extent to which tariffs have had an effect because there are other headwinds, such as supply chain and inventory issues. Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, said tariffs had some effect on goods inflation, but hadn't resulted in a massive surge.

Glen Smith, chief investment officer at GDS Wealth Management, said, "we expect just one rate cut for 2026, and while the timing of this next rate cut is debatable, it will likely come towards the second half of the year" with a new Fed chair. Fed members can look back at last year's inflation to inform their coming interest rate decision. This is historically low, but it comes alongside limited vacancies, low hiring rates, and a decline in the number of Americans quitting their jobs or changing roles compared to a few years ago. Daniel Zhao, the chief economist at Glassdoor, said last year's job market ended "with a fizzle rather than a bang." Economists and job-market experts told Business Insider that the job market was in a low-fire, low-hire environment, partly due to economic uncertainty and reduced demand after the pandemic recovery and the Great Resignation. It's likely Fed leaders will stick to the status quo in January, in hopes that steady rates will push inflation closer to their 2% goal. Affordability is a major concern for American households, as prices rise on housing, groceries, healthcare, and more. Powell has consistently prioritized price stability during his time as chair. The Fed is expected to cut rates at least once later this year, a move that could ease costs for borrowers and juice the job market. Powell's term as chair ends in May, but he's eligible to remain on the Fed committee until early 2028. It's rare for former chairs to stay on as governors, and Powell has not indicated his plans. But there's been some speculation from Wall Streeters that Trump's threats to the Fed could entice Powell to remain at the bank longer than expected. Powell's term as chair expires in May, and Trump is set to announce his next pick for the role in the coming weeks.

"If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none," North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said, adding that he will oppose any Trump nominees to the central bank until "this legal matter is fully resolved." With around 7.5 hours until the Fed's latest rate decision is announced, things are a bit of a mixed bag in financial markets on Wednesday. That's due in large part to its tech focus, with many of the biggest tech firms reporting earnings this week.

In Europe, where markets are open, stocks are a little lower, with the UK's FTSE 100 benchmark down 0.5%, and Germany's DAX falling 0.2%. Gold's record rally is continuing on Wednesday, with the precious metal extending its gain by another 3% to trade just under $5,300 per ounce. Silver is also higher, gaining 5.4% to trade at $111 per ounce.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla earnings are looming, and Wall Street's outlook is mixed as vehicle sales remain in a rut and the company's AI plans continue to take shape. Analysts said ahead of the Wednesday report that they see challenges ahead for Elon Musk's carmaker, including uncertain EV demand and unclear timelines for some of its major AI projects. While some firms are bullish on the robotaxi rollout expanding this year, others say the stock has largely priced in the bull case for AI and robotics, leaving little room for disappointment on either front. Chinese EV maker BYD sold more cars than Tesla last year — and it wasn't even close. The Shenzhen-based automaker delivered more than 2.26 million battery-electric cars to global consumers. Chinese EV maker BYD sold more cars than Tesla last year — and it wasn't even close. The Shenzhen-based automaker delivered more than 2.26 million battery-electric cars to global consumers. It's a 620,000-unit gap that didn't exist two years ago." In the auto industry, design refreshes typically trigger months of growing sales. For Tesla, however, sales have continued to slide. Tesla didn't hit any of those targets. It did, however, remove safety drivers from its vehicles in Austin this month. Tesla is planning to launch robotaxis in multiple US cities this year, and investors will be watching the earnings call closely for any updates. Analysts at JPMorgan lowered their EPS estimate for Tesla to $0.43 from $0.48 after the carmaker missed its fourth-quarter delivery target. Tesla recently reported a 16% year-over-year drop in deliveries for the fourth quarter. "The -16% y/y decline in 4Q25 deliveries is the worst ever for Tesla," analysts wrote in a recent client note, adding that Tesla's stock price looked "increasingly divorced" from the company's "rapidly declining earnings outlook."

The bank reiterated its "underweight" rating on the stock but lifted its price target to $130 a share, citing updated growth estimates for Tesla's car business. The price target implies 70% downside from Tesla's current levels. Still, the automaker's stock has jumped to near record highs, boosted by optimism around self-driving and AI. "The market doesn't seem to place much emphasis on Tesla's current automotive business, even as deliveries are declining," Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar who closely monitors Tesla, told Business Insider. But returns for those projects may not be realized in the near future, UBS analysts said. "So in our view, given a declining valuation for TSLA's EV business, the market is already assigning a higher and higher value to the AI ventures.

TD Cowen is bullish on Meta ahead of its Wednesday earnings report, predicting that generative AI tools will continue to support growth in its advertising business. Analyst John Blackedge said he believes ad growth will help bolster its high capex spending.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve has not yet complied with grand jury subpoenas issued as part of a criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell by federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Wednesday. The probe of Powell is continuing, according to that person, who spoke hours before the Fed is set to reveal whether it will cut interest rates for the fourth time in recent months. CNBC has requested comment from the Fed and from the Department of Justice. Powell on Jan. 11 said that he was under criminal investigation. Powell said on Jan. 11 that the DOJ days earlier served the Fed "with grand jury subpoenas threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June" about the central banks $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters. Powell also said that the investigation resulted from frustration by President Donald Trump over the Fed's refusal to cut interest rates as quickly and as much as the president wanted last year. "The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President," Powell said in a video statement tweeted by the Fed's X account.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's what analysts polled by LSEG are expecting: Meta spent a large chunk of 2025 overhauling its AI unit, including investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI to land the startup's founder, Alexandr Wang, and several of his colleagues. Wang oversees Meta's top-tier TBD unit that is tasked with developing powerful AI models. The company set up TBD after its Llama 4 model launched to tepid response from developers last spring. Meta has been testing a new frontier model and Llama successor code-named Avocado, and plans to release it during the first half of the year, CNBC reported. Underpinning Meta's AI efforts has been a major data center build-out while rivals like OpenAI and Alphabet do the same. Meta on Tuesday said it committed to paying glass manufacturing giant Corning up to $6 billion through 2030 for fiber-optic cable in its AI data centers. Although investors have been spooked by Meta's costly artificial intelligence investments, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has characterized the moves as necessary given AI's rapid pace of development. "Being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over, over some period," Zuckerberg told analysts in October. Wall Street expects fourth-quarter daily active people to come in at 3.58 billion. Investors will also be monitoring what Zuckerberg has to say about the company's Reality Labs unit, which builds the virtual reality, augmented reality and wearable technology intended to power the so-called metaverse. Earlier this month, Meta laid off more than 1,000 Reality Labs employees who worked on VR-related initiatives, including internal studios, as part of a shifting of resources to AI and related wearable devices, like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Although Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth told media outlets last week that Meta is not halting its VR efforts, the company's outsized impact on that industry has chilled some developers and sparked fears of a VR winter, CNBC reported. Analysts estimate Reality Labs to post a fourth-quarter operating loss of $5.67 billion on $940.8 million in sales. That unit has had over $70 billion in total operating losses since late 2020.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is cutting 16,000 corporate roles, and an internal FAQ viewed by Business Insider spells out the details for affected employees. This round of layoffs is the second mass job cut since October, when Amazon shed 14,000 roles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Absolutely not," Bessent told CNBC's Sara Eisen, responding to a question about if the U.S. is intervening in the currency market or strengthening the yen. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the American currency against a basket of foreign peers, fell 1.3% on Tuesday, marking its biggest one-day slide since April. The dollar index also fell to its lowest level since 2022 during the session, but ticked higher in midday trading on Wednesday. Reuters reported last week that the New York Federal Reserve had reviewed dollar-to-yen rates with dealers, citing a person familiar with the matter. Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday he had no comment on the report besides saying the U.S. has a strong dollar policy. The "U.S. always has a strong dollar policy, but a strong dollar policy means setting the right fundamentals," Bessent said. "If we have sound policies, the money will flow in," he added. "We are bringing down our trade deficits, so ... automatically that should lead to more dollar strength over time." Bessent's comments come a day after President Donald Trump said, "I think it's great" when asked if he was comfortable with the current value of the dollar. The dollar index has dropped more than 10% compared with 12 months ago. Trump said he's seen China and Japan "devalue" their currencies, which he's found to be unfair. Investors have been monitoring for a potential intervention on the Japanese yen. "They devalue, because it's hard to compete when they devalue," Trump said in Iowa, where he was on a visit focused on his economic record.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was "heartbroken" by the situation in Minneapolis and called for an easing of tensions in a note to employees this week, CNBC confirmed Wednesday. "I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they're from, and when we embrace our shared humanity." Cook said he had a "good conversation" with President Donald Trump this week to discuss his concerns and expressed appreciation for his "openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all." Cook did not directly mention the two fatal shootings by federal agents. A growing list of leaders and billionaires are speaking out after Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis this month. Multiple news outlets reported that OpenAI's Sam Altman said Immigration and Customs Enforcement "is going too far" in a message  to employees. Many executives have kept quiet on the events unfolding in Minneapolis. It's a stark contrast to 2020, when major tech CEOs, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, spoke out against the death of George Floyd in the Midwest city and committed millions to groups working on racial justice. In 2020, Cook sent a lengthy email to employees, condemning the killing of Floyd and addressing discrimination and inequality in the U.S. "To stand together, we must stand up for one another, and recognize the fear, hurt, and outrage rightly provoked by the senseless killing of George Floyd and a much longer history of racism," he wrote at the time. Cook, Amazon's Andy Jassy and Advanced Micro Devices' Lisa Su were all in attendance, according to multiple media outlets. Apple employees were reportedly angered by Cook's attendance, according to The Intercept.

Say a Trump-friendly group of owners bought TikTok, and wanted to change the way TikTok worked — so it showed more stuff that was Trump-friendly, and less that wasn't. You'd need to do it pretty subtly, over an extended time period, so people wouldn't notice it right away. They also note that at one point, TikTok prohibited users from using the word "Epstein" in direct messages to each other. It says its entire operation was screwed up Sunday because one of Oracle's data centers had an outage. (TikTok didn't formally identify Oracle in its statements, but on Tuesday night, Oracle raised its hand and acknowledged that it was the "US Data Center partner" TikTok was referring to. Oracle now owns 15% of the new US TikTok.) And all of that seems pretty plausible to me. On Saturday, my feed was full of posts about the latest killing of a protester in Minneapolis by federal agents. And while I don't normally use TikTok's DM feature, or send messages about Jeffrey Epstein, I was able to do that without a problem on Tuesday. All of which suggests that TikTok's answer — we had to unplug the machine and plug it back in, basically — sounds pretty plausible to me. And much more plausible than, "The new US TikTok has immediately started censoring anti-Trump views." Gavin Newsom and Sen. Chris Murphy, are running with. And while some of the people complaining may have a specific motivation for their complaints — both Newsom and Murphy are consistent critics of the Trump administration, for instance — it's easy enough to understand why people might think TikTok really is up to something. For starters, one of the reasons US TikTok is no longer run entirely by ByteDance, its original owner, is because US lawmakers told us they were worried that China might influence what TikTok users saw in America. But now US TikTok is owned by Trump allies — most notably Oracle founder Larry Ellison — and Trump has made it clear that he wants media and tech companies to promote things he likes and demote things he doesn't. So it's not outrageous to believe that TikTok's new bosses might put their thumb on the scale for Trump. But you're still guessing, and your guessing is often informed by the way you think the platform should operate. Conservatives, for instance, complained for years about the way Twitter and Facebook treated them — up until Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and Mark Zuckerberg pivoted to Trump in 2025. Digital publishers are consumed with the vagaries of Google Discover — the platform many of them are now dependent on for traffic referrals. Now, AI engines are the new target for bias claims. But proving that something is up — one way or another — is just about impossible in any systemic way: Yes, maybe your latest post isn't getting the views your other posts used to get. But does that mean the platform is censoring you? Even more confounding for us outsiders: Sometimes we really do find out that a human being — not software — made a decision to push something out of sight on a platform they run. In 2020, Twitter, then run by Jack Dorsey, hid a New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop because the company believed it might be part of a disinformation plot against Joe Biden. (Twitter later reversed itself, and Dorsey apologized publicly.) So when a big platform stops showing you what you want to see, there are plenty of reasons to think that something's afoot. So maybe one day we will find out that the new US TikTok really is trying to promote Trump and tamp down his foes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has "brought down the temperature" on Minnesota, the site of major civil unrest over aggressive federal immigration efforts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday. Trump is "urging" Congress to take action to avoid triggering a partial government shutdown amid disputes over federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security, Bessent told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." ET on Saturday unless lawmakers come to a resolution on the DHS funding, which a slew of Democrats have rejected in light of the recent killing of nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis. Trump is "in constant contact" with lawmakers "and he is urging them not to shut down the government," Bessent told CNBC. Bessent spoke as the Trump administration tempers its tone after its harsh initial response to two immigration enforcement-related killings in Minneapolis that stirred waves of outrage from Democrats and even some Republicans. The Cabinet secretary declined to make a prediction about whether a shutdown — the second in less than four months — will be averted. "I don't know what to expect. The Democrats can become unhinged like they were last time, and they don't care. Like, they think this is a way to stop President Trump," he said. He also warned that another shutdown could cause further economic harm. So, there's a big permanent loss," Bessent said. The House of Representatives last week passed a more-than-$1.2 trillion spending package that includes funding for DHS, the agency in charge of federal immigration enforcement. And if the Senate changes what the House already passed, the House would have to return from a prescheduled recess to vote on any amended measure, with little time to spare before a shutdown. Democratic opposition to the spending package rapidly grew after Pretti's killing on Saturday morning. Senate Democrats now say they will vote against the package unless the DHS portion is stripped out, something Republicans have signaled they will not do. Pretti was killed just weeks after another U.S. citizen, Renee Nicole Good, was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis. In both cases, the Trump administration initially came out in full-throated defense of its officers' actions while accusing the slain citizens of domestic terrorism. After widespread blowback — and after new polls showed Trump's immigration approval rating plummeting — the administration has dialed back its tone. Trump said Tuesday, "we're going to de-escalate a bit" in Minnesota. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has suggested that that pivot is not enough for Democrats to drop the shutdown threat. "In the meantime, I will vote no on any legislation that funds [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue," Schumer said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said Wednesday in separate releases that the firms will match the U.S. government's one-time $1,000 contribution to children's retirement savings accounts for eligible employees, the latest corporations to announce such a measure. The so-called Trump accounts are part of a pilot program that deposits $1,000 from the U.S. Treasury into tax-advantaged accounts for eligible children born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. The program, partly the brainchild of hedge fund manager Brad Gerstner, aims to help narrow the U.S. wealth gap by encouraging long-term saving and investing from birth. It has attracted commitments from a growing list of wealthy individuals, from billionaires such as Michael and Susan Dell and Ray Dalio to rap artist Nicki Minaj. "JPMorgan Chase has demonstrated a long-term commitment to the financial health and well-being of all of our employees and their families around the world, including more than 190,000 here in the United States," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a release. "By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future." In a memo sent to employees Wednesday first reported by Reuters, Bank of America said it applauded the government's "innovative solutions" for employee savings. Financial firms dominate the list of companies that are matching contributions for the new accounts. Besides JPMorgan and Bank of America, the two largest U.S. banks by assets, BlackRock, BNY, Robinhood, SoFi and Charles Schwab have made similar announcements. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday said the city's wealthiest must pay more in taxes to help fill the staggering budget deficit of more than $12 billion that he was left by his predecessor. "This is at a scale that's actually greater than what we saw here in New York City during the Great Recession," Mamdani said of that budget hole during an interview with CNBC "Squawk Box" co-anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin at City Hall. Andrew Cuomo, whom he soundly defeated in the November general election, for causing that budget gap. Mamdani vowed that his administration will be up front with New Yorkers about budget issues that have been "hidden from them for far too long." City Comptroller Mark Levine earlier this month said the new mayor faces a budget shortfall that is projected to total $12.6 billion over the next two fiscal years. He gave the example of the Adams administration launching a "basically unusable" artificial intelligence chatbot that reportedly cost about $600,000 to develop. "I think the scale of this crisis is one where we have to pursue all of these things," Mamdani said. "I have to show that the city government is not just serious about public goods, but also public excellence and public efficiency, and so we have to make sure every dollar that's being spent is actually being spent in a worthwhile way," he said. The 34-year-old former state assemblyman, while campaigning for mayor last year, vowed to raise the city's corporate tax rate to 11.5%, matching New Jersey's rate. He also promised to impose a flat 2% tax on New Yorkers who earn more than $1 million per year. Mamdani's sudden rise to prominence after his stunning upset victory over Cuomo in the 2025 Democratic mayoral primary, and his self-identification as a democratic socialist, has caused consternation among some of the city's business elite. A number of those leaders warned that his redistributionist agenda could hobble the city, which is the nation's financial capital. Asked by Sorkin on Wednesday about fears of an exodus by billionaires, other wealthy people and businesses in the face of his policies, Mamdani pushed back. "Capital flight is always spoken about whenever we talk about the potential of increasing taxes on the wealthy," Mamdani said. And Mamadni stressed that his revenue plans are aimed at increasing the quality of city services. "We're sitting here right now in one of the coldest stretches in New York City weather history," the mayor noted. "One of the reasons why the city could start to get back on its feet was because we had a Sanitation Department that was staffed by thousands of people," he said. "That's only possible when you're actually investing in public service." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Dhillon spent almost five years at Palantir before leaving to build cybersecurity startup Outtake. Now his former boss is helping fuel his new company's growth, alongside a roster of investors that includes Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Outtake, which counts OpenAI and Bill Ackman's Pershing Square among its customers, has just raised a fresh $40 million, the company said Wednesday. The startup, founded in 2023, uses autonomous artificial intelligence agents to help companies detect and quickly remove cyberthreats like phishing, through a variety of applications, including email verification. "We're headed towards this world of always-on security," Dhillon said in an interview. "You need agent tech solutions like Outtake, defending your neighborhood." The funding round was led by venture firm Iconiq, with participation from CRV, S32 and angel investors Nadella as well as Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora, Anduril co-founder Trae Stephens, and Ackman. Palantir tech chief Shyam Sankar was another angel investor in the company and contributed to the newest round. Dhillon didn't disclose the valuation, but the 35-person company said that annual recurring revenue has increased about sixfold year over year, and that its systems scanned 20 million potential cyberattacks last year. Dhillon said that AI has raised the sophistication and pace of cyberthreats, and that his company is building a "trust layer for the Internet." Iconiq general partner Murali Joshi, who is joining Outtake's board, said the company's growth rate, strong customer feedback and market opportunity are among the reasons the firm invested. "What they've built, from a product perspective, is so fundamentally differentiated relative to everything else that's been on the market," Joshi told CNBC. Outtake's technology is used by AppLovin, federal agencies, luxury retail brands and popular AI labs. Dhillon, who worked on Palantir's AI platforms, said the company plans to use some of the funding to grow its go-to-market teams, including engineering and product.

Getting laid off is very traumatic — and it's becoming more common. I've been a full-time career coach to tech employees at startups and in Big Tech since 2017, and I've seen how layoffs have become more visible in recent years. I help clients navigate life after a layoff, including what role they want next and how to apply for new jobs. Amazon has announced new plans to cut staff, and I want affected employees to remember that they are coming from one of the world's top companies.

Do you have a story to share about being laid off by Amazon? When people reach out to me for coaching after a layoff, many have a scarcity mindset and feel like they have to apply for any job. For some people who urgently need to pay rent or put food on the table, that's necessary. The very first thing I ask clients to do is create a list of "must-haves" and "dealbreakers" for their next job. You're going to submit a résumé with almost every application, and having an up-to-date LinkedIn account puts you in a good position if potential employers check it or recruiters go looking for talent on the platform. But if everyone does that, you don't stand out. I can usually tell quickly if someone's written their résumé with AI. For example, they'll be applying to a systems engineer role, and it won't even have the phrase "systems engineer" in it. Everyone thinks only AI is reading their résumé, but I have clients who work in talent acquisition and HR — the humans who are still involved in the recruitment process. Then put those phrases near the top, rather than using AI to create generic slop. I'd suggest creating a master résumé that you can spend 20 minutes tailoring for different roles. If you're using AI, use it more like an extra tool, rather than the thing that's driving your job search. Layoffs are normal now, especially in the tech industry, and there's much less stigma around them. But there's more competition in the job market, because it's easier to apply for jobs with AI, for example, so the challenges around layoffs are different nowadays. In today's job market, it's important to figure out what's unique about you. I've found that clients are surprised by the feedback they receive.</p>
