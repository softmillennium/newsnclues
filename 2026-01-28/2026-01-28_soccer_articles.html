                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This summer, LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes will serve as Mexico's Hospitality House, which will also be known as Casa México — a community-centered hub uniting soccer aficionados through the rich cultural traditions of Mexico — launched in partnership with the Mexican Consulate General. “It made perfect sense,”  said Leticia Rhi Buckley, CEO of LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, of when she was first approached with the idea from the Mexican Consulate General. “We were really excited to explore how we could put forward the kind of programming that we do every day under this banner and ensure that communities like ours are part of these big global events happening in our city,” she added. A total of 104 matches will take place across the United States, Canada and Mexico. Throughout the tournament, which will conclude on July 19, Casa México will offer free programming for fans, including live watch parties of the Mexican National Team, courtesy of its official media partner Telemundo 52 / KVEA, which is also the exclusive Spanish-language network airing the FIFA World Cup. Earlier this week, Mayor Karen Bass welcomed the partnership during a press conference. “There is no better place to bring people together than [Los Angeles], honoring our past with pride while also looking ahead to the future — inspiring the next generation of athletes, supporting an economic boost that will continue to benefit Angelenos and uplifting the millions of Mexican Americans that call L.A. home,” said Mayor Bass in a press release statement. LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes is already thinking of ways to incorporate its current programming into the Casa México experience, including the popular Summer of Salsa concert series — which takes place one Friday a month during the summer — as well as film screenings, family days and temporary exhibits relating to the beloved sport and the community. The downtown hub, located by Olvera Plaza, estimates over 20,000 visitors between June 11 and July 19, despite community fears over ICE enforcement decimating foot traffic in Los Angeles. Last week, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to bar immigration enforcement officers from county-owned spaces, which would protect spaces like the LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes from the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown. “We've had safety plans in place for a long time,” says Rhi Buckley about protecting patrons from immigration enforcement. “You can't be an institution like ours under this current government at the federal level and not be prepared to have plans in place.” As excitement for the World Cup intensifies in the coming months, Rhi Buckley hopes visitors and soccer fans can celebrate the richness of this city and its Mexican influence at LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, which proudly champions Mexican culture through its corridors. “This region, this country was built by us and by people like us,” said Rhi Buckley, “I hope people come to experience joy and connection, and recognize how much we have in common.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea have confirmed that Raheem Sterling has left the club by "mutual agreement" as he seeks a new club in January. The Blues' misfit has finally departed Stamford Bridge, with his last competitive appearance for the club coming in May of 2024. The club said in a statement: "Raheem Sterling has today departed Chelsea Football Club by mutual agreement, bringing to an end three-and-a-half seasons as our player, having signed in the summer of 2022 when he was transferred from Manchester City. "We thank Raheem for the contribution he made while a Chelsea player and wish him well for the next stage in his career." It is a far cry from the excitement showed by manager Thomas Tuchel when he was signed in 2022. He's a big improvement to our squad and is exactly what we were looking for in terms of age, experience, and style of play. "Once the players arrive these days in a situation where they only have one year [left on their] contract, there's always room for negotiation and possibility. He was convinced, he did everything that was needed to do, we gave our best to make it happen. "He gives us a lot of flexibility, mobility and attacking options at the front." He was loaned to Arsenal in the 2024-25 season but failed to make any sort of impact in north London and returned to Stamford Bridge in the summer, despite him leaving for no loan fee at all. He has not featured at all this season, however, and will now seek a new club. Manager Liam Rosenior gave an update on the winger's future after taking the job, telling reporters: "I've said what I've had to say on Raheem. He's a player I have massive respect for. Huge respect for as a person and what he's achieved in the game. Now is not the right time to speak about his situation."

He said:  “My father is 75 years old and for 50 years he has been a fisherman, working from two o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock in the morning,” Maresca said. “This is sad in life – not a player and the way that they work. “I've been in Raheem's situation and Axel's situation as a player and for sure I know that it's not the best feeling for a player because you want to train and play and then, for a different reason, the situation is the situation. Per The Guardian, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) investigated claims Sterling was being made to train at 8pm, a time that is far from ideal for a father of four.

Donald Trump makes us feel not only German but also European.” “Far from being left behind, Europe will show everyone what it's made of on the pitch.” Trump lashed out at Europe in December, threatening to stop supporting Ukraine and also saying: “If it keeps going the way it's going, Europe will not be … in my opinion … many of those countries will not be viable countries any longer. Their immigration policy is a disaster.” In January, he threatened to annex Greenland and said in Davos last week that he would not use force. “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. The 30-year-old Goretzka has previously spoken out on racism, diversity and the climate crisis, but has become more careful in his public statements in recent years. “I don't need to mention how hard that missed opportunity hit me.” The former Schalke player has six months on his Bayern contract and is considering a move abroad, having only ever played in Germany. “It would be exciting to go abroad during my career,” he said. The Premier League could be an option, he says: “There are a lot of people who think my style of football would be a very good fit for England. I will listen to everything and weigh it up carefully. I am looking forward to the talks.” Goretzka is not ruling out staying in Munich, having regained his place under Vincent Kompany.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada Soccer's long-running on-again, off-again courtship is finally coming to a close. Multiple sources have confirmed that highly-touted attacking midfielder and dual-national Marcelo Flores, 22, is in the process of completing his FIFA one-time switch from Mexico to Canada. The Athletic reported in October that Flores was initially being courted by Canada, while TSN was the first to report he would complete his allegiance change. John Lobban, Canada's men's national-team communications manager, provided the following statement to The Athletic: “Decisions around international representation, including any change of association, are personal matters for players and are governed by FIFA's eligibility regulations. Until all required steps are completed and approved, Canada Soccer will not speculate, or provide confirmation, on individual player eligibility.” Flores comes with a bit more baggage than the rest, though. The dynamic attacking player was born in Canada but held Mexican eligibility through his father, Rubén, a former professional. Playing time has not come regularly for Flores since, but that didn't discourage Canada Soccer from re-opening a file once thought to be closed. “I'm sure you've got players like young Marcelo Flores (who) might be looking after this game and wondering whether he wants to play for Mexico or Canada,” Herdman said at the time. Yet months later, Flores chose to represent Mexico in a move that left some in the Canadian soccer community burned and could still cause some consternation over his present-day choice. “Despite the ability to represent several countries, I have always been a part of the Mexican national team system,” Flores said in a May 2022 social media post. Herdman later expressed frustration at being strung along – it's believed that Rubén was instrumental in his son's decision to choose Mexico – but Flores' nine minutes in a June 2022 Concacaf Nations League game against Suriname were his last in three appearances for El Tri. He no longer factors into Mexico's plans, which undoubtedly influenced his decision four years later, all while he remains eligible for Canada due to FIFA's regulations. As for why Marsch and Canada Soccer brought Flores back into the fold, it reveals plenty about their World Cup ambitions and belief in the player. Flores' combination of pace and technical qualities on the ball means he can move from a wide spot to a more central one with ease. The likelihood is that a resurgent Ismaël Koné is Canada's starting advanced midfielder when the cohosts begin World Cup group play on June 12 against one of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy, Northern Ireland and Wales in Toronto, his backup has felt like a question mark. Sigur could find himself at right back, and while Jonathan Osorio is important to Canada's midfield, it's more as an intelligent, deep-lying player who can kill off a game with his soccer IQ. Yes, his preferred position is on the left and makes an already crowded spot now more akin to a clown car. Alphonso Davies, Ali Ahmed, Liam Millar, Jayden Nelson, Jacob Shaffelburg and now Flores could all be in contention for two or three spots on that side. There was a maturity in Flores' approach that might not have been present years earlier. His club playing time might not suggest as such, but Flores did have a two-goal showing in a Liga MX Clausura start vs. San Luis earlier this month, and Canada's coaching staff finds his finishing abilities intriguing. It's no secret Canada struggled to score at times late in 2025. Les comparto la narración que hice del segundo gol de Marcelo Flores con @TigresOficial ante el San Luis 🫡@Andres_Vaca_ @MajolaB @CantaloCamacho @FJG_TD @J_Pietra pic.twitter.com/6pxbHbHyn6 Marsch's successful play to land Flores suggests a few more things as well. The drama that initially surrounded Flores was before Marsch's time. The manager is not interested in years-old hurt feelings if it means bolstering his World Cup roster. When Herdman brought a trusted but aging squad to the previous World Cup in 2022, his bench was limited and Canada lacked dynamic players who could break down the likes of Belgium and Croatia in the group stage. And so it should come as no surprise now that, from within Canada's setup, Flores is being looked at as a genuine possibility to make the World Cup. Marsch's outlook on roster-building will inform part of that decision. Couple that with an unrelenting demand to play front-foot soccer, and you can begin to understand why Marsch isn't afraid to roll the dice on an untested younger player — potentially at the expense of an experienced and older one who may struggle with those demands and require added time off to recover between games. Marsch has reason to believe he can accelerate Flores' development in a short amount of time. The coach has been adamant that players can be developed at the national-team level, not just at their clubs, and the ascent we've seen at different times with younger Canadians such as Ahmed and Shaffelburg suggests his belief is a strong one. There will be two games in the team's most familiar surroundings: Toronto. There will be minimal travel, compared to friendlies in Europe. There will be a multi-day camp before those friendlies against Iceland and Tunisia to get Flores up to speed on the team's tactical approach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A three-week trip to Japan symbolizes what's next for the former USWNT and Angel City FC star who announced her retirement from professional soccer last fall. Press was honored on Jan. 24 before the USWNT took on Paraguay at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, Calif., just a short drive from her hometown in Palos Verdes Estates. She also recently discussed some of her career highlights (including a memorable interaction with Neymar) with World Cup winner and former teammate Meghan Klingenberg on this week's episode of the U.S. Soccer Podcast. After spending 33 years of her life devoted to the sport, Press is embracing a newfound freedom. That includes preparing for a trip that she's left partly unplanned so she can wind her way through an unknown country, experience a fine culture, and develop a trip organically to make it feel special and memorable. “To retire in your 30s gives you this second half of life, a second chance to really decide, with time, intention and integrity what you want to do with your life,” she said. After a storied career at Stanford University, where she remains the all-time leading goal scorer in program history, Press broke onto the international scene in 2013. She earned her first cap on Feb. 9 in an international friendly against Scotland. In that game, she scored twice, becoming one of just 25 players to record a goal in her debut, forecasting beautifully both the commitment to excellence and goal-scoring ability she'd become known for as a U.S. Women's National Team mainstay. From there, Press would go on to be a part of several winning teams, including the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cups, and add her name to the record books as one of the all-time great goal scorers. As a creative and quality finisher, there are plenty of Press goals to choose from for the highlight reel. Her golazo against England in the 2020 SheBelieves Cup produced “Christen Press! Salazar repeated the call soon after to a similar degree when Press chipped in another incredible goal against Japan in the same tournament. With the support of head coach Jill Ellis, Press was invited to the January trip to Europe, which, Press recalls, was not exactly common for a player who had missed a few of the previous camps. Press wanted to stay home and be near her family. But soccer meant a lot to them – Press and her two sisters played, and Stacy even coached them as youth players – so Stacy encouraged her daughter to go abroad with the team. From a blurry stream on their iPad, Press' parents watched as their daughter scored what Press refers to as a “God goal,” because of the way it unfolded – the goal wasn't presented to her but had to be the way, she says. It was the last goal that my mom got to see me score. She never saw us win that 2019 World Cup. She wasn't in the stands when I scored that header against England. Sadly, soon after seeing her daughter score that goal against Spain, Stacy passed away. In a heartfelt tribute in Sports Illustrated written by the late Grant Wahl, Press's father, Cody, explains what it was like in the following months, grieving a devastating loss while watching Press play a pivotal role in helping the U.S. Women's National Team capture the FIFA 2019 Women's World Cup. The soccer world might know her best for the immaculate header she scored against England off service from fullback Kelley O'Hara in the semifinal – Stacy played a role in that goal too as Press paid tribute to her mom by extending her gaze and hands lovingly toward the sky – but that goal earlier in the year against Spain encapsulates a much more fuller picture of Press' whole journey. That experience of going to that camp, being there and doing it for someone else, then losing that person really shows the power of what integrating football into a life really means.” Press is part of a special group of Women's National Team players who have retired in the past several years including Megan Rapinoe, Becky Sauerbrunn, Alex Morgan and Klingenberg, among others. These players, including Press, were on the forefront in the quest for equal pay, using their voices and positions to advocate for better compensation, which led to a settlement with U.S. Soccer in May 2022. “I feel like I was a part of a generation that pushed things forward, that prioritized our value and the value of future athletes.” Reflecting on the beginnings of her own professional career when she played club soccer in Sweden and at Benedictine College outside of Chicago with the Chicago Red Stars, Press notes the amount of progress between then and now is “incomprehensible.” Even then, there weren't many opportunities for women to play soccer at a livable wage apart from making it through the pathway to the senior Women's National Team. “The quality of life for athletes is sky high. Those types of conversations continue to this day, but it's clear that things have improved from where they were as recently as 10-20 years ago. More women have platforms, soccer players like current USWNT forward Trinity Rodman are signing multi-million-dollar deals, women's sports are more visible on television and breaking records for viewership. People are also talking and learning more about how to treat female athletes. Press explained it's about the value of seeing women not as small versions of men, but as women who deserve their own considerations. This reimagining of culture and focus on the female athlete is on theme with leaders in the sport including current USWNT head coach Emma Hayes and U.S. Soccer investor and Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang. “Women's sports is not a lesser version of men's,” Press said. That thought is what will guide Press as she moves into the next stage of life. She plans to focus on her business RE, a global sports media brand that seeks to improve the world through the unifying power of sport. The platform is champion-led behind two of its founders: Press and her wife, two-time World Cup winner and four-time Olympian Tobin Heath, who last summer also announced her retirement from professional soccer. Their mission statement based on what they call “Gal Culture” and the idea of challenging the status quo to give women's sports a brighter spotlight. “I really see it as a vessel where Tobin and I get to do whatever we want with it,” Press said. They keep me connected to the game in a new way.” 1 most popular soccer podcast on Apple Podcasts and the No. For someone as thoughtful, wise and devoted as Press is, it's clear that she has set up a platform that will allow her to use her voice, inspire excellence and build community for years to come.</p>

Atlanta government and business leaders want to present a welcoming environment for foreign dignitaries and international fans planning to descend upon the city this summer for the World Cup. 

But a pair of fatal shootings in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents has raised new concerns among host cities like Atlanta about potential violence or tensions that could arise when World Cup travelers arrive in droves.

The first-ever Women's Champions Cup kicks into high gear on Wednesday with two semifinals at the Brentford Community Stadium, home of Premier League side Brentford – Gotham FC's clash with Brazil's Corinthians and Arsenal's fixture against Morocco's AS FAR. The final, plus a third-place match, await on Sunday at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium for the last four teams standing. The new FIFA tournament will serve as a first official measuring stick for how teams from different continents in the women's game will stack up against each other, at least partially satisfying the curiosity of many who have wondered how NWSL teams fare against Europe's top sides. A matchup between UEFA Women's Champions League winners Arsenal and Concacaf W Champions Cup victors Gotham is not a guarantee – each of them have to face off against fellow continental champions to earn a fixture against each other. Here's what you need to know about the FIFA Women's Champions Cup semifinals. Arsenal, Gotham and Copa Libertadores winners Corinthians qualified directly for the semifinals, while CAF Women's Champions League victors AS FAR made it to London the hard way. The competition technically began in October with a first round match between AFC Women's Champions League Wuhan Jiangda and OFC Women's Champions League victors Auckland United. Wuhan 1-0 and booked a meeting with AS FAR in December, with the Moroccan team winning 2-1 in extra time. Since head coach Juan Carlos Amoros joined Gotham FC ahead of the 2023 NWSL season, the team has gone from strength to strength. They are now two-time league champions and added the inaugural Concacaf W Champions Cup title last season, thrusting them into a first-ever showcase against global competition. "It would be a dream come true for us to be in this position two games away," Amoros said. We need to win the [NWSL] championship, go next year around North America to qualify for the semifinal, final. They will be dealing with a disadvantage, though – Gotham are technically in preseason mode. The NWSL regular season will not start until March, forcing them to begin preseason earlier than their domestic opponents. Gotham will also be without Esther Gonzalez, an NWSL MVP nominee, while she is on parental leave but many of their heavy-hitters are available for selection. Rose Lavelle, who scored the game-winning goal in November's championship, will likely play a meaningful role while Jaedyn Shaw might steal the show. The game against Corinthians offers a unique chance to show off her skills, especially as someone who had formative experiences with Santos' women's team as a teen. "It really shaped me as a player to be honest, seeing the vision on the field, knowing how to combine in small spaces, getting out of them on the dribble and the pass: those are some of my strengths," she said. "Just being around Brazilian culture, football and futsal, is something I think really helped me build the passion for the game. There is no gambling offered on this site.

The freshest news in Santa Barbara County UC Santa Barbara's Harder Stadium underwent a makeover and rolled out the red carpet for the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team for an international match for the first time ever on Tuesday night. Local soccer fans in town and from up and down the Central Coast showed up and showed out for the international friendly against Chile, selling out the stadium with 14,797 attendees. “I have not been to Santa Barbara often, but it's a beautiful place,” U.S. standout Trinity Rodman said. “Obviously, when we scored, it's even louder, so I enjoyed that a lot and I liked playing here.” A USWNT fan turns toward the crowd to begin a cheer in Tuesday's international friendly matchup with Chile at Harder Stadium. It was a match full of firsts for the U.S., as midfielder Croix Bethune, forward Jameese Joseph and defender Emily Sams all scored the first goals of their international career in the opening half. “When you have players that don't play a lot of minutes, able to deliver a tactical performance like that, I think that's what gives me most joy. “I think we always know the U.S. produced players that can win soccer games, maybe a certain way, but I feel like we have learned how to break opponents down in much different ways… That's the level that this program sets, and I feel like we're returning to a level that was here a while ago.” Croix Bethune shows off her dance moves after scoring the first goal of Tuesday's win over Chile. The offensive barrage continued in the 33rd minute, as Emma Sears received a pass inside the box and crossed it to captain Sams, who slid in and scored for a 3-0 advantage, which held into halftime. The Santa Barbara crowd responded to the three-goal first half with a wave that wrapped around Harder Stadium several times before dying down. Hayes mentioned the wave in her postgame press conference and was pleased with the energy levels both from her team and in the Santa Barbara crowd. Sign Up for the A.M.

The USWNT comes together to celebrate one of their five goals in Tuesday's international friendly win over Chile. “I think this has certainly opened up the year with what we've identified as the key themes to take us through to qualification,” Hayes said of the season-opening camp. “I think this camp has given us the reference points to be able to say, these are the things we need to add to go to the next level, these are the things we are looking for, and for the players that come back in for SheBelieves, it will be really clear what that looks like.” Local soccer fans in town and from up and down the Central Coast showed up and showed out for the international friendly against Chile, selling out the stadium with 14,797 attendees. “I have not been to Santa Barbara often, but it's a beautiful place,” U.S. standout Trinity Rodman said. “Obviously, when we scored, it's even louder, so I enjoyed that a lot and I liked playing here.” A USWNT fan turns toward the crowd to begin a cheer in Tuesday's international friendly matchup with Chile at Harder Stadium.

The USWNT comes together to celebrate one of their five goals in Tuesday's international friendly win over Chile. “I think this has certainly opened up the year with what we've identified as the key themes to take us through to qualification,” Hayes said of the season-opening camp. “I think this camp has given us the reference points to be able to say, these are the things we need to add to go to the next level, these are the things we are looking for, and for the players that come back in for SheBelieves, it will be really clear what that looks like.” “I have not been to Santa Barbara often, but it's a beautiful place,” U.S. standout Trinity Rodman said. “Obviously, when we scored, it's even louder, so I enjoyed that a lot and I liked playing here.” A USWNT fan turns toward the crowd to begin a cheer in Tuesday's international friendly matchup with Chile at Harder Stadium. It was a match full of firsts for the U.S., as midfielder Croix Bethune, forward Jameese Joseph and defender Emily Sams all scored the first goals of their international career in the opening half. “When you have players that don't play a lot of minutes, able to deliver a tactical performance like that, I think that's what gives me most joy. “I think we always know the U.S. produced players that can win soccer games, maybe a certain way, but I feel like we have learned how to break opponents down in much different ways… That's the level that this program sets, and I feel like we're returning to a level that was here a while ago.” Croix Bethune shows off her dance moves after scoring the first goal of Tuesday's win over Chile. The offensive barrage continued in the 33rd minute, as Emma Sears received a pass inside the box and crossed it to captain Sams, who slid in and scored for a 3-0 advantage, which held into halftime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (KEYT) Soccer fans and players of all ages filled Harder Stadium at UCSB on Tuesday night, but not to see the Gauchos play, they came to see the USWNT also known as U.S. Women's National Soccer Team play Chile. Some local AYSO players and members of Central Coast Surf club soccer teams got to enter the stadium early and take photos on the field. Many of the girls and young women said they couldn't wait to see a certain Olympic Gold Medalist with a famous last name. Brooke, Carter and Ellie Rozhko dressed in team US colors. Mila Mctiernan, Sierra Hope, Page Hall and Merrick Hope came from San Luis Obispo to watch and went in with the crowd that looked like a sea of fans. Dennice Marin of Oxnard doesn't play but appreciated seeing women in the spotlight. "Also excitingly she just signed the largest women's project ever she signed with Washington Spirit and we are going to watch her play tonight," said Sydney Baritone, who used to play club while at UCSB. They love to play and this is their first time seeing the pros in person rather than on TV. The U.S. won 5-0 and Trinity Rodman scored one of those goals.
