                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Legendary's live-action feature adaptation of Gundam looks to have found a home as sources tell Deadline that Netflix is on board to distribute the pic. Sydney Sweeney and Noah Centineo are on board to star with Sweet Tooth director Jim Mickle helming. Netflix and Legendary could not be reached for comment. The project has been co-developed between Legendary and franchise owner Bandai Namco Filmworks, from Mickle's own script. Mickle also will produce with his partner Linda Moran through their production company Nightshade. One of the most revered anime, Gundam pioneered the sci-fi subgenre known as mecha, IP that centers on giant fighting robots. Gundam is set in the Universal Century, a future where humanity has colonized space. When a rebellion erupts between Earth and its colonies, the ensuing conflict is fought by pilots in massive mechanized contraptions known as mobile suits. Since then, the internationally renowned Yoshiyuki Tomino-created endeavor has spanned 83 animated series and movies, in addition to a lucrative merchandising arm that generates $600 million annually. Legendary Entertainment announced its development of a Gundam film with Netflix in the spring of 2021, with Jordan Vogt-Roberts attached to direct the pic following his work with the studio on its hit Monsterverse installment Kong: Skull Island. However, the streamer and Vogt-Roberts no longer are involved. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. It's a live action anime adaptation, those have always been trash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a chant of “ICE Out Now!” Bruce Springsteen wasted no time condemning Donald Trump and the killings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents in Minnesota. “I wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released it to you today in response to the state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis,” Springsteen said on social media Wednesday morning with his “Streets of Minneapolis” song – which you can hear here: The Boss added in his posting: “It's dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.

With a canon full of topical songs like 2001's “American Skin (41 Shots),” 2012's “We Take Care of Our Own” and his 2025 digital release The Land of Hope and Dreams EP, the openly progressively political Springsteen has never turned around a new song in such quick order as he did this week.

At the show in his home state, Springsteen told the crowd: “If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed mass federal troops invading an American city using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president.” RELATED: Jon Stewart Slams MAGA's Course Reversal On Second Amendment In Wake Of Alex Pretti's Killing: “Guns Are Your Whole Personality” Through the winter's ice and coldDown Nicollet AvenueA city aflame fought fire and ice‘Neath an occupier's bootsKing Trump's private army from the DHSGuns belted to their coatsCame to Minneapolis to enforce the lawOr so their story goesAgainst smoke and rubber bulletsBy the dawn's early lightCitizens stood for justiceTheir voices ringing through the nightAnd there were bloody footprintsWhere mercy should have stoodAnd two dead left to die on snow-filled streetsAlex Pretti and Renee Good Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voiceCrying through the bloody mistWe'll remember the names of those who diedOn the streets of MinneapolisNow they say they're here to uphold the lawBut they trample on our rightsIf your skin is black or brown my friendYou can be questioned or deported on sight In chants of ICE out nowOur city's heart and soul persistsThrough broken glass and bloody tearsOn the streets of Minneapolis Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bruce Springsteen has released a protest song denouncing President Donald J. Trump and the “private army” of his Department of Homeland Security, in the wake of ICE's killings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis. Listen to “Streets of Minneapolis” below. I wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released it to you today in response to the state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis. It's dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good. The rallying full-band song memorializes Pretti and Good in verses that pull no punches on the crimes of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier this month, Springsteen dedicated a rendition of “The Promised Land” to Good during an impromptu appearance at a New Jersey festival, telling the crowd: “If you believe in democracy, in liberty; if you believe that truth still matters, and that it's worth speaking out, and it's worth fighting for; if you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it; if you stand against heavily armed, masked, federal troops invading American cities, and using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens; if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest; then send a message to this president. And as the mayor of that city has said, ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.” Another impassioned speech in protest of Trump's “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,” given last year at a show in Manchester, England, was captured on a live EP released a week later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marc Anthony's eighth baby is on the way! The singer announced Wednesday that his wife, Nadia Ferreira, is pregnant with their second child. !” the Grammy winner, 57, and his partner, 26, captioned a joint Instagram upload. “What a great gift life gives us. “Marquito is going to be a big brother,” they concluded, using their toddler Marco's nickname. The 2-year-old made an appearance in the social media upload, pressing his hand against his mom's baby bump. The little one was born on Father's Day in June 2023, five months after Anthony and Ferreira walked down the aisle in Miami. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

Marco joined the actor's big brood, which includes six other children from past relationships with Debbie Rosado, Dayanara Torres and Jennifer Lopez. Anthony shares daughter Arianna and son Chase with Rosado, as well as sons Cristian and Ryan with Torres. Anthony and Ferreira started dating in early 2022, making their romance Instagram-official that March and getting engaged two months later. Anthony, notably, performed at David's eldest son Brooklyn Beckham's Florida wedding to Nicola Peltz the previous year — and he has been roped into the famous family's recent drama. When Brooklyn, 26, called out his parents for “controlling” behavior in a scathing Instagram statement last week, he blasted his mom, Victoria Beckham, for an “inappropriate” dance at his nuptials spearheaded by Anthony.</p>

[Editor's Note: This article contains spoilers for “The Housemaid.”] One of the reasons director Paul Feig‘s adaptation of Freida McFadden's bestselling thriller “The Housemaid” has been cleaning up at the box office is that it's a movie that not only rewards but demands repeat viewings. That created unusual challenges for production designer Elizabeth Jones and set decorator Paige Mitchell, who had to create a location — the “Winchester” house in which most of the story takes place — that would seem inviting and luxurious on first viewing but sinister and threatening in retrospect. “The overall approach was this idea of, ‘What if Nancy Meyers did a horror film? “Quiet luxury was our baseline, but then how do we take that to another level and make it more interesting?” “We tried to limit color in the more public-facing spaces, but as you get further into the house, we use deeper reds.” The key to several of the furnishings and accessories was to make them seem like things only a wealthy person would own — but a wealthy person with something just a bit off. “On first viewing, everything is nice and cohesive,” Jones said, “but when you look close, there's something nasty about all of it.” That idea informed the selection of art for the house, which Jones said was chosen largely to express the husband's true views about women. “We wanted to show how [Sklenar's character] doesn't really see women as people, but as something for his pleasure,” Mitchell said. “I was trying to signify how he sees the bride as an object and something for him to control and have power over.” “We looked at 75 to 100 homes,” Jones said, adding that she wanted a house like the ones she had read about in books like “Jane Eyre” and “Rebecca,” novels where the central home was a character. The filmmakers ultimately landed on a house they found in an old Zillow listing that not only had many of the characteristics they were looking for but some additional features that informed changes in the script. “In the original story, Andrew was supposed to be pushed off of a balcony,” Jones said. Feig's “more is more” approach was one of the things Jones and Mitchell found most pleasurable about working on the movie. “He really let us go to town,” Jones said. “There were very few times when he would say, ‘Ladies, rein it in. '” Mitchell wondered at times — as when the art department suggested snake wallpaper in a bathroom — if Feig would think they had gone too far. “It really allowed us to push things and get out of that world of same old prop house rentals, which I feel like can really flatten the world of the movie visually. When there's room to play, it's a great opportunity.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Vanderpump Rules” Season 12 newbie, Angelica Jensen, exclusively sat down with EntertainmentNOW to discuss everything that happened so far on season 12. Of course, she couldn't help but acknowledge the OG crew, telling us, “The last cast from the previous seasons have been so iconic, and so we had what felt like humongous shoes to fill.” She added, “I think we all came into this with open hearts, and it's a time capsule moment. It really was a crazy time in all of our lives.” “I think my entrance made it a bit more easy for me. I was really lucky to have that. What caused the trip was her heels over a tripod, with Angelica adding, “Lisa was so nice. Although viewers saw her bonding with Natalie from the start, Angelica revealed she had a deeper friendship with Kim. “My strongest connection in the group was actually Kim. Natalie and I, we had our moments, but I think she just had a lot going on,” she said, referring to the bartender's up and down relationship with Demy Selem and Marcus. What viewers don't see on the show, however, is that Angelica got the okay from Natalie to pursue her interest with Shayne. There's someone else I have my eye on. As for whether she and Shayne are still seeing each other, Angelica teased, “I'd say we're all still very close, but you'll have to watch to really find out, because a lot does happen.” Angelica outing Jason's penis pump was a big deal mid-season, and while she has no regrets talking about it, she does feel bad that it led to a fallout with Audrey. Angelica admitted to taking the joke too far at the time because she felt targeted by Jason and Chris [Hahn], but when she spilled the beans about the penis pump, she had just come from an X-ray session after getting thrown on the mat by Jason during their Jiu-Jitsu date, and was basically trauma dumping on Lisa Vanderpump. “At the end of the day, I never had malicious intent,” she said, expressing how badly she feels about her rift with Audrey. “I think we're still healing and trying to move forward,” Angelica shared, adding that fans will see more of that rift played out at the reunion. Angelica was in a bit of a messy situation with her ex-boyfriend at the start of “Vanderpump Rules” season 12, but as she explained to EntertainmentNOW, it was more of a transition phase. I may or may not have been able to move out, but when I was looking for places, I was getting approved for places more expensive than the situation I was currently in with my ex, because we lived together out of love. My next goal was to be married and have kids with this partner, and unfortunately, we just fell out of love, and I tried so hard to keep that relationship together,” she told us. Circumstances surrounding the rent and lease forced Angelica to stay with her ex for another month, but as she says now, “I'm an independent girlie!” Angelica shared that she did watch the original “Vanderpump Rules” show, but refrained from doing so until after she filmed her season so that she wouldn't be influenced by the former cast. “I really wanted to live my own experience,” she told us. When asked who her favorite OG cast member was, Angelica immediately named one person: Stassi Schroeder. Nobody had her side with the whole pregnancy scare, and she really had to fight to get that respect.” She's an incredible woman, and she's doing her thing, and I totally look up to her,” Angelica gushed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quinton Aaron, best known for starring opposite Sandra Bullock in “The Blind Side,” remains in critical condition after being placed on life support. As friends and loved ones continue to rally around the actor, Bullock is quietly offering her support. Friends now say his condition is more serious than reported. Bullock, who won an Academy Award for her performance in “The Blind Side,” is said to be aware of her former co-star's condition. The performance marked a career milestone for Bullock and brought her Academy Award recognition. A family friend told The Daily Mail that Aaron and Bullock “do check in with each other every once in a while,” describing Bullock as “absolutely incredible.” The source added that Aaron is undergoing extensive testing and receiving round-the-clock medical care. As per the Daily Mail Report, those close to Aaron, his condition remains uncertain as doctors continue to assess the full scope of his health issues. The source said his ongoing “battle with his weight,” including a dramatic 200-pound weight loss last year, “has been a lifelong situation and has always been something to monitor.” “If he survives, there will be a renewed focus on his overall health after so many years have taken their toll,” the source said, noting that the next several days remain critical.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first few days of this year's Sundance, we heard near-constant patter about how in-demand the latest Olivia Wilde film was among distributors. The bidding war was still raging as of yesterday afternoon when, per Deadline, Warner Bros. “new contemporary film label” tossed its hat in the ring. However, this morning, A24 has emerged victorious, and will distribute The Invite after an eight-figure bid, according to The Hollywood Reporter. It's not hard to imagine why the project would attract so much attention, given the names attached to it. Starring and directed by Wilde, The Invite comes from a script written by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack and also stars Seth Rogen, Ed Norton, Penelope Cruz. The sexual rom-com is a remake of the Spanish language film Sentimental, and sees Rogen and Wilde play a married couple on the rocks who host a dinner party with a communicative and passionate couple portrayed by Norton and Cruz. Describing the premiere as “the best night of my life,” Wilde told Deadline that “What this project taught me was it's actually OK to have non-negotiables going into something… this time I was like, ‘Guys, what if we just do it the way we've always wanted to do it?' And it was so rewarding that it made me think, that's what I want to do. But I'm really happy.” The Invite is Wilde's third directorial effort, after 2019's Booksmart and 2023's Don't Worry Darling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Despite rampant misinformation... the reality is that this is an era full of more success stories ... than at any point in history," says Spotify's global head of music. Spotify's global head of music, Charlie Hellman, released a letter to users on Wednesday (Jan. 28), highlighting the platform's contributions to the music industry ahead of its famous Best New Artist Grammy party in Los Angeles. “Spotify paid out more than $11 billion to the music industry, the largest annual payment to music from any retailer in history,” he writes, noting that indie artists and labels accounted for over half of those royalties. Hellman notes that “there are now more artists generating over $100k/year from Spotify alone than were getting stocked on record store shelves at the height of the CD era,” but he says that “rampant misinformation” about streaming has led the public to distrust how successful and lucrative these services have been for musicians. The letter highlights that Spotify pays two-thirds of its music revenue back to the industry and that given recent price hikes and gains in new subscribers the “music payouts have grown as well.” Today, Spotify accounts for roughly 30% of recorded music revenue, and its payouts are growing at a rate that greatly outpaces other music revenue streams. Hellman's letter comes after a few years of expansion for Spotify. In the last two years, the service moved to include audiobooks in its premium tiers, added music videos in an increasing number of markets, added DJ-like features to playlists, and even hinted at plans to build generative AI models “with the consent of the music industry.” Still, some in the music business, particularly the National Music Publishers' Association, are upset with Spotify, given that the platform used its addition of audiobooks in 2024 as an opportunity to reclassify its premium tiers as “bundles,” a special discounted type of subscription tier, and, in turn, to significantly reduce expected payments to songwriters and publishers by nine figures in its first year. Though many music firms have since struck direct deals with Spotify, including the NMPA itself, to improve remuneration, the NMPA's president and CEO David Israelite recently told Bloomberg that despite its deal with Spotify: “it doesn't change the fact” that it is “at war” over bundling. Hellman's letter goes on to point out the company's focuses for 2026, which include increasing videos on the service, fighting deepfakes and streaming fraud, producing more live shows, and leaning into human editorial more than ever. As we look at 2026, I want to start with where 2025 landed. Once again, independent artists and labels accounted for half of all royalties. Big, industry-wide numbers can feel abstract, but that growth is showing up in tangible ways. For example, there are now more artists generating over $100k/year from Spotify alone than were getting stocked on record store shelves at the height of the CD era. Today, Spotify accounts for roughly 30% of recorded music revenue. Last year, our payouts grew by more than 10%, while other industry income sources grew by closer to 4%, making Spotify the primary driver of industry revenue growth in 2025. As that audience has grown, we've also raised prices. Since Spotify pays out two-thirds of all music revenue to the industry – almost 70% of what we take in – as Spotify revenues grow, music payouts have grown as well. By doing all we can to innovate on behalf of the music industry, we've been able to deliver an unrivaled listening experience, helping connect artists with listeners who are most likely to care about their music. One of the reasons we celebrate the Best New Artist nominees each year is because they represent something powerful: artists who've broken through and found their audience. With over 100,000 new songs released daily, competing against the entire history of recorded music, emerging artists face an unprecedented challenge in building the early fanbase every successful career needs. That's why this year our number one priority is to help more new music and new artists cut through the noise and form real connections with fans. Helping fans better understand who artists are and what inspires them establishes real connections that turn casual listeners into long-term fans. Before long, you're finding your way into new catalogs, like Kloser's work with Ed Sheeran or Anderfjärd's work with Alec Benjamin. Video also plays a big role in storytelling, and we've only scratched the surface. Especially now, authenticity matters more than production value. For KATSEYE, early behind-the-scenes Clips on their Countdown Page fueled anticipation by bringing fans into the journey leading up to the release of BEAUTIFUL CHAOS. Storytelling helps fans understand who's behind the music, and ensures authentic creativity stands out from anonymous filler. It's critical to ensuring listeners and rightsholders can trust who made the music they're hearing. When artists start to connect with fans on Spotify, sustaining that attention becomes the next challenge. And being added to a hand-selected editorial playlist can mark a turning point for an artist, growing exposure and streams to new heights. For Leon Thomas, pitching songs through Spotify for Artists led to editorial placements on RADAR and RNB X, introducing his music to listeners in more than 180 countries. Even more important than the numbers they drive, these playlists reflect human expert opinion. In a world of highly individualized listening through algorithms, editorial curation gives artists and fans a common cultural reference point. In 2026, you'll see us create new programs where editorial can unlock more sustained support for emerging artists that help turn early recognition into ongoing momentum. We've already started experimenting with this by bringing our music editors forward through video and storytelling, where they share why a song resonated and what stood out about an artist. We believe that as fans go deeper into an artist's world on Spotify, that connection shouldn't live only online. By understanding how listeners connect with your music, we help artists reach the fans who care most, and are most likely to buy tickets. To date, Spotify has helped artists generate more than $1 billion in ticket sales by connecting fans with live shows through our ticketing partners. In 2026, we're building on that strength with new features that will help more artists turn listening into tangible support from their fans. You've built communities, taken risks, and kept going even when the path felt uncertain. It's our job to make sure Spotify works as hard as you do, and keeps growing in ways that better support artists who are serious about building a career. Our focus is ensuring that growth creates clear, reliable paths for artists to reach fans, and sustain careers. There's a lot of work ahead and I'm excited about what we can build together this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club will return to recap the show on March 4.] It has since morphed into a straightforward, often saccharine hangout dramedy. Characters pop in and out of each other's homes and offices at all times, they eat breakfast before heading to their jobs, go on midday hikes (because, you know, L.A.), and generally don't have boundaries in a mostly endearing way. It appears to be outside the realm of logic, but when the cast is this charming, does it matter? Like he accomplished with Scrubs, Cougar Town, and Ted Lasso, series co-creator Bill Lawrence thrives in this mix of humor and heart. Shrinking encapsulates his strengths, even if this show veers more toward the dramatic side. So Harrison Ford‘s monologue in Shrinking‘s season-two finale, when Paul expresses gratitude to his pals for sticking by him during his health issues, got me. (And yes, I do think Ford should've won some awards for his beautiful performance.) So by the end of this season-three premiere, it's a one-two punch because Paul gets married—hell yeah!—and then quickly realizes how bad his Parkinson's symptoms have gotten. Once again, Shrinking delivers a good mix of goofy humor and waterworks in a way that progresses the plot. As with any opener, “My Bad” catches us up to what the gang has been up to since Thanksgiving—including the fact that Gaby (Jessica Williams) and Derrick #2 (Damon Wayans Jr.) are on the “I love you” stage already—and sets up forthcoming storylines, like Liz's (Christa Miller) unfiltered involvement as a nanny to help Brian (Michael Urie) and Charlie (Devin Kawaoka) prep for their baby's arrival. The most crucial parts of the episode stem from Paul, whom I'll get to shortly, and the reveal that Alice (Lukita Maxwell) might be heading off to Connecticut for school, much to Jimmy's (co-creator Jason Segel) distress. The thought of leaving him and the rest of her Pasadena community scares the crap out of her, even though she's excited at first, showing off her athletic skills and knowing that Wesleyan's coach is watching from the stands (along with Jimmy, Paul, Gaby, Liz, and everyone else, who aggressively cheer her on). Still, it's only when the coach comes to meet her at home and tells her she's in that Alice realizes she isn't ready to go. It's a little weird that her therapist dad's former patient is giving her such solid advice, but honestly, this feels par for the course for a show like Shrinking. Sean's salient counsel actually sums up where I think season three might be heading thematically. In many ways, grief is naturally baked into the premise, considering Shrinking opened with Jimmy despondent over his wife's death a few months ago, while everyone rallied around him for support. Season two, according to what Lawrence told The A.V. That's why Louis (co-creator Brett Goldstein) entered the picture. Louis was the drunk driver responsible for killing Jimmy's wife, and much of the sophomore run was about Jimmy, Alice, Brian, Gaby, et al. reconciling with how the accident affected Louis and shattered his own life, with Jimmy eventually forgiving the guy, mostly so that he can start to heal himself. It feels like the pitch for the third season was “moving on.” Alice has to evolve instead of being the one her dad continually keeps leaning on, and that can happen only if she prioritizes herself and her education. I'm glad Sean not only convinced her to call the coach again so she can go to Wesleyan but also that he made Jimmy realize why he has to let her go. Then there's Gaby, who seems stuck in her work, realizing she isn't helping people the way she intended to. Gaby does have one goal in “My Bad,” though, and that is to ensure Paul gets married and that Julie (Wendie Malick) gets a lovely wedding. So what if they decide to tie the knot only to avoid filling a barrage of legal forms? There are more than a few hiccups, including the fact that a grumpy Paul doesn't care to celebrate much and doesn't realize that Julie seems excited about the prospect of wearing a white dress rather than having to go to court to sign the document. But it's okay, Meg (Lily Rabe) shows up anyway, and Paul and Julie happily walk down the aisle, with Jimmy giving yet another moving speech about finding love and hope in unexpected ways. Cue those tears I was talking about. At least they're happy ones (for now). At the very end of “My Bad,” Paul spots a stranger sitting in Liz's kitchen. The two had hit it off quickly, bonding over how each of them is dealing with having Parkinson's. But like he said in that season-two finale, at least he's got his community to help him through it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump said he feels “terrible” about the recent deaths of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, but he feels worse about Good because her parents are “tremendous Trump people.” Will Cain quickly brought up the events in Minneapolis, where an ICE takeover of the city has resulted in federal agents shooting and killing two U.S. citizens. “We're going to de-escalate a little bit,” Trump acknowledged while simultaneously saying the polling numbers in Minnesota are “doing better than they've done in many years.” “The entire country is talking about what happened this past week in Minnesota,” Cain said, adding that everyone has seen the video of Pretti's murder and has an opinion. “I think the whole thing is terrible,” Trump replied. “I don't like the fact that he was carrying a gun… It's pretty unusual. The daughter was, I don't know if you could say radicalized. Trump previously addressed Good's death during a press conference at the White House, during which he also mentioned her parents being Trump fans. “They're gonna make mistakes sometimes,” he said of ICE. “ICE is gonna be too rough with somebody. Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot in the head by a masked ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month. The tragedy occurred one day after thousands of federal agents were deployed to Minnesota for a 30-day immigration enforcement “surge.” The agent has since been identified as Jonathan Ross. In the aftermath of the shooting, Trump administration officials claimed that Good was a “domestic terrorist” who had attempted to harm agents with her vehicle. Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot and killed on Saturday in Minneapolis by a group of immigration agents. The killing was captured on video by multiple bystanders. In the footage, Pretti can be seen filming officers with his cell phone, and is pepper sprayed after attempting to assist a woman who was shoved to the ground by immigration agents. Two agents then shoot at him a total of 10 times in the span of a few seconds, appearing to continue to fire even after he collapses. Alex Pretti Helped Veterans and Owned a Gun. Why Is Country Music Silent About His Death? ‘Chaos': Behind the Scenes of Amazon's Melania Trump Doc Neil Young Trashes Amazon, Gives His Complete Musical Catalog to Greenland for Free Trump Says He Feels ‘Terrible' About Alex Pretti, But Worse About Renee Good Because Her Parents Were ‘Trump Fans' The Department of Homeland Security and administration officials moved quickly to present Pretti — even before he had been positively identified — as a would-be domestic terrorist. Following massive public backlash, including from Republicans, the government has slowly shifted the narrative to blame Pretti for carrying a gun to a protest. Yesterday, Trump sent Border Czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to meet with Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. According to Walz's office, the officials “agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals.” Homan wrote on X, “While we don't agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point, and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rarely does an opening song choice so precisely define the mood of a film like LCD Soundsystem's exquisitely tortured anthem “New York, I Love You but You're Bringing Me Down” over the opening frames of writer-director Noah Segan's quiet knockout, The Only Living Pickpocket in New York. Sundance's Last Park City Hoorah: How to Go Out (and Ski) in Style Venue: Sundance Film Festival (Premieres)Cast: John Turturro, Giancarlo Esposito, Will Price, Tatiana Maslany, Steve Buscemi, Lori Tan Chinn, Kelvin Han Yee, Karina Arroyave, John Gallagher Jr., Victoria Moroles, Jack Mulhern, Michael Hsu Rosen, Aida Turturro, Mark CayneDirector-screenwriter: Noah Segan Turturro is unshowy but magnificent in his best film role in years, an honorable hustler who still carries himself with dignity despite a lifetime of regrets and a world gradually leaving him behind. Segan has clearly been paying attention during his long association with Rian Johnson, who first cast him in Brick and has found roles for him in pretty much everything since. He moved into directing with a segment of the 2019 horror anthology, Scare Package, following in 2022 with his first solo feature, the Shudder vampire flick Blood Relatives. Segan's latest is a complete swerve into more nuanced genre territory and more complex storytelling, not to mention a singularly great New York movie. The hypnotic, patiently held closing shot alone will strike a chord with natives, transplants and ex-residents alike. A well-heeled businessman (John Gallagher Jr.) applies a spritz of cologne, slips on his chunky Philippe Patek watch and exits his upscale apartment building, heading for the subway when no cabs materialize. All we see is a quick shot of peak-hour strap-hangers packed in tight, with Harry close behind the guy. Harry obviously has been at this game since he was a young man, when more people carried thick wads of cash. Still, he scrapes by, offloading resaleable items through his old friend Ben (an endearingly spiky Steve Buscemi) and laughing off the suggestion of tech-savvy young scammer Eve (Victoria Moroles) that he should shift to online theft. He believes in circulating his stolen dough where it matters — whether it's a healthcare worker at the facility that looks after his nonverbal, disabled wife Rosie (Karina Arroyave) during the day; or a neighbor in their Bronx apartment building who looks in on her when she's at home and Harry steps out to ply his trade. But it's the thoughtfulness and resourcefulness of a man whose cerebral cogs are constantly turning that defines him. One of the most poignant aspects of his performance is the way his face is transformed by love and devotion when he's with Rosie — gently brushing her hair; carrying her up multiple flights of stairs and then returning for her wheelchair when the elevator is out of order; cheerfully nattering away in one-sided conversations; or spinning “Native New Yorker” on vinyl and goofily dancing around the room serenading her. Harry has no idea what it is and nor does Ben, whose dinosaur desktop is about 500 upgrades short of the capability necessary to read the thing. Ben sends him to another fence in Chinatown (Kelvin Han Yee), who takes the USB and a few other items off Harry's hands. Dylan and his posse are well-connected, so it takes them relatively little time to track down Harry using CCTV footage. Watching The Only Living Pickpocket in New York, you are reminded of how rarely we now get to see movies fully shot on locations in the city and how there really is no substitute for the real thing. One such instance is an amusing bit of improvisation in which he gets backup by greasing the palm of a panhandler played by Aida Turturro. The encounter with Kelly — which reverberates in a lovely moment later on — is made even more touching by the heavily embellished account of it he shares with Rosie. The ways in which Harry's detective buddy Warren (Giancarlo Esposito in fine form), Ben, Eve and Billy (Mark Cayne), a young pickpocket who gets tips from the old-timer, all factor into the closing developments demonstrate that Segan has a real gift for intricate plotting, not to mention a deft hand at creating a satisfying ending rich in emotional shading. The final scenes also involve a drive across the river with an extended cameo from a major-name star, whose character and Harry — in a duologue loaded with revealing insights — seem to develop an understanding, despite circumstances that could hardly be more unfavorable. This is a remarkably layered and rewarding story, especially for a movie running less than 90 minutes; editor Hilda Rasula keeps the pace steady and the transitions fluid. A big assist comes from Gary Lionelli's full-bodied score, with jazzy retro funk riffs that add excitement to the early scenes and more bluesy, somber sounds in the later action. Even before the Cole Porter standard “I Happen to Like New York” comes in over the closing shot, it's clear this is a movie very close to born-and-bred New Yorker Segan's heart. And it's a gift to the wonderful Turturro, another native son, who imbues his role with a lifetime of personal history, underplaying everything with the most delicate restraint.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's what an all-star lineup reminds us on the eve of the FIFA World Cup 2026, as Van Halen's 1984 classic “Jump” gets a makeover. J Balvin and Amber Mark take vocal duties on the cover, while Blink-182's Travis Barker fills it on up the drums, and guitar hero Steve Vai works his magic on the six-string.

Cole Celebrates His B-Day With Surprise DJ Clue-Hosted 'Birthday Blizzard '26' EP, Featuring 4 New Freestyles Not only does Vai stand at the very top of the ladder of great electric guitarists, as did late Van Halen guitarist, keyboardist and co-founder Eddie Van Halen, who passed in October 2020, aged 65. Vai went on to record and tour with VH singer David Lee Roth, who pursued a solo career following the release of 1984, the parent album of “Jump.” For old school VH fans, it was a shocking sonic shift away from their traditional hard rock and blues-leaning sounds. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, a position it locked down for five weeks. In the United Kingdom, “Jump” leapt to No. 7, and is one of the band's two top 10 appearances. “At Coca-Cola, we believe in the power of shared experiences. Our creative vision for this campaign is to harness the incredible energy of the FIFA World Cup and the rollercoaster of emotions that only this tournament can deliver, transforming them into real, tangible connections.” Through “innovative experiences and compelling content,” Roy continues, “we're bringing fans closer than ever before, whether they're cheering in digital spaces, local bars, or at-home watch parties.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

Many will be looking for homes, but if this year is anything like last year, it may take some time for those sales to close. We'll be tracking all of them as they come in. Section: PremieresDistributor: A24Directors: Olivia WildeDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: This was a true, old-fashioned, late night bidding war between multiple interested buyers that ended up being a 72-hour, marathon competition. IndieWire hears that Neon, Black Bear, Netflix, Searchlight, and Focus Features — and even Warner Bros. at the 11th hour — were all in the mix for what was Olivia Wilde's third feature as a director. Others may have bid more, but Wilde was determined to get a theatrical deal. Related Stories How Did Channing Tatum Make His Young ‘Josephine' Co-Star Feel Comfortable?

Section: MidnightDistributor: NeonDirector: Adrian ChiarellaDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: A queer, coming-of-age horror movie? “Leviticus” is about two teenage boys who have to fight off a violent entity capable of taking the form of the other. The film plays on the real-life horrors of conversion therapy and stars Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen, Jeremy Blewitt, Ewen Leslie, Davida McKenzie, Nicholas Hope, Zahra Newman, and Mia Wasikowska. The film's unique genre premise from writer/director Adrian Chiarella, his feature debut, was good enough for Neon to jump on worldwide rights in a seven-figure deal, as well as the first sale of the festival, an otherwise slow affair thus far, though one that has sparked an early bidding war for at least one other title. Section: PremieresDistributor: Focus FeaturesDirectors: Daniel Roher and Charlie TyrellBuzz: The “Navalny” director teams up with producer Daniel Kwan (“Everything Everywhere All At Once”) on a film that goes deep into the perils and promise of artificial intelligence, all through the lens of Roher debating whether this is a good moment to bring a child into the world. Section: PremieresDistributor: ESPNDirectors: Liz Garbus and Elizabeth WolffBuzz: More than a sports doc, this portrait of Billie Jean King looks at the tennis icon's compulsion to hide her sexual orientation and eating disorders. Section: PremieresDistributor: Searchlight PicturesDirector: Andrew StantonBuzz: Though he's directed plenty on TV, Pixar vet Andrew Stanton is returning to a live-action feature for the first time since “John Carter” dropped way back in 2012. Section: World DocumentaryDistributor: PBS/FrontlineDirectors: Itab Azzam, Jack MacInnesBuzz: This documentary was filmed over 10 years and follows a Syrian refugee girl who travels to Germany and then back to Syria with her family. It stars Midori Francis as a woman who takes part in a bizarre weight loss craze that involves eating human ashes, only to become possessed by demonic forces in the process. Section: PremieresDistributor: Nat GeoDirector: Sara DosaBuzz: Like her Sundance breakout “Fire of Love” before it, “Time and Water” is a more elevated nature documentary and follows an Icelandic writer eulogizing both a glacier and his grandparents. Section: MidnightDistributor: A24Director: Ian TuasonBuzz: A micro-budget horror movie in the vein of “Paranormal Activity” that first played at Fantasia Fest, the actual producers of “Paranormal Activity” helped give the film a new cut and are hoping for another horror hit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the big day approaches, Rosé sat down with Alex Cooper of Call Her Daddy for a special episode titled “Alex Cooper Presents: A Grammy's Special,” which arrives tomorrow. After acknowledging that it's been a “big subject” and both she and her fans are itching for her to be on tour, Rosé says that she wants to be able to present crowds with a “solid world” first but didn't want to “feel rushed.” The singer explains that her first solo album, Rosie, was a “learning curve” and she needed time to “really learn about” the LP. “I feel like to create a whole world onstage, I need more time to build on that with extra songs as well, because right now we have, what 12?” she continues. “And I don't feel ready to create a whole body of work for everyone yet.” ‘Chaos': Behind the Scenes of Amazon's Melania Trump Doc Neil Young Trashes Amazon, Gives His Complete Musical Catalog to Greenland for Free So I don't want to ruin that experience.” This year's Grammy Awards will be hosted by Trevor Noah and held on Sunday, Feb. 1, broadcasting live on CBS and Paramount+ from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Rolling Stone has predicted that Rosé and Bruno Mars' “APT.,” a track based on a Korean drinking game, will take home Record of the Year, calling it a “collaboration that was impossible to forget.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>
