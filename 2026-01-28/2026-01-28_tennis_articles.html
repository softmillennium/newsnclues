                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Australian Open doubles draw is down to its final four pairs. With reigning champions Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend out, a new champion is guaranteed. Here's a closer look at the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz doubles semifinalists in Melbourne Park: Seventh-seeded pair Aleksandra Krunić and Anna Danilina knocked off the top doubles pair in the world in Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend. In their two three-set matches in Melbourne so far, Krunić-Danilina have dominated when it mattered most with third-set bagels. Krunić-Danilina eventually reached the final, but fell to Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini. Their next task is Gabriela Dabrowski and Luisa Stefani in the semifinals. The duo has won all their matches in straight sets in Melbourne, marking a successful start for the rekindled doubles tandem. Hsieh Su-wei and Ostapenko had come in with plenty of momentum, with a title in Brisbane a few weeks ago. Prior to 2026, Dabrowski-Stefani most recently played together in a few tournaments in 2023, including Roland Garros, Madrid and Stuttgart, among others. Both Stefani and Dabrowski were at the WTA Finals Riyadh in November 2025, playing alongside different partners. Both are top 15 players in the doubles rankings, with Mertens at No. In their quarterfinal win, they had five aces to their opponents' one and finished with four pivotal breaks to get the edge. Zvonareva, 41, returned to tennis after a long layoff at the end of last year, and reached the final with Shibahara in Canberra earlier this month. The Australian Open doubles draw is down to its final four pairs. With reigning champions Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend out, a new champion is guaranteed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elena Rybakina defeated Iga Swiatek to reach the Australian Open semifinals, and she'll play Jessica Pegula for a spot in the final. We break down what to watch for in Melbourne's second semifinal. Elena Rybakina and Jessica Pegula both handled higher-seeded players in straight sets to advance to Thursday's WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz semifinals at the Australian Open. Rybakina finished with a flourish, winning eight of the last nine games. Complete command in the critical category of second serves. Pegula won 16 of her 25 second-serve points (.640), while Anisimova hit seven double faults -- all in the winnable second set. "I've always been someone that doesn't really panic -- I don't really get too emotional,” Pegula told reporters. "I don't really get too upset about things, so I think that's just kind of where the stability comes from. I'm very persistent as far as always wanting to get better, always wanting to work on stuff, always feeling like I can do things that maybe people thought I couldn't, and kind of improve in those areas." Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, says that maturity and quickly adapting to little challenges are necessary to win seven matches in a fortnight. "So all these conditions [are] a bit tricky. How in form are these four WTA Tour semifinalists? We break down these two stellar matches, with thoughts from writers Greg Garber and Brad Kallet: Rybakina won the last one -- in a three-setter in Riyadh, last fall -- but they've never met at a Grand Slam. This is Pegula's second straight major semifinal, and she's looking to make her second final in three semifinal tries. She's the only woman in the Open era to advance to her first three Grand Slam semifinals after her 30th birthday. Rybakina's followed up her title at the WTA Finals with a strong start in 2026, winning seven of eight matches. Greg Garber: It's not common knowledge, but since Wimbledon last year, Rybakina has won more matches (35) than any other woman. The current run is 18 of 19, losing only to Karolina Muchova earlier this month in Brisbane. Perhaps more relevant, Rybakina has claimed an impressive eight consecutive Top 10 wins. And, as you know, Brad, Pegula is a Top 10 player. She hammered 11 aces against Swiatek and converted four of seven break points. Rybakina leads all women in Melbourne with 35 aces. "The most important for me," she said, "[is] to be focused on my serve, since it's a big advantage if it works." Brad Kallet: Pegula tends to slip under the radar, doesn't she, Greg? Everyone knows how good she is, but we often take her consistency for granted. Even Iva Jovic generated more buzz, with her run to the quarters. She'll have her work cut out for her in Rybakina, who is playing as well as anyone on tour, but the 31-year-old knows how to handle the power players. Just look at her quarterfinal match against Anisimova as proof. If she can neutralize Rybakina, change direction, create unforced errors and maintain her dominance on second serve, she has a great shot. We haven't had a down-to-the-wire three-setter in a bit, Greg, but I agree that we'll get one tonight. Pegula gets it done and reaches her second Slam final. Elena Rybakina defeated Iga Swiatek to reach the Australian Open semifinals, and she'll play Jessica Pegula for a spot in the final.

Physical struggles followed, Djokovic surged back, and Musetti eventually retired in the fifth set. Five years later, on a different surface, history repeated itself. Grigor Dimitrov was the most recent example before Musetti at last year's Wimbledon, where he retired due to a pectoral injury when leading Jannik Sinner 6-3, 7-5, 2-2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lorenzo Musetti's hopes of ending his Grand Slam drought against Novak Djokovic were dashed in cruel fashion on Wednesday afternoon in Melbourne. Stepping onto Rod Laver Arena having lost all three previous meetings with Djokovic at the majors, Musetti had produced a superb all-around quarter-final display to open a two-set lead, but he appeared to injure his upper right leg in the third game of the third set. Although the Italian tried to continue after receiving treatment from the physio at 1-2, he was ultimately forced to stop after two hours and eight minutes of play. “I don't know what to say except I feel really sorry for him and he was a far better player,” said Djokovic in his on-court interview. These kinds of things happen in sport. It happened to me a few times, but being in the quarters of a Grand Slam, two sets to love up, and being in full control, it's so unfortunate. He should have been a winner today, no doubt.” By stepping on court Wednesday, Djokovic became just the third man (after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer) to compete in 1,400 tour-level matches. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings will know he will have to produce a markedly improved performance if he wants to overcome two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner or Ben Shelton in the final four.

He broke Djokovic's serve five times across the first two sets, according to Infosys Stats, while the Serbian — who was playing his first match since Saturday after advancing through the fourth round via walkover against Jakub Mensik — struggled to find any rhythm with his aggressive game plan from the baseline. “The strategy worked very well for the first couple of games, and then it changed completely,” said Djokovic, who now holds a 10-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead over Musetti. “Four winners in the first two games, and no unforced errors. When you think the point is finished, it's not. Obviously, a bit more wind today, swirly conditions, and when you attack him you don't know what to expect… What can I say. Yes, I have a blister here and there, but nothing really majorly bothered me. I just wasn't feeling the ball today in the first couple of sets, but that's also due to his quality and his variety of game. I'm just extremely lucky to get through this one today.” Djokovic is chasing a record-extending 11th Australian Open crown and 25th major overall. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has advanced to the semi-finals of the past five majors he has played but has not won any of those last-four matches. 3 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings if he had reached his third major semi-final.

Having the lead in the match like that and being forced to retire is something that, of course, I could never imagine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On her fourth try, Jessica Pegula advanced to her first semifinal in Melbourne on Wednesday with a straight-sets victory over compatriot Amanda Anisimova, the third American she's beaten at the event. Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play Five years later, it was Pegula who reigned victorious in an all-American affair, outlasting No. 4 seed Amanda Anisimova 6-2, 7-6 (1) in 1 hour and 35 minutes on Wednesday to reach her first Australian Open semifinal, where she'll face Elena Rybakina. “It's awesome,” Pegula said in her on-court interview. “I was like, ‘It's got to be coming, you know. It's the third time Pegula has advanced to a Grand Slam semifinal, and her first time at a Major other than the US Open. She did it by continuing her dominance against fellow Americans. The win marked her eighth straight victory over an American at a Grand Slam. She also became the first American woman to defeat three compatriots in a single Australian Open since Gigi Fernández accomplished the feat in 1993. She also improved to 4-0 against Anisimova at the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz level. Keeping it clean: Both Pegula and Anisimova reached the quarterfinals without dropping a set. But while that suggested both were in top form, Anisimova's path had been far shakier than the scorelines indicated. She finished with 44 unforced errors, including seven double faults in the second set alone, to just 18 winners. She hit 21 unforced errors to 20 winners, and aside from a costly double fault while serving for the match at 6-5 in the second set, she kept her margins tight throughout. While Anisimova landed a slightly higher percentage of first serves (61% to 60%), Pegula dominated nearly every other category. Pegula punished Anisimova's second serve, routinely stepping in and attacking. It was part of a concerted effort; one she executed from start to finish. Aggressive returning: Thanks in large part to winning more than 60% of points on Anisimova's second serve, Pegula generated 11 break points, including seven in the second set alone. After Anisimova earned her first break of the match for a 5-3 lead, giving herself a chance to serve out the set, Pegula immediately broke back. She held in the next game, then broke again for a 6-5 with the help of a forehand winner that set up her second break point. DO NOT GO ANYWHERE - we are into a tiebreaker in the second set! So luckily, yeah, I was able to kind of flip that switch. Pegula grabbed the first mini-break at 3-1, then took another point off Anisimova's serve for a 4-1 lead as frustration began to set in for the two-time Grand Slam finalist. Pegula capitalized, reeling off seven straight points to close out the match and book a semifinal date with Rybakina. What's next: “She has a massive serve, big groundies, cool as a cucumber, you get nothing out of her,” Pegula said of Rybakina. “And she's been playing some great tennis, honestly since the end of last year. But I'm going to do my best to hopefully crack the code on her for the next round and we'll see how it goes.” Pegula and Rybakina have split their six career meetings. Pegula won their first matchup in Miami in 2022, but Rybakina claimed their most recent encounter, rallying from a set down in the semis of the WTA Finals a few months ago. A win would send Pegula to her first Australian Open final, while for Rybakina, a second appearance in the championship match is on the line. On her fourth try, Jessica Pegula advanced to her first semifinal in Melbourne on Wednesday with a straight-sets victory over compatriot Amanda Anisimova, the third American she's beaten at the event.</p>

She dug out of a 0-40 deficit at 1-1 in the first set, and only lost 12 points in eight subsequent service games. Eleven of her 26 winners were aces, and she hit just 19 unforced errors -- but 14 of those miscues came in the first set, where nine of 12 games went to deuce. Swiatek, by contrast, struggled for the same consistency. She hit just 10 winners, and her error count ballooned to 25 by the match's end. "I'm really pleased with the win," Rybakina said in her on-court interview. "We know each other pretty well, and I was just trying to stay aggressive. In the first set, the first serve wasn't working for both of us, so we were trying to step in on the second serve and put pressure on each other. In the second set, I just started to play more free, serve better, and I'm really happy with the win."

The Kazakh told reporters after her victory that her late-season 2025 surge, capped by an undefeated title run at the WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF, is still putting wind in her sails in Melbourne. "Like even today, a couple of shots were very close to the line, on the line, so I'm glad it was going my way, but definitely the most important for my game to stay aggressive." Swiatek, meanwhile, told reporters that she struggled to keep up with the "high intensity" match after a first set that could've gone either way. Sometimes it was, like, 30-All and, for example, I missed one return. You know, I wanted to be aggressive on the second serve, so sometimes, yeah, will make mistakes. But if you want to break, you need to make it in in the moment like that. So there's no breakthrough lesson," she continued. "I'm just going to keep doing my job, and hopefully the next tournament I'll get some stuff, you know, settled in terms of what I wanted to do with my game." Elena Rybakina advanced to the Australian Open semifinals after defeating Iga Swiatek in straight sets and will face No.</p>

In the meantime, organizers pointed players to data available through its technology partner, Bolt6, which also manages electronic line calling at the tournament.“Wearables are currently not permitted at Grand Slams. The Australian Open is involved in ongoing discussions on how this situation could change,” organizers said in a statement.“Some wearables provide athletes with an indication of internal load (measures like heart rate), which can give them a 360-degree view of the work they're doing and how their bodies respond.“In terms of other data provided to athletes and their teams at the AO, players can monitor key external load measures such as distance covered, changes of direction, high acceleration events and speed/spin of shots via Bolt6.” Tennis Australia confirmed there are “ongoing discussions” with WHOOP about the issue.
