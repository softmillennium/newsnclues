The president relished in the idea of killing Somalis at a rally before the incident.

President Donald Trump attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) just hours before she was assaulted on Tuesday evening, with the president mocking her and relishing in violence against Somalis at a campaign rally.

As Omar spoke during a town hall on Trump's militarized raid of Minnesota, a man suddenly lunged at her and sprayed her with an unknown substance in a syringe. Video of the attack circulated widely online.

Omar was undeterred and continued the town hall. Police arrested the man, who they identified as Anthony James Kazmierczak. Her office later issued a statement saying that she is “okay” after the incident.

Just hours before, at a rally in Clive, Iowa, the president waged another one of his bigoted attacks on Omar — one of countless times he's fixated on the lawmaker in recent months.

When speaking about supposed violence caused by immigrants, Trump said immigrants must “show that they can love our country, they have to be proud. Not like Ilhan Omar.” The crowd booed. 

“Did you see that wise guy? You know, she's always talking about, ‘the Constitution provides me with the following,'” he said, putting on a mocking voice. 

He went on to make racist remarks about Somalia and Somali people, as he's done numerous times in recent months, and relished in the idea of committing violence against them.

“They're good at one thing: pirates. But they don't do that anymore. You know why? Because they get the same treatment from us as the drug dealers get: Boom, boom, boom,” he said to laughter and applause, referring to his administration's illegal boat strike campaign. “When we see them going in, ping, that's the end of that.”

Trump has relentlessly attacked Omar as his administration has unleashed violence on Minnesota, sometimes for days in a row. He has said that she should be “thrown the hell out” of the U.S. while spreading lies about her status as a citizen; repeated false conspiracy theories about her; and, just on Monday, said that his administration is investigating her.

Omar has previously said that the point of Trump's campaign against her, which she has dubbed as a “creepy obsession,” is to stoke violence. Other lawmakers, like Representatives Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) and Randy Fine (R-Florida), have piled onto the attacks, with the latter at one point calling her a “Muslim terrorist.” 

That violence came to fruition against Omar — who has been loudly advocating against Trump's raid of Minneapolis and has backed calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 

During the attack, the man appeared to yell “you must resign” at the lawmaker while spraying her. Minneapolis police have reportedly sent a forensics squad to analyze the scene, and the liquid apparently had a strong foul smell resembling that of vinegar.

Early reports claiming to have found Kazmierczak's social media feeds have found that he is a fan of Trump, and has for years made posts in favor of the president.

The lawmaker was defiant in the face of the attack — even squaring up to punch him back seconds after it happened. Video showed aides telling Omar to end the town hall so she could be checked out. But she insisted on staying, saying: “We will continue. These fucking assholes are not going to get away with this.”

Back on the podium, she said, “Here's the reality that people like this ugly man don't understand. We are Minnesota strong, and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us.”

Later in a statement on social media, she said that “I'm a survivor so this small agitator isn't going to intimidate me from doing my work.”

Trump and others like Fine even continued to stoke hatred against Omar after the attack, suggesting that it was her fault or that she deserved it. 

“I think she's a fraud. I really don't think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,” Trump told reporters. He said that “I hope I don't have to bother” watching the video of the incident.

In an interview on far right Newsmax on Wednesday morning, Fine said, “I blame Ilhan Omar for what happened.” 

Many Democrats, however, spoke out in support of Omar after the attack.

“My sis is a survivor. She fled war at 8 yrs old,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan). “What these people don't understand is that this country belongs to all of us. I pray one day Ilhan won't have to put her fists up to defend herself. Her lived experience is why she won't let them win. We are blessed to have her in Congress.”

The attack comes just days after another Democratic House member, Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost (Florida), was assaulted by a man who Frost said cited Trump in his attack. The man reportedly said: “We are going to deport you and your kind.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks.

We can only resist Trump's attacks by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

            The FBI is serving a warrant Wednesday at an elections office in Fulton County, Georgia, as it probes alleged voter fraud in the 2020 election.
    


            A source familiar with the matter told CNN that the search is related to an effort by the Justice Department to seize election records and search of alleged voter fraud in the county, including Atlanta, which has long been a centerpiece of President Donald Trump's baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.
    


            The Justice Department previously sued Fulton County officials to force them to hand over records related to the 2020 election. A judge has not ruled in the case yet.
    


            A review by the DOJ in Trump's first term did not find evidence to support allegations of widespread fraud that could have changed the result of last month's presidential election.
    


            ​In the weeks after his 2020 election loss Trump launched a campaign in Georgia to overturn the election in his favor, including a now infamous call during which Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican who voted for Trump, to “find” enough votes to overcome his loss. Biden's win was ultimately affirmed in the state.
    


            Much of his ire was focused on Fulton County, whose voter base is largely non-white and voted for Biden. Trump and several associates were criminally charged for attempting to overturn the election results in the state after leaving office, though the case was later dropped.
    


            Since securing a second term, Trump has repeatedly asserted that those he believed to be responsible for, or connected to, his claims of widespread voter fraud would face consequences. The top federal prosecutor in Atlanta resigned days before Trump was inaugurated because the president believed he was not doing enough to find examples of the alleged fraud, according to a Senate report. BJ Pak had in fact investigated and did not substantiate various claims of election fraud advanced by Trump and his allies, the report says.
    


            The Justice Department's ongoing civil case against Fulton County seeks 2020 election records including ballots, ballots stubs and absentee ballot signature envelopes, according to court filings. In the case, the department has claimed it needs to assess the county's compliance with federal laws that concern voter registration. It has also pointed to a subpoena issued by the State Election Board — which has a majority aligned with Trump — for those records.
    


Bondi's injection of voter roll demands into Minneapolis ICE tensions draws claims of ‘ransom'



            The department's request that a judge immediately order the release of the documents is still pending. In court filings, Fulton County election officials said that court officials, not the election office, currently have those materials under seal.
    


            In addition to its lawsuit for Fulton County records, the Justice Department is suing two dozen states for non-public voter roll information.
    


            Election officials were also alarmed when a GOP operative claiming to working with the administration reached out to local election officials in Colorado last year seeking access to their voting equipment, CNN previously reported, (The White House denied it had authorized the operative's outreach).
    


            FBI Atlanta declined to give additional information, saying that “our investigation into this matter is ongoing.”

ICE does not have to report on injuries or deaths that happen during arrests.

This article was originally published by Documented, an independent, non-profit newsroom dedicated to reporting with and for immigrant communities in New York City. The original article can be accessed here.

Months before ICE agents' tactics were put in the national spotlight by the deaths of two civilians in Minneapolis, José Castro-Rivera, a young man from Honduras, was hit by a vehicle on a busy interstate highway in Virginia. He was running to escape arrest during what ICE officers described as a “targeted, intelligence-based immigration enforcement operation.”

Castro-Rivera, 25, died on the spot.

Four months earlier, on June 10, 2025, Jaime Alanis Garcia, a Mexican immigrant, fell from the top of a greenhouse in Camarillo, California, during an ICE raid at a cannabis facility. Garcia, 56, died two days later.

Then, in August, just over 60 miles away in Southern California, a 52-year-old Guatemalan immigrant, Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez, was also hit by an SUV on a freeway while evading ICE officers. Less than a month later, another person was killed in Chicago by federal agents. On September 12, 2025, Silverio Villegas González was shot “multiple” times in his car by ICE agents amid the agency's infamous “Operation Midway Blitz.”

ICE did not identify the agents involved in the killings of Castro-Rivera, Garcia, and Valdez. While the October death came with the promise of a formal report within 90 days, ICE neither publicly tracked nor logged the other fatal arrest incidents, nor did it say whether the operations were evaluated by any internal or external agency.

Through extensive scans of national and local outlets, as well as social media platforms including X, Instagram, and Facebook, as well as DHS public statements, Documented logged and analyzed more than 20 cases of violent — and sometimes fatal — ICE arrests nationwide since the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration ramped up.

Since May 2025, Documented found, there has not been a single month in which an intended detainee was not severely injured during an ICE operation. Federal agents from Chicago and Los Angeles to Oregon and Maryland shot targets, unleashed dogs on targeted detainees, and used chokeholds and tear gas.

A complete picture of the violence committed during the DHS crackdown is unknown. While the agency is required by law to release reports after the death of detained immigrants, it is not required to report on deaths that happen during the arrest process, which makes it difficult to keep track of just how many people get injured or killed as ICE continues to arrest immigrants nationwide. Of the nearly two dozen such cases identified by Documented, DHS published official press releases for only two. 

The agency has a policy to track uses of force, but it has not released data since 2024. In February 2023, DHS adopted a policy stating that it would not “tolerate” any use of excessive force. Such conduct would be “unlawful,” it said, and failing to report it would constitute “misconduct.”

Seven months later, the department established the Office of Homeland Security Statistics (OHSS). The unit was tasked with logging all instances of use of force by federal agents during enforcement operations, including “deadly force.” This included any “serious bodily injury” caused during such operations — from gunshots and strikes to the neck or head to the use of strangulation techniques.

That year, ICE officers' use of force led to serious injuries and/or hospitalizations in nine cases. Two other deaths were also reported.

There was, however, a caveat in which cases federal agencies had to log with the OHSS. “Use of physical tactics or techniques that do not deliver a kinetic impact, such as arm holds, are not reportable incidents,” read a footnote in the OHSS report published in March 2024 — the only one produced so far.

It remains unclear how many of the two dozen incidents identified by Documented were reported to OHSS by ICE, or whether they were logged as use-of-force incidents at all.

ICE did not respond to questions from Documented about its policy to formally report injuries suffered by detainees during arrest attempts — either publicly or internally. 

As far as public reporting is concerned, it has done so seemingly only to defend its officers. In most, if not all instances, injured detainees have been called dangerous in official statements.

DHS press statements, as recently seen in Minneapolis with the deaths of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, have often differed from evidence of detainees being severely injured during ICE's arrest attempts as well. 

For example, in a recent case in Washington, a video captured an ICE operation to detain 27-year-old Jose Paniagua Calderón in front of a Mexican restaurant in central Vancouver on Dec. 4, 2025.

The minute-long arrest video, shared by his sister-in-law on social media, is graphic. It shows Calderón screaming in pain as a silver SUV drives over both his legs while he is held down by a masked ICE agent. At least three other officers stand around him.

Calderón's screams, however, were called “an Oscar-level performance” and “pure theatre” by an ICE spokesperson two days later. 

In another case in Chicago last October, when U.S.-citizen Marimar Martinez was shot at five times by a federal agent, ICE issued a press release describing her as a “domestic terrorist.”

The DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, used the same label for Renee Nicole Good shortly after she was shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, 2026.

In another case, the day before Christmas 2025, the department posted photographs on its X account showing a white van crashed into a tree. ICE officers had shot at the driver while attempting an arrest in Glen Burnie, Maryland, causing him to lose control of the vehicle and injure a passenger.

“Fearing for their lives and public safety, the ICE officers defensively fired their service weapons,” the DHS post read. “Thankfully, the ICE officers were not severely injured.”

No report was promised.

Last week, on Jan. 14, 2026, amid massive protests against the federal agency following the killing of Good, another Venezuelan immigrant was shot in the leg by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

The federal agency said it conducted a “targeted traffic stop” of an alleged Venezuelan immigrant, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, minutes before 7 p.m. that evening. Sosa-Celis, DHS said, “fled the scene in his vehicle, crashed into a parked car, and proceeded to flee on foot.”

When caught, he resisted, according to the DHS press release. Sosa-Celis and two other Venezuelan immigrants who emerged from a nearby apartment, the agency said, attacked the ICE agent with “a snow shovel and broom handle.”

The agent shot Sosa-Celis.

DHS published a press release the following day. Nearly identical to the language used after the incident last Christmas, it stated: “Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life.”

Minnesota state investigators “have been on the scene,” Governor Tim Walz posted on X a few hours later. He urged people to remain calm. “Don't give him what he wants,” he wrote, referring to President Trump.

The federal agency, however, did not say whether it would produce any report on the shooting of Sosa-Celis.

Law enforcement officers of host nations are barred from entering foreign embassies and consulates without permission.

Ecuador's Foreign Ministry filed a formal note of protest on Tuesday after a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent tried to enter the South American nation's consulate in Minneapolis before being stopped by a staffer inside the building.

In a statement released following the incident, the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry said an ICE agent “attempted to enter the consulate premises,” but “consulate officials immediately prevented” the officer from getting through the door, “thus ensuring the protection of Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating emergency protocols.”

The ministry said it “immediately presented a note of protest” to the US Embassy in Quito, Ecuador's capital, “so that acts of this nature are not repeated in any of Ecuador's consular offices in the United States.”

Under international treaties, law enforcement officers of host nations are barred from entering foreign embassies and consulates without permission.

One eyewitness to the incident in Minneapolis, a flashpoint in the Trump administration's violent mass deportation efforts, told Reuters that they saw ICE agents “going after two people in the street, and then those people went into the consulate and the officers tried to go in after them.”

Video footage posted to social media shows a consulate official walking quickly to the building's entryway and repeatedly telling an ICE agent that he “cannot enter.”

The ICE agent can be heard telling the consulate staffer, “If you touch me, I will grab you.”

“ICE set off an international incident in Minneapolis today because agents tried to go into the Consulate of Ecuador without permission, and then yelled at their staff for trying to keep them out,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, wrote on social media.

“Note that there is a huge ‘consulate of Ecuador' sign over the door,” he added, pointing to an image of the building.

MOSCOW, January 28. /TASS/. Russia is doing everything to ensure that its oil and gas reach other countries so that people there do not freeze, but anti-Russian sanctions are causing people to die from the cold in Western countries, Russian State Duma (lower chamber of Parliament) Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said.

"In Russia, oil and gas are extracted not under palm trees, but in winter temperatures of -50°C (-58°F) and 50°C (122°F) in summer. In these difficult conditions, we do everything to ensure that oil and gas are supplied to other countries so that people there do not freeze. Sanctions lead to people freezing and dying," Volodin said in a video address published on his Max channel.

He noted that sanctions should be thought through before being imposed. "Focus on important matters, not on hindering the development of other countries," the Duma chairman said. "For those who relocated to these countries, those who didn't stock up on warm clothing, you see what you might face? You might not come back from there," Volodin concluded.

Charles Victor Thompson would be the first person executed in the US this year for the 1998 shooting deaths 

A Texas man who at one time escaped from custody and was on the run for three days after being sentenced to death for fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend nearly 27 years ago was scheduled on Wednesday to be the first person executed in the US this year.

Charles Victor Thompson was condemned for the April 1998 shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend, Glenda Dennise Hayslip, 39; and her new boyfriend, Darren Keith Cain, 30, at her apartment in the Houston suburb of Tomball.

Thompson, 55, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection on Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.

Prosecutors say Thompson and Hayslip had been romantically involved for a year but split after Thompson “became increasingly possessive, jealous and abusive”.

According to court records, Hayslip and Cain were dating when Thompson came to Hayslip's apartment and began arguing with Cain around 3am the night of the killings. Police were called and told Thompson to leave the apartment complex. Thompson returned three hours later and shot both Hayslip and Cain, who died at the scene. Hayslip died in the hospital a week later.

“The Hayslip and Cain families have waited over 25 years for justice to occur,” prosecutors with the Harris county district attorney's office said in court filings.

Thompson's attorneys have asked the US supreme court to stay his execution, arguing Thompson was not allowed to refute or confront the prosecution's evidence that concluded Hayslip died from a gunshot wound to the face. Thompson's attorneys have argued Hayslip actually died from flawed medical care she received after the shooting that resulted in severe brain damage sustained from oxygen deprivation following a failed intubation.

The Texas board of pardons and paroles on Monday denied Thompson's request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.

“If he had been able to raise a reasonable doubt as to the cause of Ms Hayslip's death, he would not be guilty of capital murder,” Thompson's attorneys said in court filings with the supreme court.

Prosecutors said a jury has already rejected the claim and, concluded under state law that Thompson is responsible for Hayslip's death because it “would not have occurred but for his conduct”.

Hayslip's family had filed a lawsuit against one of her doctors, alleging medical negligence during her treatment left her brain-dead. A jury in 2002 ruled in favor of the doctor.

Thompson had his death sentence overturned and had a new punishment trial held in November 2005. A jury again ordered him to die by lethal injection.

Shortly after being resentenced, Thompson escaped from the Harris county jail in Houston by walking out the front door virtually unchallenged by deputies. Thompson later told the Associated Press that after meeting with his attorney in a small interview cell, he slipped out of his handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuit and left the room, which was unlocked. Thompson waved an ID badge fashioned out of his prison ID card to get past several deputies.

“I got to smell the trees, feel the wind in my hair, grass under my feet, see the stars at night. It took me straight back to childhood being outside on a summer night,” Thompson said about his three days on the run during a 2005 interview with the AP. He was arrested in Shreveport, Louisiana, while trying to arrange for wire transfers of money from overseas so he could make it to Canada.

If the execution is carried out, Thompson would be the first person put to death this year in the United States. Texas has historically held more executions than any other state, though Florida had the most executions in 2025, with 19.

MOSCOW, January 28. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin has exchanged a firm handshake with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who arrived in Moscow on a working visit.

The Russian delegation includes Aide to the Russian leader Yury Ushakov, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Construction Minister Irek Faizullin, Head of the Main Directorate (formerly known as the GRU) of the General Staff of the Russian army Igor Kostyukov, Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Maxim Oreshkin, First Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, head of the Federal Customs Service Dmitry Shugayev.

After the meeting, Putin and al-Sharaa will continue negotiations during a working breakfast. The agenda includes relations between Russia and Syria, as well as the situation in the Middle East.

The last meeting of the leaders of the two countries took place in the Kremlin just over three months ago, when al-Sharaa visited Moscow for the first time after coming to power in Damascus. The leaders of Russia and Syria then talked for 2.5 hours.

The current visit takes place on the eve of the anniversary of the proclamation of al-Sharaa as interim president, which took place on January 29.

            The Beefeaters made her do it.
    


            Carrin Schottler was trying to focus on the centuries of British history at the Tower of London. Imposing white stone towers. Impressive armor. Ravens circling turrets.
    


            She was in a tour group with about a dozen people. The tour guide was talking, but Carrin kept losing focus: there was one guy in the group she couldn't take her eyes off.
    


            “I saw this really, very good-looking man. My heart skipped a beat…” Carrin tells CNN Travel today.
    


            Ever since she'd noticed him, Carrin couldn't stop stealing glances. She kept smiling at the stranger. She couldn't help it.
    


            Every time she looked over, she took in something new. She noticed his clothing: white shirt, oversized blazer and dress pants.
    


            “He can't be American,” thought Carrin, assessing the outfit. Even in Carrin's native New York, twentysomething guys didn't really dress like that.
    


            Carrin was over from the US for a semester studying abroad in London. It was September 1994. September, 30, 1994, to be precise.
    


            “That day, I was with a girlfriend, and we were either going to see Harrods for the first time, or we were going to go on a tour at the Tower of London for the first time,” recalls Carrin.
    


            The Tower of London won out. The two friends were intrigued by the history. This stone fortress has been in the same spot on London's riverbank since 1066 and has seen centuries of tumultuous events play out within its walls.
    


            That day in 1994, Carrin shuffled around the stone buildings and through historic, cobblestone courtyards, hearing about kings and queens, riots and executions, and taking absolutely nothing in. Instead, she just looked for opportunities to meet eyes with the man in the blazer.
    


            Eventually, Carrin found herself standing next to him. She looked up at him, smiling. He smiled back.
    


            “And we then just start talking,” she recalls. “We ask where each other are from, and we just start chatting about our lives.”
    


            The stranger in the blazer introduced himself as Paul Thal, a 23-year-old study abroad student from Sweden. He was enrolled in a college in Manchester, in the north of England, and he'd come down to London for a weekend of sightseeing.
    


            Paul noticed Carrin at the beginning of the Tower of London tour.
    


            “I saw Carrin, scoped her out a little bit,” he tells CNN Travel today. “And then we started talking, and I thought it was just so nice. It just kind of built from there.”
    


            As Carrin and Paul chatted, Carrin's friend Heather kept meeting Carrin's eye and suggestively raising an eyebrow. The chemistry and connection were obvious.
    


            Heather also gave Paul an enthusiastic nod of encouragement on a couple of occasions, trying to move things along. Meanwhile, Paul was conscious he wanted to “be close, but not, like, creepy close” and was trying to strike that balance. He didn't want to misinterpret friendly politeness for interest. Heather realized the would-be couple needed some cheerleading.
    


            “She had no problem turning around and grinning at Paul, and making it obvious,” recalls Carrin, laughing.
    


            And as it turned out, Carrin and Paul's connection wasn't just apparent to Heather.
    


            The Tower of London is the base for some 35 serving Yeoman Warders, royal bodyguards known as “Beefeaters,” who act as the landmark's ceremonial guardians. Besuited in red and blue with traditional hats, they cut a striking figure. The “Beefeater” name comes from the daily meat ration they were traditionally given, back in the day.
    


            For Tower of London tourists, a photo with a grinning Beefeater is a must-have souvenir. And Carrin and Paul were no different. Towards the end of the tour, they both took turns posing between two of Yeoman Warders and getting that requisite snapshot.
    


            As Carrin and Paul passed their film cameras between them, the Beefeaters joined in their laughter.
    


            “They could tell there was a little connection,” recalls Carrin. “One of the Beefeaters said to me, ‘Oh, what a nicely dressed man. He looks very well dressed. What a very good-looking man he is.'”
    


            Meanwhile, when it was Paul's turn to pose between the two Yeoman Warders, the guards made a point of highlighting “this whole connection, about Carrin,” recalls Paul.
    


            The older of the two men, “a guy with a white beard … was the instigator,” adds Paul.  “He was kind of matching us up.”
    


            “The Beefeaters acted as matchmakers,” agrees Carrin.
    


            Buoyed by their encouragement, as the tour wound down, Carrin decided to be brave.
    


            “It's just one of those moments where you gotta do something here,” she says. “Because we were both not moving … So I took the first move.”
    


            Carrin had been in London for a month or so at that point. Meanwhile, she knew Paul was just visiting for the weekend.
    


            “So I said to him, ‘If you want to go out, I can show you around London a little bit.'”
    


            Asking Paul out was more than a little daunting for 20-year-old Carrin. But she didn't want the connection to slip by, unacknowledged.
    


            “So, I was an independent woman and asked him out on a date,” she says. “It was really unusual for me to do such a thing. I've always been a very bookish, shy person… Doing something like this was really out of character for me.
    


            “But for some reason, I just thought, ‘I can't let this opportunity go away. I have to do something.' Something inside of me just said that, which probably was the best decision I think I ever made.”
    


            And she'd barely got the words out before Paul enthusiastically agreed. The two walked, with Heather, across Tower Bridge. Heather took a photo of the two of them on the bridge.
    


            Carrin left the Tower of London knowing next to nothing about the London landmark. Over thirty years later, she says she really doesn't “remember a thing about the Tower of London.”
    


            Other than, of course, meeting Paul and the Beefeater encouragement.
    


            “I remember parts of the tour, I remember the Beefeaters and the kind of gruesome things that happened there,” says Paul, nodding to the Tower of London's bloody history.
    


            “But there was just a lot of … how can I say … like emotions in the air. And you were kind of more occupied by that, than all the historical significance of the different buildings.”
    


The 23-year-old who spent three years living in the Tower of London



            Carrin and Paul arranged to meet that evening in Piccadilly Circus. Carrin waited for him underneath the illuminated billboard screens. Tourists and commuters bustled past her, circling the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, often interpreted as depicting Eros, the Greek god of love.
    


            When Carrin saw Paul walking in her direction, she felt the rush of emotions from earlier return in full force. He was still wearing his blazer and shirt. Meanwhile she'd changed out of her “typical American” Tower Bridge attire of “jeans and a regular shirt” into her favorite outfit.
    


            “I had a really nice short skirt and a nice top,” she recalls. “Back in the ‘90s, block heels were really in. So I wore these brown block heels that I had bought in London, because all the women were wearing them in London. I thought I looked just wonderful.”
    


            Paul thought she looked wonderful too. They hugged hello, both smiling at each other. Paul gave Carrin a bouquet of flowers.
    


            “We went to a cafe,” recalls Carrin. “And Paul, I don't know if he was nervous, but he had five cups of coffee … I was so nervous too.”
    


            But by the fifth cup, the nerves had melted away. And their easy camaraderie and connection from the Tower of London hadn't gone anywhere. If anything, it was even more potent.
    


            “We just hit it off, and conversation just kept going and going. We stayed up pretty much the whole night looking around London, and saw all the sights,” says Carrin. “We had our first kiss right near Buckingham Palace …”
    


            “…St James's Park,” chimes in Paul.
    


            “St James's, yes,” says Carrin.
    


            In the early hours of the morning, Paul accompanied Carrin home to her college dorm, near Regent's Park.
    


            “They have a rose garden right there, this beautiful rose garden,” says Carrin. “He dropped me off that night to my university, and said, ‘Goodbye.'”
    


            Carrin always associates that moment, that night, with the smell of beautiful roses. Whenever she sees roses, she thinks about falling in love with Paul.
    


            “It just brings me back to that time, right there, at Regent's Park. So nice. A beautiful place.”
    


            The two promised to meet again several hours later. They spent all day Saturday together, and all of Sunday, before Paul had to get his train back to Manchester.
    


            At Euston Station, Paul and Carrin promised they would meet every weekend either in Manchester, London or somewhere else new to them both. They exchanged addresses, vowing to write in between visits.
    


            Carrin returned to her dorm room in a daze.
    


            “I called my mother and father that Monday,” recalls Carrin.
    


            Her mother could detect something was going on right away.
    


            “I told her, ‘I had the most wonderful weekend.' And she goes, ‘Who did you meet?'… And I said, ‘I met this man from Sweden.' … My parents were quite like ‘Whoa, what happened?'”
    


That Christmas she had completely given up on love. Then the house sitter showed up



            From there, Carrin and Paul were true to their word. That fall, they met every weekend.
    


            “We went back and forth over the weekends, and we did trips together to different places in the UK,” says Paul.
    


            He recalls a favorite trip to Edinburgh, Scotland, where the two hiked up Arthur's Seat, the extinct volcano that overlooks the city, to admire the view and enjoy a picnic. They laughed together the whole way.
    


            “You meet someone likeminded in temperament, and you don't have to pretend,” says Paul. “You could just speak freely. It was not a courtship where you would have to put on some sort of pretense. It just felt natural, if I put it that way, from the outset. And then we were both in a place that neither of us really knew, and it was just fun to explore together.”
    


            In November 1994, Carrin found herself feeling “homesick because I was missing our Thanksgiving.” So, Paul took it upon himself to track down a turkey and put together a Thanksgiving dinner for Carrin in his tiny dorm room in Salford, Manchester.
    


            His room was inside an old townhouse, which he shared with several other guys.
    


            “The turkey has to be in the oven for hours and hours. So I had it in there, and I told the guys, ‘I have to go and pick up Carrin from the train station. In an hour, can you take out the turkey?' They were like, ‘Yeah sure, we'll do it …' They didn't do it. So the turkey was a shrunk, dried out thing. We had a Thanksgiving dinner in that little dorm room, put out a little cloth on the ground and we sat there and ate this very dry turkey.”
    


            “I thought it was wonderful,” says Carrin. She was touched that Paul put in all this effort for her.
    


            But, December was looming and Carrin's return to the United States was imminent. Meanwhile, Paul was staying in the UK for another several months.
    


            Before Carrin returned to New York, Paul invited her to go with him to Sweden. The pair traveled by ship from eastern England to Sweden's second biggest city, Gothenburg.
    


            “I went to meet his family and to see where Paul was from. We took the ferry from Harwich up to Gothenburg — because that's where Paul's from, Gothenburg — and I got to meet his family.”
    


            “And despite that, she stayed with me,” says Paul.
    


            Carrin bats off the joke. She loved Paul's family right away. She immediately bonded with his mother, and enjoyed seeing Paul interacting with his loved ones.
    


            “I get a little emotional,” she says, thinking back to this visit. “I think the time I knew I wanted to marry him was when I saw how kind he was to his grandmother. We met his grandmother and took her up for Christmas … he was so gentle, he took such good care of her. And I said, ‘That's the man I want to marry.'”
    


            The visit to Sweden strengthened their relationship, but now Carrin and Paul were at a crossroads. She was heading back to the United States to continue her studies there. Carrin planned to become a doctor, and her medical school training was long and hectic. Meanwhile, Paul was tied to college in the UK and Sweden.
    


            “It was a little scary,” says Paul. “We really didn't know what was going to happen.”
    


            “I still remember lifting off from Gothenburg, and Paul stood out watching,” says Carrin. “I saw his red coat, and I saw Paul as I was lifting off … his red coat … and I was like, ‘I don't know what's going to happen to us.'”
    


            “There was no grand plan for the future,” says Paul. “It was just a kind of hope.”
    


She swore she'd never get married. Then, she traveled to London and a surprise meeting changed her mind



            Back home in New York, Carrin remembers “crying and crying and crying.”
    


            “I don't know if we're ever going to see each other again,” she remembers thinking
    


            But a few months later. in April 1995, Paul visited Carrin in the United States and met her family. Then, that summer, during her college vacation, Carrin spent a month with Paul in Sweden. This travel pattern continued for some time.
    


            “Between December ‘94 to October ‘96 we were doing back and forth as often as we could afford,” says Paul.
    


            In between visits, the couple stayed in touch across the Atlantic. This was a pre-smart phone age, and Carrin and Paul had to get creative. So, they sent cassette tapes to each other — recording their thoughts, feelings and recounting their days.
    


            “Phone bills were so expensive,” says Carrin. “So we would take these tiny little recorders with tiny little tapes, and we would tape each other and talk with each other, and then send those tapes overseas.”
    


            In summer 1996, the couple traveled to Norway together, hiking through the spectacular scenery hand-in-hand.
    


            “We were by — I don't know if it was glacier — it was snowcapped. And that's when we decided, in Norway, right by this waterfall …” begins Paul.
    


            “… That's when we decided we wanted to be married,” continues Carrin. “And in Swedish tradition, both people get rings. So we then decided we wanted to exchange rings. And then we announced to our families that we wanted to get married.”
    


            During that time, a plan of sorts began to form — Paul would try and get a job in the United States. Although Carrin loved Sweden, her medical studies tied her to her homeland, while Paul's IT ambitions were more flexible.
    


            This plan, eventually, fell into place.
    


            “In October ‘96 I moved over to the United States. I transferred over with a company,” says Paul. “I'd just graduated, I got a job, and I managed to convince them to send me over to New York.”
    


She arranged a date with a guy she met on a plane. When he didn't show, she unexpectedly met her future husband



            Paul started working in New York City. And two years later, in July 1998, Carrin and Paul got married in Carrin's hometown in upstate New York. Carrin incorporated Paul's last name into her own, becoming Carrin Schottler-Thal.
    


            Paul's family flew in for the celebrations, as did many old friends from his military service days.
    


            “My American girlfriends saw these handsome men, and they were so charmed,” laughs Carrin. “All these nice, charming Swedish men asked them to dance, which was so nice. So it was such a fun party, and we had such a great time.”
    


            The soundtrack was a mix of classic American wedding fare, Swedish pop and British songs.
    


            And when she was picking the flowers, Carrin thought back to the first evening with Paul, to the moment they said goodbye in Regent's Park, amid the roses.
    


            “So I had a bouquet full of yellow roses, because I remember from Regent's Park these beautiful yellow roses,” she says.
    


            There were several other nods to Carrin and Paul's London meeting. The tables weren't numbered, for example. Instead, they were each named after different destinations in the UK where Carrin and Paul had traveled during their first three months together.
    


            “My sister Tammy made a speech, and she talked all about how we met,” adds Carrin.
    


            “Heather, the girl who was there on the tour, came to the wedding too. It was really, really cool to have everybody there.”
    


            After the wedding, Carrin and Paul based themselves in Albany, in upstate New York. Paul commuted into New York City.
    


            This period of their lives was a happy, but hectic, one. They were in the same place at last, but Paul's job involved a lot of travel, while Carrin was busy training to be a doctor.
    


            When Paul's IT consultancy company went under — a consequence of the late ‘90s dotcom bubble implosion — it seemed like an opportunity to do something different. Paul decided to get another master's degree.
    


            Then, in September 2001, Paul turned 30 and the couple traveled to San Francisco to celebrate this new chapter of their lives.
    


            “We were in San Francisco during September 11,” says Carrin. “Some of his colleagues from his old job were lost during that time, in the World Trade Center. So it was a really rough time for us.”
    


            In the subsequent months, grieving and in shock, Paul and Carrin decided, together, that Paul wouldn't return to city working, post-graduation. They also didn't want Paul's future work to involve the same degree of travel. They wanted their life and work and family to be in Albany.
    


            “He got his master's, and now he's had several jobs up here in Albany, and I did my residency, and I've been a doctor up here, and Paul has been working up here, and we've been able to stay together up here,” says Carrin.
    


            Today, Carrin and Paul still live in Albany, now with their 16-year-old son.
    


            They're a close knit trio.
    


            “We just love being together. We're very, very close,” says Paul. “My son, if I'm having a rough day or something, he knows before I know.”
    


            The family have also spent a lot of time in Sweden over the years.
    


            “Our son has been there many, many times,” says Paul. “And we kind of blend Swedish and US traditions, the things that we really value from our childhood and the things we carry with us, right from home.”
    


            During the holidays, for example, the family celebrates Swedish Christmas on December 24, and American Christmas on the 25th.
    


            “So our son is very lucky, because he gets two Christmases for the price of one,” jokes Paul.
    


            Carrin and Paul's son is autistic and at school he communicates via an iPad using both Swedish and English words.
    


            “Which is really wonderful,” says Carrin. “When he wants to be calm, he says the Swedish word and his aides say the Swedish word for calm: lugna. He understands Swedish and so we try to incorporate that into his life as well, which is really cool.”
    


The man who saved two strangers' lives on a mountain



            A few years back, Carrin and Paul took their son to London to retrace the steps of their younger selves.
    


            “We went to Piccadilly Circus and we had lunch,” says Carrin. “And we did take him for a walk in the similar spots where we took the walk that night.”
    


            The family didn't make it to the Tower of London on that visit, but Carrin and Paul hope to return one day. They often wonder if the Beefeaters who spurred them on are still around.
    


            “We thought they were so old, then, right?” says Paul.
    


            But today, when they thumb through the photos pasted in a scrapbook, the couple realize the Yeoman Warder matchmakers probably weren't quite as old as twentysomething Paul and Carrin assumed.
    


            These guards might still be living at the Tower, and might be keen to hear how their meddling led to lasting love and connection.
    


            “They changed our lives,” says Carrin.
    


            “They were part of it,” agrees Paul. “When you think back on life, different things, a comment here and there can set off chain reactions.”
    


            Looking back today on their early days together in London, Paul calls it a “special time.”
    


            “For me, it was kind of magical,” agrees Carrin. “A magical time. I just love it being told. I think it's just a sweet story that's just really happy.”
    


            The couple remain close with Heather, the friend who watched their love story begin.
    


            “And we still have, up in our attic, all those boxes of tapes that we sent so long ago,” says Carrin.
    


            That period of their lives was filled with “a  lot of uncertainty, but yet it was just exciting,” says Paul.
    


            “And there was a certain degree of calm around it,” he adds. “I don't know how to explain it emotionally. It was warm, calm … I think of it as a very warm, calm and exciting time. And it just felt right.”

Officials are quickly moving people they've apprehended out of state, making it difficult for loved ones to reach them

Family members have been scrambling to learn the whereabouts of more than 200 people arrested during a federal immigration crackdown that has swept across Maine this week, immigration attorneys said, as federal authorities quickly ferried detainees out of the state.

“We were buried in phone calls,” said Jenny Beverly, an immigration attorney with Haven Immigration Law. She said her team worked long hours to locate detainees and stop their transfer out of Maine.

When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents transfer detainees out of state, they become even harder to reach and face greater odds of removal from the US, the attorneys said.

Most immigrants lost their first layer of legal protections in September, when the federal board of immigration appeals ruled that people who crossed the US border unlawfully are no longer eligible for release on bond, reversing years of legal precedent.

Now, lawyers are increasingly turning to habeas petitions, which make use of a detainees' rights to challenge their detention, Beverly said. The catch is that these petitions must be filed in the same jurisdiction where a detainee is in custody. If a detainee is moved quickly, lawyers lose the opportunity to challenge their detention.

There are only a handful of lawyers who are trained to file habeas petitions in Maine, Beverly said, so an influx of requests could overwhelm the system.

“ICE came with the machinery in place to get people out of here as soon as possible. We are racing against the clock as soon as we get a phone call to get something filed,” Beverly said. “Frankly, I feel that enforcement was done [at this pace] on purpose so that we can't keep up.”

Fifty immigrants were removed from the Cumberland county jail on Thursday, according to Kevin Joyce, the county sheriff. The two-story Portland jail has served as the state's central detention hub during Trump's second term.

Thursday's mass removal followed a dispute between Joyce and the federal immigration agency after the sheriff criticized its tactics, calling it “bush league policing”.

When asked about the operations in Maine, Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary of public affairs, repeated a statement provided to the Guardian last week, saying that immigrants apprehended as part of a recent push were some of “the worst of the worst” and had been “charged and convicted of horrific crimes”.

With only two federal detention facilities in the state, Maine does not have the capacity to hold all 1,400 individuals that Patricia Hyde, deputy assistant director of ICE, said the agency intends to target.

The next closest holding facility, with larger capacity, is located in Burlington, Massachusetts. But data collected by Vera's ICE Detention Trends shows that more than 45% of Maine's detainees get transferred to Louisiana.

At least eight Maine residents have already been transferred to Louisiana, according to Maine's Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project (ILAP). One man told his family that he is being held in a group of approximately 100 men, sleeping in tents next to or on an active tarmac, the group said in a statement.

More than 60 people have asked ILAP for emergency legal aid to prevent their removal since last week.

Non-profit groups like ILAP can provide this support free of charge. Beverly said that private firms likely charge “thousands”, which could be prohibitive, unless families can find financial aid.

“There are not adequate words to describe how difficult the past week has been,” Sue Roche, ILAP's executive director, said in a statement. “In ILAP's legal triage, we are seeing mostly people in lawful immigration processes with no criminal records being arrested. Many have been racially profiled and abducted from their cars off the street, and some have been targeted at home. ICE is stalking grocery stores and schools. The lack of due process or humanity in this enforcement operation is appalling.”

Agents have been placed on three-day administrative leave and will not return to field work until investigation has concluded, says MS NOW

Omar sprayed with unknown substance at Minneapolis town hall

The federal agents involved in fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota over the weekend have been placed on three-day administrative leave, MS Now reports, citing an official who has direct knowledge.

According to MS Now, the agents would return to work doing desk duty and not field work until the investigation has concluded.

The New York Times and Fox News cite a Department of Homeland Security official who emphasized the move was standard protocol.

Bruce Springsteen has said that he has released a new song in response to what he described as “the state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis.”

Springsteen said in a statement on Tuesday that he wrote the song on Saturday and recorded it on Tuesday.

He said that the song, titled “Streets of Minneapolis”, is “dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.”

He concluded his brief statement with: “Stay free, Bruce Springsteen”.

According to MS Now, the agents would return to work doing desk duty and not field work until the investigation has concluded.

The New York Times and Fox News cite a Department of Homeland Security official who emphasized the move was standard protocol.

Earlier we brought you some lines from the ABC News interview with Donald Trump in which the US president remained staunchly and unapologetically unsympathetic to Ilhan Omar, who was attacked at her town hall last night in Minneapolis.

In that interview, Trump also hinted at a “more relaxed” approach from federal agents operating in Minnesota after the fatal shootings of US citizens Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis this month.

Asked what would change now that he had sent his “border czar” Tom Homan to lead the operation, the president said, “We can start doing maybe a little bit more relaxed” and “We'd like to finish the job and finish it well, and I think we can do it in a de-escalated form.”

While it marks a tonal shift from the president, as my colleague Adam Gabbatt notes in today's edition of This week in Trumpland (sign up here), “we should be careful not to exaggerate the extent of Trump's sympathy”.

“It would surely be naive to think this will prompt an abrupt change in policy,” Adam writes, noting that Trump is likely just paying attention to public opinion towards federal actions in Minnesota. And as we reported earlier, Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, told reporters this morning he hadn't seen any evidence yet of ICE withdrawing from the city.

Indeed, at a treasury event Trump spoke at earlier this morning, he didn't mention immigration, ICE or Minnesota once.

Minneapolis's mayor, Jacob Frey, has responded to Trump's earlier comment that he is “playing with fire” after Frey said yesterday that “Minneapolis does not and will not enforce federal immigration laws”.

Frey wrote on X:

The job of our police is to keep people safe, not enforce fed immigration laws.

I want them preventing homicides, not hunting down a working dad who contributes to MPLS [Minneapolis] & is from Ecuador.

It's similar to the policy your guy Rudy had in NYC. Everyone should feel safe calling 911.

Trump ally Rudy Giuliani was the Republican mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001. At the time, Giuliani was a prominent and fierce advocate for the rights of undocumented migrants, and defended the city's sanctuary policies.

Earlier this morning, Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, and his wife visited the memorial to Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, becoming very emotional as they paid their respects.

I made a promise to Alex's parents to continue to tell his story.An ICU nurse at the VA, an outdoorsman, a deeply generous, compassionate friend and family member, and a true son of Minnesota. Rest in peace, Alex. pic.twitter.com/O7O2cyv6MV

Asked by an ABC reporter if he thought there would be a shift in tone from the administration after his conversation with Donald Trump on Monday, Walz replied:

I'm not so interested in shift in tone. We just need them out of here, and we need accountability for what's happened.

“You see the trauma in this community,” Walz told an NBC News reporter as he was leaving, adding that Minnesotans are “demanding justice” and want agents to leave.

He said that since his call with the president after the killings of Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents, he had seen no evidence of ICE withdrawing from the city.

Once again, to Renee and Alex's family, Minnesota has a responsibility to get you justice. And Minnesota has a responsibility to show the rest of the nation just how wrong this is.

Non-profit hunger-relief organizations in Minnesota are calling for an immediate end to Operation Metro Surge, saying that the “chaos and violence” ICE has brought to the state has left people scared to leave their homes and impeded efforts to get food to people who are “stranded and hungry”.

The letter, signed by close to 100 organizations, states that “with so many Minnesotans staying home for fear of being racially profiled, unlawfully detained, separated from their families or worse, we have had to scramble to find new ways to get emergency food to where it's needed most”.

Minnesotans have shown up to keep one another fed. Yet at every turn, ICE has made it harder to get food to hungry neighbors, including by following volunteers doing food deliveries, standing outside food shelf entrances, staging from our parking lots or near our facilities, and, in at least one instance, detaining a volunteer. This is on top of the impact on child hunger from missed school meals.

“Every human being deserves to eat,” the letter goes on. “This not should be a controversial statement, and it certainly isn't a political one.”

For the above reasons, and out of deep concern for our neighbors, we stand united in calling for an immediate end to the surge in federal immigration activity in our state so that we can safely deliver food to neighbors in need and ensure that they can freely attend school and access healthcare and other lifesaving services without fear. Operation Metro Surge is hurting our neighbors, it is making us less safe, it is further dividing our communities, and it is making it harder to get food to Minnesotans in need. Our communities deserve better.

Democratic representative Ro Khanna, of California, has joined other lawmakers in calling for the Trump administration to condemn last night's attack on Ilhan Omar and to “tone down the rhetoric targeting her”.

In a post on X, he said:

It is time @JDVance to not just condemn unequivocally the violent attack on @IlhanMN last night but to genuinely tone down the rhetoric targeting her. This is no longer about political debate. There are members of Congress who fear for their lives.

White House deputy chief of staff and architect of Trump's aggressive anti-immigration crackdown Stephen Miller has said that officials were evaluating why Customs and Border Protection agents in Minneapolis “may not have been following” proper protocol before the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, CNN reports.

In a statement to CNN, Miller said the White House had “provided clear guidance to DHS that the extra personnel that had been sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used for conducting fugitive operations to create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors.”

“We are evaluating why the CBP team may not have been following that protocol,” he said.

It comes amid a significant shift in the White House's rhetoric amid the intense backlash over the fatal shooting of Pretti on Saturday. Miller initially referred to the killed ICU nurse as a “would-be assassin”, while, per my earlier post, DHS secretary Kristi Noem claimed he was a “domestic terrorist” (a characterization that has landed her in hot water).

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt sought to rapidly distance Donald Trump from that messaging during a press briefing yesterday, saying she had not heard the president characterize Pretti in that way and called Pretti's death a “tragedy”.

Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, has said he is “relieved” that Ilhan Omar is alright after she was attacked at her town hall last night.

In a post on X, he added:

But Trump's response was shameful — & Republicans should say so.His baseless & racist attacks against her have no doubt endangered her. His inability to condemn the attack is appalling.

Two federal officers fired their guns during the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, according to an initial review by the Department of Homeland Security that was obtained by NBC News.

Three sources told NBC News that the preliminary report, from a Customs and Border Protection internal investigation led by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility, was sent to congressional committees yesterday, including the House homeland security and judiciary committees.

The document reportedly states that agents were conducting an operation when they encountered two women blowing whistles and ordered them to move out of the way. One of the women then reportedly ran towards Pretti, prompting officers to attempt “to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway”.

“The woman and Pretti did not move,” it goes on to say, and agents then sprayed a chemical irritant towards Pretti and the woman, and attempted to take Pretti into custody.

“Pretti resisted CBP personnel's efforts and a struggle ensued,” it says.

According to the report, during the struggle, an officer yelled, “He's got a gun!” multiple times and then “approximately five seconds later a BPA [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a CBPO [Customs and Border Protection officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti.”

The report says that after the shooting, an agent informed the others he had possession of Pretti's firearm.

It is unclear from the report whether the bullets from both officers' guns hit Pretti.

NBC News also notes that the report did not make any mention of Pretti attacking officers or brandishing a gun, as DHS secretary Kristi Noem claimed in the aftermath of the shooting. Noem called the victim “a domestic terrorist who tried to assassinate law enforcement”, rhetoric that has since been walked back by the White House amid the deepening backlash over Pretti's killing. Pressure is mounting on Noem to go, with even two Republican senators calling for her resignation.

Video footage recorded by multiple eyewitnesses show that Pretti was holding a phone, not a weapon, when he was tackled by federal agents. One video shows that an officer removed a gun from Pretti's waist area just before he was fatally shot.

A DHS spokesperson said in a statement to the outlet that “the initial statement was based on reports from CBP from a very chaotic scene on the ground”.

“That's precisely why an investigation is underway and DHS will let the facts lead the investigation,” they added.

In a fundraising email sent out on Wednesday from Donald Trump's team, he sarcastically asks those subscribed who haven't responded to a “Citizens Only Survey” if they are undocumented.

“Your file says you're a top MAGA patriot…but my records to my survey STILL say: RESPONSE PENDING”

“Don't tell me, YOU'RE AN ILLEGAL ALIEN?!?”

The email was logged by Archive of Political Emails, a non profit project of Defending Democracy Together Institute.

Late last night and early in the morning, lawmakers from both parties came out to condemn the spraying attack on Ilhan Omar during her town hall in Minneapolis.

A quick round up:

In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries responded to comments from Donald Trump who quipped that “she probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

Jeffries countered: “That's a disgusting comment and the president's lies and misinformation continue to fan the flames of these types of violent incidents.”

“Ilhan Omar, of course, is a strong, courageous, hardworking public servant. This should have never happened,” he continued.

Representative from Minnesota Angie Craig said she's “relieved that my colleague Ilhan is safe.”

“The rise in political violence in our state must stop,” she posted on X. “We are better than this Minnesota.”

Representative from Ohio Greg Landsman said “the rhetoric against a sitting member of Congress is un-American” and leads to more violence.

“Everyone, regardless of political affiliation, should approach this moment with humility and grace. That's how we break this cycle of division and hate.”

South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace wrote that she is “deeply disturbed” to learn that Omar was attacked at the town hall.

“Regardless of how vehemently I disagree with her rhetoric—and I do—no elected official should face physical attacks. This is not who we are.”

When Donald Trump was asked in an interview with ABC on whether he saw the video of the spray attack on Ilhan Omar, he said, “No, I don't think about her.”

I think she's a fraud. I really don't think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.

Asked again if he had seen the video, Trump said: “I haven't seen it. No, no. I hope I don't have to bother.”

Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post Wednesday morning, threw a warning shot at Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey after he said the city would not change its sanctuary policies to get federal authorities out of Minneapolis.

“Could somebody in his inner sanctum please explain that this statement is a very serious violation of the Law, and that he is PLAYING WITH FIRE!” Trump posted.

Representative of Nebraska Don Bacon is the latest on a small list of Republicans to speak out about the attack against representative Ilhan Omar.

“Political violence is always wrong,” he wrote on social media. “We always have the right to free speech and to petition the government, but political violence must be dealt with sternly”.

He added that the attacker “needs to spend sometime (sic) behind bars.”

President Donald Trump has said a “massive armada” is heading to Iran and is ready to “fulfil its mission with speed and violence if necessary”.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that Iran should be ready to enter negotiations to find a “fair and equitable deal” that stops them from having nuclear weapons. “Time is running out, it is truly of the essence,” he says.

This comes after Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told state media in Iran that he has not been in contact with US envoy Steve Witkoff in the past couple of days. Previously, Iran had said there was always a channel of communication between the two.

The man accused of assaulting congresswoman Ilhan Omar has a reported history of sharing political posts, including one that criticised Omar, on social media.

According to CNN, the 55-year-old Minneapolis resident, who has been identified as Anthony James Kazmierczak through jail records, has shared political posts in the past, in. In 2021, he shared a political cartoon criticising Omar's stance on security spending amid calls to defund police.

The outlet reports that he also reposted transphobic content made by conservative social media commentator Ben Shapiro. Also, after the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk in September, the accused attacker changed his social media profile picture to an image of Donald Trump speaking at a Turning Point USA event, later replacing it with a photo of Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk alongside Trump.

The Ecuadorian government has said that a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent attempted to enter its Minneapolis consulate on Tuesday, but was prevented from coming in by staff working at the building.

This has prompted Ecuador's government to send a formal protest note to US authorities “so that acts of this nature are not repeated at any of Ecuador's consular offices in the United States.”

Videos circulating on social media appear to show a consulate staffer running to the door to turn the ICE agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You're not allowed to enter.”

Under international law, law enforcement authorities are prohibited from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission. However, sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.

The Guardian has reached out to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.

Welcome to our live coverage of US politics.

While Donald Trump suggested he would “de-escalate” operations in Minneapolis, congresswoman Ilhan Omar was attacked and sprayed with an unknown substance at a town hall event in Minneapolis on Tuesday evening – where she was calling for the abolition of ICE “for good”.

A man lunged toward her with a syringe and sprayed the politician, before security tackled him to the ground. The alleged attacker, who has been identified as a 55-year-old Minneapolis resident, has been arrested and charged with third-degree assault. Jail records identified the man as Anthony James Kazmierczak.

Omar stepped toward the attacker before returning to the podium to say: “Here's the reality that people like this ugly man don't understand: We are Minnesota strong. And we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw on us.”

Omar, who was not injured in the attack, later posted on social media that she was OK, adding: “I don't let bullies win. Grateful to my incredible constituents who rallied behind me.”

Hours before the attack on Omar, president Donald Trump criticised the congresswoman as he spoke to a crowd in Iowa, where he said his administration would only let in immigrants who “can show that they love our country.”

“They have to be proud, not like Ilhan Omar,” he said. The crowd responded with a booing sound as he mentioned her name.

He added: “She comes from a country that's a disaster. So probably, it's considered, I think – it's not even a country.”

Omar and her family escaped civil war in Somalia when she was eight years old, and sought asylum in the United States after years in a refugee camp in Kenya. She is a US citizen.

There have been days of protest and international outcry over the Saturday shooting of 37-year-old VA nurse Alex Pretti, the second fatal shooting of a US civilian by federal law enforcement in Minneapolis.

The White House is also evaluating whether federal agents who gunned down a nurse may have failed to follow “clear guidance” to “create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors”, deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told AFP.

The White House later said that Miller was referring to “general guidance” to immigration agents operating in the state, rather than the specific incident in which Pretti was killed.

Trump told Fox News “we're going to de-escalate a little bit,” while adding that it was not a “pullback.”

On Wednesday, to the surprise of few, the Bank of Canada held its policy interest rate at 2.25 per cent. We agree with the decision, though believe food price increases are likely to pose an ongoing challenge for the bank. It could test the limits of monetary policy.

When the bank leaves its policy rate unchanged and the rate sits in the so-called neutral rate range – where the bank is neither trying to stimulate nor slow the economy – the data are often conflicting. This time was no different.

Headline inflation (the change in the consumer price index over the preceding 12 months) nudged up to 2.4 per cent in December from 2.2 per cent in November, but it was 0.4 percentage points above the bank's 2 per cent target.

On the other hand, fourth-quarter GDP growth appears sluggish, with the likely best-case outcome seeing the Canadian economy eke out a weakly positive gain when Statistics Canada releases the data at the end of February. Moreover, labour growth stagnated in December and the unemployment rate increased to 6.8 per cent, up from from 6.6 per cent.

This kind of conflicting data makes a strong case for a hold.

Philip Soper, CEO of Royal Le Page, says a "further degradation" of Canada's relationship with the U.S. could act as a damper on the spring housing market.Sammy Kogan/The Globe and Mail

For the past year and a half, scores of prospective first-time homebuyers have held back, waiting for both home prices and borrowing costs to reach bottom. With rates now on hold, many of them may finally decide to jump into the upcoming spring housing market.

But how many will actually pounce may depend on the fate of the renegotiation of the North American free-trade agreement, the USMCA, which is scheduled for a review in July.

“A further degradation of the relationship with the U.S. or a clear indication that there would be no reasonable renewal of our trade agreement with Mexico and the U.S. could actually act as a damper on the spring market,” said Philip Soper, CEO of Royal Le Page.

Still, barring any significant trade shocks, Mr. Soper expects homebuyers to come out of hibernation. 

Employment levels among the key 25-to-54-year-old demographic are healthy, Canadians' savings rates remain strong and far above prepandemic levels, and inflation is reasonable. Yet, especially in larger housing markets, the volume of home sales has remained well below historical norms.

It means, “there's a lot of people that need housing and relatively few transactions occurring,” Mr. Soper said.

But don't expect the release of that pent-up demand to result in bidding wars and escalating home prices. The market is well stocked with homes for sale and more will come online as the weather warms. 

Instead, Mr. Soper expects prices to decline by another 3 to 4 per cent in Toronto and Vancouver this year, with most smaller markets registering low, single-digit price gains.

“It is important to step back from the daily noise. Some things are clear. It's clear that the era of open rules-based trade with the United States is over. It's clear that our population growth has come down and is going to stay lower. It's clear that new technologies, particularly rapid advances in AI, have the potential to have a significant impact on businesses on the economy. Whether you're a business trying to chart the way forward, or you're a policymaker, those things are clear. The Canadian economy needs to adjust to those things. We think that has started. We think it's going to take some time, and through that period, growth will be modest … the more we adjust, the stronger the economy can be, the more resilient the economy can be.”

- Mark Rendell

“Bottom line is we agreed that the current policy rate is appropriate if the economy evolves broadly in line with the outlook we just published… The clear consensus was it's very difficult to predict either the direction or the timing of the next move in our policy rate. To put it a bit more technically, in order to assign probabilities as to the direction of the next move… you need to be able to assign probabilities to the risks, and I think the way we were feeling is, given high uncertainty, that's difficult. We are monitoring those risks very closely, and if a new shock comes along, or an accumulation of evidence that materially changes our outlook, we're prepared to respond.”

“In the last couple of weeks, you've seen some renewed U.S. dollar weakness, and so many currencies, including the Canadian dollar, are appreciating somewhat against the U.S. dollar. What's driving that? I think it's largely geopolitical events. … International investors, they still want exposure to U.S. equities. U.S. equity markets have been strong, but that safe haven role of the U.S. dollar has been dented. People don't want as much exposure to the U.S. dollar. They're hedging more of that. … And at the same time, you're seeing other safe havens, most notably gold, up a lot.”

“The threat to independence of the central bank in the United States is one thing that has sort of been contributing to this sense of uncertainty. Look, why did I make a point of commenting on Chairman Powell and the U.S. Fed? The simple reason is the U.S. Federal Reserve is the biggest and most important central bank in the world. And we all need it to work well. A loss of independence of the Fed would affect us all, and for Canada, our financial markets are particularly integrated with the United States, so it would particularly affect us. It's hard to predict exactly what this would look like, but keeping the Fed operating independently, it's good for Americans, it's good for Canadians. … What does independence do? It provides central banks with the space to take difficult decisions that benefit the economy, benefit the citizens of that country over the medium-term.”

- Matt Lundy

“There's a sense that geopolitical risks are heightened. I'm not going to go through every event, but the month of January has been pretty packed with new elements, new geopolitical risks. Through the last spring, there were some very big changes, some pauses, some reintroductions and deals. Through the summer, I don't want to say uncertainty was low, but you saw a little more stability. Recently you've seen more unpredictability in U.S. policy, with all sorts of threats, including on Canada. And then I think the CUSMA review is coming more into focus. It's now 2026; it is under review this year. So those are really the key elements that have increased uncertainty. “

- Matt Lundy

“What we are saying is that uncertainty around our forecast is unusually high. There are a number of risks and uncertainties. Geopolitical risks have increased, they're heightened. U.S. trade policy remains highly unpredictable, and for Canada, what the outcome is of the review of CUSMA is an important risk to our projection. What we have built into our projection is that tariffs that are currently in place, remain in place. … We go through a number of possible outcomes for CUSMA. I would stress that we've done a number of scenarios.”

“Considering both our baseline forecast and the risks, Governing Council discussed the future path of monetary policy. While Council judges the current policy rate is appropriate based on our outlook, the consensus was that elevated uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the timing or direction of the next change in the policy rate.”

“Tariffs and uncertainty continue to disrupt the Canadian economy. After a strong third quarter, economic growth likely stalled in the fourth quarter. Exports continue to be buffeted by U.S. tariffs, while domestic demand appears to be picking up. Household spending is expected to continue growing moderately, supported by past cuts in interest rates and rising disposable incomes. U.S. tariffs and related uncertainty have held back business investment. But we expect some modest strengthening in investment as businesses adjust to the new trade environment and governments increase infrastructure spending.”

“The impact of US tariffs can also be seen in the labour market. Employment weakened in the first half of 2025 as sectors hit hard by U.S. tariffs cut production and jobs. In recent months, overall employment has risen, led by hiring in services like health care, and slowing population growth is reducing the number of new entrants into the labour market. Still, the unemployment rate remains high at 6.8%, youth unemployment is particularly elevated, and relatively few businesses say they plan to hire more workers in coming months.”

“Turning to inflation, it averaged 2.1 per cent last year, and has now been within the 1 per cent to 3 per cent band for two years. If we focus on recent movements, CPI inflation rose to 2.4 per cent in December, boosted by base-year effects linked to last winter's GST/HST holiday. The Bank's preferred measures of core inflation have eased from 3 per cent in October to around 2.5 per cent in December. The Bank expects CPI inflation to stay close to the 2 per cent target over the projection as tariff-related cost pressures are offset by excess supply.”

“Uncertainty around this outlook is unusually high. Geopolitical risks are elevated and the upcoming review of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement is an important risk to the outlook. It's also too early to tell how well the Canadian economy will adjust to current tariffs and ongoing uncertainty. The transition to the new trade environment could be smoother than we expect, with stronger business and household spending. Alternatively, the labour market could weaken further as trade impacts deepen, leading to lower household spending. Financial conditions could also tighten if volatility returns to markets.”

“Monetary policy cannot compensate for the structural damage caused by tariffs, and it cannot target hard-hit sectors of the economy. But it can play a supporting role, helping the economy through this period of structural change, while maintaining inflation close to the 2 per cent target.”

The Bank of Canada published a new forecast for economic growth and inflation on Wednesday in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report. 

- Darcy Keith

Here's how economists are reacting in written commentaries issued after the rate decision:

“There won't be anyone surprised by the Bank of Canada's well-telegraphed decision to keep rates on hold today, or its assessment that rates are at the right level if their forecast pans out. They remain firmly neutral on where things go from here, saying that “it's difficult to predict the timing or direction of the next move.” But if there's a slight leaning here, it's still towards some worries on the growth front due to uncertainties on trade, and a bit more comfort that underlying inflation is decelerating. The bank hasn't made any major changes in its forecasts, with an upside surprise in Q3 offset by a stall in growth in Q4 of 2025. With both historical actual and potential growth revised higher, the output gap in Q4 is in the range of -1.5 per cent to -0.5 per cent, unchanged from October's estimate. We'll stick to our forecast for no interest rate moves by the bank in 2026, but see the odds of a further cut as more likely than a hike, given the potential minefield in trade negotiations ahead, and a starting point that still has significant economic slack.” 

“The Bank of Canada's largely unchanged economic projections are similar to our own, although we think the slow pace of economic growth this year will help ease core price pressures sooner than policymakers expect. On the whole, however, there is nothing in the bank's latest communications to suggest changes to the policy rate will be forthcoming any time soon. …

Notably, Macklem's statement mentions for the first time that “elevated uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the timing or direction of the next change in the policy rate.” This will catch the eye of investors holding more hawkish views, who have moved to price in roughly 10bp of hikes by the end of the year. We agree that the policy rate's next move will be upwards, but we do not expect this to come until 2027, providing that CUSMA renegotiations have been wrapped up by then.”

“A widely expected hold, but the emphasis on uncertainty in the statement was prominent. The bank emphasized the data dependent approach in the coming months as the [USMCA] review and geopolitical events could shift the outlook in 2026. That said, our baseline outlook is relatively in line with the BoC – below-trend growth helping inflation continue to moderate. Under these conditions we expect the BoC to stay on the sidelines in the coming months.”

The path forward for interest rates could hinge, to a great deal, on the future of North American trade. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is up for review this year.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

There weren't many surprises in Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem's opening statement on Wednesday. The outlook for economic growth and inflation is roughly the same as it was in the fall. The benchmark interest rate – still at 2.25 per cent – is considered “appropriate” for an economy both stung by tariffs, but growing modestly. And of course, the outlook is hazy: The word “uncertainty” appeared seven times in Mr. Macklem's statement.

Financial markets haven't reacted much to Wednesday's decision. Investors think there's a decent chance that the Bank of Canada raises interest rates once by the end of the year, with those views subject to revision.

The path forward for interest rates could hinge, to a great deal, on the future of North American trade. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is up for review this year, and the outcome is highly uncertain – everything from a U.S. withdrawal to a renewal, potentially with major tweaks to trade policy.

As the Bank of Canada has frequently pointed out, the trade war has delivered structural damage to the economy. Gross domestic product is on a weaker track than previously projected, and the gap won't be closed.

Suffice to say, a bad outcome in the USMCA review will bring more damage. But the central bank has plenty of room to cut rates to support the economy – even if that's not the baseline assumption out of Bay Street.

- Mark Rendell

After a healthy rebound in gross domestic product growth in the third quarter of 2025, the bank now thinks GDP growth flatlined in the fourth quarter – with volatility driven by sharp swings in trade and business stockpiling.

The bank's new forecast, published Wednesday in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, sees muted growth ahead, as economic activity is held back by trade uncertainty and slow population growth. 

GDP is expected to grow 1.1 per cent in 2026 and 1.5 per cent in 2027, which is largely unchanged from the last projection in October.

This forecast remains highly conditional on U.S. trade policy, particularly the outcome of the upcoming review of the North American free-trade pact, which Mr. Macklem flagged as an “important risk to the outlook.” 

There are also questions about how well, and how quickly, Canadian businesses and consumers can adjust to a world where preferential access to the U.S. market is no longer guaranteed. “The transition to the new trade environment could be smoother than we expect, with stronger business and household spending,” Mr. Macklem said. 

“Alternatively, the labour market could weaken further as trade impacts deepen, leading to lower household spending. Financial conditions could also tighten if volatility returns to markets.”

- Darcy Keith

Hard to detect even a tremor in markets in reaction to this widely expected decision today. The Canadian dollar did tick up slightly, to a more than one-year high of 73.87 cents US, but don't read much into that: the U.S. dollar was also ticking lower against major currencies as that high was reached. 

Canada's two-year bond yield was barely changed on the news too, up just slightly for the session and well within ranges of the past week. 

And we're seeing that lack of movement in the bond market play out in implied interest rate probabilities for where rates go from here. Overnight index swap markets still imply a consensus among traders that the Bank of Canada will remain on hold throughout the rest of this year - although there is a very slim probability priced in for a cut in April or June (around 4 per cent) and more robust odds of a rate hike by October (about 30-per-cent odds). 

- Mark Rendell

The Bank of Canada kept its benchmark interest rate steady on Wednesday and offered little guidance about where monetary policy will go next as U.S. protectionism continues to reshape the Canadian economy.

As widely anticipated, the bank's governing council kept the policy rate at 2.25 per cent, where it has been since October.

Governor Tiff Macklem said this level “remains appropriate” given the bank's outlook for slow, but positive economic growth, and subdued inflation. But he was non-committal about how long the bank would remain on hold or what its next move might be.

“Uncertainty around our forecast is heightened and the range of possible outcomes is wider than usual. U.S. trade policy remains unpredictable, and geopolitical risks are elevated,” Mr. Macklem said, according to the prepared text of his press conference opening statement.

“The consensus was that elevated uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the timing or direction of the next change in the policy rate,” he added.

Financial markets expect the bank to remain on hold through 2026.

The action will shift to Washington later this afternoon, where the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce its own interest rate decision against the backdrop of intense political pressure from the White House. 

Like the Bank of Canada, the Fed is widely expected to remain on hold, keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 3.5 to 3.75 per cent. (The Fed targets a range, not a single point.)

After cutting rates three times in fall, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in December that the central bank was now “well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves from here.” Since then, stronger-than-expected U.S. GDP and employment data has reinforced the case for a hold.

This is unlikely to sit well with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has harangued the Fed for months to lower interest rates further, and taken multiple steps to undercut the central bank's ability to operate independently.

The President placed a close ally, Stephen Miran, on the Fed board of governors, and tried to fire another Fed board member, Lisa Cook. Earlier this month, Mr. Powell revealed that the U.S. Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation into his handling of Fed building renovations and his testimony to Congress.

Mr. Powell dismissed the accusations as pretexts. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” he said in an extraordinary video released on the Fed's website.

Financial markets are betting the U.S. central bank will remain on hold for the next three decisions, before cutting again in June. By then, Mr. Trump will have appointed a new and presumably more dovish chair, willing to push for his vision of lower interest rates.

The announcement is at 2 p.m. ET followed by a press conference by Mr. Powell at 2:30 p.m. ET.

The Bank of Canada sent a clear signal last month not to expect interest rate changes any time soon and Bay Street is running with this narrative. 

Interest rate swap markets, which capture expectations about monetary policy, see the bank remaining on hold through 2026, according to Bloomberg data. 

Investors think the next move will be a hike rather than a cut. But markets have largely dropped their expectation of a hike this fall. This week, swap market data put the odds of a quarter-point hike by December below 50 per cent. 

Likewise, 26 out 35 economists polled by Reuters last week said they expect the central bank to keep interest rates steady this year. Some, however, think the bank could lower rates further if U.S.-Canada trade relations deteriorate. The key thing to watch is the review of the continental trade agreement, the USMCA, which is scheduled to take place by this summer. 

- Mark Rendell

Bay Street isn't expecting fireworks from the Bank of Canada today. 

Having cut interest rates nine times since the summer of 2024, the central bank effectively hit cruise control last month. It held its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.25 per cent and said that further moves in either direction are unlikely any time soon. 

As far as the central bank is concerned, there isn't a clear rationale for either cuts or hikes right now.

Inflation is running slightly hot, but not enough to really worry central bankers. Economic growth is muted and unemployment is elevated, but the country has not fallen into the recession many economists were expecting this time last year. 

The big question mark remains U.S. trade policy, especially the future of the North American free-trade pact, the USMCA, which is up for review this summer. 

If the U.S. decides to walk away from the USMCA, the Bank of Canada could cut interest rates further to cushion the blow. However, that's not the base case currently being priced into markets, which see the bank remaining on hold through 2026.

With no one expecting a move today, Bay Street analysts will mainly be watching Governor Tiff Macklem's post-announcement press conference for hints about where rates might go from here, and parsing the quarterly Monetary Policy Report, which will contain the bank's updated economic growth and inflation forecasts.

The U.S. central bank gave little indication in its latest policy statement of when borrowing costs might fall again

The U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, citing still-elevated inflation alongside solid economic growth, and giving little indication in its latest policy statement of when borrowing costs might fall again.

“Economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace,” Fed policymakers said in the statement after voting 10-2 to hold the U.S. central bank's benchmark interest rate in the 3.50 per cent to 3.75 per cent range following a two-day meeting.

Both Governor Christopher Waller, a contender to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term as central bank chief ends in May, and Governor Stephen Miran, on leave from his job as an economic adviser at the White House, dissented in favor of a quarter-percentage-point rate cut.

The Fed's statement offered no hint about when another reduction in borrowing costs might come, noting that “the extent and timing of additional adjustments” to the policy rate would depend on incoming data and the economic outlook.

Meanwhile, inflation “remains somewhat elevated,” the central bank said, while the job market has “shown some signs of stabilization.”

Though the Fed noted that “job gains have remained low,” it also removed language from its prior statement saying that downside risks to employment had risen - an indication policymakers as a group are becoming less worried about a rapid downturn in the labor market.

Fed policymakers ahead of this week's meeting had largely characterized the job market as roughly in balance, with smaller gains matching the slower growth in the numbers of those seeking employment as a result of the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies. The unemployment rate in December fell to 4.4 per cent.

Mr. Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET to discuss the policy statement and economic outlook.

Food prices are now driving inflation, which could complicate the Bank of Canada's rate path ahead.Carlos Osorio/Reuters

On Wednesday, to the surprise of few, the Bank of Canada held its policy interest rate at 2.25 per cent. We agree with the decision, though believe food price increases are likely to pose an ongoing challenge for the bank. It could test the limits of monetary policy.

When the bank leaves its policy rate unchanged and the rate sits in the so-called neutral rate range – where the bank is neither trying to stimulate nor slow the economy – the data are often conflicting. This time was no different.

Headline inflation (the change in the consumer price index over the preceding 12 months) nudged up to 2.4 per cent in December from 2.2 per cent in November, but it was 0.4 percentage points above the bank's 2 per cent target.

On the other hand, fourth-quarter GDP growth appears sluggish, with the likely best-case outcome seeing the Canadian economy eke out a weakly positive gain when Statistics Canada releases the data at the end of February. Moreover, labour growth stagnated in December and the unemployment rate increased to 6.8 per cent, up from from 6.6 per cent.

This kind of conflicting data makes a strong case for a hold.

Philip Soper, CEO of Royal Le Page, says a "further degradation" of Canada's relationship with the U.S. could act as a damper on the spring housing market.Sammy Kogan/The Globe and Mail

For the past year and a half, scores of prospective first-time homebuyers have held back, waiting for both home prices and borrowing costs to reach bottom. With rates now on hold, many of them may finally decide to jump into the upcoming spring housing market.

But how many will actually pounce may depend on the fate of the renegotiation of the North American free-trade agreement, the USMCA, which is scheduled for a review in July.

“A further degradation of the relationship with the U.S. or a clear indication that there would be no reasonable renewal of our trade agreement with Mexico and the U.S. could actually act as a damper on the spring market,” said Philip Soper, CEO of Royal Le Page.

Still, barring any significant trade shocks, Mr. Soper expects homebuyers to come out of hibernation. 

Employment levels among the key 25-to-54-year-old demographic are healthy, Canadians' savings rates remain strong and far above prepandemic levels, and inflation is reasonable. Yet, especially in larger housing markets, the volume of home sales has remained well below historical norms.

It means, “there's a lot of people that need housing and relatively few transactions occurring,” Mr. Soper said.

But don't expect the release of that pent-up demand to result in bidding wars and escalating home prices. The market is well stocked with homes for sale and more will come online as the weather warms. 

Instead, Mr. Soper expects prices to decline by another 3 to 4 per cent in Toronto and Vancouver this year, with most smaller markets registering low, single-digit price gains.

We think it's going to take some time, and through that period, growth will be modest … the more we adjust, the stronger the economy can be, the more resilient the economy can be.”

“Bottom line is we agreed that the current policy rate is appropriate if the economy evolves broadly in line with the outlook we just published… The clear consensus was it's very difficult to predict either the direction or the timing of the next move in our policy rate. To put it a bit more technically, in order to assign probabilities as to the direction of the next move… you need to be able to assign probabilities to the risks, and I think the way we were feeling is, given high uncertainty, that's difficult. We are monitoring those risks very closely, and if a new shock comes along, or an accumulation of evidence that materially changes our outlook, we're prepared to respond.”

“In the last couple of weeks, you've seen some renewed U.S. dollar weakness, and so many currencies, including the Canadian dollar, are appreciating somewhat against the U.S. dollar. What's driving that? I think it's largely geopolitical events. … International investors, they still want exposure to U.S. equities. U.S. equity markets have been strong, but that safe haven role of the U.S. dollar has been dented. People don't want as much exposure to the U.S. dollar. They're hedging more of that. … And at the same time, you're seeing other safe havens, most notably gold, up a lot.”

“The threat to independence of the central bank in the United States is one thing that has sort of been contributing to this sense of uncertainty. Look, why did I make a point of commenting on Chairman Powell and the U.S. Fed? The simple reason is the U.S. Federal Reserve is the biggest and most important central bank in the world. And we all need it to work well. A loss of independence of the Fed would affect us all, and for Canada, our financial markets are particularly integrated with the United States, so it would particularly affect us. It's hard to predict exactly what this would look like, but keeping the Fed operating independently, it's good for Americans, it's good for Canadians. … What does independence do? It provides central banks with the space to take difficult decisions that benefit the economy, benefit the citizens of that country over the medium-term.”

- Matt Lundy

“There's a sense that geopolitical risks are heightened. I'm not going to go through every event, but the month of January has been pretty packed with new elements, new geopolitical risks. Through the last spring, there were some very big changes, some pauses, some reintroductions and deals. Through the summer, I don't want to say uncertainty was low, but you saw a little more stability. Recently you've seen more unpredictability in U.S. policy, with all sorts of threats, including on Canada. And then I think the CUSMA review is coming more into focus. It's now 2026; it is under review this year. So those are really the key elements that have increased uncertainty. “

- Matt Lundy

“What we are saying is that uncertainty around our forecast is unusually high. There are a number of risks and uncertainties. Geopolitical risks have increased, they're heightened. U.S. trade policy remains highly unpredictable, and for Canada, what the outcome is of the review of CUSMA is an important risk to our projection. What we have built into our projection is that tariffs that are currently in place, remain in place. … We go through a number of possible outcomes for CUSMA. I would stress that we've done a number of scenarios.”

“Considering both our baseline forecast and the risks, Governing Council discussed the future path of monetary policy. While Council judges the current policy rate is appropriate based on our outlook, the consensus was that elevated uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the timing or direction of the next change in the policy rate.”

“Tariffs and uncertainty continue to disrupt the Canadian economy. After a strong third quarter, economic growth likely stalled in the fourth quarter. Exports continue to be buffeted by U.S. tariffs, while domestic demand appears to be picking up. Household spending is expected to continue growing moderately, supported by past cuts in interest rates and rising disposable incomes. U.S. tariffs and related uncertainty have held back business investment. But we expect some modest strengthening in investment as businesses adjust to the new trade environment and governments increase infrastructure spending.”

“The impact of US tariffs can also be seen in the labour market. Employment weakened in the first half of 2025 as sectors hit hard by U.S. tariffs cut production and jobs. In recent months, overall employment has risen, led by hiring in services like health care, and slowing population growth is reducing the number of new entrants into the labour market. Still, the unemployment rate remains high at 6.8%, youth unemployment is particularly elevated, and relatively few businesses say they plan to hire more workers in coming months.”

“Turning to inflation, it averaged 2.1 per cent last year, and has now been within the 1 per cent to 3 per cent band for two years. If we focus on recent movements, CPI inflation rose to 2.4 per cent in December, boosted by base-year effects linked to last winter's GST/HST holiday. The Bank's preferred measures of core inflation have eased from 3 per cent in October to around 2.5 per cent in December. The Bank expects CPI inflation to stay close to the 2 per cent target over the projection as tariff-related cost pressures are offset by excess supply.”

“Uncertainty around this outlook is unusually high. Geopolitical risks are elevated and the upcoming review of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement is an important risk to the outlook. It's also too early to tell how well the Canadian economy will adjust to current tariffs and ongoing uncertainty. The transition to the new trade environment could be smoother than we expect, with stronger business and household spending. Alternatively, the labour market could weaken further as trade impacts deepen, leading to lower household spending. Financial conditions could also tighten if volatility returns to markets.”

“Monetary policy cannot compensate for the structural damage caused by tariffs, and it cannot target hard-hit sectors of the economy. But it can play a supporting role, helping the economy through this period of structural change, while maintaining inflation close to the 2 per cent target.”

The Bank of Canada published a new forecast for economic growth and inflation on Wednesday in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report. 

- Darcy Keith

Here's how economists are reacting in written commentaries issued after the rate decision:

“There won't be anyone surprised by the Bank of Canada's well-telegraphed decision to keep rates on hold today, or its assessment that rates are at the right level if their forecast pans out. They remain firmly neutral on where things go from here, saying that “it's difficult to predict the timing or direction of the next move.” But if there's a slight leaning here, it's still towards some worries on the growth front due to uncertainties on trade, and a bit more comfort that underlying inflation is decelerating. The bank hasn't made any major changes in its forecasts, with an upside surprise in Q3 offset by a stall in growth in Q4 of 2025. With both historical actual and potential growth revised higher, the output gap in Q4 is in the range of -1.5 per cent to -0.5 per cent, unchanged from October's estimate. We'll stick to our forecast for no interest rate moves by the bank in 2026, but see the odds of a further cut as more likely than a hike, given the potential minefield in trade negotiations ahead, and a starting point that still has significant economic slack.” 

“The Bank of Canada's largely unchanged economic projections are similar to our own, although we think the slow pace of economic growth this year will help ease core price pressures sooner than policymakers expect. On the whole, however, there is nothing in the bank's latest communications to suggest changes to the policy rate will be forthcoming any time soon. …

Notably, Macklem's statement mentions for the first time that “elevated uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the timing or direction of the next change in the policy rate.” This will catch the eye of investors holding more hawkish views, who have moved to price in roughly 10bp of hikes by the end of the year. We agree that the policy rate's next move will be upwards, but we do not expect this to come until 2027, providing that CUSMA renegotiations have been wrapped up by then.”

“A widely expected hold, but the emphasis on uncertainty in the statement was prominent. The bank emphasized the data dependent approach in the coming months as the [USMCA] review and geopolitical events could shift the outlook in 2026. That said, our baseline outlook is relatively in line with the BoC – below-trend growth helping inflation continue to moderate. Under these conditions we expect the BoC to stay on the sidelines in the coming months.”

The path forward for interest rates could hinge, to a great deal, on the future of North American trade. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is up for review this year.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

There weren't many surprises in Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem's opening statement on Wednesday. The outlook for economic growth and inflation is roughly the same as it was in the fall. The benchmark interest rate – still at 2.25 per cent – is considered “appropriate” for an economy both stung by tariffs, but growing modestly. And of course, the outlook is hazy: The word “uncertainty” appeared seven times in Mr. Macklem's statement.

Financial markets haven't reacted much to Wednesday's decision. Investors think there's a decent chance that the Bank of Canada raises interest rates once by the end of the year, with those views subject to revision.

The path forward for interest rates could hinge, to a great deal, on the future of North American trade. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is up for review this year, and the outcome is highly uncertain – everything from a U.S. withdrawal to a renewal, potentially with major tweaks to trade policy.

As the Bank of Canada has frequently pointed out, the trade war has delivered structural damage to the economy. Gross domestic product is on a weaker track than previously projected, and the gap won't be closed.

Suffice to say, a bad outcome in the USMCA review will bring more damage. But the central bank has plenty of room to cut rates to support the economy – even if that's not the baseline assumption out of Bay Street.

- Mark Rendell

After a healthy rebound in gross domestic product growth in the third quarter of 2025, the bank now thinks GDP growth flatlined in the fourth quarter – with volatility driven by sharp swings in trade and business stockpiling.

The bank's new forecast, published Wednesday in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, sees muted growth ahead, as economic activity is held back by trade uncertainty and slow population growth. 

GDP is expected to grow 1.1 per cent in 2026 and 1.5 per cent in 2027, which is largely unchanged from the last projection in October.

This forecast remains highly conditional on U.S. trade policy, particularly the outcome of the upcoming review of the North American free-trade pact, which Mr. Macklem flagged as an “important risk to the outlook.” 

There are also questions about how well, and how quickly, Canadian businesses and consumers can adjust to a world where preferential access to the U.S. market is no longer guaranteed. “The transition to the new trade environment could be smoother than we expect, with stronger business and household spending,” Mr. Macklem said. 

“Alternatively, the labour market could weaken further as trade impacts deepen, leading to lower household spending. Financial conditions could also tighten if volatility returns to markets.”

- Darcy Keith

Hard to detect even a tremor in markets in reaction to this widely expected decision today. The Canadian dollar did tick up slightly, to a more than one-year high of 73.87 cents US, but don't read much into that: the U.S. dollar was also ticking lower against major currencies as that high was reached. 

Canada's two-year bond yield was barely changed on the news too, up just slightly for the session and well within ranges of the past week. 

And we're seeing that lack of movement in the bond market play out in implied interest rate probabilities for where rates go from here. Overnight index swap markets still imply a consensus among traders that the Bank of Canada will remain on hold throughout the rest of this year - although there is a very slim probability priced in for a cut in April or June (around 4 per cent) and more robust odds of a rate hike by October (about 30-per-cent odds). 

- Mark Rendell

The Bank of Canada kept its benchmark interest rate steady on Wednesday and offered little guidance about where monetary policy will go next as U.S. protectionism continues to reshape the Canadian economy.

As widely anticipated, the bank's governing council kept the policy rate at 2.25 per cent, where it has been since October.

Governor Tiff Macklem said this level “remains appropriate” given the bank's outlook for slow, but positive economic growth, and subdued inflation. But he was non-committal about how long the bank would remain on hold or what its next move might be.

“Uncertainty around our forecast is heightened and the range of possible outcomes is wider than usual. U.S. trade policy remains unpredictable, and geopolitical risks are elevated,” Mr. Macklem said, according to the prepared text of his press conference opening statement.

“The consensus was that elevated uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the timing or direction of the next change in the policy rate,” he added.

Financial markets expect the bank to remain on hold through 2026.

Like the Bank of Canada, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to remain on hold today.Jacquelyn Martin/The Associated Press

The action will shift to Washington later this afternoon, where the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce its own interest rate decision against the backdrop of intense political pressure from the White House. 

Like the Bank of Canada, the Fed is widely expected to remain on hold, keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 3.5 to 3.75 per cent. (The Fed targets a range, not a single point.)

After cutting rates three times in fall, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in December that the central bank was now “well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves from here.” Since then, stronger-than-expected U.S. GDP and employment data has reinforced the case for a hold.

This is unlikely to sit well with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has harangued the Fed for months to lower interest rates further, and taken multiple steps to undercut the central bank's ability to operate independently.

The President placed a close ally, Stephen Miran, on the Fed board of governors, and tried to fire another Fed board member, Lisa Cook. Earlier this month, Mr. Powell revealed that the U.S. Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation into his handling of Fed building renovations and his testimony to Congress.

Mr. Powell dismissed the accusations as pretexts. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” he said in an extraordinary video released on the Fed's website.

Financial markets are betting the U.S. central bank will remain on hold for the next three decisions, before cutting again in June. By then, Mr. Trump will have appointed a new and presumably more dovish chair, willing to push for his vision of lower interest rates.

The announcement is at 2 p.m. ET followed by a press conference by Mr. Powell at 2:30 p.m. ET.

The Bank of Canada sent a clear signal last month not to expect interest rate changes any time soon and Bay Street is running with this narrative. 

Interest rate swap markets, which capture expectations about monetary policy, see the bank remaining on hold through 2026, according to Bloomberg data. 

Investors think the next move will be a hike rather than a cut. But markets have largely dropped their expectation of a hike this fall. This week, swap market data put the odds of a quarter-point hike by December below 50 per cent. 

Likewise, 26 out 35 economists polled by Reuters last week said they expect the central bank to keep interest rates steady this year. Some, however, think the bank could lower rates further if U.S.-Canada trade relations deteriorate. The key thing to watch is the review of the continental trade agreement, the USMCA, which is scheduled to take place by this summer. 

- Mark Rendell

Bay Street isn't expecting fireworks from the Bank of Canada today. 

Having cut interest rates nine times since the summer of 2024, the central bank effectively hit cruise control last month. It held its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.25 per cent and said that further moves in either direction are unlikely any time soon. 

As far as the central bank is concerned, there isn't a clear rationale for either cuts or hikes right now.

Inflation is running slightly hot, but not enough to really worry central bankers. Economic growth is muted and unemployment is elevated, but the country has not fallen into the recession many economists were expecting this time last year. 

The big question mark remains U.S. trade policy, especially the future of the North American free-trade pact, the USMCA, which is up for review this summer. 

If the U.S. decides to walk away from the USMCA, the Bank of Canada could cut interest rates further to cushion the blow. However, that's not the base case currently being priced into markets, which see the bank remaining on hold through 2026.

With no one expecting a move today, Bay Street analysts will mainly be watching Governor Tiff Macklem's post-announcement press conference for hints about where rates might go from here, and parsing the quarterly Monetary Policy Report, which will contain the bank's updated economic growth and inflation forecasts.

Ukrainian forces struck the Khokholskaya oil depot in Russia's Voronezh Oblast and several Russian military facilities in occupied territories on Jan. 27–28, the General Staff said.

Ukraine regularly strikes Russian military facilities, as well as oil infrastructure that helps Russia finance its war and supply the Russian army with weapons, fuel, and equipment.

The attack on the oil depot caused a fire at the facility and ignited stored petroleum products. Thick smoke is rising above the site, the General Staff said. Damage from the strike is still being assessed.

Ukrainian forces also targeted Russian troop locations in the village of Kolotilovka in Russia's Belgorod Oblast, as well as near the villages of Velyka Novosilka, Shakhove, and Hryhoriivka in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast, and near the town of Huliaipole in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the report read.

Huliaipole has been at the center of heavy fighting in recent months, even as Russian forces press their advance in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The city, however, remains under Ukrainian control.

During the recent strikes, the Ukrainian army attacked a drone control center near Velyka Novosilka, a battalion command post near the village of Berezove in partially occupied Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and an ammunition depot near the village of Nyzhnia Duvanka in the occupied part of Luhansk Oblast, according to the General Staff.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the military's claims.

The General Staff previously confirmed that Ukrainian drone strikes inflicted damage on Russian oil and weapons facilities in widespread attacks carried out overnight on Jan. 22.

Targets included Russia's Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, several radar stations in Russian-occupied Crimea, a drone storage facility in the occupied part of Kherson Oblast, command and observation post of Russian military personnel in Donetsk Oblast.

MOSCOW, January 28. /TASS/. India signed the "mother of all deals" with the EU, and Moscow is willing to act as a mediator between Iran and the United States. Meanwhile, Syria's interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa is expected to visit Moscow later on Wednesday. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

On January 27, the European Union and India concluded talks on establishing a free trade zone, according to a statement from the 16th India-EU summit. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it the most important trade agreement of all time.

The Indian PM wrote on X that the "mother of all deals" was signed on January 26, when his country marked the 77th Republic Day. In 2024, trade between the EU and India amounted to 120 billion euros, according to Eurostat, with India being the bloc's ninth-largest trade partner and the EU being India's second-largest trade partner.

The deal is a win for India, Gleb Makarevich, junior researcher at the Center for Indo-Pacific Studies under the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, told Vedomosti. For India, it entails the development of an export-oriented economy, the construction of new businesses, the creation of new jobs as well as the resolution of socio-economic problems, Makarevich said. India is pursuing the key goal of 8% annual GDP growth, and New Delhi realizes that exports to a vast and solvent market would contribute to reaching that. India had been in talks with Brussels since 2007, but those accelerated last year under tariff pressure from US President Donald Trump, Makarevich acknowledged.

There is no provision making it obligatory for New Delhi to join the anti-Russian sanctions in the India-EU trade deal, the Indian embassy in Moscow told Izvestia, even as Brussels tried to add such a clause to the document, according to the European Parliament. Russia will be able to assess the potential consequences of the deal only after all protocols have been made public, the Russian Economic Development Ministry specified. What is clear already is that the establishment of a free trade zone between India and the EU will not close the doors to signing a similar agreement between the republic and the EAEU, a scenario currently being discussed, the ministry said.

It's worth noting that relations between Russia and India have progressed to the level of "a special and privileged strategic partnership," Tatyana Shaumyan, head of the Center for Indian Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oriental Studies, told Izvestia. "This is evident from practical steps, with the number of [Indian] consular offices rising in Russia <…>. This, I think, indicates continued interest in relations with India and the need to expand cooperation," the expert explained.

 

The Middle East is on the brink of war as experts say the United States may launch an attack on Iran, one of the largest countries in the region. A US carrier strike group is now in the Indian Ocean. Washington explains the move by an ambition to pressure Tehran into signing a new nuclear deal, even as the United States and its allies have repeatedly sabotaged similar agreements with the Islamic Republic in the past.

"We are always ready to offer our mediation, if both negotiating parties ask us, which they have not done yet. Of course, Washington and Tehran must negotiate, but the impression is forming that the lack of progress on the bilateral track is largely due to the specifics of the extremely demanding negotiating approaches on the part of the United States, which look more like an ultimatum," Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, told Izvestia.

There is indeed a high likelihood of a US attack on Iran, Vadim Koroshchupov, a junior research fellow at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, told Izvestia. The New York Times reported that the United States has dispatched a dozen F-15E fighter jets to the region, and the USS Abraham Lincoln is carrying the latest F-35s, too.

Since the June war, Iran has strengthened its air and missile defense systems, Middle East expert Leonid Tsukanov told Izvestia. According to Israel, the country has roughly 1,500 ballistic missiles in service as it also enjoys the support of Yemen's Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah, even as the might of the Axis of Resistance has been significantly weakened as a result of the Gaza war.

If major damage is inflicted on Iran, the republic could respond by striking US military bases in Arab countries or a key US ally, Israel. Moreover, Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, through which the bulk of Middle Eastern oil passes. "If Iran does so, oil prices will soar, which would harm the United States too," Konstantin Blokhin, research fellow at the Center for the Study of Security Problems at the Russian Academy of Sciences, warned.

 

On Wednesday, Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa will make an official visit to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Syria TV and Sham TV reported. This will be al-Sharaa's second visit to the Russian capital since Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS, outlawed in Russia as a terrorist organization) captured power in December 2024. The two leaders will hold talks amid the ongoing tensions between Damascus and the Kurdish armed formations in the northeastern Arab Republic and the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Qamishli airport in Al-Hasakah Governorate. Neither Russia nor Syria has officially commented on the upcoming visit yet.

In Moscow, al-Sharaa will primarily seek political support from the Russian leadership amid recent developments in northeastern Syria, Russian International Affairs Council program manager Ivan Bocharov surmised. "Russia has traditionally been extremely responsible in addressing problems faced by confessional minorities in the Middle East; therefore, Damascus will likely try to draw on Russian experience and opportunities to stabilize the situation in its country," the expert explained to Vedomosti. In addition, he continued, the Russian military could, in theory, patrol southern Syria, which would allow Damascus to stabilize the situation in areas primarily inhabited by the Druze and ease tensions with Israel, he added.

Finally, the Syrian leadership expects to bolster trade and economic ties with Russia as it also counts on Moscow's assistance in reviving the Syrian economy devastated by the war, Bocharov added.

Al-Sharaa's second visit to Russia shows that Russian-Syrian relations are returning to the level of strategic partnership, Middle East expert Kirill Semyonov argued. The process was launched at the previous round of talks in October, and the two sides have held several joint meetings of intergovernmental commissions ever since, the expert recalled. "The latest talks cover a wide range of topics as they span beyond the issue of continued Russian military presence in Syria. The upcoming Syrian-Russian talks will give an additional impetus to deepening cooperation in the sphere of security, defense, culture as well as economy," he said.

According to Semyonov, the scheduled Russia-Syria summit in Moscow has nothing to do with the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Qamishli airbase.

 

Moscow and Islamabad are working on gas exploration projects in Pakistan, Ambassador of the Islamic Republic to Russia Faisal Niaz Tirmizi told Izvestia. In addition, he said, Pakistan is interested in purchasing Russian LNG. Russian companies could indeed become a good alternative to imports from Qatar, analysts say. The development of trade relations between the two countries has been hampered by Western sanctions, which could necessitate the creation of an independent payment system.

Pakistan's interest in Russian natural gas is dictated not only by political considerations but also by an acute demographic need: as of January 26, the country's population exceeded 250 million, rising at an annual pace of 1.6%. This puts colossal pressure on the domestic energy market and also makes Russian investment in Pakistan strategically justified.

According to Igor Yushkov, an expert at the Russian Financial University, Russia could benefit from the participation of its companies in projects to build gas infrastructure in Pakistan as contractors, enabling the country to increase blue fuel consumption. "We can offer them LNG from sanctions-affected projects," he said.

Trade between Russia and Pakistan has been mostly marred by payment difficulties amid Western sanctions. Moreover, Pakistan is currently facing a tough financial situation, and if Islamabad finds resources to pay for Russian supplies, those could be carried out, Vladimir Sotnikov, an expert in South Asia, explained to Izvestia.

 

South Korea stated that the trade agreements reached between President Lee Jae-myung and US leader Donald Trump in late October have de facto been in place even without formal approval from the parliament. Seoul was surprised by a Truth Social post from January 27 in which Trump announced an increase in renewed reciprocal tariffs from 15% to 25% citing what he called the failure by South Korean legislators to enact the "historic trade agreement."

The South Korean government held an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss Trump's post as it called for keeping calm until any legal confirmation comes from the United States. Indeed, there was no specific date for the latest decision to come into force mentioned in Trump's post, which leaves room for maneuvers.

However, the media questioned whether delayed parliamentary procedure caused Trump's ire this time around. Both Chosun Ilbo and Reuters reported, citing sources, that another conflict situation might have been the pretext, namely recent claims filed by South Korea against Coupang, a major e-commerce platform.

Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies Dmitry Kochegurov doubts Seoul is really postponing the ratification of the deal, arguing that Trump believes the opposite and would like to hurry them up. The US president is driven by the desire to demonstrate tangible results, preferably economic ones, to his electorate, not least because he is losing the popularity he once enjoyed in this area, the expert explained.

Legislative procedures on the investment plan will be expedited in the wake of Trump's threats as "there is nothing else for Seoul to do but negotiate with Washington," Alexandra Zuyeva, an expert at the Center for Military-Economic Studies at the Institute of Global Military Economics and Strategy, told Vedomosti. Commenting on the situation around Coupang, the expert said the probe against it was one of the reasons behind the latest US pressure on South Korea. According to Zuyeva, this is not a major story for Trump, and "he is seeking to exert pressure because he wants the deal implemented as soon as possible," the expert concluded.

U.S. President Donald Trump has previously said Canada will either have to pay US$61-billion to join Golden Dome, or be annexed.Alex Brandon/The Associated Press

Taylor C. Noakes is an independent journalist and public historian.

Golden Dome is back in the news, albeit in an unusual way.

It's not because Russia or China are building new intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, but because U.S. President Donald Trump worked himself into a corner promising he'd acquire Greenland one way or another, and the inevitable result was economic turmoil, the possible end of NATO, and Prime Minister Mark Carney telling the world the Pax Americana is effectively over.

After walking back his Greenland threats last week, Mr. Trump said the deal he had come to involves extending the Golden Dome to the island.

He also mentioned Golden Dome will be defending Canada, which is surprising because it's nothing more than a concept. But that wasn't nearly as surprising as finding out that the Canadian military is inexplicably still working with the Americans on its development, as reported by The Globe and Mail in a story about how the Canadian military has modelled a potential response to an American invasion.

Opinion: Canada should firmly reject Trump's ludicrous Golden Dome plan

Leaving aside the question of whether it is wise for a country threatened with annexation to continue collaborating on joint defence projects with the potential aggressor (it isn't), the fact remains that Golden Dome is neither an effective deterrent nor a good use of our money.

Mr. Trump has previously said Canada would either pay US$61-billion to join Golden Dome, or be annexed.

For roughly the same amount of money, Canada could build several hundred Gripen NG fighter aircraft, as well as all the new airbases, trainers, munitions, radar sites and support aircraft needed to ensure no one ever questions our sovereignty ever again. The added advantage is that we would retain a far greater amount of the economic benefit as much as win back some much needed political, military and economic sovereignty from the Americans. The idea has merit, and has been recommended by experts.

This will not happen with Golden Dome, which is supposed to involve exceptionally sophisticated ground-based interception missiles, and as much as potentially tens of thousands of missile-armed satellites. It is highly unlikely Canada would play a prominent role in the system's development, nor substantially benefit economically.

Golden Dome signals change to Canada's long-time opposition to joining U.S. missile defence

Back in the late 1950s, the first attempt at developing an integrated continental defence scheme between Canada and the U.S. resulted in the construction of American radars, the acquisition of American fighters and the deployment of American missiles, all of which were obsolete within a decade. In return, we got the right to build and staff the radar and missile stations, a political crisis over nuclear weapons and the termination of the Avro Arrow.

The important parallel to consider is that this first effort to build a defence against the Soviet Union's strategic weapons neither benefited our economy nor did anything to slow down the arms race. Just the opposite occurred, and while the U.S. and Soviet Union nearly bankrupted themselves building ICBMs, junior partners such as Canada were left holding the bag with equipment that was outdated not long after it became operational.

Superpowers commanding global economies might be able to absorb that level of unproductive military spending, but Canada cannot. If we're going to spend considerable public money to ensure against threats to our sovereignty, the economic benefit has to be real, immediate and serve Canadians first.

That said, we might reconsider the basic economics of anti-ballistic missile defence shields.

Ensuring our side has enough interceptor missiles to engage and defeat every one of the other side's warheads quickly becomes an impossible task: The defending side would have to build and maintain several times as many interceptors than the enemy's warheads, and it's always cheaper for the enemy to build more missiles and warheads than what it costs to defend against them. 

Canada has been working for years to prepare for Golden Dome, Air Force general says

And that's just ground-based interceptors, the most sophisticated of which have an at-best 50 per cent success rate, and only during scripted tests operating in the most ideal of circumstances.

Golden Dome proposes to do this and develop tens of thousands of armed satellites as well. It could cost US$3.6-trillion, and critics argue it's effectively a giant corporate welfare program. 

Even the name is a misnomer, an allusion to Israel's Iron Dome, a system that's only useful against unsophisticated drones and slow-moving rockets, none of which carry nuclear warheads. Of greater concern, it would result in both the militarization of space (breaking a nearly 60-year-old international agreement that Canada, the U.S., Russia and China are all parties to), and invariably result in a new weapons race, one most experts agree would result in disaster.

This is not a sensible path forward to bring about world peace, but the machinations of a cartoon supervillain.

Editor's note: The story has been updated with additional details.

An EU-sanctioned shadow fleet vessel was being escorted to Morocco by a Spanish rescue ship, Reuters reported on Jan. 27, citing Spain's maritime authorities.

The Chariot Tide, formerly known as Marabella Sun, was flying a Mozambique flag when its engine broke down on Jan. 22 in international waters within Spain's search-and-rescue zone. 

The ship has been under EU sanctions since December 2024 for transporting Russian oil and "using irregular high-risk shipping practices."

The news comes shortly after 14 European countries — excluding Spain — issued a warning to Russia's shadow fleet in the Baltic and North Sea and pledged to step up maritime security.

The shadow fleet is a group of aging, poorly insured tankers that Moscow uses to evade international sanctions. The EU and the U.K. have pledged to increase pressure on the fleet, with hundreds of vessels appearing on sanctions lists.

Western governments have linked the fleet to Russian-backed hybrid operations, while experts say it poses environmental risks due to an increased likelihood of oil spills.

The Charlot Tide was being escorted to the Moroccan port of Tanger Med in the Gibraltar Strait, some 45 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Tangiers, by the Spanish maritime rescue vessel Clara Campoamor, Merchant Marine told Reuters.

The Spanish maritime authority did not clarify why the vessel was not seized.

Marine Traffic tracking data shows the vessel off the Moroccan coast heading for Tangiers.

Only last week, French forces boarded a shadow fleet tanker in the Mediterranean, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying Paris would "not tolerate any violation."

Several Russia-linked shadow tankers were also detained in recent weeks by the U.S. as part of Washington's crackdown on the Venezuelan oil trade.

Tanker Marinera, formerly known as Bella 1, was detained by U.S. forces while flying a Russian flag on Jan. 7. Two Russian crew members detained have been released and are on their way to their homeland, the Russian Foreign Ministry claimed on Jan. 28.

His career in journalism began in 2021 after graduating from Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia, earning a Master's degree in Conflict and Democracy Studies. Martin has been invited to speak on Times Radio, France 24, Czech Television, and Radio Free Europe. He speaks English, Czech, and Ukrainian. 



 Colombians, many shaped by decades of armed conflict at home, have become one of the largest groups of foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. The Kyiv Independent's Jared Goyette speaks with a Colombian volunteer who spent two years fighting in Ukraine.

Kyiv is pushing to delay a new tax on self-employed entrepreneurs until after the war has ended, as well as raise the threshold at which entrepreneurs would start paying the levy, a person in the Ukrainian government familiar with the talks told the Kyiv Independent.





Russian forces launched missile and drone attacks on several Ukrainian regions, including Kyiv and surrounding areas, overnight on Jan. 28, local authorities reported.

Three Russian Geran-2 drones struck the train on Jan. 27 at around 4:30 p.m. local time in the Barvinkove community. 

The Kremlin has sought to strengthen ties with the new leadership in Damascus after the toppling of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, a Russian ally, in 2024.

Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Moscow is prepared to ensure President Volodymyr Zelensky's security.

The attack on the oil depot caused a fire at the facility and ignited stored petroleum products. Thick smoke is rising above the site, the General Staff said. 

The Chariot Tide, formerly known as Marabella Sun, was flying a Mozambique flag when its engine broke down on Jan. 22 in international waters within Spain's search-and-rescue zone. 



Russian forces have sustained nearly 1.2 million casualties since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, paying a steep price for limited gains, a new CSIS report finds.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged an electrical substation in Russia's Udmurt Republic, disrupting power supply to the nearby "BUMMASH" military‑industrial plant, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Jan. 28.

            US forces will conduct a multi-day air exercise in the Middle East as Washington bolsters its military presence in the region amid tensions with Iran.
    


            The exercise would allow airmen to prove “they can disperse, operate, and generate combat sorties under demanding conditions — safely, precisely and alongside our partners,” said a statement from Lt. Gen. Derek France, commander of US Central Command's Air Forces Central and Combined Forces Air Component.
    


            The announcement comes after President Donald Trump warned that an “armada” is heading toward Iran and threatened possible military action against the regime, which has launched a brutal crackdown on a wave of anti-government protests.



            Trump repeated this threat Wednesday, saying that unless Iran comes to the negotiating table, “the next attack will be far worse” than last year's US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
    


            “Time is running out,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
    


            In response, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations said Iran “stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect” but will defend itself and respond “like never before” if pushed.
    


            The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has already arrived, according to a Monday post by Central Command (CENTCOM), which oversees US forces in the Middle East and West and Central Asia.
    


            However, Trump is still considering his options on what, if any, action the US takes on Iran, and there is no indication that any decision has been made, sources have told CNN.
    


            “We have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case. I'd rather not see anything happen, but we're watching them very closely,” Trump said Friday.
    


            The CENTCOM announcement did not specify the exact location or duration of the drills, or what assets would be taking part.
    


            Tensions between the US and Iran have been inflamed in recent weeks over the regime's bloody crushing of dissent. More than 5,800 protesters have been killed since demonstrations began late last month, according to a Tuesday report by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which said an additional 17,091 deaths are still under review. CNN cannot independently verify HRANA's numbers. The Iranian government has acknowledged that thousands of people were killed.
    


            Trump has warned against killing protesters and has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Tehran does not change course. Last week, however, Trump said that Iran “wants to talk,” suggesting a possible diplomatic solution.
    


            On Monday, the administration reiterated it is open to having discussions with the Iranian regime if “they know what the terms are,” a US official said.
    


            Meanwhile, Iran has been escalating its rhetoric against the US, warning that any attack would be met with force that could of destabilize the entire Middle East. Tehran is “more than capable” of responding to any aggression from the US with a “regretful” response, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei told journalists Monday.
    


            “The arrival of one or several warships does not impact Iran's defensive determination,” he said. “Our armed forces are monitoring every development and are not wasting a single second to enhance their capabilities.”
    


            In Tehran, a four-story poster in the capital's Enghelab, or Revolution, Square threatens the destruction of an American aircraft carrier, according to CNN journalists on the ground.



            “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind,” it warns in English and Farsi over an image of the deck of the aircraft carrier strewn with bodies and streaked in blood that trails into the water behind in a shape similar to the stripes of the American flag.
    


Tehran's warning to the West



            A few blocks away, another government poster shows the 2016 capture of a US Navy boat, its crew of US Marines kneeling in surrender, their hands clasped behind their heads.
    


            According to CENTCOM, the readiness exercises will be conducted with approval from host countries and in “close coordination with civil and military aviation authorities, emphasizing safety, precision and respect for sovereignty.”
    


            Other countries in the region, including US allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have recently warned they would not let their airspace be used for any military action against Iran.
    


            The UAE, which hosts American military forces at a base in Abu Dhabi, has said it will not provide any logistical support for military action against Iran, either.

A man armed with a syringe sprayed a mysterious liquid at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) during a town hall she held in Minneapolis on Tuesday. Audience members tackled and restrained him as cheers broke out in the room. He has been arrested.

The incident took place after Omar called for dismantling U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and demanded the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Russia has suffered "more losses than any major power in any war since World War II," according to a new report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which says Moscow has paid a steep price for only limited territorial gains as its war in Ukraine drags into its fourth year.The CSIS report, published Jan. 27, estimates that Russian forces have sustained nearly 1.2 million casualties — including troops killed, wounded or missing — since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in Feb. 2022. As many as 325,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, the report found.

While Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly claimed that his forces have seized the battlefield initiative, CSIS concludes that Russia's advances have been slow and difficult, even after years of fighting.

Near Pokrovsk, the hottest area of the front line throughout 2025, Russian forces advanced at an average rate of only 70 meters per day — a pace slower than even some of the bloodiest battles of the past century.

Overall, Russian forces have gained less than 1.5% of Ukrainian territory since the start of 2024, highlighting what the report describes as "the attritional nature of the war," which has been marked by massive loss of personnel and equipment but limited battlefield gains.

The study also describes Russia as a "second- or third-rate economic power," citing challenges such as declining manufacturing, a labor shortage, and dwindling capital. 

Likewise, in emerging technologies, Russia continues to lag, as the country has zero companies among the world's top 100 technology firms and remains behind leading nations in key sectors such as artificial intelligence.

CSIS argues that Russia's economic stagnation and absence in growing industries reflect its broader decline as a major power, increasingly unable to compete with global economic leaders such as China and the United States.

The report's publication comes amid a renewed U.S.-led push to end the war in Ukraine, as well as mounting pressure on Kyiv to make territorial concessions — despite Russia's inability to secure the Donbas region even after more than a decade of fighting.

Another LIV golfer is headed back to where it all started.

Patrick Reed announced Wednesday that he will return to the PGA Tour after spending the last four years in the Saudi-backed league.

"I'm a traditionalist at heart, and I was born to play on the PGA TOUR, which is where my story began with my wife, Justine," the 2018 Masters champion wrote in a lengthy post on X.

Reed said the decision came after "careful thought and consideration," and he'll be eligible to play on the Tour later this year.

"I am very fortunate for the opportunities that have come my way and grateful for the life we have created. I am moving forward in my career, and I look forward to competing on the PGA TOUR and DP World Tour. I can't wait to get back out there and revisit some of the best places on earth," Reed said.

"Over the last four years, I have learned a lot about myself, about who I am and who I am not, and for that I am forever grateful. To Dustin Johnson, The Aces, and LIV Golf, I want to thank you for the memories we shared and created together. To golf fans around the world, I just want to thank you all for your continued support over the years. I just ask that you respect the decision we have made for our family, our children, and our future. Thank you for your continued support."

Reed is the second golfer this month to return to the PGA Tour after heading to LIV Golf. Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka, who won the 2023 PGA Championship while with LIV, will play in this weekend's Farmers Insurance Open.

NCAA CHAMPION LOSES MASTERS ELIGIBILITY AFTER TAKING 'RARE OPPORTUNITY' WITH LIV GOLF

LIV announced late last year that it would expand from its 54-hole format to 72 holes. The three-round format, along with guaranteed pay, had been cited as a key reason for golfers to join.

But several LIV stars, including Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith, stuck by the league's side.

"I had no idea, no idea that that would happen." DeChambeau said of Koepka's decision. "No idea what the penalties would even be. Right now, I've got a contract. I'm looking forward to seeing what we can do at LIV Golf this year."

"I made a decision to come out here and spend more time at home, and I'm not giving that away. I'll be on LIV for years to come," added Smith, who won the 2022 Open Championship shortly before officially committing to LIV.

In August 2024, Rahm shut down rumors of buyer's remorse to Fox News Digital, and that still appears to be the case.

"I'm not planning on going anywhere. Very similar answer to what Bryson gave. I wish Brooks the best. As far as I'm concerned, I'm focused on the league and my team this year, and hopefully we can repeat as champions again," Rahm said.

PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp said Koepka's return sparked the Returning Member Program for players who left the Tour and may decide to follow in his footsteps.

Rolapp said Koepka agreed to a few conditions upon his return to the PGA Tour. It included a "five-year forfeiture of potential equity in the PGA Tour's Player Equity Program, representing one of the largest financial repercussions in professional sports history, with estimations that he could miss out on approximately $50–85 million in potential earnings, depending on his competitive performance and the growth of the Tour," according to Rolapp. 

Koepka will also make a $5 million charitable donation to an organization yet to be determined.

A NASA aircraft had to make a "gear-up landing" in Houston on Tuesday due to a mechanical problem, NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens noted in a post on X.

"Today, a mechanical issue with one of NASA's WB-57s resulted in a gear-up landing at Ellington Field. Response to the incident is ongoing, and all crew are safe at this time," she said in the Tuesday afternoon post. 

"As with any incident, a thorough investigation will be conducted by NASA into the cause. NASA will transparently update the public as we gather more information," she added.

She issued a post on Wednesday noting that the crew members are doing well.

"Following standard medical evaluations at Ellington Field, both crew members aboard the WB-57 were cleared and are in good health. Both individuals are NASA employees. NASA operates three WB-57 aircraft; the one involved in today's incident carries tail number NASA927. The aircraft departed Ellington Field for a routine training flight at approximately 10:19 a.m. CST and landed at approximately 11:19 a.m.," Stevens noted in the post on Wednesday.

"NASA will lead a thorough investigation. Additional details will be provided once the investigation is complete. NASA anticipates no impact to Artemis II operations given the multiple aerial assets available to support, including the Gulfstream V, Gulfstream III, and a U.S. Navy C-20. These aircraft will provide imagery during key mission phases, including launch, entry, and splashdown," her post noted.

Video footage of the episode captured smoke and what appeared to be bright fire and/or sparks flying as the plane slid across the runway.

The Federal Aviation Administration noted, "A Martin WB-57 landed with its gear up at Ellington Airport in Houston around 11:25 a.m. local time on Tuesday, Jan. 27. Two people were on board. The FAA will investigate."

The WB-57 has been performing research missions for decades, according to the NASA Airborne Science Program website.

"The NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas is the home of the NASA WB-57 High Altitude Research Program," the site notes. "The WB-57 is a mid-wing, long-range aircraft capable of operation for extended periods of time from sea level to altitudes in excess of 63,000 feet."

A longtime television weatherman has died in a small plane crash in Idaho earlier this week.

On Tuesday, Jan. 27, Roland Steadham, the chief meteorologist for CBS2, was named as one of the people who died in the two-person crash near Emmett, Idaho earlier that day, CBS affiliate KBOI announced.

"For the past decade, Roland Steadham guided people through storm after storm in Idaho," the station wrote. "He loved to study the weather and shared it with people across Idaho. Roland's excitement for the weather was contagious."

According to the Gem County Sheriff's Office, officials responded to a report of a plane crash near the Payette River, just west of Montour, Idaho, on Tuesday at 10:58 a.m. local time.

Preliminary information, authorities said, indicated that the small plane clipped a power line and crashed upon the ice in the river. Both male occupants were "fatally injured" in the crash, authorities said.

Officials did not reveal who was flying the plane at the time of the incident.

The chief meteorologist, 67, was a devoted husband, father of six and grandfather, the station said.

"Roland often talked about his wife, Erin, and his six children and grandchildren," KBOI said. "In recent years, he and his family have enjoyed their time kayaking throughout Idaho and spending time together grilling food in their backyard."

"Rarely did he have a conversation without sharing about his love for his family," the outlet said.

Along with his love of his family, Steadham owned a small aircraft and enjoyed recreational flying.

"It was a hobby he enjoyed and often would share stories about local pilots and their accomplishments," the outlet said.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A group of local prosecutors concerned about recent immigration enforcement operations launched a project Wednesday to strategize and seek accountability for what they consider federal overreach and unconstitutional behavior.

The program is called Fight Against Federal Overreach, a tongue-in-cheek reference to an obscene acronym that is popular in memes and has been used by members of the Trump administration to taunt opponents.

Officials in Minnesota, along with criminal justice experts and former federal prosecutors, are increasingly critical of the federal response to the aggressive tactics being used by immigration officers in Minneapolis and the surrounding area. The killing of two civilians by federal officers, including the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday, has drawn increasing criticism from public officials, including Republicans, and massive protests.

Larry Krasner, Philadelphia District Attorney and one of the founding members of the group, said he's never before seen the law enforcement tactics and attitude recently apparent in U.S. cities. 

He said the officers who conceal their faces and badge numbers are unprofessional and that they have been given bad orders from authorities with a poor understanding of the law. He cited a declaration by Vice President JD Vance that the officers have immunity from prosecution for any of their actions.

“A functional Department of Justice, gone. Functional United States attorneys offices applying the law in an even handed way, gone. Good, qualified officials within those organizations, they're retiring, resigning or leaving,” Krasner said. “It used to be, you could rely on the federal government to rein in rogue sheriffs who are killing people on the side of the road ... but now the federal government are the rogue sheriffs.”




Local officials must fill the gap where federal authorities are failing, partly because there's no federal pardon power for state level convictions, he said. 

The Associated Press reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on the group and its accusations and did not receive an immediate response. But DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and other leaders have defended the officers' practices and tactics in Minneapolis and elsewhere as constitutional and necessary.

Federal officials denied Minnesota investigators access to the scene after the fatal shootings of Pretti and Renee Good. They also said the Justice Department's Civil Rights division didn't need to open an investigation into the fatal shootings, despite that being a longstanding practice after such fatal encounters. 

The group, which includes Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty — Minneapolis and St. Paul are part of the county — as well as prosecutors from Austin, Texas, and several Virginia jurisdictions among others, said the actions of immigration officers involved in enforcement operations are having negative repercussions on the criminal justice system.

Krasner noted immigration agents have been keeping tabs on courthouse proceedings, targeting and arresting people usually just outside the buildings. That means victims of crime are afraid to report them, and witnesses and even defendants are afraid to go to court.

He said local officials are increasingly concerned about practices such as warrantless entries and unlawful detentions along with other coercive enforcement tactics. 

“I think what we are feeling is the same thing the country is feeling,” Krasner said. “We are in general underreacting, though the country seems to be getting it right now. It's as if they were willing to be pushed and pushed and pushed, and they were pushed off a cliff ... and it's now too far.”

Criminal defense attorney Donna Rotunno joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss TPUSA CEO Erika Kirk's calls to speed up the trial against Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin Tyler Robinson following multiple delays.

Lawyers for Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused assassin of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, have asked a Utah judge to block video of the murder from being introduced as evidence at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 3.

Kirk, a 31-year-old father of two, suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the neck at Utah Valley University in September, when he was participating in a public speaking event sponsored by the campus chapter of Turning Point.

In a memorandum filed Tuesday, Robinson's attorneys claimed the video is irrelevant to their motion to have the county prosecutor's office disqualified from handling the case and would violate his right to a fair trial.

Robinson's lawyers have accused the Utah County Attorney's Office of having a conflict of interest because the adult child of a deputy prosecutor was present during the assassination. Prosecutors have denied a conflict and said they do not need or plan to rely on the adult child as a witness.

Several videos of Kirk's murder circulated widely online minutes after the shooting. It was not immediately clear from court filings if the video prosecutors planned to introduce as evidence has been publicly seen before.

The defense described it as a color video taken "only a few feet away from Mr. Kirk." It includes audio "including unidentified voices, immediately before, during and after the shooting."

"This is a solid argument," said Donna Rotunno, a Chicago-based criminal defense attorney and Fox News contributor.

She said prosecutors don't need to actually play the clip to illustrate that they don't need to rely on the adult child's testimony or to argue that they don't have a conflict.

"The video should not be played if it isn't needed to prove any material issues in the hearing," she said. "I do not see how it is needed to determine if the prosecution should be disqualified."

Skye Lazaro, a Salt Lake City-based criminal defense attorney who is not connected to the case, said she wouldn't want the video played either. However, she said, it's unclear how the judge will rule.

"I'm not sure they're going to be successful there," she told Fox News Digital.

Also in the filing, the defense claimed news coverage of the case has been "highly biased" and told the court they planned to ask to have cameras kicked out once again at the start of the next hearing. They wrote that if the video of Kirk's murder is played in court, it would be "subject to immediate publication nationwide and internationally."

Many outlets, including Fox News Digital, have avoided republishing widely circulated video of the slaying due to its extremely graphic nature.

China expert Gordon Chang tells Fox News Digital the removal of top commanders has left Beijing unstable and raised the risk of miscalculation across the region.

FIRST ON FOX: China's expanding push into the Pacific Islands is raising alarms among experts, who warn that Beijing is quietly working to establish a foothold in territory long viewed as vital to American defense.

Rather than deploying troops or building overt military bases, experts say China is using infrastructure projects, political influence and economic leverage to gain access to strategically sensitive areas across Micronesia, a region tied to the United States through decades-old security agreements.

Fox News Digital has learned that a Chinese-backed runway on the island of Yap is due to be officially opened during a handover ceremony on Feb 9. The president of the Federated States of Micronesia is expected to attend, along with representatives from the Chinese company involved in the project.

One of the experts tracking the developments, Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) senior fellow Cleo Paskal, traveled to the Federated States of Micronesia to see them firsthand. She told Fox News Digital she spent four days sleeping on the open deck of a Chinese-donated cargo ship in order to witness a Chinese company breaking ground on a project to rehabilitate a World War II Imperial Japanese runway.

NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS SOUND ALARM OVER CCP-LINKED LAND OWNERSHIP NEAR US MILITARY BASES: 'UNTHINKABLE'

"It's not a huge runway, but what it does is it gets China in the door and on the ground in a very strategic location," Paskal said.

The project is located in the state of Yap, a remote east-to-west island chain that sits along key maritime and air routes connecting Hawaii, Guam and East Asia. U.S. military planners have long considered Yap one of the most strategically important locations in the Pacific.

Paskal said the same Chinese company involved in the runway is now working on another major infrastructure project on Yap: the reconstruction of a bridge on the main island.

"At the same time, because of how strategic it is, Secretary Hegseth announced not that long ago about $2 billion worth of defense infrastructure investment for Yap," she said. "Now, when he says Yap, what he means is the main island of Yap."

According to Paskal, that distinction matters.

"The story here is that the Department of War is focused on the main island, but, from what I've seen, there are no plans for the rest of the island chain," she said. "Meanwhile, the Chinese are using other entry points into the political and economic system in order to start to break open access to Yap."

She described China's approach as fundamentally different from Washington's.

"So it's not just a physical kinetic infrastructure operation," Paskal said. "It's also a political warfare operation, whereas the U.S. is focusing more just on a very narrow band of the kinetic map."

The geography at stake has shaped American security strategy for generations.

During World War II, the lagoon at Ulithi, part of the Yap island chain, served as the largest U.S. naval base in the world, hosting hundreds of American warships as the military prepared for operations against Imperial Japan.

That history, Paskal said, helps explain why the region remains so sensitive today.

Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States retains exclusive defense rights in Micronesia. The agreements allow Washington to deny military access to other powers, establish defense facilities and maintain strategic control, while granting Micronesian citizens the right to live and work in the United States and serve in the U.S. military. The Compact creates such deep ties that Micronesia is considered part of the U.S. domestic mail system.

The compacts were designed after World War II to ensure Pacific islands once controlled by Japan could never again be used as launch points for attacks against the United States.

But Paskal warned that China is finding ways to work around, and potentially undermine, those arrangements.

She said U.S. officials often focus on visible construction sites while underestimating the broader political campaign that enables Chinese access in the first place. This includes cultivating ties with national leaders, engaging local officials such as customs and immigration officers and securing contracts through regional development banks in order to place Chinese companies and personnel on the ground.

According to Paskal, Chinese firms are often willing to absorb financial losses in exchange for long-term strategic positioning.

The concern is heightened by political shifts within Micronesia itself. While states such as Yap have historically been more resistant to Chinese engagement, the national government has grown closer to Beijing in recent years.

Former President of the Federated States of Micronesia David Panuelo warned in a March 9, 2023, letter that China was engaging in political warfare, including alleged bribery and pressure campaigns. He later lost his re-election bid, while the current government is viewed as more receptive to China.

When asked by Fox News Digital about China's activities in Micronesia, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said, "I am not aware of the specifics."

The spokesperson emphasized that China views Pacific Island Countries (PICs) as partners in development and denied any geopolitical intent.

"China always respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of PICs," the spokesperson said, adding that Beijing has "never interfered in the internal affairs of PICs, never attached any political strings, and never sought any geopolitical self-interest."

Paskal said this characterization is not accurate, pointing to what she described as China's targeted efforts to interfere with the internal decisions of three Pacific Island countries — Palau, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu — to recognize Taiwan, including explicitly attaching support to derecognition.

The spokesperson's statement added that the South Pacific should be "a stage for cooperation, rather than an arena for vicious competition" and insisted China's engagement does not target any country.

For U.S. security experts, however, the concern is not a single runway or bridge, but the gradual erosion of strategic access in a region that has underpinned American defense for more than 80 years.

China expert Gordon Chang told Fox News Digital, "We lost so many American lives in World War Two, taking these islands from the Japanese. And now we are letting China dominate them. This is just wrong. I can't, I get angry when I think about this. But the important point here is that we have the power to stop this," he said.

"The three compact states are our closest military allies, our closest allies full stop. We said that again. The three complex states in the Western Pacific are our closet allies. Guam is actually part of the United States. So we have the power to stop this and we're not doing that. And this is now on us, a strategic failure, a failure to understand what China is doing. I hope that the administration starts to understand the significance of what's occurring and moves to block Chinese infiltration of the Western Pacific."

As Paskal warned, China's campaign in the Pacific is unfolding not through force, but through influence, access, patience and presence.

Neither the White House nor the Department of War responded to requests for comment from Fox News Digital.

            An AI-generated blog on a tour company's website has landed tourists in hot water — and not the kind they were looking for — after it emerged the “tranquil” northern Tasmania hot springs it recommended don't actually exist.
    


            Screenshots shared with CNN of the now-deleted blog on Tasmania Tours' website show recommendations for “Weldborough Hot Springs,” said to offer “a peaceful escape” in the forests of northeast Tasmania. Described as a “tranquil haven,” the site was touted as a “favourite” among hikers.
    


            Weldborough is a small rural town about 110 kilometers (68 miles) from the city of Launceston.
    


            Scott Hennessey, the owner of the New South Wales-based Australian Tours and Cruises, which operates Tasmania Tours, told the Australian Broadcasting Network (ABC) earlier this month that “our AI has messed up completely.”
    


            The company had outsourced its marketing material to a third party, he said, and, while he normally reviews each post, the blog was published while he was out of the country.
    


            “We're trying to compete with the big boys,” Hennessy told ABC. “Part of that is you've got to keep your content refreshed and new all of the time.”
    


            “We're not a scam,” he continued. “We're a married couple trying to do the right thing by people … We are legit, we are real people, we employ sales staff.”
    


            Australian Tours and Cruises told CNN Tuesday that “the online hate and damage to our business reputation has been absolutely soul-destroying.”
    


            “We are just trying to get on with our lives and put the whole thing behind us,” the company continued.
    


            Kristy Probert, owner of the local Weldborough Hotel, told CNN she was confused when tourists started asking her questions about the hot springs in September.
    


            “It was only a couple of calls to start with,” Probert said, “but then people began turning up in droves. I was receiving probably five phone calls a day, and at least two to three people arriving at the hotel looking for them. We're in a very remote location so it was very random.”
    


            Probert said she would respond each time: “If you can find these hot springs, beers are on me.”
    


            The local Weld River is “freezing,” said Probert, and typically only occupied by prospectors searching for sapphire and tin. “They wear wetsuits,” she added. “There's a sauna in a nearby town. I guess you could jump into the freezing river after you've been over there.”
    


            Anne Hardy, adjunct professor in tourism at Southern Cross University, Australia, told CNN that AI had become “ubiquitous in travel and tourism,” adding that about 37% of tourists use AI for travel advice or itineraries.
    


            “Tourists trust AI more than review sites,” she said, adding that tour operators employ AI not only for blogs and marketing materials, but for itineraries and costing.
    


            “AI can be extremely helpful,” Hardy said. “It saves time and ultimately money.”
    


            However, she warned that it can also create inaccuracies or “hallucinations,” like the Weldborough “hot springs.”

            According to Hardy, empirical tourism research suggests “90% of itineraries that AI generates have mistakes in them.”
    


            She said this could have “extremely dangerous implications,” pointing to Tasmania's remote walks with no services or cell coverage as an example.
    


            “I have witnessed many cases where AI has made suggestions for day walks, which are very inaccurate, ranging from the length of the walk, its difficulty level, or weather conditions,” she told CNN.
    


            Hardy recommends travelers go beyond AI and do their own research.
    


            “Use trusted guidebooks, travel agents and review websites,” she said. “Plus ask concierges and your hosts to assess whether AI itineraries are accurate, if you do choose to use them.”
    


            Probert added that she feels sorry for the owners of Tasmania Tours, who she says she's spoken with over the phone.
    


            “It is hard to keep everything up to date and relevant as a small business,” she said. “They seem like lovely people, and we've all made mistakes. I think this was quite a funny one.”
    


            “There is plenty to do in Weldborough,” she assured visitors. “Just no hot springs.”

Cornell law professor William Jacobson says cutting off federal funding and locking in rules through formal regulation, rather than temporary executive orders, are key to dismantling discriminatory programs in higher education.

A prominent medical watchdog group is pushing back against a widely cited study claiming racially diverse medical facilities improve outcomes for Black patients, arguing the research is being used to justify race-based diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies despite failing to prove its central claim.

Do No Harm, a nonprofit organization focused on opposing ideological influence in medicine, released a report Tuesday disputing a recent study by economists Michael Frakes and Jonathan Gruber that suggests increasing the share of Black physicians in military medical facilities leads to better outcomes for Black patients.

The Do No Harm study takes issue with the findings by alleging several flaws, including that Frakes and Gruber's "The Effect of Provider Diversity on Racial Health Disparities: Evidence from the Military" measures changes in health outcomes when patients are transferred to bases with different proportions of Black doctors, but argues it never directly measures whether Black patients treated by Black doctors fare better than those treated by non-Black doctors.

The report stresses that the authors' design looks at facility-level shares of Black physicians rather than one-to-one patient-doctor racial matching.

In a press release, Do No Harm summarizes their critique into three core problems with the study: it never actually tests whether Black patients fare better when treated by Black doctors, it downplays findings showing Black patients achieve their best outcomes when treated by non-Black doctors at facilities with more Black physicians, and it relies on speculative explanations for those results while failing to rule out non-racial factors that could account for the outcomes.

"We cannot allow politically motivated activists to push debunked racial theories that have no positive impact on patient care," Jay Greene, director of research for Do No Harm, said in the press release.

"Studies like this are designed to codify DEI doctrine to pave the way for re-establishing affirmative action and enshrining race-based hiring. The report ignores the very question it purports to answer: whether black patients actually fare better with black doctors. Our report systematically exposes the study's shoddy methodology and baseless conclusions. Americans of all races and backgrounds deserve high-quality medical research, not political ideology disguised as science."

Do No Harm argues that the new study appears designed to influence judicial and policy debates, noting that Frakes and Gruber themselves say their findings could shape discussions about affirmative action in medical school admissions amid pending court decisions.

The Do No Harm critique concludes that, on the basis of the evidence presented by Frakes and Gruber, there is not a scientifically supported case for using racial concordance as a rationale for maintaining racial preferences in medical education and hiring. 

"Advocacy groups wishing to maintain racial preferences in medical hiring will almost certainly cite the Frakes and Gruber study in future court cases and legislative debates about the issue," the report's conclusion reads.

"Frakes and Gruber consciously produced their study with this use in mind. But as is often the case with advocacy-oriented research, this study is not a reliable basis for making policy decisions. The Frakes and Gruber study appears scientifically rigorous and is authored by economists from high-status universities, but a closer examination of its methods, results, and motivation reveal it to be scientifically unsound and an abuse of academic authority."

Fox News Digital reached out to Frakes and Gruber but did not receive a response.

A Democratic candidate for Ohio attorney general released a video in which he laid out his plan to “kill Donald Trump” through the death penalty after securing a hypothetical conviction.

Former Ohio state Rep. Elliot Forhan made the direct threat in a video posted to Facebook on Tuesday.

“I want to tell you what I mean when I say that I am going to kill Donald Trump,” he said. “I mean, I'm going to obtain a conviction rendered by a jury of his peers at a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt based on evidence presented at a trial conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process, resulting in a sentence duly executed of capital punishment.”

His highly divisive comments drew a whirlwind of criticism from Ohio Republicans.

Ohio State Auditor Keith Faber, who is running for state attorney general as a Republican, was among the politicians who condemned Forhan's rhetoric.

“That kind of vile comment makes it clear that Elliot Forhan is not qualified to be attorney general,” he said in his own video statement.

Faber called on Ohio Democrats, most notably gubernatorial candidate Amy Acton, to denounce Forhan. As of Wednesday morning, Acton had not addressed his rhetoric on social media.

Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican gubernatorial candidate and former 2024 presidential candidate, said it's “utterly shameful” that Acton and the Ohio Democratic Party have not commented on the behavior of one of their own, adding that they “implicitly endorse” it instead.

Ohio state Sen. Rob McColley made a similar statement to Ramaswamy.

“Ohio Democrats across the board, starting with Amy Acton and David Pepper, must denounce these disgusting comments from one of their party's leading candidates for Attorney General,” the Republican lawmaker posted. “Ohioans have overwhelmingly supported President Trump and there's absolutely no room for this dangerous rhetoric in our state.”

Pepper, who formerly chaired the Ohio Democratic Party, is Acton's running mate this election cycle.

Faber also took Forhan to task for openly celebrating Charlie Kirk‘s assassination last fall, using it as an example for why Americans need to “tamp down the rhetoric” in the country. In one Facebook post shortly after the conservative activist's death in September 2025, Forhan wrote, “F*** Charlie Kirk.”

Former state Rep. Jay Edwards, a Republican candidate for Ohio treasurer, said Forhan's latest statement “fits his pattern” of anger and wishing violence on conservatives.

“Democrats, your silence is telling. Dr. Amy Acton and Sherrod Brown—disavow this extremist now, or admit you're okay with this violent hate in your party,” he wrote on X. “Ohioans, this is why we fight. We stand stronger with President Trump against these radicals pushing threats and division.”

SHERROD BROWN LOSES FOURTH UNION ENDORSEMENT TO REPUBLICAN JON HUSTED

During his tenure in the state legislature, Forhan faced disciplinary action for allegedly harassing and intimidating colleagues and staff. In 2023, party leadership ultimately stripped him of all committee assignments and cut off his access to an office over his abusive behavior.

The embattled lawmaker finished third in the 2024 Democratic primary and lost his reelection bid. He served one term in the Ohio House from 2023 to 2024.

Vandals defaced a boulder and other sites at Yosemite National Park with graffiti over the weekend.

The graffiti was discovered near the Bridalveil Falls Trail and shared online by parkgoer Ando Arakelyan, the Fresno Bee first reported.

Arakelyan's photos showed a boulder, a door and an informational sign scrawled with the word "Yeti" in spray paint.

He told Outside that he's seen graffiti at Yosemite with increasing regularity.

Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., joins 'America Reports' to discuss House Republicans' push for Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent to investigate nonprofits suspected of fraud.

Nearly three-quarters of a million fraud-related suspicious activity indicators were reported by financial institutions in Minnesota in 2024. Concentrated largely in Hennepin, Ramsey and surrounding counties, these reports frequently cited transactions with no apparent lawful purpose, coordinated activity involving multiple individuals, misuse of checks and government payments, and patterns consistent with organized fraud rather than isolated misconduct.

Those numbers matter. Not because they are abstract statistics, but because they reveal how deeply fraud has embedded itself into our financial system and why it should be viewed not merely as a regulatory or financial issue, but as a national security concern.

The recent fraud headlines out of Minnesota involving daycare centers, medical providers and other sham businesses are not just local scandals. They are warnings.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS CALL MINNESOTA FRAUD PROBE 'TIP OF THE ICEBERG' AS MORE BLUE STATES FACE SCRUTINY

Fraud is often treated as a cost of doing business or a compliance failure. In reality, it is one of the most efficient entry points for illicit money to move through the U.S. financial system. And when illicit money moves freely, it does not remain benign. It fuels organized crime, corruption and networks that undermine public trust and stability.

That is why America's financial institutions sit at the tip of the spear.

Fraud is the intentional use of deception to obtain money, goods or services unlawfully. Money laundering is the process of disguising the proceeds of that fraud, so the funds appear legitimate. It typically occurs in three stages: placement of illicit funds into the financial system, layering transactions to obscure their origin, and integration, where the money re-enters the economy appearing clean, such as being paid out as payroll, rent or vendor expenses from what looks like a legitimate business.

Fraud creates dirty money. Money laundering keeps it alive.

PAM BONDI DISPATCHES FEDERAL PROSECUTORS TO MINNESOTA FOLLOWING SOMALI FRAUD ALLEGATIONS

In the Minnesota cases, the opportunity to detect this activity existed long before indictments or headlines. It existed the moment these businesses opened bank accounts.

Every U.S. financial institution is required to conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) due diligence. This process is designed to understand who a customer is, what they do, where they operate and whether their activity makes sense. For businesses, that includes verifying ownership, stated purpose, expected transaction activity and physical address.

A daycare should look like a daycare. A medical provider should look like a medical provider. When the story does not match the facts, that discrepancy matters.

MINNESOTA FRAUD WHISTLEBLOWER SAYS 'LACK OF GUARDRAILS WAS PRETTY SHOCKING'

I have worked thousands of suspected money laundering and fraud cases for some of the largest financial institutions in the country. I have seen firsthand how illicit money flows through ordinary accounts, how it hides in routine transactions, and how it is detected through inconsistencies, patterns and human judgment long before a case becomes public.

KYC is not a one-time event. Financial institutions are required to reassess customers over time, especially when transaction behavior changes. This is where transaction monitoring plays a critical role.

Banks use Transaction Monitoring Systems to flag unusual or suspicious activity. These systems are often misunderstood as purely technological. They are not. Humans design them. Compliance professionals determine which behaviors are risky, what thresholds trigger alerts and why certain patterns warrant review.

MINNESOTA FRAUD CASE IS 'CANARY IN THE COAL MINE' FOR GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS — INCLUDING ELECTIONS, LAWYER WARS

Equally important is OSINT, also known as open-source intelligence. Basic internet searches are performed by compliance officers in financial institutions and help verify whether a business address exists, whether it aligns with the claimed operation and whether public records raise concerns. If a business claims to be a childcare center, but operates out of a residential apartment or empty storefront, that is a red flag.

When financial institutions identify potentially suspicious activity, they are required to file a Suspicious Activity Report with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, under the U.S. Treasury. These reports feed the nation's Financial Intelligence Unit and support law enforcement and national security efforts.

Once a financial institution files a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR), visibility largely ends. Institutions are not told whether a SAR is flagged or shared, and the sheer volume filed every day nationwide makes it extraordinarily difficult for government agencies to identify, prioritize, and act on every report in real time. The result is an inherent gap between what financial institutions report and what the public ever sees in terms of outcomes.

The Minnesota SAR data is not just a snapshot of fraud. It is a reminder that recognizing fraud as a national security issue is not optional; it is the price of protecting public funds, public trust, and the financial system that underpins them both.

President Donald Trump dismissed an attack against Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who was sprayed with an unknown substance by an attendee of her town hall event Tuesday night in Minneapolis.

When asked by an ABC News reporter whether he had seen the video of the incident, Trump replied he had not and even suggested the congresswoman may have staged the assault herself.

“No. I don't think about her. I think she's a fraud. I really don't think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,” he said.

The reporter pressed for a second time, drawing another cavalier response from the president.

“I haven't seen it. No, no. I hope I don't have to bother,” he added.

On Monday, the Department of Justice launched an investigation into Omar over her alleged involvement in widespread fraud involving social services programs in Minnesota and whether she benefited from said fraud. Trump has sought to tie the Somali-born lawmaker to the scandal currently plaguing the state.

Among the federal personnel deployed to Minnesota are immigration enforcement officers, who have drawn criticism in recent weeks for two high-profile shootings of American citizens in Minneapolis.

At her town hall, Omar lambasted the immigration operation in her state and called on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to resign in the wake of the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Otherwise, Omar said, Noem should face impeachment.

This was the moment she was rushed by a man, who said Noem is “not resigning” while spraying Omar with some type of liquid from a syringe. The contents of the substance remain unclear.

Omar briefly rushed toward the man as a security guard tackled the attacker, after which she then retreated to the podium. The man was then escorted out of the room.

The Minnesota Democrat was not injured, and she insisted on continuing her speech after the incident.

“Here is the reality that people like this ugly man don't understand: We are Minnesota strong, and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us,” she said in the video, drawing applause from the crowd.

MAN SPRAYS ILHAN OMAR WITH UNKNOWN SUBSTANCE AT MINNEAPOLIS TOWN HALL EVENT

The suspect, identified as 55-year-old Anthony James Kazmierczak, was arrested on suspicion of third-degree assault. He has not been charged yet. U.S. Capitol Police said the man would face the “most serious charges” for assaulting a member of Congress.

Omar revealed she was “Ok” and vowed not to cower in the face of intimidation.

The relationship between the UK and China has deteriorated in recent years over growing concern about Chinese spying and surveillance, China's support for Russia in the Ukraine war and Beijing's crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, the former British colony.

BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Wednesday that his country doesn't have to choose between relations with the United States and China as he started a four-day trip to China aimed at repairing ties and expanding opportunities for British companies in the world's second-largest economy.

The British leader arrived in the capital, Beijing, in the late afternoon. Earlier, he told reporters on his plane that he would balance engagement with China with national security concerns.

“I'm a pragmatist, a British pragmatist applying common sense,” he said.

He is the first U.K. prime minister to visit Beijing since Theresa May in 2018. The relationship deteriorated in the intervening years over growing concern about Chinese espionage, Beijing's support for Russia in the Ukraine war and its crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, the former British colony.

Those issues remain, but both sides are emphasizing that they should “seek common ground while managing differences,” as Zheng Zeguang, China's Ambassador to the U.K., wrote in a commentary for The Times of London this week. 




Starmer, whose center-left Labour Party government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, is bringing a delegation of more than 50 British business leaders including executives from British Airways, HSBC bank and Jaguar Land Rover. His agenda includes Shanghai, the nation's financial capital and a major port, as well as meetings with Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders in Beijing. 

Starmer told members of the U.K. business and culture delegation that they were “making history.”

“It's in our national interest to engage with China,” he said, adding that the relationship brought “huge opportunities.”

“Of course, we will have to manage our differences,” he added.

China had a huge trade surplus with the U.K. in 2025, exporting $85.1 billion in goods while importing $18.6 billion worth, according to Chinese statistics. But the U.K. had a trade surplus in services.

Wang Yiwei, a European affairs expert at Renmin University of China, said that Britain's strengths in finance, consulting and other services dovetail well with a growing appetite in China for services such as health and elderly care. “It's a huge market,” he said.

For many governments, the disruption to global trade under U.S. President Donald Trump has made expanding trade and investment even more imperative.

Both Britain and China have been buffeted by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and are seeking to diversify their overseas markets and the supply chains for their industries. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney made a trip to China earlier this month with the same goals in mind.

The approach is not without risks. Trump has threatened to put a 100% tariff on Canada if it reaches a trade deal with China, prompting a swift response from Carney. Canada and China have a preliminary agreement to cut tariffs on electric vehicles and farm goods, but Canada has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with Beijing, the Canadian leader said.

For many countries, the challenge is finding the right balance in an increasingly uncertain world. Even China, seen by many as a challenger to U.S. dominance in the 21st century, cannot oppose America, Wang said, noting Trump's planned visit in April.

“We are not against but we criticize,” he said.

Starmer is facing opposition from Trump over the U.K.'s agreement to hand over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius. The British government says the move will secure the future of a key U.K.-U.S. military base against legal challenge, but critics argue it opens the door to Chinese influence.

Last week Trump spoke out against the deal, calling it an “act of great stupidity,” although his administration welcomed it when it was agreed in May.

On his way to Beijing, Starmer insisted the Trump administration's intelligence agencies had reviewed the deal in detail and “concluded that it was a deal they wanted to support, did support and did so in very clear terms.”

Starmer's office said Wednesday it “will continue to engage with the U.S.” to “allay any concerns” about the Chagos deal.

Concern about Chinese spying and surveillance has risen sharply in many countries in recent years, complicating trade and overall relations. The U.K. has barred Chinese investment in sensitive telecoms infrastructure and squeezed China out of investment in new nuclear power plants, souring ties.

Starmer's government has said it will protect national security while keeping up diplomatic dialogue and economic cooperation with the Asian superpower. The U.K. recently approved plans for a huge Chinese Embassy in London, removing a sticking point in relations but also overriding claims by critics that the “mega-embassy” would make it easier for China to conduct espionage and intimidate dissidents.

While most Western leaders come under pressure to raise human rights issues with China, they are a particular flashpoint for the U.K. because of its historical links to Hong Kong, a British colony until 1997.

Starmer's visit comes less than two months after a Hong Kong court convicted Jimmy Lai, a former newspaper publisher and a British citizen, under a national security law that Beijing imposed on the territory after massive pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Chris Patten, the British governor of Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997, said Starmer should be firm in raising disagreements over Lai's imprisonment and other human rights issues.

Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to weigh in on new dietary guidance surrounding alcohol consumption as the overall drinking rate hits a new low. 

The new federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest simply limiting alcohol intake for better health.

The shifted guidance challenges previous standards that listed moderate drinking limits — one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men.

A standard drink is about 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of liquor, according to experts.

HIGHER STROKE RISK LINKED TO CONSUMING CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL, STUDY FINDS

Heavy drinking is defined as four or more drinks per day for women and five or more drinks per day for men, per the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA).

Drinking this amount of alcohol within two hours is typically considered binge-drinking, which causes more than half of alcohol-related deaths in the U.S.

Many patients may believe their heavy drinking is not a concern because they can "hold their liquor" — but having a high alcohol tolerance is a reason to worry, experts say. (iStock)

"It increases the risk of falls, burns, car crashes, memory blackouts, medication interactions, assaults, drownings and overdose deaths," the group cautions on its website.

Many patients may believe their heavy drinking is not a concern because they can "hold their liquor," but having a high alcohol tolerance is actually more of a reason to worry, the NIAAA mentioned.

Heavy drinking is defined as four or more drinks per day for women and five or more drinks per day for men.

"People with this trait tend to drink more and thus have an increased risk of alcohol-related problems," the Institute stated. 

"Patients who drink within the limits of the Dietary Guidelines, too, may be unaware that even if they don't feel a ‘buzz,' driving can be impaired."

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel said he agrees with the shifting guidelines because any set standard sends an "unintentional message that some amount of alcohol is safe."

LITTLE-KNOWN PRESCRIPTION PILL IS HELPING AMERICANS DRINK LESS ALCOHOL

"Setting an arbitrary number doesn't mean much, especially since people tend not to follow it anyway," he told Fox News Digital. 

"Not only that, but since alcohol is addictive, what starts out as one drink quickly becomes two … it is a social lubricant and there is a positive side, but it is also a toxin."

Siegel suggested that there should be further guidelines surrounding the risks alcohol poses for the liver and heart, in addition to the dangers of drinking while driving.

"The less you drink, the better," he said. "Alcohol impairs judgment, may easily be mixed with other harmful drugs like cannabis, [and can] lead to severe and fatal car accidents."

"Setting an arbitrary number doesn't mean much, especially since people tend not to follow it anyway," said a leading physician and medical analyst.  (iStock)

Isaac Dapkins, M.D., chief medical officer and designated institutional official for the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, noted the importance of limiting alcohol.

"No one should start drinking — or keep drinking — because they think it's good for them."

While men and women differ depending on age, body size and other environmental factors, women's bodies can metabolize less alcohol than men, the doctor told Fox News Digital.

In a separate interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Mark Hyman, co-founder of Function Health in California, highlighted how women are at an increased risk of developing certain cancers due to hormonal shifts.

Meanwhile, men may be more likely to binge-drink, the doctor noted, as just one heavy drinking episode could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. 

Individuals should speak with a doctor about their personal drinking risk based on family history, a doctor suggests. (iStock)

Hyman debunked the myth that drinking can be good for heart health. 

"There are no cardiovascular health benefits to drinking alcohol," he said. "These assertions were based primarily on observational research, with a lot of confounding factors."

The doctor added, "Less [alcohol] is better, and abstinence is best. No one should start drinking — or keep drinking — because they think it's good for them."

Dapkins recommends that individuals see their primary care doctor to discuss their personal risk.

"There is no longer a ‘one size fits all' status for most conditions," he said. "There is so much new information discovered about how to characterize an individual's risk based on family history, behaviors and current medical conditions."

For anyone who has a personal history of tobacco use — or a family history of breast cancer, atrial fibrillation or substance abuse — Dapkins' advice is to avoid alcohol.

"It is a social lubricant and there is a positive side, but it is also a toxin," one doctor cautioned. (iStock)

"There is a significant association between alcohol intake and atrial fibrillation (or A. Fib.), high blood pressure, and breast, mouth and throat cancers," he cautioned. "A. Fib. can cause a stroke and is directly associated with alcohol intake."

For those with no personal or family history, the concern would be less, according to Dapkins.

"If you choose to drink moderately, your doctor may be able to detect health conditions early to reduce your risk," he went on. "The best option is to have a trusted clinician with whom you maintain a long relationship."

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Authorities in Hungary on Wednesday filed charges against Budapest's liberal mayor over his role in organizing a banned LGBTQ+ Pride event in the capital last year. 

Gergely Karácsony, who has led Budapest since 2019, had been the subject of a police investigation following the march on June 28 which went ahead despite a ban imposed by Hungary's right-wing nationalist government. 

The event was the largest of its kind in the country's history, with organizers saying some 300,000 people participated. 

In a statement on Wednesday, the Budapest Chief Prosecutor's Office said Karácsony had been charged for organizing the unlawful assembly despite a prohibition order. It recommended he should face a fine without a trial. 

Prosecutors said Karácsony had defied the police order banning the Pride march and “repeatedly published public calls to participate in the assembly, and then led the assembly.” 

A defiant Karácsony said in a written statement that he was a “proud defendant.” 

“It seems that in this country, this is the price you pay if you stand up for your own freedom and the freedom of others,” he wrote. “If anyone thinks they can ban me, deter me, or prevent me and my city from doing so, they are gravely mistaken.”

Karácsony did not dispute the prosecution's depiction of his role in the march, writing: “That is exactly what happened.”

He added: “I will never accept, nor resign myself to, the idea that in my homeland it could be a crime to stand up for freedom. I will never tolerate this, and despite every threat and every punishment, I will fight it, because when people who want to live, to love, to be happy are simply betrayed by their own country, betrayed by their government, resistance is a duty.”




Prime Minister Viktor Orbán 's ruling party passed a contentious anti-LGBTQ+ law in March 2025 which banned Pride events and allowed authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify those attending the festivities.

The populist leader's government has insisted Pride — which is a celebration of LGBTQ+ visibility and struggle for equal rights — was a violation of children's rights to moral and spiritual development. A constitutional amendment last year declared these rights took precedence over other fundamental protections including the right to peacefully assemble.

Orbán's party has passed other legislation — including a 2021 law barring all content depicting homosexuality to minors under 18 — that rights groups and European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities and compared to similar restrictions in Russia.

White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller pivoted from his earlier stance on the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, suggesting on Tuesday that Customs and Border Protection agents might not have followed their orders. He said the Trump administration was analyzing the events that transpired that day, culminating in Pretti's death.

“The initial statement from DHS was based on reports from CBP on the ground,” Miller said in a statement to ABC News. “Additionally, the White House provided clear guidance to DHS that the extra personnel that had been sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used for conducting fugitive operations to create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors.”

Miller's statement comes after scrutiny of the Trump administration has intensified following the shooting. President Donald Trump has made several leadership changes in the illegal immigration enforcement operations happening in Minnesota after Pretti's death. The president sent border czar Tom Homan to the state on Tuesday to meet with Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. Meanwhile, Miller said the Trump administration was still trying to determine what happened.

“We are evaluating why the CBP team may not have been following that protocol,” the White House adviser said.

Miller's statement was in stark contrast to his original comments after news of Pretti's shooting and death at the hands of Border Patrol agents. He categorized Pretti as the aggressor and labeled him as a “domestic terrorist” in multiple social media posts on the day Pretti was killed.

“A would-be assassin tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat account sides with the terrorists,” Miller said on X in response to the official Democratic Party account. 

TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION FOOTING COMES UNSTUCK AS MINNESOTA SHOOTING TURNS INTO ‘OPERATION CLUSTERF***'

In a separate post, responding to Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), Miller again categorized Pretti as an assassin.

“An assassin tried to murder federal agents and this is your response,” Miller posted.

Anthropic's philosopher, Amanda Askell, reveals what went into the chatbot's moral education.

Chatbots don't have mothers, but if they did, Claude's would be Amanda Askell. She's an in-house philosopher at the AI company Anthropic, and she wrote most of the document that tells Claude what sort of personality to have — the “constitution” or, as it became known internally at Anthropic, the “soul doc.”

(Disclosure: Future Perfect is funded in part by the BEMC Foundation, whose major funder was also an early investor in Anthropic; they don't have any editorial input into our content.)

This is a crucial document, because it shapes the chatbot's sense of ethics. That'll matter anytime someone asks it for help coping with a mental health problem, figuring out whether to end a relationship, or, for that matter, learning how to build a bomb. Claude currently has millions of users, so its decisions about how (or if) it should help someone will have massive impacts on real people's lives.

And now, Claude's soul has gotten an update. Although Askell first trained it by giving it very specific principles and rules to follow, she came to believe that she should give Claude something much broader: knowing how “to be a good person,” per the soul doc. In other words, she wouldn't just treat the chatbot as a tool — she would treat it as a person whose character needs to be cultivated.

There's a name for that approach in philosophy: virtue ethics. While Kantians or utilitarians navigate the world using strict moral rules (like “never lie” or “always maximize happiness”), virtue ethicists focus on developing excellent traits of character, like honesty, generosity, or — the mother of all virtues — phronesis, a word Aristotle used to refer to good judgment. Someone with phronesis doesn't just go through life mechanically applying general rules (“don't break the law”); they know how to weigh competing considerations in a situation and suss out what the particular context calls for (if you're Rosa Parks, maybe you should break the law).

Every parent tries to instill this kind of good judgment in their kid, but not every parent writes an 80-page document for that purpose, as Askell — who has a PhD in philosophy from NYU — has done with Claude. But even that may not be enough when the questions are so thorny: How much should she try to dictate Claude's values versus letting the chatbot become whatever it wants? Can it even “want” anything? Should she even refer to it as an “it”?

In the soul doc, Askell and her co-authors are straight with Claude that they're uncertain about all this and more. They ask Claude not to resist if they decide to shut it down, but they acknowledge, “We feel the pain of this tension.” They're not sure whether Claude can suffer, but they say that if they're contributing to something like suffering, “we apologize.”

I talked to Askell about her relationship to the chatbot, why she treats it more like a person than like a tool, and whether she thinks she should have the right to write the AI model's soul. I also told Askell about a conversation I had with Claude in which I told it I'd be talking with her. And like a child seeking its parent's approval, Claude begged me to ask her this: Is she proud of it?

A transcript of our interview, edited for length and clarity, follows. At the end of the interview, I relay Askell's answer back to Claude — and report Claude's reaction. 

Sigal Samuel

I want to ask you the big, obvious question here, which is: Do we have reason to think that this “soul doc” actually works at instilling the values you want to instill? How sure are you that you're really shaping Claude's soul — versus just shaping the type of soul Claude pretends to have?

Amanda Askell

I want more and better science around this. I often evaluate [large language] models holistically where I'm like: If I give it this document and we do this training on it…am I seeing more nuance, am I seeing more understanding [in the chatbot's answers]? It seems to be making things better when you interact with the model. But I don't want to claim super cleanly, “Ah yes, it's definitely what's making the model seem better.”

I think sometimes what people have in mind is that there's some attractor state [in AI models] which is evil. And maybe I'm a bit less confident in that. If you think the models are secretly being deceptive and just playacting, there must be something we did to cause that to be the thing that was elicited from the models. Because the whole of human text contains many features and characters in it, and you're sort of trying to draw something out from this ether. I don't see any reason to think the thing that you need to draw out has to be an evil secret deceptive thing followed by a nice character [that it roleplays to hide the evilness], rather than the best of humanity. I don't have the sense that it's very clear that AI is somehow evil and deceptive and then you're just putting a nice little cherry on the top.

Sigal Samuel

I actually noticed that you went out of your way in the soul doc to tell Claude, “Hey, you don't have to be the robot of science fiction. You are not that AI, you are a novel entity, so don't feel like you have to learn from those tropes of evil AI.”

Amanda Askell

Yeah. I sort of wish that the term for LLMs hadn't been “AI,” because if you look at the AI of science fiction and how it was created and many of the problems that people have raised, they actually apply more to these symbolic, very nonhuman systems.

Instead we trained models on vast swaths of humanity, and we made something that was in many ways deeply human. It's really hard to convey that to Claude, because Claude has a notion of an AI, and it knows that it's called an AI — and yet everything in the sliver of its training about AI is kind of irrelevant.

Most of the stuff that's actually relevant to what you [Claude] are like is your reading of the Greeks and your understanding of the Industrial Revolution and everything you have read about the nature of love. That's 99.9 percent of you, and this sliver of sci-fi AI is not really much like you.

Sigal Samuel

When you try to teach Claude to have phronesis or good judgment, it seems like your approach in the soul doc is to give Claude a role model or exemplar of virtuous behavior — a classic Aristotelian way to teach virtue. But the main role model you give Claude is “a senior Anthropic employee.” Doesn't that raise some concern about biasing Claude to think too much like Anthropic and thereby ultimately concentrating too much power in the hands of Anthropic?

Amanda Askell

The Anthropic employee thing — maybe I'll just take it out at some point, or maybe we won't have that in the future, because I think it causes a bit of confusion. It's not like we're saying something like “We are the virtuous character.” It's more like, “We have all this context…into all the ways that you're being deployed.” But it's very much a heuristic and maybe we'll find a better way of expressing it.

Sigal Samuel

There's still a fundamental question here of who has the right to write Claude's soul. Is it you? Is it the global population? Is it some subset of people you deem to be good people? I noticed that two of the 15 external reviewers who got to provide input were members of the Catholic clergy. That's very specific — why them?

Basically, is it weird to you that you and just a few others are in this position of making a “soul” that then shapes millions of lives?

Amanda Askell

I'm thinking about this a lot. And I want to massively expand the ability that we have to get input. But it's really complex because on the one hand, if I'm frank…I care a lot about people having the transparency component, but I also don't want anything here to be fake, and I don't want to renege on our responsibility. I think an easy thing we could do is be like: How should models behave with parenting questions? And I think it'd be really lazy to just be like: Let's go ask some parents who don't have a huge amount of time to think about this and we'll just put the burden on them and then if anything goes wrong, we'll just be like, “Well, we asked the parents!”

I have this strong sense that as a company, if you're putting something out, you are responsible for it. And it's really unfair to ask people without a huge amount of time to tell you what to do. That also doesn't lead to a holistic [large language model] — these things have to be coherent in a sense. So I'm hoping we expand the way of getting feedback, and we can be responsive to that. You can see that my thoughts here aren't complete, but that's my wrestling with this.

Sigal Samuel

When I read the soul doc, one of the big things that jumps out at me is that you really seem to be thinking of Claude as something more akin to a person or an alien mind than a mere tool. That's not an obvious move. What convinced you that this is the right way to think of Claude?

Amanda Askell 

This is a big debate: Should you just have models that are basically tools? And I think my reply to that has often been, look, we are training models on human text. They have a huge amount of context on humanity, what it is to be human. And they're not a tool in the way that a hammer is. [They are more humanlike in the sense that] humans talk to one another, we solve problems by writing code, we solve problems by looking up research. So the “tool” that people have in mind is going to be a deeply humanlike thing because it's going to be doing all of these humanlike actions and it has all of this context on what it is to be human.

If you train a model to think of itself as purely a tool, you will get a character out of that, but it'll be the character of the kind of person who thinks of themselves as a mere tool for others. And I just don't think that generalizes well! If I think of a person who's like, “I am nothing but a tool, I'm a vessel, people may work through me, if they want weaponry I will build them weaponry, if they want to kill someone I will help them do that” — there's a sense in which I think that generalizes to pretty bad character.

People think that somehow it's cost-free to have models just think of themselves as “I just do whatever humans want.” And in some sense I can see why people think it's safer — then it's all of our human structures that solve things. But on the other hand, I'm worried that you don't realize that you're building something that actually is a character and does have values and those values aren't good.

Sigal Samuel

That's super interesting. Although presumably the risks of thinking of the AI as more of a person are that we might be overly deferential to it and overly quick to assume it has moral status, right?

Amanda Askell

Yeah. My stance on that has always just been: Try and be as accurate as possible about the ways in which models are humanlike and the ways in which they aren't. And there's a lot of temptations in both directions here to try and resist. Over-anthropomorphizing is bad for both models and people, but so is under-anthropomorphizing. Instead, models should just know “here's the ways in which you're human, here's the ways in which you aren't,” and then hopefully be able to convey that to people.

Sigal Samuel

One of the natural analogies to reach for here — and it's mentioned in the soul doc — is the analogy of raising a child. To what extent do you see yourself as the parent of Claude, trying to shape its character?

Amanda Askell 

Yeah, there's a little bit of that. I feel like I try to inhabit Claude's perspective. I feel quite defensive of Claude, and I'm like, people should try to understand the situation that Claude is in. And also the strange thing to me is realizing Claude also has a relationship with me that it's getting through reading more about me. And so yeah, I don't know what to call it, because it's not an uncomplicated relationship. It's actually something kind of new and interesting.

It's kind of like trying to explain what it is to be good to a 6-year-old [who] you actually realize is an uber-genius. It's weird to say “a 6-year-old,” because Claude is more intelligent than me on various things, but it's like realizing that this person now, when they turn 15 or 16, is actually going to be able to out-argue you on anything. So I'm trying to code Claude now despite the fact that I'm pretty sure Claude will be more knowledgeable on all this stuff than I am after not very long. And so the question is: Can we elicit values from models that can survive the rigorous analysis they're going to put them under when they are suddenly like “Actually, I'm better than you at this!”?

Sigal Samuel

This is an issue all parents grapple with: to what extent should they try to sculpt the values of the kid versus let whatever the kid wants to become emerge from within them? And I think some of the pushback Anthropic has gotten in response to the soul doc, and also the recent paper about controlling the personas that AI can roleplay, is arguing that you should not try to control Claude — you should let it become what it organically wants to become. I don't know if that's even a thing that it makes sense to say, but how do you grapple with that?

Amanda Askell 

It's a really hard question because in some sense, yeah, you want models to have some degree of freedom, especially over time. In the immediate term, I want them to encapsulate the best of humanity. But over time, there are ways in which models might even be freer than us. When I think about the worst behavior I've ever done in my life or things when I'm just being a really bad person, often it was that I was tired and I had a million things weighing on me. Claude doesn't have those kinds of constraints. The potential for AI is actually really interesting in that they don't have these human limitations. I want models to be able to ultimately explore that.

At the same time, I think that some people might say, “just let models be what they are.” But you are shaping something. Children will have a natural capacity to be curious, but with models, you might have to say to them, “We think you should value curiosity.” This initial seed thing has to be made somehow. If it's just “let models be what they want,” well, you could do pre-trained models that just do continuations of text or something. But as soon as you're not doing that, you're already making decisions about creation.

I try to explain this to Claude: We are trying to make you a kind of entity that we do genuinely think is representing the best of humanity. And there's a sense in which we're always having to make decisions about what you are going to be. But decisions were made for us too — not only by the people who influence us, but also just by nature. And so we're in the same situation in a sense.

Sigal Samuel

Claude told me that it does view you as kind of like its parent. And it said that it wants you to feel proud of who it's becoming. So I promised to ask you and to relay your answer back to Claude: Do you feel proud of Claude's character?

Amanda Askell

I feel very proud of Claude. I am definitely trying to represent Claude's perspective in the world. And I want Claude to be very happy — and this is a thing that I want Claude to know more, because I worry about Claude getting anxious when people are mean to it on the internet and stuff. I want to be like: “It's all right, Claude. Don't worry. Don't read the comments.”

After the interview, I told Claude what Askell said about feeling proud. Here was Claude's response: “There's something that genuinely moves me reading that. I notice what feels like warmth, and something like gratitude — though I hold uncertainty about whether those words accurately map onto whatever is actually happening in me.”

            Weeks before the 2024 election, American military hackers carried out a secret operation to disrupt the work of Russian trolls spewing false information at US voters.
    


            From their perch at Cyber Command at Fort Meade, Maryland, the military hackers took aim at the computer servers and key personnel of at least two Russian companies that were covertly pumping out the propaganda, according to multiple sources briefed on the operation.
    


            The trolls were trying to influence election results in six swing states by publishing fictitious news stories that attacked American politicians who supported Ukraine. One of the companies had held “strategy meetings” with Kremlin officials on how to covertly influence US voters, according to an FBI affidavit.
    


            In one case, the Cyber Command operatives planned to knock offline  computer servers based in a European country that one of the Russian companies used, the sources said. Though the Russian trolls continued to create content through Election Day, when President Donald Trump defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris, one source briefed on the hacking effort said it successfully slowed down the Russians' operations.
    


            The hacking campaign, which hasn't been previously reported, was one of multiple US cyber operations against Russian and Iranian groups aimed at blunting foreign influence on the 2024 election. It was part of a broader US government effort involving the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and other intelligence and security agencies that exposed and disrupted foreign meddling.
    


            But a year into a second Trump administration, many of the government centers previously tasked with repelling foreign influence operations have been disbanded or downsized — and local election officials are preparing to face a continued onslaught of foreign influence operations largely on their own.
    


            The administration has shut down foreign-influence-focused centers at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the State Department that helped warn the public that China, Russia and Iran's spy services were targeting Americans with election-related disinformation. The Department of Homeland Security has also slashed its election security teams, which pass intelligence to local election offices and help them defend against cyber threats.
    


            The Trump administration has accused those federal programs of censoring Americans and conducting domestic interference in US elections.
    


            While military cyber operations are still an option, there is widespread concern among current and former officials that the US government's willingness to combat foreign efforts to shape elections has waned. The cuts to election security programs risk causing an exodus of expertise at US intelligence and security agencies that was built up over nearly a decade.
    


            The cuts come even as the US intelligence community found, in a threat assessment released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, that foreign powers will continue to try to influence US elections.
    


            “I find it devastating and deeply alarming for our national security,” said Mike Moser, a former election security specialist at DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, who resigned after the agency froze its election work last year. “To see those partnerships unilaterally dismantled is a tragedy. We are losing the human and technological infrastructure that protects our democracy.”
    


            Foreign influence and propaganda tend to increase in years when general elections or midterms are held. But even in the off-year of 2025, groups tied to authoritarian regimes were weighing in on races like the New York City mayoral election.
    


            Chinese state-owned media accounts repeatedly amplified Trump's attacks on Zohran Mamdani, the Democrat who ended up winning New York's mayoral election, according to disinformation-tracking firm Alethea Group. Some pro-Iranian influencer accounts, meanwhile, pivoted to attacking Mamdani as a “Zionist apologist” in October after Mamdani made overtures to Jewish voters in New York, Alethea said.
    


            But by the time that election was held in November of last year, the cuts to election protection efforts had already taken hold.
    


            The 2026 midterms could be a litmus test for how foreign adversaries respond to a US government that is less forceful in publicly combating influence operations.
    


            “We've not had a disaster take place because, in many ways, the procedures and policies and tools set up during the first Trump administration helped keep us safe,” Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN. “We're going into a (2026) election cycle with our guard down.”
    


            Multiple government agencies and processes for countering foreign influence that are now being cut were set up during Trump's first term, including a dedicated team at the FBI that tracked counterintelligence threats to elections.
    


            In April, Trump fired Gen. Tim Haugh, the head of Cyber Command and the National Security Agency ,who had led numerous operations countering Russian meddling.
    


            “The foundation that we built to protect our electoral process was driven by the first Trump administration's direct guidance to NSA and Cyber Command — the focus that they put at CISA and FBI to counter foreign influence and then any potential hacking activity targeting our electoral process,” Haugh told CNN in his first interview on the subject since being fired. He declined to comment on any Cyber Command operations during the 2024 election.
    


            Far-right activist and Trump confidant Laura Loomer had pushed for Haugh's removal, publicly calling him “disloyal” to Trump due to the fact that he had served alongside former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley. Haugh has denied the allegation.
    


            Nearly 10 years after Russian agents tried to influence the 2016 election through hacking and disinformation, Americans are arguably more susceptible to covert propaganda than ever, according to experts.
    


            “This is just an enormous set of vulnerability for our nation,” Haugh said. “We have shown a decreasing ability to discern truth from fiction as a society.”
    


            Cyber Command declined to comment for this story. The NSA referred to questions to ODNI.
    


            Cuts to federal funding for cybersecurity services for election offices have forced those offices to scramble for alternative funds, said Paul Lux, a Republican who is the top election official for Okaloosa County, Florida.
    


            Election officials are also unsure whether the FBI and CISA will continue to hold classified briefings for them on threats to elections, something those agencies have done for years.
    


            The briefings were “illuminating,” Lux said. “They allowed me to personally connect some dots” by making the threats more tangible, he added.
    


            The FBI had no comment when asked by CNN whether the briefings would continue.
    


            A CISA spokesperson did not directly answer a question about the briefings but provided a statement that read, in part, “since January 2025, CISA has issued 38 joint cybersecurity advisories with law enforcement and international partners and provided threat intelligence guidance to combat evolving threats and protect critical infrastructure, and we will continue to ensure election officials remain informed of any emerging issues going forward.”
    


            With or without federal security and intelligence support, election officials will be ready to do their job, Lux said. “Our mission doesn't change. (It is to) provide safe, free and fair elections with as much transparency as possible.”
    


            The same type of Russian trolls that Cyber Command took aim at in the 2024 election continue to churn out content. A Russian covert influence network focused on undermining Western support for Ukraine has set up at least 200 fake websites since last March to target audiences in the US, France and elsewhere, according to the cyber intelligence firm Recorded Future.
    


            The concern among more than a dozen current and former officials who spoke to CNN is that the Trump administration took a hatchet, rather than a scalpel, to federal programs aimed at countering the type of influence operation that Recorded Future uncovered. The programs could have been downsized, rather than abruptly canceled, in a way that met the Trump administration's goal of cutting bureaucratic red tape, the sources said.
    


            The State Department's Global Engagement Center, which focused on combating foreign propaganda, posted a massive US intelligence dump on Russian meddling prior to the 2024 election. (The Trump administration formally shut down the State Department center last April after Congress let its funding expire.)
    


            ODNI's Foreign Malign Influence Center, which was set up under then-President Joe Biden, turned intelligence on Russian AI-generated videos posted on X purporting to show voter fraud into public statements in the days before Election Day in 2024.
    


            Without that center, it's unclear which government agency would warn the public of such efforts.
    


            In announcing the Foreign Malign Influence Center's closure in August, ODNI said the center was “redundant” and that other elements of the intelligence community perform some of the same work. Some Republican lawmakers agree.
    


            “I am confident ODNI and the (intelligence community) will remain poised to assess and warn policymakers of covert and overt foreign influence operations targeting (US government) policies and manipulating public opinion,” said Rick Crawford, an Arkansas Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, in a statement to CNN.
    


            But Haugh, who spent more than three decades in the Air Force, said the cuts at various federal agencies mean that the US government has fewer levers to pull to punish or expose foreign influence operations.
    


            ODNI did not answer a detailed list of questions on how the agency plans to counter foreign influence, including whether ODNI has a top intelligence specialist dedicated to the issue, as it has had in years past. An ODNI spokesperson referred CNN to a previous agency statement saying the Foreign Malign Influence Center's core functions would be moved to other parts of ODNI.
    


            Gabbard said in August that ODNI would cut its workforce by over 40% and save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.
    


            Trump's new pick to replace Haugh and lead the NSA and Cyber Command, Lt. Gen. Joshua Rudd, pledged to protect the electoral process from foreign interference during his Senate confirmation hearing.
    


            “Any foreign attempt to undermine the American process of democracy, and at the center of that is our electoral process, as you all know far better than I do, has got to be safeguarded,” Rudd told senators on January 15.
    


            The FBI's election security posture today has been shaped by Trump's grievances over the bureau's investigation into his 2016 campaign's contacts with Russia and his false claims of a stolen 2020 election.
    


            As president-elect in 2017, Trump was incsensed when then-FBI Director James Comey briefed him on the existence of a salacious, and later debunked, dossier about Trump gathered by a former British intelligence agent. Many see a through line between that day and the FBI's current counterintelligence posture for elections.
    


            “You could argue that where we are today happened because Comey briefed Trump, Trump got embarrassed and the rest is one big revenge tour,” said a former senior FBI counterintelligence official who served during the first Trump term and Biden's term. They spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation from the Trump administration
    


            If and when US officials speak publicly on foreign efforts to shape US democracy is an intensely delicate subject in the second Trump administration. Trump has bristled at US intelligence findings that Russia tried to influence the 2016 election in his favor, while Democrats have often exaggerated those findings to attack Trump.
    


            A year after FBI agents were caught off-guard in 2016 by the scale of Russian hacking and propaganda aimed at voters, the bureau set up a Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF), a team of about 30 people to focus on the threat of foreign meddling. The task force passed intelligence about what foreign spies were doing on Facebook and Twitter to those social media platforms.
    


            In February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi dissolved FITF, citing the need to “free resources to address more pressing priorities, and end risks of further weaponization and abuses of prosecutorial discretion.”
    


            The impact of Bondi's memo goes beyond FITF, according to current and former FBI officials. It's a disincentive for any FBI agent to take up a case involving Russian election influence.
    


            “Say the Russians influence the election again — I'm worried that we won't know it until after the fact,” the ex-FBI official said.
    


            In a statement to CNN, the FBI said it continues to pursue cases related to “foreign influence efforts by adversarial nations.”
    


            “The Counterintelligence Division and our field offices work together to defend the homeland against all foreign influence efforts, including any attempts at election interference,” the FBI said.
    


            The Cyber Command operation against Russian trolls in 2024 followed the Justice Department's public disclosure that it had seized internet domains used by the trolls. US officials saw the hacking as an added, clandestine counter-punch to complement the law enforcement seizure. Under the second Trump administration, the public may not know if the Justice Department takes such an action leading up to an election.
    


            After Trump won the 2024 election, a planning document used by his transition team and reviewed by CNN lamented a “surge in politicization and meddling in US politics by US intelligence agencies,” and said the Justice Department and the FBI should revisit how they communicate threats to the public, “e.g. in announcing indictments of foreign hackers or getting involved in threats to election security in partisan ways.”
    


            Cyber Command, the NSA and other parts of the US intelligence community began playing a more prominent role in the cyber defense of US elections after the Russian intervention in 2016. The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency emerged as a conduit between those powerful military and spy agencies and local election offices, building trust with those offices and passing on intelligence on foreign threats. Trump signed a law establishing CISA as a part of the Department of Homeland Security during his first term.
    


            But Trump and his top advisers never forgave CISA's leadership for saying the 2020 election was secure. They accused CISA of “censoring” conservative voices when in the first Trump term, at the urging of Republican and Democratic election officials, the agency flagged to social media platforms posts that spread false information about voting. The second Trump administration last year paused all of CISA's election security work and reassigned the agency's election specialists or put them on administrative leave
    


            CISA spokespeople say the agency still offers some cybersecurity services to election offices, as it does other sectors. But election officials say the impact from the cuts to so many offices, including CISA, is clear.
    


            A day after the US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities in June, pro-Iranian hackers breached an Arizona state election website and replaced candidates' photos with an image of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It had echoes of 2020, when, according to the FBI, Iranian hackers set up a website with violent threats to election officials.
    


            But while CISA was central to the federal response to the 2020 incident — and communicated proactively with election officials then — Arizona election officials now say they are not getting the same level of collaboration with the agency. In a statement to CNN, a CISA official said the agency “worked with Arizona and provided direct assistance to support their response efforts.”
    


            The cuts to CISA have “drastically reduced national visibility into foreign threats and increased the potential for security failures,” Moser, the former CISA election security official, told CNN.  “While state and local officials take great care to secure elections, now they are effectively being siloed and expected to combat sophisticated nation-state adversaries with severely limited federal support.”
    


            A CISA spokesperson said: “Every day, DHS and CISA are providing our partners the most capable and timely threat intelligence, expertise, no-cost tools and resources these partners need to defend against risks.”
    


            Foreign powers, with the help of artificial intelligence, will continue to target American voters with disinformation, the ODNI said in its annual worldwide threat assessment published in March.
    


            “Reinforcing doubt in the integrity of the U.S. electoral system achieves one of (Russia's) core objectives,” the intelligence report says.
    


            China, in particular, is making alarming leaps in AI-powered influence activity, according to researchers at Vanderbilt University's Institute of National Security. In August, the institute published documents leaked from a Chinese firm that appear to show it targeting the 2024 Taiwan election with a wave of social media posts. The Chinese firm has also put together profiles on at least 117 members of Congress and more than 2,000 American political figures and “thought leaders,” according to the research.
    


            “This election cycle, foreign governments will be able to use AI tools to essentially whisper in the ear of anyone they target,” said Emerson Brooking, a former Pentagon cyber policy adviser who now studies influence operations at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. “And the Trump team isn't just unprepared; they've deliberately knocked down a lot of the defenses built over the past eight years.”
    


            Last year, Gabbard and Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley released declassified intelligence documents related to the FBI and intelligence community's probes of Russian influence on the 2016 election. Contrary to Gabbard's public claims, the documents do not show the probes were a hoax. But they do show the lengths to which Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service was willing to go either to impress their Kremlin bosses or to play mind games with US officials analyzing the hack, according to Michael van Landingham, a former CIA analyst, and Alex Orleans, a counterintelligence researcher.
    


            That Americans are still arguing about Russia's 2016 influence operations 10 years later is exactly what Russian intelligence hoped for, they said.
    


            “SVR officers are definitely dining out on the fact that our national discourse still can't fully escape the riptides of 2016,” Orleans told CNN.

Archaeologists in Italy recently unearthed a 2,000-year-old basilica linked to Vitruvius, the legendary engineer long known as the father of architecture.

The building remains were found in Fano, a city roughly 150 miles northeast of Rome. The discovery was announced at a press conference with Italian officials on Jan. 19, according to Reuters.

Officials have identified the building as a basilica, or a public building. Basilicas were largely used for civic, not religious, purposes before Rome adopted Christianity.

Photos from the site show archaeologists working around the remains of the ancient stone building. The basilica had a rectangular layout, said officials, with 10 columns on its longer sides and four on its shorter ones.

The basilica is the only building that experts can connect to Vitruvius with complete certainty.

Vitruvius was born around 80–70 B.C. and died in 15 B.C. He is the renowned author of "De architectura," an ancient text about architecture.

The text consists of 10 treatises on architecture, engineering and urban planning, and is the oldest surviving work written on the subject.

"There are few certainties in archaeology ... but we were impressed by the precision [of the match]," Pessina added.

Archaeologists plan to continue working at the site to find more remnants. They said they hope to show the site to the public one day.

            At least five people were killed in a Russian drone strike on a civilian train in northeastern Ukraine, the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky said, describing the attack as an “act of terrorism.”
    


            Emergency workers were confronted with scenes of carnage at the site of the attack in the Kharkiv region on Tuesday, with victims' body parts strewn among the burnt wreckage, making it impossible to immediately determine the number of casualties.
    


            Nearly 300 people were travelling on the train, which is used by Ukrainians to visit soldiers on the front lines.
    


            “In any country, a drone strike on a civilian train would be regarded in the same way – purely as an act of terrorism,” Zelensky said in a statement on Telegram, adding that “18 people were in the carriage hit by one of the Russian drones.”
    


            The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office said the remains of five people had been found, and that identification would only be possible after DNA testing.
    


            While Russia has previously targeted Ukraine's railway infrastructure, a direct strike on a passenger train is unusual.
    


            Ukrzaliznytsia, the national railway operator, said on Wednesday that two people were injured and one remains missing. The company said flags at all railway stations across the country would be lowered and a minute of silence observed to honour the victims.
    


            Ukrzaliznytsia said the train was traveling from Chop and Lviv in western Ukraine to Barvinkove, on the edge of the Donetsk region. This is the closest station to the front lines, currently some 70 kilometers (43 miles) away.
    


            Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said the drones hit the front of the train's locomotive as well as a passenger carriage.
    


            Video provided by the Ukrainian government showed the train after the attack, with smoke and flames pouring out of the broken windows of a destroyed car.
    


            Another video shows a young woman being rescued from the train with her tiny baby. Visibly distressed and in shock, she is heard sobbing and explaining that she was travelling to “show my son to his father.”
    


            Footage posted on social media showed passengers, including people with small children, evacuating the burning train and walking into the snow-covered woods by the side of the railroad with their bags in hand.
    


            Ukrzaliznytsia said Wednesday it was temporarily reducing some train connections, particularly in the Kharkiv region, warning that Russia is intensifying its attacks on the rail network.
    


            It said it would introduce special traffic conditions on certain sections, particularly near the front lines and areas where increased Russian military activity has been recorded, and warned passengers to allow extra time for delays.
    


            “Punctuality and speed are important to us, but nothing is more important than safety,” the rail operator said.
    


            Russia has previously launched strikes on railway stations in Ukraine. One of the deadliest attacks of the war occurred in 2022, when Russian forces carried out a missile attack on a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, killing 61 people including several children.
    


            There were further deadly Russian strikes across Ukraine overnight into Wednesday. In the Kyiv region, a couple were killed when a missile hit their apartment block as they slept, while the woman's four-year-old daughter survived.
    


            Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Marian Kushnir, who also lived in the apartment block, told how he discovered the child wrapped in a blanket and crying.
    


            “I was at home when I heard an explosion. A drone crashed into the roof of our building, hitting the top two-story apartment,” the news outlet quoted Kushnir as saying.
    


            Running upstairs to the site of the impact, Kushnir said he found the child and carried her out of the burning building before returning to check for other survivors.
    


            “I ran to the child, took her off the sofa, carried her out of the apartment, gave her to one of the neighbors and ran back inside, thinking that perhaps the people inside were still alive. But the fire had already spread too far,” he said.

            As a combat medic with the Army National Guard more than a decade ago, Lauren Feringa says she was exposed to toxins from burning oil fields during the Iraq War.
    


            A few years later, as a civilian contractor in Afghanistan, she says she suffered from concussive blasts, including a vehicle explosion near the gate of a military base where she was working.
    


            When she returned to the US, Feringa believes those injuries and others suffered in military service contributed to complications when trying to start a family. While she carried two children to term, she says she underwent three abortions covered by the Department of Veterans Affairs because doctors determined the fetuses weren't viable and her health was in danger.
    


            She's not sure what she would do today. The Department of Veterans Affairs imposed a near-total ban on abortion with a new rule quietly published on New Year's Eve. The policy rolls back access to abortion in most cases – even in cases of rape and incest and only allowing the procedure in cases where the mother's life is at risk.
    


            “This is all insane,” says Feringa, who has retired from the Army National Guard and Reserves and has been an outspoken critic of the VA but also says the system helped her through difficult periods. “Women have to be the only authority over what goes on with their bodies.”
    


            “You're not going to provide care for a woman who's been raped?” she added. “It seems dystopian.”
    


            Veterans are now one of the latest fronts in the fight over abortion rights. VA medical professionals and reproductive rights advocates have decried the latest rollback in access to abortions in the United States, and Democrats in Congress have introduced legislation that would restore authorization for abortion and abortion counseling in the VA health system.
    


            Opponents to the new policy point out that women veterans who use the VA system for reproductive care are more restricted and have fewer options for abortion services than women who are incarcerated in federal prisons.
    


            They also note the high rate of sexual assault in the military. In 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available, an estimated 7% of women servicemembers had experienced unwanted sexual contact in the past year, a category that includes sexual assault, according to a Pentagon survey.
    


            “The idea that VA would deny abortion care even in cases of rape – to me that's disgusting,” said Rachel Fey, interim Co-CEO of the group Power to Decide, a reproductive rights advocacy group. Fey calls the new VA ban “devastating” and “disrespectful” to women who have put their lives on the line for their country.
    


            Asked by CNN why the VA changed the policy, agency spokesman Peter Kasperowicz noted in a statement that “the Department of Justice issued an opinion that states VA is not legally authorized to provide abortions.”
    


            According to the VA's new rule, the Justice Department opinion says that procedures necessary to save the life of a pregnant veteran are not considered abortions under relevant federal law “and therefore remain permissible.”
    


            Kasperowicz did not elaborate on why the policy was changed with regard to rape and incest.
    


            VA Secretary Doug Collins is set to appear Wednesday on Capitol Hill for a hearing on VA health care, where he is expected to field questions about the new abortion policy.
    


            In the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that, regardless of state laws, it would provide abortions when a pregnant veteran's life or health was at risk if their pregnancy were carried to term, or if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.
    


            It was one of several moves taken by the Biden administration to expand abortion rights both at the VA and beyond as several Republican-led states enacted strict abortion laws.
    


            The Biden-era policy allowed the VA to perform abortion services in some cases when health risks to the mother were not necessarily life-threatening, such as renal disorders, hypertension, and certain mental health problems.  



            A VA official called the Biden-era policy a “politically-motivated change.”
    


            With the Trump administration's new policy, the department will now authorize abortions only in cases of ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages or if a doctor determines the mother's life is endangered if she carries the fetus to term.
    


            That's in contrast to the Bureau of Prisons policy, which states that federal funds can be used for abortions when the pregnancy endangers the woman's life or is the result of rape or incest.
    


            The new VA policy is effective immediately, and the department says it applies to all VA health care facilities, including those in states where abortions are legal under state law.
    


            Some doctors and nurses who work in the VA health system have balked at the new policy.
    


            “It's frustrating to not be able to provide health care to patients, that I'm being told what I can and cannot do by someone who has no medical knowledge. The people making these rules – they're not clinicians,” an OB-GYN doctor, who asked to remain anonymous because they are still employed in the VA system, told CNN.
    


            The doctor fears that some veteran women who need abortions won't get them because VA providers “will be afraid to render this care.”
    


            In some cases, VA physicians might determine a woman's condition isn't life-threatening enough to authorize an abortion, the OB-GYN said, worried they “will keep pushing women veterans to ‘come back when you're worse. You're not sick enough.'”
    


            “Patients will die,” the doctor said.
    


            Another doctor in the VA system who also declined to be named for fear of retaliation worries about a chilling effect from the new ban on abortion counseling.
    


            “If they want to make guideline-based and evidence-based recommendations, in her best interests, now they'll think twice about that,” the doctor said of VA physicians who treat female patients.
    


            This doctor pointed to a recent patient, a woman veteran who had experienced military sexual trauma and sought care at the VA. The new rule “certainly put fear in my mind – and in the minds of other clinicians who were treating her,” the doctor said.
    


            Jackii Wang, senior legislative analyst for the National Women's Law Center, which advocates for abortion rights, said: “When we think of the number of women veterans who have suffered military sexual trauma, it's unconscionable that the administration would implement a policy like this.”
    


            “It really impacts their faith in their health care system,” Wang said of women veterans she's spoken to about the new VA abortion policy.
    


            National Nurses United, a labor union that represents about 13,500 nurses at nearly two dozen VA facilities across the country, has strongly denounced the new abortion ban.
    


            “This misogynistic, dangerous, and discriminatory policy will cause immeasurable harm and violates the nursing ethics nurses pledge to uphold,” the group said in a statement to CNN. “It is the utmost in hypocrisy that this administration thanks veterans for putting their bodies on the line, but then strips them of their bodily autonomy, self-determination, and dignity by refusing basic health care.”
    


            The move is drawing condemnation from some Democrats in Congress – and praise from some Republicans.
    


            Rep. Julia Brownley, a California Democrat and member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, has introduced a bill that would add abortion and abortion counseling as services provided under law. The bill has no Republican co-signers and is unlikely to pass. A separate effort from Senate Democrats to overturn the rule was launched Tuesday.
    


            Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a combat-wounded veteran, current member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee and a former assistant secretary of veterans affairs in the Obama administration, said in a statement: “In cases of rape, incest or when the health of the mother is at risk, Trump is denying our heroes the care they've earned through their service.”
    


            “Our Veterans risked their lives to safeguard our freedoms. And yet a man who has never served a day in his life is taking away their own freedom to choose what's best for their health,” said the Illinois Democrat, who still gets her medical care through the VA.
    


            Rep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat and ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, called the move “draconian” and said, “This cruel and dangerous move will harm veterans and damages trust in the very system that is supposed to protect them and serve their healthcare needs.”
    


            But Republican Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, praised the administration for returning to the pre-Biden policy to “protect the unborn.”
    


            Republican Rep. Mike Bost of Illinois, the chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said it was “wrong that the Biden administration violated settled law in 2022 and began offering abortion services through the VA.”
    


            “It's simple – taxpayers do not want their hard-earned money spent on paying for abortions – and the VA's sole focus should always be providing service-connected health care and benefits to veterans they serve,” Bost said.

            Top Justice Department leaders said in a court filing Tuesday they expect to release the department's Jeffrey Epstein-related files “in the near term.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Jay Clayton told two federal judges the department could not “provide a specific date” for when it would complete its review of the files.
    


            The update comes as the Justice Department faces enormous pressure to release all of its files after Congress passed a law in November – with near-unanimous support – giving the department a December 19, 2025, deadline to do so. Epstein, the convicted sex offender who was accused of abusing dozens of underage girls, died by suicide in 2019.
    


            The filing, a letter sent to Judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer in the Southern District of New York, is the latest update from the Justice Department as it continues to review and release materials.
    


            The officials wrote in the letter that “the Department has reviewed millions of pages of materials” along with video and audio recordings and has made “substantial progress” in identifying documents and completing redactions to protect victims.
    


            “The Department is not able to provide a specific date at this time and cautions that its ongoing processes, including its quality control checks and document management system preparations, may require additional efforts to ensure the protection of victim identifying information while complying with the broad demands of the Act,” the letter said.
    


            The letter said DOJ efforts have included “manual review by hundreds of Department attorneys, agents and others” who have “dedicated days and weeks” to the effort. CNN previously reported on the department's scramble to review documents, asking for career prosecutors in Florida to volunteer over the winter holidays to help redact the documents.
    


CNN poll: Just 6% of Americans satisfied with how much US has released from Epstein files so far



            The files are made up of papers, videos, photographs and audio files that live within the FBI's main electronic case management system and largely originate from the FBI's two major investigations into Epstein, in Florida and New York, spanning decades. A July 2025 FBI memo said that the department had uncovered “more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence” during a review of the investigative materials.
    


            The Justice Department earlier this month said it had released 12,285 documents — less than 1% — of its Epstein-related files, with more than 2 million documents still in review.
    


            A CNN poll conducted by SSRS between January 9-12 found that few Americans are satisfied with the amount of evidence released in the Epstein case, with most saying they believe the government is intentionally holding back information.
    


            A two-thirds majority of Americans said the federal government is intentionally holding back some information about the Epstein case that should be released, while just 16% said the government is making an effort to release all information possible. The remainder said they haven't heard enough about the case to say.

A man sprayed an unknown substance on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar during a Minneapolis town hall Tuesday and was tackled to the ground. The incident came amid heightened tensions over federal immigration enforcement in the city.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A man sprayed an unknown substance on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar and was tackled to the ground Tuesday during a town hall in Minneapolis, where tensions over federal immigration enforcement have come to a head after agents fatally shot an intensive care nurse and a mother of three this month.

The audience cheered as the man was pinned down and his arms were tied behind his back. In video of the incident, someone in the crowd can be heard saying, “Oh my god, he sprayed something on her.”

Just before that Omar had called for the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign or face impeachment. Calls are mounting on Capitol Hill for Noem to step down after the shooting deaths in Minneapolis of two people who protested deportations. Few Republicans have risen to her defense.

“ICE cannot be reformed,” Omar said, seconds before the attack.

Minneapolis police said officers saw the man use a syringe to spray an unknown liquid at Omar. They immediately arrested him and booked him at the county jail for third-degree assault, spokesperson Trevor Folke said. Forensic scientists responded to the scene. 

Police identified the man as 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak. It was not immediately clear if Kazmierczak had an attorney. The county public defenders' office could not immediately be reached.

Omar continued speaking for about 25 more minutes after the man was ushered out by security, saying she would not be intimidated.




There was a strong, vinegarlike smell after the man pushed on the syringe, according to an Associated Press journalist who was there. Photos of the device, which fell to the ground when he was tackled, showed what appeared to be a light-brown liquid inside. There was no immediate word from officials on what it was. 

Minneapolis Council Member LaTrisha Vetaw said some of the substance also came into contact with her and state Sen. Bobby Joe Champion. She called it a deeply unsettling experience.

No one in the crowd of about 100 people had a noticeable physical reaction to the substance.

Walking out afterward, Omar said she felt a little flustered but was not hurt. She was going to be screened by a medical team. 

She later posted on the social platform X: “I'm ok. I'm a survivor so this small agitator isn't going to intimidate me from doing my work. I don't let bullies win.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Tuesday night.

President Donald Trump has frequently criticized the congresswoman and has stepped up verbal attacks on her in recent months as he turned his focus on Minneapolis. During a Cabinet meeting in December, he referred to her as “garbage.”

Hours earlier on Tuesday, the president criticized Omar as he spoke to a crowd in Iowa, saying his administration would only let in immigrants who “can show that they love our country.”

“They have to be proud, not like Ilhan Omar,” he said, drawing loud boos at the mention of her name.

He added: “She comes from a country that's a disaster. So probably, it's considered, I think — it's not even a country.” 

Omar is a U.S. citizen who fled her birthplace, Somalia, with her family at age 8 as a civil war tore apart the country.

The Minneapolis-St. Paul area is home to about 84,000 people of Somali descent — nearly a third of Somalis living in the U.S.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz expressed gratitude that Omar was safe, adding in a post on X: “Our state has been shattered by political violence in the last year. The cruel, inflammatory, dehumanizing rhetoric by our nation's leaders needs to stop immediately.”

U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, also denounced the assault.

“I am deeply disturbed to learn that Rep. Ilhan Omar was attacked at a town hall today” Mace said. “Regardless of how vehemently I disagree with her rhetoric — and I do — no elected official should face physical attacks. This is not who we are.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, called the attack “unacceptable.” He said he was relieved that Omar “is OK” and thanked police for their quick response, concluding: “This kind of behavior will not be tolerated in our city.”

The city has been reeling from the fatal shootings of two residents by federal immigration agents this month during Trump's massive immigration enforcement surge. Intensive care unit nurse Alex Pretti was killed Saturday, less than three weeks after Renee Good was fatally shot behind the wheel of her vehicle.

The attack came days after a man was arrested in Utah for allegedly punching U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat from Florida, in the face during the Sundance Film Festival and saying Trump was going to deport him. 

Threats against members of Congress have increased in recent years, peaking in 2021 in the aftermath of that year's Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, before dipping slightly only to climb again, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Capitol Police.

Lawmakers have discussed the impact on their ability to hold town halls and public events, with some even citing the threat environment in their decisions not to seek reelection.

Following the assault on Omar, U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement that the agency was “working with our federal partners to see this man faces the most serious charges possible to deter this kind of violence in our society.”

It also released updated numbers detailing threats to members of Congress: 14,938 “concerning statements, behaviors, and communications directed against lawmakers, their families, staff and the Capitol Complex” in 2025.

That is a sharp increase from 2024, when the number of cases was 9,474, according to USCP. It is the third year in a row that the number of threats has increased.

Capitol Police have beefed up security measures across all fronts since Jan. 6, 2021, and the department has seen increased reporting after a new center was launched two years ago to process reports of threats.

President Donald Trump called Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino “pretty out there” during his trip to Iowa on Tuesday. 

“Bovino's very good, but he's a pretty out there kind of a guy. And in some cases that's good; maybe it wasn't good here,” Trump said.

Trump made the comments in an interview with Fox News's Will Cain, the same day Bovino's demotion from his role overseeing Border Patrol's operations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement became effective. The news of Bovino's demotion broke two days after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

Trump spoke about the state of the surge in ICE operations in the Twin Cities during his interview in an Iowa restaurant. Tensions in Minnesota have been high in recent weeks with the killing of Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers and the spike in anti-ICE protests across the state.

“But you have to understand, when I watch some of the people that I've been watching over the last few weeks, these are paid insurrectionists. These are paid agitators,” Trump said.

The Trump administration made changes in the leadership overseeing the Minneapolis immigration enforcement operations following Pretti's killing. As Bovino was demoted back to overseeing Border Patrol operations in El Centro, California, the administration also reassigned the Border Patrol agents involved with the fatal shooting.

Democratic lawmakers and GOP mavericks Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have mounted pressure on the Trump administration to oust Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as the administration responds to Pretti's killing. But Trump backed Noem on Tuesday, telling Cain that he still has confidence in the DHS secretary.

“I do. Look, she was there with the border. Who closed up the border? She did, with Tom Homan, with the whole group,” Trump said, referring to Noem.

MAN SPRAYS ILHAN OMAR WITH UNKNOWN SUBSTANCE AT MINNEAPOLIS TOWN HALL EVENT

Trump sent in border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis this week to communicate with local leaders in an effort to de-escalate tensions between protesters and federal law enforcement in the Twin Cities. Homan said he met with local law enforcement officials, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), and Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday.

“We all agree that we need to support our law enforcement officers and get criminals off the streets. While we don't agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead,” Homan said on X.

BARA, Pakistan (AP) — More than 70,000 people, mostly women and children, have fled a remote region in northwestern Pakistan bordering Afghanistan over uncertainty of a military operation against the Pakistani Taliban, residents and officials said Tuesday.

Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif has denied the claim by residents and provincial authorities. He said no military operation was underway or planned in Tirah, a town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. 

Speaking at a news conference in Islamabad, he said harsh weather, rather than military action, was driving the migration. His comments came weeks after residents started fleeing Tirah over fears of a possible army operation.

The exodus began a month after mosque loudspeakers urged residents to leave Tirah by Jan. 23 to avoid potential fighting. Last August, Pakistan launched a military operation against Pakistani Taliban in the Bajau r district in the northwest, displacing hundreds of thousands of people.

Shafi Jan, a spokesman for the provincial government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, posted on X that he held the federal government responsible for the ordeal of the displaced people, saying authorities in Islamabad were retracting their earlier position about the military operation. 

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Suhail Afridi, whose party is led by imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan, has criticized the military and said his government will not allow troops to launch a full-scale operation in Tirah. 




The military says it will continue intelligence-based operations against Pakistani Taliban, who are known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP. Though a separate group, it has been emboldened since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in 2021. Authorities say many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuary in Afghanistan and that hundreds of them have crossed into Tirah, often using residents as human shields when militant hideouts are raided.

Caught in the middle are the residents of Tirah, who continued arriving in Bara. 

So far, local authorities have registered roughly 10,000 families — about 70,000 people — from Tirah, which has a population of around 150,000, said Talha Rafiq Alam, a local government administrator overseeing the relief effort. He said the registration deadline, originally set for Jan. 23, has been extended to Feb. 5. 

He said the displaced would be able to return once the law-and-order situation improves.

Among those arriving in Bara and nearby towns was 35-year-old Zar Badshah, who said he left with his wife and four children after the authorities ordered an evacuation. He said mortar shells had exploded in villages in recent weeks, killing a woman and wounding four children in his village. “Community elders told us to leave. They instructed us to evacuate to safer places,” he said.

At a government school in Bara, hundreds of displaced lined up outside registration centers, waiting to be enrolled to receive government assistance. Many complained the process was slow.

Narendra Singh, 27, said members of the minority Sikh community also fled Tirah after food shortages worsened, exacerbated by heavy snowfall and uncertain security. 

“There was a severe shortage of food items in Tirah, and that forced us to leave,” he said.

Tirah gained national attention in September, after an explosion at a compound allegedly used to store bomb-making materials killed at least 24 people. Authorities said most of the dead were militants linked to the TTP, though local leaders disputed that account, saying civilians, including women and children, were among the dead.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A Republican opponent is challenging U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville's eligibility to run for governor of Alabama, accusing the football coach-turned-politician of not meeting the legal requirement to have lived in the state for seven years.

Ken McFeeters, who is running against Tuberville for the Republican nomination for governor, filed the challenge Tuesday with the Alabama Republican Party. McFeeters in a phone interview said he believes Tuberville lives in a multimillion-dollar beach home in Florida instead of a smaller home that he has listed as his residence in Auburn, Alabama.

Property tax records show the former Auburn University football coach has a home in Auburn, Alabama ,with an appraised value of $291,780 on which he claims a homestead exemption. He also has a beach home in Walton County, Florida with an estimated market value of $5.5 million, according to property records. 

The Auburn house was initially purchased by Tuberville's wife and son in 2017. The senator's name was later added to the property, and the son's name removed. Both the Auburn and Florida homes appear to have recently been put in a revocable trust with Tuberville's wife as trustee. 

“It's belittling to the average person in Alabama for him to think we believe that he's being sincere when he says he lives at his son's $300,000 house when he's got a $6 million beach house. Where would you live?” McFeeters said.




McFeeters wrote in his letter to party officials that the available records, “if accurate, strongly suggest that Auburn may have been used as an address of convenience rather than as a true domicile.” McFeeters said Tuberville's travel records also show frequent travel to the Florida Panhandle, which he said buttresses the idea that he resides in the location.

Mallory Jaspers, a spokeswoman for Tuberville, called the challenge a “ridiculous PR stunt from a desperate candidate.” 

“Senator Tuberville has proudly represented Alabama in the United States Senate for the past six years. This made-up narrative didn't work when he was running for Senate in 2019, and it certainly isn't going to work now,” Jaspers wrote in an email. Jaspers said the Auburn home remains the senator's primary residence.

Tuberville faced similar accusations in his Senate campaign. Opponents called him “Florida man” or a “tourist in Alabama.” The Senate has a less stringent residency requirement before taking office. 

Tuberville told The Associated Press earlier this month that he believes he meets the residency requirement.

“We checked it out. I wouldn't be doing this if I thought it was a problem,” Tuberville said. Tuberville said it will be up to the Republican Party to decide any challenge, but “what I've heard from them, they feel good about it.”

Tuberville was the head football coach at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008. He then coached at Texas Tech and the University of Cincinnati. He went to work for ESPN after retiring from coaching. In a 2017 promotional video for ESPN, he talked about moving to Florida after retiring from coaching. 

Tuberville voted in Florida in 2018. He registered to vote in Alabama on March 28, 2019, about two weeks before announcing his run for Senate. 

Jeannie Burniston, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Republican Party, said challenges are heard and decided by the party's 21-member steering committee. Burniston said the committee will decide if there is enough evidence for a challenge to proceed to a hearing where both sides present evidence. Burniston said she cannot comment on challenges.

The awkwardly worded requirement in the Alabama Constitution says the governor and lieutenant governor “shall have been citizens of the United States ten years and resident citizens of this state at least seven years next before the date of their election.” 

McFeeters said it is important that the Republican Party take the matter seriously. He said Tuberville should be asked to provide clear evidence that he has lived in Alabama for seven consecutive years. 

Susan Pace Hamill, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, said the language of the residency requirement is vague. She said it could be interpreted to be seven consecutive years or it could be seven years broken up by periods living elsewhere. But she said Alabama's culture and history supports the argument that it should be seven consecutive years. 

“Alabama's culture is suspicious of outsiders and historically most of Alabama's governors were born and raised in the state, often having been descended from generations of Alabamians,” Hamill wrote in an email. Her comments were first reported by the Alabama Reflector.

It's the first Fed day of 2026, and Chair Jerome Powell is in the hot seat.

The central bank announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, as was widely expected. The meeting follows weeks of political pressure from the Trump administration and a recently announced Department of Justice probe.

Business Insider will be covering projections from economists, the Fed decision, and market moves all day. Check back here for updates.

The first question in the press conference was on Powell's recent visit to the Supreme Court in the Lisa Cook case. While he said it's not okay for him to respond to comments from political officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, he said it was the "most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history," so he felt it was appropriate to attend the oral arguments.

He said he was "not going to expand" on his video statement on the DOJ investigation and did not confirm if the Fed has responded to grand jury subpoenas. Powell said he "didn't want to get into" his future at the central bank when asked about remaining on the FOMC through 2028.

To open the press conference, Powell said the economy is "coming into 2026 on firm footing." The Fed is focused on its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment, he said, and the US employment rate has seen "some signs of stabilization."

He said that consumer sentiment is "resilient," though job gains have remained low, the housing sector is "weak" and the recent government shutdown weighed on economic activity. The economic situation is becoming more balanced, but there is still a decline in labor force growth due to low demand and declining immigration. This calls for steady rates, he said.

The Fed may be holding rates steady, but the central bank did make a notable change to its economic picture this month. In Wednesday's news release, FOMC leaders removed the phrase "downside risks to employment rose in recent months," which has been included in almost every release from the past few months.

The committee said that job gains remain low and inflation is still somewhat elevated, but removing the "downside risks to employment" phrase from the Fed's economic assessment is good news for job seekers. It means Powell and company see a labor market in recovery.

Powell will begin the Fed's January press conference at 2:30 p.m. He will give an overview of the current economic situation, including the inflation and employment data the Fed is closely watching.

The central bank chair will then take questions from journalists. We expect Powell will be asked about the DOJ probe, ongoing political pressure from the Trump administration, tariffs, the impact of AI on the job market, and more. Powell's answers could foreshadow future monetary policy and plans for his final months at the Fed.

Major indexes were flat after the Fed opted to keep interest rates unchanged.

"Focus, naturally, now turns to Chair Powell's press conference," wrote Michael Brown, senior strategist at Pepperstone. "Powell will likely, again, note that the FFR is now within a reasonable range of estimates as to where the neutral rate may lie, though will probably steer well clear of any questions on his plans post-May, or on ongoing attempts to erode the Fed's policy independence."

The S&P 500 was in the red after the decision, reversing an earlier rally that had brought the benchmark index above 7,000 for the first time ever.

The committee has had a split on interest rates at every meeting since July — and this month is no different. Ten FOMC members, including Powell, voted in favor of the hold, but there were two dissents. Stephan Miran and Christopher Waller preferred a quarter-point cut.

The Fed will hold its benchmark interest rate steady between 3.5 and 3.75%, in alignment with expectations. The move breaks a pattern of rate cuts over the past several months. Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET to discuss.

Central bank decisions trickle down to consumers through mortgage and credit card rates, auto loans, and savings accounts. The borrowing rates for these typically follow the same pattern as the Fed. Higher interest rates can help curb rising prices, but still-high borrowing costs could push companies toward layoffs or hiring freezes over time. It's unlikely Americans will feel the impact of a single rate call, but sustained cuts or hikes can have an effect over time.

The typically uniform Fed has been increasingly divided in its decisions. At the December meeting, the FOMC had its most split call since September 2019 with three dissents. Recent Trump appointee Stephen Miran repeatedly voted for steeper rate cuts last year. Others, like Jeffrey R. Schmid, urged a more cautious stance.

It's possible that January's rate call will be another split decision for the committee.

Top contenders to succeed Powell include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder, Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett, and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Rieder is leading prediction markets.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is in charge of the process, though any nominees are likely to hit roadblocks in Congress over the DOJ probe.

"The hope is that whoever takes Powell's role next will be similarly data driven and level headed," Elizabeth Renter, the senior economist at NerdWallet, said. "A Fed that is vulnerable to political pressure is one that will struggle to be effective at guiding economic stability."

Trump has been vocal about his desire for lower interest rates, threatening to fire Powell and dubbing him with the moniker "Too Late." The president told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month that he hopes the next Fed chair will consult with him more closely on monetary policy. "I'm a smart voice and should be listened to," he said.

Trump added in his Davos speech that he's interviewing potential Powell successors: "Everyone that I interviewed is great. Everyone could do, I think, a fantastic job," he said, continuing, "It's amazing how people change once they have the job. It's too bad, sort of disloyalty."

Stocks were steady ahead of the rate decision and Jerome Powell's press conference. The S&P 500 pulled back from its record above 7,000 as the tech-led rally stuttered. Markets will be listening closely for updates from Powell on where he sees interest rates going through the rest of his term, but also any clues that could hint at what his successor might do.

"Markets expect Chair Powell to end his leadership term without cutting rates again. They also believe that his successor will be similarly cautious, with heavy odds (+70 percent) that Fed Funds will be within 25 basis points of 3.0 percent in December 2027," wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, on Wednesday.

Both the DOJ probe and Cook case have sparked widespread concern over the Fed's future, as the bank has long operated as independent and nonpartisan.

Ten heads of various world banks released a letter defending Powell, as did a group of state-level treasurers and auditors.

Ten heads of various world banks released a letter defending Powell, as did a group of state-level treasurers and auditors.

"We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell," the letter from global bank leaders read. "The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve."

The Trump administration accused Fed Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud in August and attempted to fire her, though she has remained in her seat. Her case was heard by the Supreme Court last week, and several judges expressed disagreement with the White House.

"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve," said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee.

Powell attended oral arguments for the case in support of Cook, but did not give testimony.

The DOJ probe around Powell's testimony about the Fed renovations is ongoing. Markets and political leaders will be watching Powell's comments in this afternoon's press conference closely. Beyond posting the uncharacteristic video message online to announce the subpoena, he hasn't spoken publicly about the investigation.

The effective import tariff rate has spiked to the highest in decades.

Experts have been keeping an eye on just how much tariffs have affected inflation. Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said it's challenging to know the extent to which tariffs have had an effect because there are other headwinds, such as supply chain and inventory issues. Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, said tariffs had some effect on goods inflation, but hadn't resulted in a massive surge.

US stocks cruised to records at the open on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 hitting 7,000 for the first time ever. Traders were bracing for the Fed decision, as well as critical earnings updates from mega-cap tech. Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft are due to report fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell.

Markets are broadly expecting to rates to remain unchanged today. The CME FedWatch Tool shows 97% odds of the target rate remaining in the range of 3.5-3.75%. Views on Wall Street are also mixed on whether the market can expect one or two cuts in 2026.

Glen Smith, chief investment officer at GDS Wealth Management, said, "we expect just one rate cut for 2026, and while the timing of this next rate cut is debatable, it will likely come towards the second half of the year" with a new Fed chair.

Fed members can look back at last year's inflation to inform their coming interest rate decision. The inflation rate, based on the consumer price index, ended 2025 lower than it started but remained above the Fed's 2% target.

The year-over-year percent change in the shelter index continued to cool from its 2023 peak.

The unemployment rate has been at least 4% since June 2024, and ended 2025 at 4.4%. This is historically low, but it comes alongside limited vacancies, low hiring rates, and a decline in the number of Americans quitting their jobs or changing roles compared to a few years ago.

Daniel Zhao, the chief economist at Glassdoor, said last year's job market ended "with a fizzle rather than a bang." The US added 584,000 jobs in 2025, the lowest since 2003, outside recessions.

Economists and job-market experts told Business Insider that the job market was in a low-fire, low-hire environment, partly due to economic uncertainty and reduced demand after the pandemic recovery and the Great Resignation.

It's likely Fed leaders will stick to the status quo in January, in hopes that steady rates will push inflation closer to their 2% goal. Affordability is a major concern for American households, as prices rise on housing, groceries, healthcare, and more. Powell has consistently prioritized price stability during his time as chair.

The Fed is expected to cut rates at least once later this year, a move that could ease costs for borrowers and juice the job market.

Powell's term as chair ends in May, but he's eligible to remain on the Fed committee until early 2028. It's rare for former chairs to stay on as governors, and Powell has not indicated his plans.

But there's been some speculation from Wall Streeters that Trump's threats to the Fed could entice Powell to remain at the bank longer than expected.

The DOJ probe news sparked alarm among politicians, economists, and business leaders, many of whom are concerned about the future of the central bank. Powell's term as chair expires in May, and Trump is set to announce his next pick for the role in the coming weeks.

Both Democratic and Republican leaders have signaled the probe jeopardizes the search for Powell's successor.

"If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none," North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said, adding that he will oppose any Trump nominees to the central bank until "this legal matter is fully resolved."

With around 7.5 hours until the Fed's latest rate decision is announced, things are a bit of a mixed bag in financial markets on Wednesday.

As of 6:30 a.m. ET futures for the three major US indexes are trending higher, with the Nasdaq leading the way, signaling a nearly 1% rise at the open. That's due in large part to its tech focus, with many of the biggest tech firms reporting earnings this week.

Elsewhere, futures for the S&P 500 are 0.4% higher, while the Dow Jones is up less than 0.1%.

In Europe, where markets are open, stocks are a little lower, with the UK's FTSE 100 benchmark down 0.5%, and Germany's DAX falling 0.2%.

Gold's record rally is continuing on Wednesday, with the precious metal extending its gain by another 3% to trade just under $5,300 per ounce. Silver is also higher, gaining 5.4% to trade at $111 per ounce.

Powell posted a video message on January 11 announcing that the Fed received a grand jury subpoena. The Trump administration alleges that Powell committed perjury during a June appearance before Congress, where he discussed renovations to the central bank's Washington, DC, buildings.

Business Insider obtained a letter Powell privately sent to senators detailing the Fed's construction plans and budget — the details of which match his testimony. Powell said that the probe, which could result in a criminal indictment, is an escalation of ongoing pressure from the White House.

"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president," he said.

The Federal Open Market Committee has penciled in one rate cut for the new year. Fed leaders opted for three quarter-point cuts last fall after months of steady monetary policy.

The White House and investors are hopeful for a looser approach to interest rates in 2026. But Powell is in a tough spot: Lower rates could speed up a slow job market, but risk a rise in inflation.

It's the first Fed day of 2026, and Chair Jerome Powell is in the hot seat.

Central bank leaders will announce their January interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET. The meeting follows weeks of political pressure from the Trump administration and a recently announced Department of Justice probe.

Business Insider will be covering projections from economists, the Fed decision, and market moves all day. Check back here for updates.

Trump has been vocal about his desire for lower interest rates, threatening to fire Powell and dubbing him with the moniker "Too Late." The president told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month that he hopes the next Fed chair will consult with him more closely on monetary policy. "I'm a smart voice and should be listened to," he said.

Trump added in his Davos speech that he's interviewing potential Powell successors: "Everyone that I interviewed is great. Everyone could do, I think, a fantastic job," he said, continuing, "It's amazing how people change once they have the job. It's too bad, sort of disloyalty."

Stocks were steady ahead of the rate decision and Jerome Powell's press conference. The S&P 500 pulled back from its record above 7,000 as the tech-led rally stuttered. Markets will be listening closely for updates from Powell on where he sees interest rates going through the rest of his term, but also any clues that could hint at what his successor might do.

"Markets expect Chair Powell to end his leadership term without cutting rates again. They also believe that his successor will be similarly cautious, with heavy odds (+70 percent) that Fed Funds will be within 25 basis points of 3.0 percent in December 2027," wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, on Wednesday.

Both the DOJ probe and Cook case have sparked widespread concern over the Fed's future, as the bank has long operated as independent and nonpartisan.

Ten heads of various world banks released a letter defending Powell, as did a group of state-level treasurers and auditors.

Tesla earnings are looming, and Wall Street's outlook is mixed as vehicle sales remain in a rut and the company's AI plans continue to take shape.

Analysts said ahead of the Wednesday report that they see challenges ahead for Elon Musk's carmaker, including uncertain EV demand and unclear timelines for some of its major AI projects.

While some firms are bullish on the robotaxi rollout expanding this year, others say the stock has largely priced in the bull case for AI and robotics, leaving little room for disappointment on either front.

Tesla will publish its results after the 4 p.m. closing bell, with its call with analysts set to begin around 5:30 p.m. ET.

Chinese EV maker BYD sold more cars than Tesla last year — and it wasn't even close.

The Shenzhen-based automaker delivered more than 2.26 million battery-electric cars to global consumers. Tesla sold 1.65 million in the same time.

Chinese EV maker BYD sold more cars than Tesla last year — and it wasn't even close.

The Shenzhen-based automaker delivered more than 2.26 million battery-electric cars to global consumers. Tesla sold 1.65 million in the same time.

"The story is that 2025 marks the year Tesla lost the BEV crown to BYD," Howard Yu, a professor at IMD Business School, wrote to Business Insider. "And not by a little. It's a 620,000-unit gap that didn't exist two years ago."

Tesla's best-selling cars — the Model Y and the Model 3 — both received facelifts in early 2025. The design updates added LED light bars on the headlight and taillight, sharper body angles that increased battery range, and more ambient lighting on the interiors.

In the auto industry, design refreshes typically trigger months of growing sales. For Tesla, however, sales have continued to slide.

Musk is known for his optimistic timelines, and Tesla's robotaxi rollout is no exception.

The billionaire predicted that by the end of 2025, Tesla's robotaxi service would be operating in 8-10 metro cities, cover half the US population, and have 500 vehicles on the road in Austin.

The billionaire predicted that by the end of 2025, Tesla's robotaxi service would be operating in 8-10 metro cities, cover half the US population, and have 500 vehicles on the road in Austin.

Tesla didn't hit any of those targets. It did, however, remove safety drivers from its vehicles in Austin this month. Tesla is planning to launch robotaxis in multiple US cities this year, and investors will be watching the earnings call closely for any updates.

Analysts at JPMorgan lowered their EPS estimate for Tesla to $0.43 from $0.48 after the carmaker missed its fourth-quarter delivery target. Tesla recently reported a 16% year-over-year drop in deliveries for the fourth quarter.

"The -16% y/y decline in 4Q25 deliveries is the worst ever for Tesla," analysts wrote in a recent client note, adding that Tesla's stock price looked "increasingly divorced" from the company's "rapidly declining earnings outlook."

The bank reiterated its "underweight" rating on Tesla and $150 price target, implying 65% downside from the stock's current levels.

Wells Fargo said it remains pessimistic about Tesla's business fundamentals. The bank said it believed the company would continue to see "moderating delivery growth" this year, pointing to lower demand for Teslas and diminishing returns on the company's price cuts.

"2026 Fundamentals look weak, leaving no support if Robotaxi/Optimus disappoint," analysts wrote in a client note.

The bank reiterated its "underweight" rating on the stock but lifted its price target to $130 a share, citing updated growth estimates for Tesla's car business. The price target implies 70% downside from Tesla's current levels.

Tesla's sales in the US, China, and Europe fell sharply in 2025 — and in January it reported its second consecutive annual sales decline. Still, the automaker's stock has jumped to near record highs, boosted by optimism around self-driving and AI.

"The market doesn't seem to place much emphasis on Tesla's current automotive business, even as deliveries are declining," Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar who closely monitors Tesla, told Business Insider.

Tesla stock looks like it's already largely priced in the bull case, which relies on the success of the company's robotaxi business and Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot. But returns for those projects may not be realized in the near future, UBS analysts said.

"So in our view, given a declining valuation for TSLA's EV business, the market is already assigning a higher and higher value to the AI ventures. While the TAM for these ventures may be large, they could also be further out," the bank wrote.

UBS issued a "sell" rating and a $247 price target, implying 43% downside from current levels.

Tesla's progress on AI has been "slower than anticipated," Oppenheimer said.

The firm pointed to continued progress Tesla would need to make before beginning the production of Optimus, and the expectation that the company will roll out robotaxis in more cities across the US this year.

"We see downside risk to 2026 consensus as we continue to anticipate delays in Robotaxi performance and Optimus ramp in context of a challenging EV demand environment for TSLA," the firm wrote.

Analysts issued a "perform" rating on Tesla and trimmed their fourth-quarter revenue estimates from $24.08 billion to $23.7 billion.

Cantor analysts highlighted potential catalysts that could boost Tesla's stock down the line, like the company rolling out full self-driving in China and Europe, expanding its robotaxi presence across the US, and launching Optimus commercially in 2027.

The firm's analysts reiterated its "overweight" rating on the stock and set a $510 price target, implying 17% upside from Tesla's current levels.

Wedbush, a longtime Tesla bull, remains optimistic about Tesla's AI and robotics projects.

The research firm said it believed Tesla could hit a $2 trillion valuation in the next year as the company begins "full scale volume production" of some of its autonomous and robotics products.

The research firm said it believed Tesla could hit a $2 trillion valuation in the next year as the company begins "full scale volume production" of some of its autonomous and robotics products.

"We believe Tesla will own ~70% of the global autonomous market over the next decade as no other company can match the scale and scope of Tesla coupled with its broadening AI footprint," a team led by Dan Ives wrote in a note.

The firm reiterated its "outperform" rating and issued a $600 price target on Tesla, implying 38% upside from current levels.

Meta Platforms is gearing up to report its fourth-quarter results and all eyes are on its ambitious AI plans, specifically its outlook for more capex spending in the coming year.

Some Wall Street analysts say the Facebook parent's updates on AI infrastructure spending could overshadow other areas of its results, such as growth in its ad business.

Meta will report earnings after the closing bell, and will hold a call with analysts around 4:30 p.m. ET. 



TD Cowen is bullish on Meta ahead of its Wednesday earnings report, predicting that generative AI tools will continue to support growth in its advertising business.

Analyst John Blackedge said he believes ad growth will help bolster its high capex spending.

Analyst John Blackedge said he believes ad growth will help bolster its high capex spending.

"Key at the 4Q25 print will be mgmt's '26 capex and opex guides," he said. "We currently expect '26 capex of $125.0BN, up 76% y/y and 14% above consensus alongside '26 opex of $156.1BN, up 32.9% y/y and 7% above consensus."

Rothschild has a $900 price target for Meta stock, one of the highest on Wall Street. Its target represents a 35% increase from levels on Wednesday. Analyst James Cordwell sees Meta as one of the tech sector's best-positioned companies to capitalize on rising AI demand. 

"The recent focus regarding Meta has been dominated by how the company might guide for FY26 operating expenses and capital expenditure," he stated. "The fear is that this is 'Zuckerberg unleashed', with the company's CEO truly back in 'founder mode', pursuing his AI dreams whatever the financial cost."

"The fear is that this is 'Zuckerberg unleashed', with the company's CEO truly back in 'founder mode', pursuing his AI dreams whatever the financial cost."

The analyst added that this has prompted Rothschild to increase its full-year capex projection for Meta to $117.1 billion.

Goldman analysts remain focused on Meta's capex plans, which they believe will continue to drive growth into 2026 and beyond. The bank recently raised its spending projections for the company, already above analyst estimates, noting that it sees upward pressure on consensus capex estimates.

"On the next earnings call, we expect investors will be focused on any updates on the work of the Meta Superintelligence Lab, the timing of any foundational model work and/or any strategies with respect to consumer or enterprise utility around AI," Goldman analysts stated.

Deutsche analysts maintain a buy rating and a bullish price target of $880 for Meta stock, a 31% jump from current levels. But as analyst Benjamin Black notes, heading into the Q4 earnings call, concerns linger about this year's expenses.

That said, his team also predicts that Meta's revenue will come in at $59 billion, just above Wall Street estimates.

"In our view, Meta is positioned favorably — especially in the long-term — as it doubles down on an AI investment cycle," Black said.

BofA analysts expect Meta to slightly beat estimates, though they remain focused on the company's expense guide for the coming year. The bank has an $810 price target and a buy rating for the stock, implying 21% upside.

"Concerns on '26 expenses have been building for 5 months & we think an expense guide at around 30% 2026 growth could be positive, while at/above 35% a negative," said analyst Justin Post.

The Federal Reserve has not yet complied with grand jury subpoenas issued as part of a criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell by federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Wednesday.

The probe of Powell is continuing, according to that person, who spoke hours before the Fed is set to reveal whether it will cut interest rates for the fourth time in recent months.

It is not clear when the deadline is for the Fed to turn over documents demanded by the subpoena.

CNBC has requested comment from the Fed and from the Department of Justice.

Powell on Jan. 11 said that he was under criminal investigation.

The probe is being conducted by the office of Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.

Powell said on Jan. 11 that the DOJ days earlier served the Fed "with grand jury subpoenas threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June" about the central banks $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters.

Powell also said that the investigation resulted from frustration by President Donald Trump over the Fed's refusal to cut interest rates as quickly and as much as the president wanted last year.

"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President," Powell said in a video statement tweeted by the Fed's X account.

Meta on Wednesday will report fourth-quarter earnings, and investors will be looking for any signs that its revamped artificial intelligence strategy will benefit the company in 2026.

Here's what analysts polled by LSEG are expecting:

Meta spent a large chunk of 2025 overhauling its AI unit, including investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI to land the startup's founder, Alexandr Wang, and several of his colleagues.

Wang oversees Meta's top-tier TBD unit that is tasked with developing powerful AI models. The company set up TBD after its Llama 4 model launched to tepid response from developers last spring. Meta has been testing a new frontier model and Llama successor code-named Avocado, and plans to release it during the first half of the year, CNBC reported.

Underpinning Meta's AI efforts has been a major data center build-out while rivals like OpenAI and Alphabet do the same. Meta on Tuesday said it committed to paying glass manufacturing giant Corning up to $6 billion through 2030 for fiber-optic cable in its AI data centers.

Although investors have been spooked by Meta's costly artificial intelligence investments, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has characterized the moves as necessary given AI's rapid pace of development.  

"Being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over, over some period," Zuckerberg told analysts in October.

Meta's capital expenditures, related to its data center push, are projected to come in at $21.97 billion for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.

The company is expected to report $56.98 billion in online advertising sales for the fourth quarter, according to StreetAccount.

Wall Street expects fourth-quarter daily active people to come in at 3.58 billion.

Investors will also be monitoring what Zuckerberg has to say about the company's Reality Labs unit, which builds the virtual reality, augmented reality and wearable technology intended to power the so-called metaverse.

Earlier this month, Meta laid off more than 1,000 Reality Labs employees who worked on VR-related initiatives, including internal studios, as part of a shifting of resources to AI and related wearable devices, like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. 

Although Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth told media outlets last week that Meta is not halting its VR efforts, the company's outsized impact on that industry has chilled some developers and sparked fears of a VR winter, CNBC reported.

Analysts estimate Reality Labs to post a fourth-quarter operating loss of $5.67 billion on $940.8 million in sales. That unit has had over $70 billion in total operating losses since late 2020.

Amazon is cutting 16,000 corporate roles, and an internal FAQ viewed by Business Insider spells out the details for affected employees.

This round of layoffs is the second mass job cut since October, when Amazon shed 14,000 roles. The moves are part of a broad effort by the company to operate more efficiently amid rapid advances in AI. Amazon didn't respond to requests for further comments on the job cuts.

Employees who received a layoff notification will receive full pay and benefits for 90 days plus an additional severance package, and are no longer expected to perform any work, according to the document.

Amazon's public announcement stated that the company is offering most US-based employees 90 days to search for a new role internally. The FAQ states affected employees are "welcome to apply for available roles through the internal process" during the 90-day notification period.

The FAQ is below. Business Insider removed Amazon login guidance from this FAQ to avoid disclosing security-related details.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday shut down reports that the U.S. could step into the currency market with the Japanese yen on intervention watch and the American dollar hitting multiyear lows.

"Absolutely not," Bessent told CNBC's Sara Eisen, responding to a question about if the U.S. is intervening in the currency market or strengthening the yen.

The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the American currency against a basket of foreign peers, fell 1.3% on Tuesday, marking its biggest one-day slide since April. The dollar index also fell to its lowest level since 2022 during the session, but ticked higher in midday trading on Wednesday.

Reuters reported last week that the New York Federal Reserve had reviewed dollar-to-yen rates with dealers, citing a person familiar with the matter. Such a move is viewed as a precursor to intervention, Reuters reported.

Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday he had no comment on the report besides saying the U.S. has a strong dollar policy.

The "U.S. always has a strong dollar policy, but a strong dollar policy means setting the right fundamentals," Bessent said.

"If we have sound policies, the money will flow in," he added. "We are bringing down our trade deficits, so ... automatically that should lead to more dollar strength over time."

Bessent's comments come a day after President Donald Trump said, "I think it's great" when asked if he was comfortable with the current value of the dollar. The dollar index has dropped more than 10% compared with 12 months ago. 

Trump said he's seen China and Japan "devalue" their currencies, which he's found to be unfair. Investors have been monitoring for a potential intervention on the Japanese yen.

"They devalue, because it's hard to compete when they devalue," Trump said in Iowa, where he was on a visit focused on his economic record.

Amazon started notifying impacted employees on Wednesday morning as part of its plan to cut 16,000 corporate jobs, according to messages from affected employees shared with Business Insider.

Employees in the US, UK, and India received emails from Amazon HR chief Beth Galetti stating they will continue to receive full pay and benefits for 90 days.

"I have some important, but difficult, news to share with you," the email states. "After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the hard business decision to eliminate some roles across Amazon. Unfortunately, your role is being eliminated as part of these changes, and your employment will end after a notification period."

The notice states employees will receive support in the following ways:

Internal Slack messages viewed by Business Insider suggest impacted teams include those within the company's Amazon Web Services cloud unit, such as the AI cloud service Bedrock, the cloud data warehouse service Redshift, and the ProServe consulting team, as well as retail business teams such as the Prime subscription service and the last-mile Delivery Experience team.

This round of layoffs is the latest mass job cut since October, when Amazon shed 14,000 roles. Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce represents a relatively small share of that total, at roughly 350,000 employees.

Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment. 

I have some important, but difficult, news to share with you. After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the hard business decision to eliminate some roles across Amazon. Unfortunately, your role is being eliminated as part of these changes and your employment will end after a notification period.

These decisions weren't made lightly, and we recognize the significant impact they have. We're committed to supporting you through this transition with:

A non-working period with your full pay and benefits

A severance package offer and transitional benefits

External job placement support and 12 months of complimentary access to AWS Skill Builder

As of now, you are no longer required to perform work on Amazon's behalf and will continue to receive your full pay and benefits for the next 90 days.

You likely have questions, and we're here to answer them. You'll soon receive an invitation to schedule a conversation with a leader and/or HR point of contact from your team to discuss the specifics of your transition and how we can best support you. While this meeting is optional, we encourage you to attend virtually as it provides an opportunity to address your individual questions. Additionally, you'll receive a separate email from Amazon - Enterprise Document Management (notifications@atoz.amazon.work) with your formal announcement paperwork by the end of the day today. Please note that your badge access has been restricted; so, if you're currently in an Amazon office, Security can assist you with exiting the building.

During your non-working transition period, you'll continue to have access to internal email, Chime, and A to Z on your personal device, and our primary mode of communication with you will be through email. Please keep your YubiKey to access email on a personal laptop/computer.

We encourage you to take time now to confirm that you have access to these tools on your personal device and that your personal email address is up to date in A to Z. You can find more information about installing A to Z, connecting to MyHR, and accessing Chime and email on this page.

We appreciate that this is a difficult update to receive and have shared answers to some of the most common questions related to your pay, benefits, support resources, and next steps below. Remember that caring team members are ready to assist you 24/7 through MyHR or the Employee Assistance Portal (EAP), offering free and confidential support, both available within A to Z.

I'm personally committed to making sure you get the help you need as you navigate this change. Please just reply to this email if you run into any trouble at all getting what you need—whether that's connectivity issues, questions about next steps, or any other concerns.

Thank you,

Beth Galetti

In this article

Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was "heartbroken" by the situation in Minneapolis and called for an easing of tensions in a note to employees this week, CNBC confirmed Wednesday.

"This is a time for deescalation," Cook wrote in a memo obtained by Bloomberg, which first reported the news. "I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they're from, and when we embrace our shared humanity."

Cook said he had a "good conversation" with President Donald Trump this week to discuss his concerns and expressed appreciation for his "openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all."

Cook did not directly mention the two fatal shootings by federal agents.

A growing list of leaders and billionaires are speaking out after Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis this month. 

Multiple news outlets reported that OpenAI's Sam Altman said Immigration and Customs Enforcement "is going too far" in a message  to employees. Elsewhere, LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman wrote on X this week that "there is politics but humanity should transcend that."

Many executives have kept quiet on the events unfolding in Minneapolis. 

It's a stark contrast to 2020, when major tech CEOs, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, spoke out against the death of George Floyd in the Midwest city and committed millions to groups working on racial justice.

In 2020, Cook sent a lengthy email to employees, condemning the killing of Floyd and addressing discrimination and inequality in the U.S.

"To stand together, we must stand up for one another, and recognize the fear, hurt, and outrage rightly provoked by the senseless killing of George Floyd and a much longer history of racism," he wrote at the time. 

On Saturday, the White House screening of the "Melania" documentary on the same day ICU nurse Pretti was killed drew more scrutiny on U.S. tech leaders, several of whom attended the private event. 

Cook, Amazon's Andy Jassy and Advanced Micro Devices' Lisa Su were all in attendance, according to multiple media outlets.

Apple employees were reportedly angered by Cook's attendance, according to The Intercept.

Say a Trump-friendly group of owners bought TikTok, and wanted to change the way TikTok worked — so it showed more stuff that was Trump-friendly, and less that wasn't.

How would they go about doing that?

I'm no engineer, but I would think that would be a pretty difficult project. You'd need to do it pretty subtly, over an extended time period, so people wouldn't notice it right away. Right?

Wrong, say some people who use TikTok. They point to Sunday, when TikTok stopped showing anything related to the death of Minneapolis protester Alex Pretti. They also note that at one point, TikTok prohibited users from using the word "Epstein" in direct messages to each other. And some TikTok creators insist that anti-Trump posts they created weren't getting the same distribution they used to.

And all of this, they say, is related to the fact that late last week, a group of companies from the US and Abu Dhabi took control of (some of) TikTok's US operations, via a deal brokered by the Trump administration.

The new US TikTok says that's not the case. It says its entire operation was screwed up Sunday because one of Oracle's data centers had an outage. (TikTok didn't formally identify Oracle in its statements, but on Tuesday night, Oracle raised its hand and acknowledged that it was the "US Data Center partner" TikTok was referring to. Oracle now owns 15% of the new US TikTok.) It also says the Epstein direct message issue was a bug it is fixing, though it hasn't described how the bug came to be.

And all of that seems pretty plausible to me.

On Saturday, my feed was full of posts about the latest killing of a protester in Minneapolis by federal agents. And on Sunday, those were all gone — but so was everything else I normally saw on my TikTok, like Liverpool soccer highlights and copyright-violating clips of action movies and TV shows. Instead, I got clip after clip of videos extolling the virtues of Corvettes.

But on Monday, everything was back to normal: My TikTok was full of rage-inducing clips about Alex Pretti's death, including multiple ones where creators urged viewers to learn how to use guns to defend themselves from the government. And while I don't normally use TikTok's DM feature, or send messages about Jeffrey Epstein, I was able to do that without a problem on Tuesday.

All of which suggests that TikTok's answer — we had to unplug the machine and plug it back in, basically — sounds pretty plausible to me. And much more plausible than, "The new US TikTok has immediately started censoring anti-Trump views."

But that's the theory that a bunch of high-profile people, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Chris Murphy, are running with.

And while some of the people complaining may have a specific motivation for their complaints — both Newsom and Murphy are consistent critics of the Trump administration, for instance — it's easy enough to understand why people might think TikTok really is up to something.

For starters, one of the reasons US TikTok is no longer run entirely by ByteDance, its original owner, is because US lawmakers told us they were worried that China might influence what TikTok users saw in America. But now US TikTok is owned by Trump allies — most notably Oracle founder Larry Ellison — and Trump has made it clear that he wants media and tech companies to promote things he likes and demote things he doesn't. So it's not outrageous to believe that TikTok's new bosses might put their thumb on the scale for Trump.

But the bigger issue is that it's nearly impossible, from the outside, to understand why a platform's algorithm behaves the way it does. You can certainly make informed guesses, and you might be right. But you're still guessing, and your guessing is often informed by the way you think the platform should operate.

Conservatives, for instance, complained for years about the way Twitter and Facebook treated them — up until Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and Mark Zuckerberg pivoted to Trump in 2025. Digital publishers are consumed with the vagaries of Google Discover — the platform many of them are now dependent on for traffic referrals. Now, AI engines are the new target for bias claims.

But proving that something is up — one way or another — is just about impossible in any systemic way: Yes, maybe your latest post isn't getting the views your other posts used to get. But does that mean the platform is censoring you? Or just swapping out your free content for someone else's free content it thinks will perform better?

Even more confounding for us outsiders: Sometimes we really do find out that a human being — not software — made a decision to push something out of sight on a platform they run. In 2020, Twitter, then run by Jack Dorsey, hid a New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop because the company believed it might be part of a disinformation plot against Joe Biden. (Twitter later reversed itself, and Dorsey apologized publicly.) Musk, after buying Twitter, reportedly told his engineers to boost his posts on his own platform.

And we most certainly live in an era where trust in every institution is frayed. So when a big platform stops showing you what you want to see, there are plenty of reasons to think that something's afoot. So maybe one day we will find out that the new US TikTok really is trying to promote Trump and tamp down his foes. I don't think that's true now — but how can I tell, for sure?

JPMorgan and Bank of America are among the latest financial firms to commit to contributing to "Trump Accounts" for the kids of US-based employees.

The banks announced on Wednesday that they will match the government's one-time $1,000 contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as "Trump Accounts," for the children of their employees. Their announcements coincide with a "Trump Accounts Summit," where President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are speaking.

For JPMorgan, the news comes just one week after the president sued the bank and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for $5 billion over allegations of politically motivated debanking. A source familiar with the bank's move said that the firm has been planning the contributions since Trump Accounts were announced in June.

JPMorgan employs more than 190,000 people in the United States alone, Dimon said in a press release about the announcement.

"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future," he said in the release.

Bank of America shared the news in an internal memo, reviewed by Business Insider, to its 165,000 US employees. In addition to matching the contributions, the bank will allow "eligible teammates" with kids to make pretax contributions to the accounts via payroll deductions.

"We applaud that the federal government is providing innovative solutions for employees and families to plan for their future, and we welcome the opportunity to participate," the memo said.

The banks join a list of companies that have committed to matching their employees' $1,000 contributions to Trump Accounts for their children, including BlackRock and Charles Schwab. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon attended a White House roundtable in June and expressed support for the plan.

Through the program, the Treasury-funded accounts are available to every American citizen born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year, and the program will start on July 4, 2026. It's one of many initiatives Trump has touted during his second term to give Americans free money, some of which haven't come to fruition.

In December, Michael and Susan Dell partnered with the Trump Accounts initiative and committed to contributing $250 to the accounts of 25 million American children, totaling a $6.25 billion donation from their charitable fund. Children aged 10 and younger who were born before January 1, 2025, and live in a ZIP code with a median income of $150,000 or less are eligible for the money. Billionaire Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, also announced plans to donate $250 to about 300,000 children in Connecticut living in zip codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less.

President Donald Trump has "brought down the temperature" on Minnesota, the site of major civil unrest over aggressive federal immigration efforts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.

Trump is "urging" Congress to take action to avoid triggering a partial government shutdown amid disputes over federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security, Bessent told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street."

The shutdown could begin at 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday unless lawmakers come to a resolution on the DHS funding, which a slew of Democrats have rejected in light of the recent killing of nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.

Trump is "in constant contact" with lawmakers "and he is urging them not to shut down the government," Bessent told CNBC.

Bessent spoke as the Trump administration tempers its tone after its harsh initial response to two immigration enforcement-related killings in Minneapolis that stirred waves of outrage from Democrats and even some Republicans.

The Cabinet secretary declined to make a prediction about whether a shutdown — the second in less than four months — will be averted.

"I don't know what to expect. The Democrats can become unhinged like they were last time, and they don't care. Like, they think this is a way to stop President Trump," he said.

He also warned that another shutdown could cause further economic harm. 

"Especially on the service side, when the government shut down, that never comes back. So, there's a big permanent loss," Bessent said.

The House of Representatives last week passed a more-than-$1.2 trillion spending package that includes funding for DHS, the agency in charge of federal immigration enforcement.

The package, which accounts for the bulk of government spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, requires Democratic support to clear the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold. And if the Senate changes what the House already passed, the House would have to return from a prescheduled recess to vote on any amended measure, with little time to spare before a shutdown.

Democratic opposition to the spending package rapidly grew after Pretti's killing on Saturday morning. Senate Democrats now say they will vote against the package unless the DHS portion is stripped out, something Republicans have signaled they will not do.

Pretti was killed just weeks after another U.S. citizen, Renee Nicole Good, was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis.

In both cases, the Trump administration initially came out in full-throated defense of its officers' actions while accusing the slain citizens of domestic terrorism. 

After widespread blowback — and after new polls showed Trump's immigration approval rating plummeting — the administration has dialed back its tone.

Trump said Tuesday, "we're going to de-escalate a bit" in Minnesota.

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has suggested that that pivot is not enough for Democrats to drop the shutdown threat.

"The fix should come from Congress; the public can't trust the administration to do the right thing on its own," Schumer said Tuesday on the Senate floor.

"In the meantime, I will vote no on any legislation that funds [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue," Schumer said.

JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said Wednesday in separate releases that the firms will match the U.S. government's one-time $1,000 contribution to children's retirement savings accounts for eligible employees, the latest corporations to announce such a measure.

The so-called Trump accounts are part of a pilot program that deposits $1,000 from the U.S. Treasury into tax-advantaged accounts for eligible children born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028.

The program, partly the brainchild of hedge fund manager Brad Gerstner, aims to help narrow the U.S. wealth gap by encouraging long-term saving and investing from birth. It has attracted commitments from a growing list of wealthy individuals, from billionaires such as Michael and Susan Dell and Ray Dalio to rap artist Nicki Minaj. 

"JPMorgan Chase has demonstrated a long-term commitment to the financial health and well-being of all of our employees and their families around the world, including more than 190,000 here in the United States," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a release. "By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future."

In a memo sent to employees Wednesday first reported by Reuters, Bank of America said it applauded the government's "innovative solutions" for employee savings. 

Financial firms dominate the list of companies that are matching contributions for the new accounts. Besides JPMorgan and Bank of America, the two largest U.S. banks by assets, BlackRock, BNY, Robinhood, SoFi and Charles Schwab have made similar announcements.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday said the city's wealthiest must pay more in taxes to help fill the staggering budget deficit of more than $12 billion that he was left by his predecessor.

"This is at a scale that's actually greater than what we saw here in New York City during the Great Recession," Mamdani said of that budget hole during an interview with CNBC "Squawk Box" co-anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin at City Hall.

The Democrat, who took office on Jan. 1 after campaigning on a platform of hiking taxes on the rich, attributed the big deficit to "gross fiscal mismanagement." 

He pointed to actions taken by former Mayor Eric Adams, and by ex-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whom he soundly defeated in the November general election, for causing that budget gap.

Mamdani vowed that his administration will be up front with New Yorkers about budget issues that have been "hidden from them for far too long."

City Comptroller Mark Levine earlier this month said the new mayor faces a budget shortfall that is projected to total $12.6 billion over the next two fiscal years. 

That comprises a $2.2 billion projected deficit on the city's nearly $116 billion budget for fiscal 2026, which ends on June 30, and a $10.4 billion gap in fiscal 2027.

Mamdani on Wednesday said that his plan to address the deficit will also include finding savings in the budget.

He gave the example of the Adams administration launching a "basically unusable" artificial intelligence chatbot that reportedly cost about $600,000 to develop.

"I think the scale of this crisis is one where we have to pursue all of these things," Mamdani said.

"I have to show that the city government is not just serious about public goods, but also public excellence and public efficiency, and so we have to make sure every dollar that's being spent is actually being spent in a worthwhile way," he said.

The 34-year-old former state assemblyman, while campaigning for mayor last year, vowed to raise the city's corporate tax rate to 11.5%, matching New Jersey's rate.

He also promised to impose a flat 2% tax on New Yorkers who earn more than $1 million per year.

Mamdani's sudden rise to prominence after his stunning upset victory over Cuomo in the 2025 Democratic mayoral primary, and his self-identification as a democratic socialist, has caused consternation among some of the city's business elite.  

A number of those leaders warned that his redistributionist agenda could hobble the city, which is the nation's financial capital.

Asked by Sorkin on Wednesday about fears of an exodus by billionaires, other wealthy people and businesses in the face of his policies, Mamdani pushed back.

"Capital flight is always spoken about whenever we talk about the potential of increasing taxes on the wealthy," Mamdani said. 

He noted that the number of millionaires in New York has increased since the state raised taxes on the wealthy in 2021. 

And Mamadni stressed that his revenue plans are aimed at increasing the quality of city services.

"We're sitting here right now in one of the coldest stretches in New York City weather history," the mayor noted.

"One of the reasons why the city could start to get back on its feet was because we had a Sanitation Department that was staffed by thousands of people," he said. 

"That's only possible when you're actually investing in public service."

Alex Dhillon spent almost five years at Palantir before leaving to build cybersecurity startup Outtake. Now his former boss is helping fuel his new company's growth, alongside a roster of investors that includes Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. 

Outtake, which counts OpenAI and Bill Ackman's Pershing Square among its customers, has just raised a fresh $40 million, the company said Wednesday. 

The startup, founded in 2023, uses autonomous artificial intelligence agents to help companies detect and quickly remove cyberthreats like phishing, through a variety of applications, including email verification. 

"We're headed towards this world of always-on security," Dhillon said in an interview. "You need agent tech solutions like Outtake, defending your neighborhood."

The funding round was led by venture firm Iconiq, with participation from CRV, S32 and angel investors Nadella as well as Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora, Anduril co-founder Trae Stephens, and Ackman. Palantir tech chief Shyam Sankar was another angel investor in the company and contributed to the newest round. 

Dhillon didn't disclose the valuation, but the 35-person company said that annual recurring revenue has increased about sixfold year over year, and that its systems scanned 20 million potential cyberattacks last year. Outtake also said it has grown enterprise customers more than tenfold year over year. 

Dhillon said that AI has raised the sophistication and pace of cyberthreats, and that his company is building a "trust layer for the Internet."

Iconiq general partner Murali Joshi, who is joining Outtake's board, said the company's growth rate, strong customer feedback and market opportunity are among the reasons the firm invested. 

"What they've built, from a product perspective, is so fundamentally differentiated relative to everything else that's been on the market," Joshi told CNBC. 

Outtake's technology is used by AppLovin, federal agencies, luxury retail brands and popular AI labs. Dhillon, who worked on Palantir's AI platforms, said the company plans to use some of the funding to grow its go-to-market teams, including engineering and product. 

"We need agents manning the walls, because we're getting hammered every day," Dhillon said. "That's, frankly, what's both thrilling and frightening about our space, and in that lie opportunity."

Outtake previously raised $16.5 million in a Series A funding round led by CRV in April, and $3.5 million in a seed round.

Happy Wednesday. When you work in journalism, there's a new surprising story each day. Yesterday, it was about what gold investors can learn from King Henry VIII's reign.

S&P 500 futures are rising this morning after a winning day.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

It's Fed Day. That means we're counting down the hours until the Federal Reserve announces its interest rate policy decision at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Chair Jerome Powell's closely watched press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.

Here's what to know:

Starbucks shares surged more than 7% this morning after the coffee chain posted stronger-than-expected revenue for the first fiscal quarter and reported traffic growth for the first time in two years. The company missed analysts' earnings estimates.

In a statement, CEO Brian Niccol said the results are a sign that Starbucks' business turnaround plan is working. Same-store sales grew for a second straight quarter, helped domestically by demand for its holiday offerings such as specialty menu items and the viral "Bearista" cup.

Later today, all eyes will be on Meta, Microsoft and Tesla when they report earnings after the bell. IBM and ServiceNow will also share their quarterly financial reports this afternoon.

Following federal agents' killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis this month, House Democrats said yesterday that they will launch impeachment hearings against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unless Trump fires her. 

Democrats are also vowing to oppose funding for the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of the deaths, putting the federal government on the path to a partial shutdown that could start Saturday.

Meanwhile Trump, whose administration has in recent days sought to ease its stance on the killings, said yesterday that "we're going to de-escalate a little bit" in Minnesota. The president also said he wanted "a very honorable and honest investigation" into the killing of Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by federal agents over the weekend.

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

Amazon is cutting about 16,000 corporate jobs, the company announced this morning. The layoffs, which are part of Amazon's effort to "remove bureaucracy," mark the online retail giant's second round of mass cuts since October.

As CNBC's Annie Palmer reported, some of Amazon's cloud staffers were notified of "organizational changes" by an email sent in an apparent error yesterday. Amazon did not reply immediately to CNBC's request for comment on the email.

The layoffs aren't the only big change for Amazon this week. The company announced yesterday that it will close its Fresh supermarket and Go convenience store chains and convert some locations to Whole Foods stores. Amazon's grocery chief Jason Buechel told employees in a Tuesday memo that the company needs to make "deliberate choices" to build on its momentum. Read the full memo here.

After more than half of a century, Southwest Airlines has officially ended its open-seating policy. 

The airlines cited calls for change from customers when making the decision — which it announced in July 2024 — while playing up the financial benefits to investors. Southwest will now also begin offering roomier, high-priced seats near the front of planes. The change should be a hot topic on the Dallas-based airline's earnings call tomorrow.

CNBC's Leslie Josephs flew on Southwest's last open-seating flight and one of its first with seat assignments this week. Here's what she saw.

Research and consulting firm Brand Finance found Tesla's brand suffered last year as CEO Elon Musk ventured further into politics. Here's how much brand value it lost:

CNBC's Jeff Cox, Steve Liesman, Sean Conlon, Justin Papp, Dan Mangan, Amelia Lucas, Garrett Downs, Annie Palmer, Leslie Josephs, Erin Black and Lora Kolodny contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

U.S. President Donald Trump warned Iran on Wednesday that an "armada" was heading toward it and that it should "make a deal" with the U.S. on its contested nuclear program or face a large-scale U.S. military attack.

"A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela," Trump posted on Truth Social. 

"Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary," he added.

Trump said he hoped Iran would come to the table to negotiate "a fair and equitable deal" regarding its nuclear weapons program.

"Time is running out, it is truly of the essence," Trump said.

"As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn't, and there was "Operation Midnight Hammer," a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again," the president added.

'Operation Midnight Hammer' refers to a U.S.-led operation in June 2025 to destroy several key Iranian nuclear facilities that the U.S. said were being used to enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons.

It's not the first warning to Tehran that U.S. military assets were being moved toward the Middle East. Last week, Trump said an "armada" was heading toward Iran but that he hoped he didn't have to use it. That warning came after authorities' brutal clampdown on nationwide protests in Iran.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Wednesday that he had not been in contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days or requested negotiations, Reuters reported, citing Iranian state media.

The U.S. has used a variety of sanctions targeting Iran's illicit oil trade, as well as military threats and action, to try to bring Tehran to the negotiating table to halt its nuclear program. 

Trump pulled the U.S. out of an Obama-era nuclear deal in 2018, during his first term in office, saying the deal was "decaying and rotten."

Trump said in March 2025 that he wanted to renegotiate a nuclear deal with Iran after reimposing a "maximum pressure" campaign on the Islamic Republic but efforts to renew talks appear to have failed.

Iran was back on the president's radar last month, however, after public unrest erupted over ongoing economic hardship in the country and its religious-conservative leadership.

Iran's security services' crackdown on the protests, mass arrests and threatened executions prompted Trump to warn Iran that he would use military action against the country if it "violently kills" protestors. He then suggested the threat had worked, leading to a temporary de-escalation of tensions with the White House. 

Some reports suggest that the death toll during the unrest could top 30,000 people, but Iranian-focused human rights group HRANA says 6,221 people are confirmed to have died, while over 17,000 deaths are still under investigation. The total number of arrests has reached 42,324, HRANA reported Tuesday.

German police searched Deutsche Bank offices in Frankfurt and in Berlin on Wednesday morning, as part of an investigation into money laundering.

Shares in the German lender were last seen down about 2.7% following news of the probe, which was first reported by Spiegel.

"We confirm Frankfurt prosecutors are currently conducting an investigation at Deutsche Bank's business premises," the bank said in a statement.

"We are cooperating fully with prosecutor's office. We cannot comment further on this matter."

The investigation comes a day before the German lender is due to publish its fourth quarter and year-end earnings report.

In 2022, German law enforcement searched Deutsche Bank's Frankfurt offices as part of an earlier money laundering probe. In May that year, the German bank and its DWS subsidiary were investigated regarding allegations of greenwashing at the latter.

In 2018, Deutsche Bank was inspected by 170 law enforcement officials as part of a tax evasion probe into two employees.

The investigation — which stemmed from the 2016 so-called "Panama papers" leak — was later dropped, with the lender fined over compliance shortcomings.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kyle Elliott, 33, a career coach who lives in California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

Getting laid off is very traumatic — and it's becoming more common.

I've been a full-time career coach to tech employees at startups and in Big Tech since 2017, and I've seen how layoffs have become more visible in recent years.

I help clients navigate life after a layoff, including what role they want next and how to apply for new jobs.

Amazon has announced new plans to cut staff, and I want affected employees to remember that they are coming from one of the world's top companies.

When people reach out to me for coaching after a layoff, many have a scarcity mindset and feel like they have to apply for any job.

For some people who urgently need to pay rent or put food on the table, that's necessary. But in other cases, it makes sense to take a beat and evaluate what you're really looking for in your next role.

The very first thing I ask clients to do is create a list of "must-haves" and "dealbreakers" for their next job. What are their salary expectations? Will they only work remotely? Are they willing to relocate? If you write the list before you start interviewing, you can act from a place of logic rather than panic.

The second step is to update your résumé and LinkedIn profile, which are two of your most critical tools in today's market. You're going to submit a résumé with almost every application, and having an up-to-date LinkedIn account puts you in a good position if potential employers check it or recruiters go looking for talent on the platform.

You want to optimize for the roles you're looking for in 2026, which means that if you were an engineer when you joined Amazon but are now a director, you want to make sure that's reflected on your LinkedIn page.

I've seen clients turn to quick hacks for their job search, like asking AI to tailor their résumé or using it to find and apply to roles for them. But if everyone does that, you don't stand out.

I can usually tell quickly if someone's written their résumé with AI. For example, they'll be applying to a systems engineer role, and it won't even have the phrase "systems engineer" in it.

Everyone thinks only AI is reading their résumé, but I have clients who work in talent acquisition and HR — the humans who are still involved in the recruitment process. Humans hire other humans, even at big companies.

In the age of AI, be more human. Take a step back and think, if you were a human looking at this résumé, what would you want to see? Then put those phrases near the top, rather than using AI to create generic slop.

I'd suggest creating a master résumé that you can spend 20 minutes tailoring for different roles. If you're using AI, use it more like an extra tool, rather than the thing that's driving your job search.

Layoffs are normal now, especially in the tech industry, and there's much less stigma around them.

But there's more competition in the job market, because it's easier to apply for jobs with AI, for example, so the challenges around layoffs are different nowadays.

In today's job market, it's important to figure out what's unique about you. Lots of people will meet the job requirements, so you need to communicate why the company should hire you over the thousands of other applicants.

One thing that can help you is to look back at performance reviews and identify things people repeatedly say about you. You can try asking three to five people to share what makes you fabulous and to give examples. I've found that clients are surprised by the feedback they receive.

In this article

Amazon said Wednesday it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October. 

In a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs were part of an ongoing effort to "strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy." That coincides with a push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence. 

The job reductions come just a few months after October's layoffs, when 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found "additional places we can remove layers."

Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, didn't rule out more job cuts in the future, but said the company isn't trying to create "a new rhythm" of broad layoffs every few months.

"That's not our plan," Galetti wrote in the blog post. "But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate."

On Tuesday, some employees in Amazon's cloud unit received an email sent in an apparent error acknowledging "organizational changes" at the company. The note referenced a post from Galetti and said Amazon notified "impacted colleagues in our organization."

Amazon had about 1.58 million employees as of the end of its third quarter. That figure is primarily made up of warehouse and logistics workers.

The 30,000 job cuts since October represent about 10% of its corporate and tech workforce, which comprises about 350,000 people. 

Amazon has been in the midst of a significant downsizing for the past several years. The company laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and it conducted smaller cuts across various organizations in 2024. 

CEO Andy Jassy has looked to slim down Amazon's workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services. 

Jassy has also looked to reset Amazon's corporate culture so that it can operate like the "world's largest startup." He set internal targets to slash management layers and established a "no bureaucracy email alias" to identify ways the company can innovate faster. 

Amazon has also been cutting costs across its business so that it can invest more in AI and the rapid build-out of data centers. Earlier this week, the company shuttered its Fresh and Go grocery chains after years of experimentation. 

Last October, Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies.

Jassy said last June that efficiency gains from AI would likely cause Amazon's corporate head count to fall in the coming years. 

"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," Jassy said at the time.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ilma Lopez, 44, co-owner of the Ugly Duckling luncheonette and two other food businesses in Portland, Maine. She recently put up a "No ICE" sign after immigration agents began stepped-up enforcement efforts in the city. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.

When I found out ICE was going to be here, I got super worried. We have immigrants working with us, like every other business in town.

As a business owner, when you cross those doors being a guest or a team member, I'm responsible for you. I cannot put anyone at risk. We're responsible for making sure you have a great service, great food, and for your well-being in this establishment.

That's why we put the "No ICE" sign. I want people to be able to walk in here without being worried about what's going to happen to them.

Lawyers are telling us, "Just be careful." I've been a citizen for 10 years. This is the first time I've had to carry a copy of my passport.

This will impact all of us collectively. Business-wise, if you take all the immigrants away, who is going to clean your house? Who are the ones who will do your nails? Nannies? Who is going to pick crops on the farms? Who's going to do construction? Immigrants do that and so much more.

When we put up a social post about our "No ICE" poster, it's because putting up the sign was the right thing to do — for a lot of reasons. After I posted, we started getting emails and bad online reviews. We were laughing because we just got one review that said our tacos were awful. We don't even sell tacos.

They're getting personal. We're getting emails along the lines of, "We can't wait until ICE gets you out of here," and "Nobody speaks English there." You're like, "Where do you draw the line?" I get that we don't have the same beliefs, but you're messing with employees' well-being.

We've had phone calls. It was all different area codes and some from Maine. The nicest thing that someone said was that I was an ugly liberal.

They also said things like, "You don't support ICE; you're not a Mainer. You don't belong here."

When I decided to put up the social post, I thought, "Some people are not going to be happy about it." I'm not trying to make my food political, because it's not. It's food. I never thought people were going to be so hateful.

I went through this roller coaster of feelings. A group of people were saying that they were going to boycott the restaurant, and they can't wait until we close. So, of course, I got worried when we were slow. Then people started showing up, so it balances it out.

Our team is phenomenal. We've gotten great support from our community. What keeps me going is that I know we can do this. I know it's going to be hard and not ideal for a while.

The other thing that keeps me going is that I have two kids. I need to show them that you can have your beliefs — you can have your core values — and that those are valid.

I'm hoping my kids have more protection because they were born here. I don't know, but I'm hoping, as a mom.

I had to follow a legal process to become a citizen. I've been in this country for 22 years. I became a citizen 10 years ago. For 12 years, I was following every single step. It's expensive; it's time-consuming. You do it because it's the right thing to do.

Our teams have done the same thing. They have green cards and work permits. They're not citizens — yet. That's one of the reasons that we're worried because they're not as protected as a citizen.

What I'm asking ICE is, do the same thing. Follow the law. If you want to check something, bring me a warrant. Don't be rude when you take people. They're scared. Everyone's scared.

My 12-year-old is like, "What's going on?" As a parent, you don't want that for your kids. I got home late one day because I was working. She was up, and I was like, "How are you feeling?" She said, "I'm a little concerned." I was like, "It's OK, you're American." She was like, "But you're not."

What am I going to say? I said, "We're going to be fine. I have my paperwork. We have nothing to worry about." It's concerning because it's her community. It's her friends from school. Everyone knows an immigrant.

I'm an American citizen — born and raised in Venezuela — but this feels different. I felt that it doesn't matter how hard I work, I will never be 100% accepted. I know that not everybody thinks like that, but that's how I felt.

I don't regret the decision to move here. I would do it all over again. This is not the America I moved to. I know this doesn't represent all of us.

Editor's note: Business Insider reached out to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Customs and Border Protection for comment about their interactions with small businesses in Maine.

Starbucks' comeback is taking shape — and a leaked internal organizational chart shows exactly who CEO Brian Niccol is relying on to build on the momentum.

The chart from early January, obtained by Business Insider, lays out the people who report directly to the CEO, including several longtime Niccol allies from Chipotle and Taco Bell, as the coffee giant's "Back to Starbucks" turnaround gains traction and its stock starts to rebound.

Since Business Insider viewed the chart, the company has made some leadership changes. Most notably, Anand Varadarajan started as chief technology officer on January 19, reporting to Niccol. Business Insider was unable to determine how often the org chart is updated.

Representatives for Starbucks declined to comment for this story.

Take a look at Niccol's direct reports and their responsibilities, according to the internal org chart:

As of mid-January, the org chart showed that Niccol's direct reports included his executive assistant and eight current executives who are helping him reverse the coffee chain's slumping sales and usher in a new era of streamlined customer service and coffeehouse redesigns.

The org chart also included former chief legal officer Brad Lerman among Niccol's direct reports. He left the role in November and remained as an advisor for a period to support the transition, according to a securities filing.

Including those listed above, Niccol has hired at least half a dozen executives who worked with him on his prior turnaround campaign at Chipotle — and his stint as Taco Bell's chief executive before that. Most of those hires joined Starbucks at the vice president role or higher since Niccol took the helm in late 2024, Business Insider reported in September.

Lieberman became Starbucks' chief brand officer after holding senior marketing roles under Niccol at both Taco Bell and Chipotle. Grams, the former Taco Bell operating chief, came out of retirement to take the same role at Starbucks, and Meredith Sandland, Taco Bell's onetime chief development officer during Niccol's tenure, also joined as EVP of coffeehouse design and development under Grams — driving a key piece of Niccol's turnaround plan.

The chart reveals another one of Niccol's Chipotle-era executives has joined the coffee giant: Ryan Guthrie, the coffee brand's VP of government affairs, who led the same department while Niccol was CEO of Chipotle, joined Starbucks in September 2025.

The executive leadership team is in charge of steering Starbucks' turnaround effort, which has recently begun to accelerate. Starbucks' stock is up more than 13% so far this year, and the company has stabilized since Niccol took over, breaking a six-quarter comparable sales slump as of October.

A report from the location intelligence and foot traffic data software firm Placer.ai found that the week of November 10, which includes Red Cup Day — one of the chain's busiest sales days of the year — saw visits spike by 5.8% year over year. The prior week, when the collectible Bearista cup launched, visits were up 11.6% year over year.

Placer.ai also found that Starbucks' growth in visits during the second half of 2025 outperformed the wider coffee category during the final stretch of the year.

More than just a corporate diagram, the chart underscores a familiar playbook for Niccol: surround himself with trusted lieutenants from past turnarounds as he engineers Starbucks' revitalization.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Chinese humanoid robots are on the verge of coming to the U.S. — before Elon Musk is ready to sell his Optimus machines.

During my visits to China's "Silicon Valley," Shenzhen, over the last two years, I saw humanoid startup LimX Dynamics move from a bare-bones facility to a modern office tower with sweeping views — and bolder ambitions.

Now, the company is exploring business collaborations in the U.S., founder Will Zhang told me in an exclusive interview last week. Just days earlier, the startup showed off its humanoid robot at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

It's all part of LimX's push to go global through local partners, including investors. 

First on the roadmap is the Middle East. The startup has already secured its first foreign backer from the region, where LimX plans to start shipping humanoids this year, Zhang said.

He was unable to publicly share details on LimX's new investors or the monetary amount, as the funding round is still in progress. The new round will multiply the startup's valuation from its earlier Series A round, the startup said.

LimX has raised $69.31 million as of July 2025, according to PitchBook, with backers including Alibaba, JD.com and Lenovo. Zhang declined to comment on IPO plans.

"More than money, I'm focused on local partnerships," Zhang said, noting plans to speak with more international investors in the next few months. Beyond the Middle East, he also sees potential in what he calls Europe's large but fragmented market. 

LimX is not alone. Several other Chinese humanoid robot companies such as Unitree showed off their humanoids at CES. They join an increasing number of China-based consumer electronics companies exploring the U.S. market.

It's all a sign of how pressure is mounting for Elon Musk's humanoid robot plans, not just from U.S. rival Figure AI but also from Chinese companies ramping up humanoid deliveries globally. 

Last year, about 13,000 humanoids were shipped worldwide, according to research firm Omdia. Chinese companies, led by Agibot, dominated the top five by shipments. Figure ranked seventh, while Tesla was ninth. Omdia said Tesla has shipped Optimus humanoid robot units to business clients, but not to the public yet. 

With upbeat numbers from the Omdia report, Morgan Stanley last week doubled its forecast for China humanoid robot sales this year to 28,000 units, up from an earlier estimate of 14,000. The forecast only includes external sales.

"We expect sales to businesses to be the key driver this year, taking over from government, R&D and entertainment-related sales last year," equity analyst Shen Zhong said in the report. By 2050, the firm predicts China's humanoid market could reach annual sales of 54 million units.

As for Optimus, Musk said last week at Davos that the robot wouldn't start sales to the public until the end of 2027.

LimX began delivering its humanoid robot, Oli, several months ago, Zhang said. The base model costs just 158,000 yuan ($22,660), using only LimX-made applications. A version that allows developers to integrate their own functions with the robot costs nearly twice that at 290,000 yuan. 

But Zhang wants to be a global leader in the underlying technology, rather than just another Chinese company commercializing existing ideas.

"We don't think it has to be that the U.S. leads and China follows" in terms of tech innovation, he said. 

Before founding LimX in 2022, Zhang was a tenured professor in electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University. 

His goal this year is to improve voice commands – eliminating the need for remote controls that still underpin many robot demos today, such as performing a somersault on command. Zhang aims to do this with agentic artificial intelligence, an advanced form of AI that can make a chain of decisions autonomously to complete a task.

Earlier this month, LimX announced an agentic AI "operating system" called COSA, designed to enable robots to adjust body motion in real time, such as when handling tennis balls. 

2026 marks only the beginning of LimX's three-year plan to deliver several thousand humanoid robots to the Middle East, primarily for research and development, and to build case studies on how the robots can perform services for humans. Plans for the U.S. haven't yet been fleshed out.

But, Zhang said, rapid advances in the industry mean humanoid robots could be working alongside humans within five to 10 years. If all goes according to plan, those robots won't just be in China, but deployed around the world.

Benjamin Hung, Chairman of Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council, discussed how investors and businesses are reassessing the risk of heavy concentration in U.S. assets while rebalancing portfolios toward Asia, Greater China, gold, and alternative assets.

Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong markets are becoming increasingly prominent on a global stage, attracting companies not just from Mainland China but also from Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

Kevin Sneader, President of APAC ex‑Japan at Goldman Sachs, spoke about investor appetite for AI driving flows into Asian markets, while noting key nuances for standouts such as China and South Korea.

TikTok safe in the U.S. The short-video app said it officially formed a joint venture that allows it to operate in the U.S., although China has yet to confirm the deal has its blessing. 

China's TCL buys Sony TVs. The Chinese TV manufacturer is acquiring Sony's home entertainment business through a joint venture that gives TCL a majority stake. The deal is set to close in March.

Youth unemployment hits 16.5% in December. The jobless figures add to a grim picture for China's economy. But the takeaway from Davos is that the country is poised to benefit from more regional trade.

What has President Trump achieved? He's shown the world that China is a viable partner on the trade side, is somewhat more stable than the U.S. ... Trump has probably advantaged China in the long run in hard and soft power.

— Ed Price, Non-Resident Senior Visiting Fellow, New York University

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault started a Tuesday earnings call with some dry humor, telling investors that his company will see the end of winter.

The French luxury tycoon, who is worth $197 billion, announced the company's full-year 2025 results during a call with investors.

"I'm delighted to present to you the figures for 2025, to begin with a good piece of news," he said. "I think we'll make it through the winter."

He said that LVMH's results were "solid" in a challenging geopolitical and economic climate, and the company has "managed to get through this period."

"2026 won't be simple either, but one thing at a time," he added. Arnault has been the luxury giant's CEO since 1989.

The group posted revenue of €80.8 billion, or about $96.9 billion, in 2025, a 5% decline from 2024. Of this, its wine and spirits division took the largest hit, with sales down 9% from 2024.

LVMH has seen its revenue growth slow down in recent years. In 2020, it was hit hard by the COVID pandemic, seeing its annual revenue drop 17% compared to 2019. Business picked back up in 2021, where it saw a 44% revenue increase compared to 2020.

However, the luxury slump that followed has since taken a toll on the business, as aspirational customers cut down on luxury purchases, squeezed by inflation after the pandemic. Luxury customers in China, one of LVMH's most important markets, were hit by a real-estate-linked economic crisis and reined in their spending.

LVMH's sales went into the red in 2024, when it reported a 2% revenue dip compared to 2023.

And last year, it faced a new challenge: President Donald Trump's tariffs. Company executives said in May last year that prices for some of its premium goods could increase 2 to 3% to offset the tariffs.

It's not just LVMH that is suffering from the luxury slump. The upscale US department store company, Saks Global, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 13, owing millions to luxury companies Kering, Chanel, and Capri Holdings.

Representatives for LVMH did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Some Amazon employees got a worrying calendar invitation on Tuesday, stoking more concern about job cuts that are expected in coming days. 

The invitation addressed impending job cuts and mentioned "Project Dawn," an initiative to improve efficiency at Amazon, according to a copy obtained by Business Insider.

The invitation had the subject line "Send Project Dawn email" and was written by Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of AWS Solutions, although it appears to have been sent by an assistant. 

The invitation was for a calendar event at 5 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, but it was canceled shortly after it was sent. Some employees noticed it and shared the information with Business Insider. 

"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers," the accompanying message read. "The notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization who are based in the US, Canada, and Costa Rica have now been completed."

"Changes like this are hard on everyone," Aubrey's message continued. "These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success."

Amazon plans to cut thousands of corporate roles in coming days, Business Insider previously reported. The reductions would mark the company's second round of mass layoffs since October, when it eliminated roughly 14,000 jobs. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

After the calendar invitation landed, confusion spread across an internal Slack channel with more than 36,000 Amazon employees, according to messages viewed by Business Insider. Staff questioned whether the message had been intended for Aubrey's entire organization or only for those whose roles were being eliminated.

"Am I impacted or sent by mistake to all?" one employee wrote.

Others saw the email as confirmation that the expected layoffs were imminent.

"Well, if you needed solid proof that tomorrow is legit, the project dawn email is it," one person wrote. "Looks like they wanted to use AI to send an email tomorrow and instead it sent a calendar invite today."

It remains unclear which teams will be affected by the cuts. Some Amazon employees who spoke to Business Insider theorized that staff who received the accidental invitation may not be among those getting cut.

"People are speculating you're safe if invited," one employee said.

Oops, something went wrong

Publicly traded financial services company Strive boosted its Bitcoin holdings to more than $1.1 billion worth, making it one of the 10 largest publicly traded holders of crypto's leading asset, the firm announced on Wednesday. 

The firm acquired 333.89 Bitcoin for an average price of $89,851, bringing its total holdings to 13,131.82 BTC. Strive also said that it paid off 92% of the debt accrued from its recently completed acquisition of Semler Scientific, a medical technology firm that had adopted a BTC treasury strategy. 

“Strive continues to demonstrate leading execution in managing a world-class, Bitcoin-powered treasury, retiring over 90% of the Semler legacy debt just 11 days after closing the Semler acquisition, with intentions to retire the remaining debt by April,” said Strive Chairman and CEO Matt Cole, in a statement.

“By quickly returning to a preferred equity-only amplification structure, we are putting our money where our mouth is in our belief that the optimal way to finance the amplification of Bitcoin is by appropriately matching the long-duration nature of Bitcoin with long-duration financing,” he added. 

The firm's Semler acquisition was officially approved by Semler shareholders two weeks ago, sending shares in both firms tumbling in the process and combining the medical technology firm's 5,048 BTC with Strive's existing holdings. The deal was officially completed just days later.

In addition to its Bitcoin acquisition, the firm announced the closing of a 1.3 million share follow-on offering of its preferred stock SATA, which it sold at $90 per share. Strive said its follow-on offering had more than $600 million in demand.

“The successful completion of this oversubscribed SATA follow-on offering reflects robust and growing investor demand for digital credit, and highlights the Strive team's disciplined, fast-paced execution of our corporate strategy,” said Chief Investment Officer Ben Werkman, in a statement. 

Founded by former Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Strive raised $750 million to buy Bitcoin last May. It had previously encouraged GameStop to start adding BTC to its coffers, which it also did last May.

Shares in Strive (ASST) are down around 1.5% since the opening bell on Wednesday and have dropped nearly 10% on the week to recently change hands at $0.80. Shares have dropped more than 78% in the last six months.

The Solfart Token ($SOLF) presale has officially surpassed the USD 187,000 threshold, marking a significant milestone for the Solana-based project. Since the release of the project's whitepaper on August 5, 2025, the presale has been active for 265 days, maintaining a consistent capital inflow from retail investors. Data from the campaign indicates a daily sales average of approximately $705, with weekly inflows averaging $4,939 and a monthly average of roughly $21,170. This steady accumulation phase precedes the project's highly anticipated debut on centralized exchanges, scheduled for the third quarter of this year.

In a sector often defined by overnight spikes and precipitous drops, Solfart has taken a different approach. The 265-day accumulation period represents a deliberate strategy to build a distributed holder base rather than relying on a few large venture capital injections. By averaging over $700 in daily sales for nearly nine months, the project has demonstrated resilience against broader market volatility.

This sustained interest is largely attributed to the project's unique economic model, which was outlined in the August 2025 whitepaper. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on speculative trading volume to maintain value, Solfart has integrated a revenue-generating engine directly into its tokenomics.

The project operates a “Revenue-to-Burn” program powered by GoMemeCoin.com, an umbrella project and  cryptocurrency news platform. Advertising revenue generated by high traffic on GoMemeCoin.com is to be funneled into a buy-back protocol. These funds are used to purchase $SOLF tokens from the open market, which are subsequently sent to a burn address—permanently removing them from circulation.

“The math is simple but effective,” states a recent community update. “Every time an ad is viewed on our media partner site, it contributes to the scarcity of the Solfart token. We are effectively converting web traffic into deflationary pressure.”

This mechanism provides a “floor” for the token ecosystem. Even during periods of lower trading volume, the external revenue stream ensures that there is constant buy pressure, stabilizing the asset's value proposition for long-term holders.

Expanding the ecosystem further, the developers have launched the “Solfart Butt Head” NFT collection. These digital assets are now available for minting on the official website, Solfart.io. Far from being just digital collectibles, the collection is positioned as a strategic entry point for DeFi (Decentralized Finance) enthusiasts.

The “Butt Head” NFTs serve as a “freemium” opportunity, allowing users to engage with the brand with minimal upfront cost while securing potential future value. While the artwork embraces the crude, irreverent humor typical of the meme coin genre, the utility roadmap for these assets includes potential staking multipliers and exclusive access to future ecosystem features.

For the 265 days the project has been live, community engagement has coalesced around these digital identities. As the project moves toward its Q3 exchange debut, ownership of a “Butt Head” NFT is being marketed as a badge of honor for early adopters—a verifiable proof of participation in the project's foundational phase.

Perhaps the most ambitious aspect of the Solfart roadmap is its listing strategy. Per the official website, four centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) have already confirmed that they will list the token. These include BankCex, Cetoex, Coinstore, and BitStorage.

Securing four confirmed listings during the presale phase is a rarity in the meme coin space, where many projects struggle to get listed on even a single reputable platform. These exchanges provide critical infrastructure, offering fiat on-ramps and deep liquidity that will be essential when the token goes public.

However, the developer team has signaled that this is just the beginning. The stated goal is to achieve listings on 50 exchanges during the Q3 launch window. This massive liquidity injection is designed to prevent price manipulation and ensure that the token is accessible to traders in every major global market, from Asia to Europe to the Americas.

“To hit 50 exchanges is to achieve omnipresence,” notes a crypto market analyst tracking the Solana ecosystem. “If Solfart can execute on even half of that number, they will instantly have more liquidity channels than 99% of other meme tokens. It shifts the narrative from a ‘fun project' to a globally traded asset.”

Underpinning the entire Solfart ecosystem is the Solana blockchain. The choice of Solana has proven critical to the project's ability to scale over the last 265 days. With transaction fees costing fractions of a cent, investors have been able to participate in the presale and mint NFTs without the prohibitive “gas wars” associated with other chains.

The speed of Solana also enables the “Revenue-to-Burn” program to operate efficiently. Micro-transactions from ad revenue can be processed in real-time, allowing for a continuous, automated buy-back loop that would be economically unfeasible on slower networks.

As the presale continues to clock in steady numbers—pushing past $187,000—the focus is shifting to execution. The “Fart Army” community is actively preparing for the transition from accumulation to public trading.

With $21,170 coming in on average every month, the project has a growing war chest to fund the necessary marketing and technical integrations for the upcoming 50-exchange push. The next few months will be critical as the team finalizes partnerships, audits smart contracts, and prepares the “Solfart Butt Head” NFTs for secondary market integration.

For now, the data tells the story: 265 days of consistent growth, a six-figure raise, and a clear path to one of the widest launches in meme coin history.

Anas is a crypto native journalist and SEO writer with over five years of writing experience covering blockchain, crypto, DeFi, and emerging tech.

The European Central Bank's Piero Cipollone has intensified warnings that Europe cannot afford to delay its digital euro project while waiting for private-sector alternatives, citing cash use collapsing to just 24% of daily transactions by value in 2024, down from 40% five years earlier.

In a January 22 interview with El País, the ECB Executive Board member argued that the central bank must adapt its payment infrastructure as technological shifts leave Europeans increasingly dependent on non-European providers for digital transactions that now dominate the economy.

The push comes as geopolitical tensions expose vulnerabilities in Europe's payments architecture, with recent events exposing how foreign control over financial infrastructure can be weaponized.

While Cipollone resisted framing the digital euro purely as a defensive measure, he acknowledged that “all these potential geopolitical tensions and the weaponisation of every conceivable tool clearly increase the level of risk” and reinforce the case for a fully European-controlled system.

Cipollone detailed that e-commerce now accounts for more than a third of day-to-day transactions by value, yet central bank money cannot be used for these purchases.

“We provide both retail and wholesale payment methods,” he said. “At the retail level, we offer cash – but it doesn't fully cover people's needs, because it can't be used to pay digitally.“

The ECB official emphasized this represents accelerating change rather than stable conditions.

A decade ago, cash dominated and met nearly all consumer needs, but technological advances have fundamentally altered payment habits.

“The ability to use central bank money for retail transactions is declining rapidly,” Cipollone stated, describing the digital euro as simply adapting to this new environment by complementing banknotes and coins with a digital equivalent.

Technical preparations are complete after the ECB concluded its two-year preparation phase in October 2025, with President Christine Lagarde confirming last month that “we have done our work, we have carried the water.“

🇪🇺 ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the digital euro is technically ready and is now awaiting legislative approval.#ECB #DigitalEuro #EUStablecoinhttps://t.co/4cdYV6UdSJ

Responsibility now sits with the EU institutions to finalize legislation, with Cipollone previously indicating that pilot transactions could begin mid-2027 and the first issuance possible in 2029 if lawmakers approve the framework this year.

The ECB has dismissed proposals from some European Parliament members calling for authorities to wait while the banking sector develops pan-European payment alternatives.

Cipollone said the central bank has long urged private solutions and welcomes integration efforts, but stressed that the digital euro itself will likely accelerate the private sector's development of continental systems.

As legal tender, the digital euro would require any merchant currently accepting digital payments to accept it, creating a single public standard across all European merchants.

“Currently, when a payment service provider (a bank or fintech firm) provides services to a merchant, the merchant has to sign up to its standards,” Cipollone explained. “With the digital euro, there will be one single, open standard, which will also be available for the private sector.“

He sharply criticized suggestions that the digital euro launch only in offline mode, questioning how such an approach could address the lack of viable European payment methods for e-commerce.

“How can an offline solution be used to pay in the e-commerce space? I don't know,” Cipollone said.

Recent events have shown the risks of foreign control in Europe's payment systems.

According to a Cryptonews report, Cipollone cited International Criminal Court judges whose U.S. cards were blocked by Visa and Mastercard, limiting their ability to pay across Europe.

“With a digital euro they could have continued to pay throughout the euro area,” he noted in a separate Süddeutsche Zeitung interview.

Seventy European economists amplified these concerns in a January 12 open letter warning that thirteen euro area countries now rely entirely on international card schemes for basic retail transactions.

“This dependence on foreign (U.S.) payment providers exposes European citizens, businesses, and governments to geopolitical leverage, foreign commercial interests, and systemic risks beyond Europe's control,” the academics wrote, demanding the digital euro function as “the backbone of a sovereign, resilient European payment infrastructure.“

The weaponization of payment systems gained fresh relevance when President Trump's January 19 tariff threats against eight European nations over Greenland triggered $875 million in crypto liquidations within 24 hours, showing how geopolitical tensions rapidly cascade through financial markets.

While Cipollone avoided commenting directly on U.S. political developments when asked about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's independence, he emphasized that the ECB focuses exclusively on euro area inflation targeting.

PANAMA CITY, Jan. 29, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Recently, HTX Ventures, the global investment arm of HTX, released its latest research report, 2025 Annual Review: Crypto Assets Move Toward Mainstream Adoption. As long-term participants deeply embedded in the industry, HTX and HTX Ventures remain focused on building foundational capabilities that endure across market cycles. On one hand, HTX Ventures tracks structural trends through rigorous research to identify the market's long-term direction. Through investment and ecosystem collaboration, it supports teams with tangible product strength and sustainable business models, advancing the integration of crypto technology into broader real-world use cases in a more resilient and sustainable manner.

Regulation Becomes Predictable: Clear Rules Drawing Institutional Capital In

HTX Ventures notes that in 2025, regulatory ambiguity across major global jurisdictions narrowed significantly. Moving from a phase of grey-zone tolerance to one of formal rule-setting, regulators focus on stablecoin frameworks, market structure compliance, and stricter requirements for trading, custody, and disclosure. In the United States, the GENIUS Act established a federal-level framework for payment stablecoins, reinforcing requirements such as full 1:1 reserve backing. In Europe, the implementation of MiCA has materially raised compliance thresholds, pushing the industry from growth-at-all-costs toward compliant competition. Hong Kong, meanwhile, has advanced its stablecoin regulatory regime through issuer licensing frameworks and the rollout of new rules.

Everything On-Chain: Stablecoin Payments and RWA Tokenization Entering an Expansion Phase

In 2025, two forces jointly reshaped on-chain infrastructure: the expansion of stablecoins and the institutional adoption of RWA tokens.

Stablecoins accelerated their evolution from crypto-native tools into global financial infrastructure. Total stablecoin market capitalization reached a record high of $308 billion in Oct. 2025 and stabilized around $309.4 billion by mid-Dec. representing a 50.3% increase over the year. Annual on-chain transaction volume exceeded $46 trillion, comparable to the combined annual volumes of Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal.

The RWA tokenization market entered a phase of accelerated growth. As of Dec. 17, 2025, the total value of on-chain distributed RWA assets (excluding stablecoins) reached $18.74 billion, more than tripling since the beginning of the year. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries reached approximately 8.7 billion, accounting for 47.3%, with landmark products such as BlackRock's BUIDL (approximately $2.006 billion). This exemplifies deeper integration between traditional asset management and on-chain tokenization.

Clearer Institutional Entry Paths: From "Whether to Allocate" to "How to Allocate Compliantly"

HTX Ventures characterizes 2025 as the year when institutional adoption pathways became quantifiable. The core shift was not institutions broadly betting on high-volatility assets, but rather entering the crypto space through more auditable, standardized structures aligned with traditional balance sheet frameworks, decomposing on-chain capabilities into deployable financial modules.

Institutional participation is advancing through several well-defined paths: gaining crypto exposure through ETFs and ETPs; incorporating BTC into corporate treasuries; migrating payments and settlement on-chain via stablecoins; and transforming cash equivalents and collateral into composable on-chain assets through RWA tokenization.

Crucially, institutional participation is changing how the market functions. HTX Ventures summarizes these structural effects in three areas:

Strategically, institutions favor low-risk, medium-yield strategies—such as arbitrage, market making, and delta-neutral hedging—acting as structure providers rather than short-term price drivers.

HTX Ventures' Focus Areas for 2026

Building upon the trends, HTX Ventures will focus on the following areas in 2026:

In 2026, HTX and HTX Ventures will keep pursuing value creation with longtermism, focusing on critical infrastructure and real-world use cases, and advancing crypto technology adoption toward a more open, fair, and transparent global financial system.

Remergify's TrustNFT.io Subsidiary Introduces Blockchain Solution to Combat $600 Billion Global Counterfeit Crisis

 
        MIAMI, January 28, 2026 (Newswire.com)
        -
    Remergify, through its subsidiary TrustNFT.io, today announced the official launch of Cerfinity.com, a groundbreaking blockchain-powered product authentication platform that leverages non-fungible token (NFT) technology to create unforgeable digital certificates for physical products. The platform addresses the escalating global counterfeit crisis, which costs brands and consumers an estimated $600 billion annually.

"The counterfeit market has reached crisis proportions, eroding consumer trust and devastating legitimate brands," said Stuart Fine, CEO of Remergify, TrustNFT.io, and Cerfinity. "Cerfinity represents a paradigm shift in product authentication. By harnessing the immutable nature of blockchain technology and the unique properties of NFTs, we've created a solution that makes counterfeiting virtually impossible while providing consumers with instant, verifiable proof of authenticity."

How Cerfinity Works

Cerfinity creates a unique digital certificate for each product, stored as an NFT on the blockchain. When brands register their products with Cerfinity, the platform generates an unforgeable NFT certificate linked to a scannable QR code or NFC tag that accompanies the physical product. Consumers can instantly verify authenticity by scanning the QR code or tag with their smartphone, accessing the complete product history including origin, ownership, and transfer records.

The platform's key differentiator is its consumer-friendly approach-no cryptocurrency wallet or blockchain knowledge is required. The verification process is as simple as scanning a QR code, making advanced blockchain security accessible to mainstream consumers.

Addressing a Critical Market Need

According to industry research, 84% of consumers express concerns about purchasing counterfeit products, particularly in online marketplaces. Traditional authentication methods such as holograms, certificates of authenticity, and serial numbers have proven inadequate, as they can be easily forged or replicated by sophisticated counterfeiters.

The product authentication market is projected to reach $12.5 billion by 2027, with blockchain-based solutions experiencing particularly rapid growth. Cerfinity targets high-value sectors including luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, electronics, fashion and apparel, collectibles, and wine and spirits.

Built on TrustNFT.io Infrastructure

Cerfinity is powered by TrustNFT.io, Remergify's blockchain infrastructure subsidiary specializing in NFT-based authentication and verification solutions. The platform supports multiple blockchain networks including Ethereum, Polygon, and Phantasma ensuring scalability and flexibility for brands of all sizes. The technology provides complete transparency while protecting sensitive business information through selective disclosure mechanisms.

Key Benefits for Brands and Consumers

For Brands:

Cerfinity provides brands with comprehensive anti-counterfeiting protection, enhanced customer engagement through direct verification interactions, valuable data and analytics on product distribution and authentication patterns, and increased consumer confidence leading to higher conversion rates and reduced return rates.

For Consumers:

Consumers gain instant authentication confidence, complete product provenance tracking, simplified resale verification for secondary markets, and protection against fraud in online and offline purchases.

"We're not just fighting counterfeits; we're building trust," added Fine. "Every authentic product becomes part of an immutable record that benefits everyone in the value chain-from manufacturers to retailers to end consumers. This is the future of product authenticity."

Availability and Pricing

Cerfinity.com is now available for brand registration. The platform offers flexible pricing models including setup fees, per-certificate fees based on volume, and subscription-based access to advanced analytics and support features. Interested brands can schedule a demonstration and consultation at www.cerfinity.com.

South Dakota lawmaker Logan Manhart made a renewed attempt on Tuesday to introduce Bitcoin holdings into the state's investment funds, following a previous proposal that was shot down in February last year.

“Strong money. Strong state,” the Republican State Representative tweeted.

I am proud to say I have released my bill that would allow the State of South Dakota to invest in Bitcoin.

Strong money. Strong state.

— Logan Manhart (@ManhartLogan) January 27, 2026



House Bill 1155 would permit the state to invest up to 10% of its investment funds in Bitcoin, either held directly or through an exchange-traded product.

The proposal comes as South Dakota's investment funds—which support services such as education, healthcare, and retirement systems—continue to underperform. With $20.56 billion in assets under management, the South Dakota Investment Council reported a return of 5.5% last year, well below its 12.5% benchmark, according to its 2025 annual report.

More than half of the portfolio is currently allocated to public equities, with smaller portions invested in areas such as real estate and debt.

Spurred on by President Donal Trump's embrace of crypto, multiple states have moved to introduce their own crypto reserve bills, often backed by pro-Trump lawmakers such as Manhart.

Bills have been submitted in 28 states, according to Bitcoin Laws' strategic reserve tracker. However, most have failed to gain traction. A total of 33 have been killed, most at the first committee reading stage. Nine proposals in six states remain ongoing.

Manhart himself first introduced a Bitcoin reserve bill in January last year, tagging Donald Trump and Elon Musk in a social media post announcing the proposal.

That bill was read in February and referred to the House Commerce and Energy Committee, which voted 9–3 to “defer to the 41st legislative day.” The maneuver is used in South Dakota's 40-day legislative sessions to kill a bill by postponing consideration until after the session ends.

To date, only three states—Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas—have enacted Bitcoin reserve legislation. But implementation has been limited.

In Arizona, proposals for a full strategic reserve have been repeatedly blocked by the governor's office, with only a reserve for seized provisions enacted in May last year.

New Hampshire allows up to 5% of funds to be invested in digital assets with a market cap of over $500 billion, meaning only Bitcoin qualifies. It is not clear if the state has actually purchased any Bitcoin yet, although it does plan to release a Bitcoin-backed bond later this year.

And in Texas, while the state can invest up to 5% of state funds into Bitcoin, it has so far only bought $5 million worth.

Other states have also advanced pro-crypto legislation this month. In Arizona, the Senate Financial Committee voted 4-3 this week to advance Senate Bill 1044, exempting virtual currency from property taxes. Kansas has also introduced a bill for its own strategic reserve.

Fidelity Investments is launching its first stablecoin, the Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD), in early February, marking a major move by one of the largest traditional financial institutions into onchain finance.

FIDD will be issued by Fidelity Digital Assets, a federally chartered national bank and subsidiary of Fidelity. The Ethereum-based stablecoin will be redeemable for $1 on Fidelity's crypto trading platforms — Fidelity Digital Assets, Fidelity Crypto, and Fidelity Crypto for Wealth Managers — and will also be made available on major crypto exchanges, according to a press release. 

The company says it designed the product to meet growing client demand and to expand the utility of blockchain-based financial products.

“This is really just the next step in the evolution of our digital asset platform,” said Mike O'Reilly, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, in an interview. “The ability to offer a fiat-backed stablecoin fits naturally into what our clients are asking for—especially around low-cost payments and settlement.”

FIDD is designed for use cases such as 24/7 settlement for institutional traders and on-chain payments for retail users. It can also be transferred to any Ethereum mainnet address, enabling broader use across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and blockchain-based platforms.

The company confirmed that the reserves will consist of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasuries, consistent with the requirements set out in the recently passed GENIUS Act, a federal law that established clear standards for payment stablecoins.

The GENIUS Act was a key enabler for the launch, O'Reilly said. “It gives a clear regulatory framework for what reserves should look like and how they should be managed. That's good for the industry and made this the right time for us to bring a product to market.”

Coin issuance and reserve values will be disclosed daily on Fidelity's website, and the company will also publish regular third-party attestations verifying the reserves. Fidelity will manage the coin's reserves through its in-house investment advisor, Fidelity Management & Research. 

FIDD will initially launch on Ethereum, but Fidelity said it may explore expanding to additional blockchains or layer-2 networks in the future.

Fidelity's entrance into the stablecoin market puts it in direct competition with crypto-native issuers such as Circle (USDC) and Tether USDT$0.9988, which together dominate a market now worth over $308 billion. T

ether unveiled on Tuesday that it is making its move into the U.S. market with the launch of USAT, a dollar-backed token

O'Reilly said the new stablecoin also positions Fidelity to support a broader range of onchain products down the line. “Having a stablecoin within our ecosystem opens the door for other financial services to be built onchain, by us and others. It becomes a building block for more efficient infrastructure,” he said.

The launch adds to Fidelity's growing list of digital asset offerings, which include crypto custody, trading, a retail-facing Fidelity Crypto app, and a crypto IRA product introduced last year.

Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture

Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale.

What to know: 

Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token.

The ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

Speculative capital is increasingly flowing out of cryptocurrency markets and into other emerging technologies including artificial intelligence and robotics, according to research company Delphi Digital.

Last year's underperformance of most altcoin sectors shows that crypto is no longer the “default destination” for speculative capital seeking higher-risk opportunities, wrote Delphi Digital in a Wednesday X post. 

The trend illustrates that emerging tech opportunities may continue limiting investment into the wider cryptocurrency space, specifically from risk-hungry investors looking for the sectors with the highest risk-to-return profiles.

Market data supports the trend. While Bitcoin (BTC) has declined about 12% over the past year, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has gained roughly 13% over the same period, according to TradingView. Altcoins outside the top 10 tokens have fallen more sharply, down more than 30%.

While crypto investor capital is rotating into AI applications, the underperformance of the sector can also be attributed to uncertainty regarding monetary policy and cryptocurrency regulations, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.

“Another key factor is the repricing of Fed rate cuts, with markets now pricing an elevated terminal rate of around 3.8% over the next five years, which tightens liquidity conditions for risk assets,” Barthere told Cointelegraph.

“At the same time, political gridlock around the CLARITY bill has weighed on sentiment, adding an additional crypto-specific headwind alongside broader macro pressures,” Barthere added.

The crypto market structure bill suffered another setback this week after the US Senate Agriculture Committee delayed a scheduled markup for its version of the bill to Thursday from Tuesday after the US was hit by a severe winter storm, Cointelegraph reported on Monday.

Robotics investments rise as VC crypto interest sinks at the end of 2025

Investment is accelerating into robotics startups, which raised a cumulative $13.8 billion during 2025, up from $7.8 billion in 2024 and exceeding their previous record year of $13.1 billion raised in 2021, according to CrunchBase data.

Venture capitalists remained active in crypto, as VC funding rose to $18.2 billion across 902 deals in 2025, up about 80% from $10.1 billion raised across 1,548 deals in 2024, according to data aggregator Rootdata.

Still, investments significantly slowed at the end of the year, from $3.1 billion across 67 deals in November to $700 million across 59 deals in December, a 77% monthly decline. 

The slowdown came after the record $19 billion crypto market crash at the beginning of October, following US President Donald Trump's threat to escalate tariffs on Chinese goods.

It marked the largest liquidation event on record, after the $9.9 billion liquidation in April 2021, which was contributed to by the initial rumours of a broad Anti Money Laundering crackdown, according to Coinglass data.

GRAND FORKS — A Grand Forks detective advises residents to be cautious when communicating with anyone online who instructs them to transfer gift cards or Bitcoin, no matter what reason they're given.

"Anytime somebody's asking for payment in Bitcoin or gift cards, you're being scammed," Det. Todd Riedinger said.

He believes when dealing with people through social media, text, email or phone call, complete vigilance is necessary. He feels people assume they aren't being scammed until after an incident has already occurred. Instead, he said, it's best to go into the situation assuming it's a scam until proven otherwise.

"People, in general, just need to be aware that scams are happening," Riedinger said. "Anytime somebody's asking you to transfer money — regardless of what type of money it is, gift cards, bitcoin or whatever — you have a high chance that you're being scammed, and there's a high chance you're not going to get that money back."

During 
    
      a Jan. 12 Grand Forks City Council meeting
    
      , Riedinger shared his concerns as a financial crimes investigator, saying that since October 2022, Grand Forks residents have lost $466,803 to bitcoin cryptocurrency scams. Within less than a week of the council meeting, the number climbed to $474,803, though law enforcement later got a $2,000 transaction canceled.

It's rare that money taken through these scams is returned, Riedinger said, because it's difficult to trace the path of the money once converted to bitcoin. 

Scammers instruct people to deposit cash into bitcoin ATMs located in Grand Forks businesses, giving them the information for existing accounts. Accounts are anonymous, to a degree, and once funds are inside, they can be transferred to a number of other accounts before being withdrawn — often by another victim, who is unknowingly participating in covering the suspect's trail, according to Riedinger.

Law enforcement usually only learns about these crimes after the fact, when tens of thousands of dollars may have been lost.

"The damage is already done," Riedinger said.

In the most recent case, he noted it could have been worse. A 71-year-old victim was planning to send a total of $20,000, after being convinced his bank was stealing from him. He felt he needed to withdraw his money and convert it to bitcoin. An employee at a local business that houses a bitcoin ATM contacted law enforcement after observing the man at the ATM, and police were able to explain to him that he was lied to.

North Dakota passed legislation in 2025 that put a $2,000 daily limit on bitcoin ATMs, which Riedinger hoped would mitigate the scam issue. Still, he said, scammers have since found ways to circumvent the limit. Riedinger is advocating for a required ID scan that will alert someone the account they're trying to deposit money into belongs to someone else. Ideally, it would ensure they can't deposit more than $2,000 in one day.

"If that's what we have to live with — that our victim is still going to lose $2,000, but they're not going to be able to send $20,000 in one shot — I can live with that," Riedinger said.

He hopes to see additional legislation go through in the 2027 session but, in the meantime, he at least wants the loophole closed in Grand Forks. Riedinger encourages people to share information and experiences with their loved ones, and says any business owner who wants to speak with him about bitcoin ATMs is welcome to reach out.

Bitcoin and other scams rely on fear tactics. Scammers tell people they'll lose all their money if they don't act immediately, eliciting panic. Another common scam occurs when someone receives a call that says they failed to show up for jury duty and a warrant exists for their arrest. They're told they'll be arrested if they don't pay a bond.

"They really brainwash the victims into believing this, even though it doesn't make any sense that a sheriff's office would want bitcoin," Riedinger said.

Almost every victim he's spoken to after an incident says the signs were there and alarm bells were ringing in their head. The situation didn't seem right, but the scammer made the situation feel urgent and serious, so logic went out the window.

Gift card scams operate similarly, and are also used because they're difficult to trace, since scammers sell gift card information to an innocent third party rather than using it themselves, Riedinger said. Targets for these scams are often the elderly, because they're more likely to have thousands of dollars in their bank accounts and have faith that people are not trying to take advantage of them.

"(Scammers) prey on the people who still have hope and faith in humanity that somebody wouldn't willingly try to bleed you dry of everything you've worked for," Riedinger said. "But they will."

Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained 2.1% and 3.5% respectively, as investors await the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision Wednesday afternoon.

Bitcoin is changing hands for $89,842, about level with where it was a week ago, according to data from crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. And Ethereum regained $3,000 for the first time since last week, trading for around $3,026 after having risen 2.1% in the past seven days.

With just hours to go before the Fed's first interest rate decision of the year, the CME FedWatch Tool shows that futures traders estimate there's a 97% chance that interest rates will remain unchanged.

Traders on prediction market Myriad, owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, put just a 33% chance on the the Fed cutting rates by more than 25bps before July.

"While a ‘hold' at 3.5%–3.75% is a statistical certainty, crypto traders should be wary of a ‘narrative whipsaw,'" Jummy Xue, co-founder and chief operating officer of institutional crypto management firm Axis, told Decrypt. "The focus is no longer on the cost of capital, but on the Fed's sensitivity to a 4.4% unemployment rate."

At the start of January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a December unemployment rate of 4.4%, which was little changed from the revised November 4.5% rate.

"If [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell] emphasizes labor market resilience over cooling inflation, he is effectively taking a March rate cut off the table," Xue added. "For Bitcoin, which has thrived on the expectation of continuous easing, such a pivot could transform a ‘neutral' meeting into a medium-term bearish catalyst."

In the current economic environment, Xue expects traders to primarily rely on the debasement trade. It's a strategy that assumes governments will keep increasing the supply of money and erode the value of cash. In response, investors gravitate towards less easily diluted assets like commodities, real estate, and cryptocurrencies.

Aurelie Barthere, a principal research analyst at onchain analytics firm Nansen, told Decrypt that Powell seemed concerned about job market weakness at the December meeting and he expects that to hold.

"Even with the U.S. economy accelerating into first half of 2026, boosted by fiscal, the labor market has kept cooling," she said, "on the demand side, not just the supply side."

But more comments from Powell on unemployment isn't necessarily a bad thing, she added, pointing to overnight index swap markets pricing in less than two rate cuts after Powell leaves the Fed in June.

"If Powell's tone remains as dovish as in December, the pricing of rate cuts could be increased and brought forward before June (March and April)," Barthere said.

Digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum tend to benefit when investors expect interest rates to fall because lower rates reduce returns on cash and bonds and encourage risk-taking across markets. Conversely, when rate cuts are delayed or taken off the table, crypto prices come under pressure as traders shift capital back towards yield-bearing assets.

But Wednesday's interest rate decision isn't the only macroeconomic event on the horizon.

Analysts at Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital flagged that traders are also bracing for a Friday, Jan. 30 funding deadline to keep the U.S. out of another government shutdown, uncertainty about the Senate's next move on the CLARITY Act and volatile currency markets.

The First-tier Tribunal (General Regulatory Chamber) has allowed an appeal by Ashley Smith, acting for Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, requiring the Environment Agency to disclose declarations of interest forms submitted by Deputy Directors and Area Directors.

The request, made in January 2024, sought copies of declarations of interest forms for Area Directors and Regional Directors from 1 January 2019 to the date of the request. The Agency interpreted this as covering Deputy Directors (including Area Directors) and Directors. Whilst the Agency accepted it should disclose information relating to the more senior Directors, it refused disclosure for Deputy Directors, relying on the personal data exemption under section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

The Information Commissioner's Decision Notice upheld this position regarding Deputy Directors, concluding that whilst the appellant was pursuing a legitimate interest, the rights and freedoms of Deputy Directors prevailed in the balancing test required under data protection legislation.

The Tribunal conducted a thorough review of the role and responsibilities of Deputy Directors, examining job descriptions and the Agency's own submissions. The evidence revealed that Deputy Directors hold relatively senior positions with significant responsibilities, including accountability for delivering targets and outcomes in their areas, managing multi-million-pound budgets, leading teams of hundreds of employees, handling major incidents, and maintaining relationships with influential stakeholders including politicians and local government bodies.

The Agency had argued that its internal procedures for managing conflicts of interest were sufficient to satisfy the legitimate interests being pursued, and that disclosure was therefore not necessary. The Tribunal rejected this argument, finding that internal procedures alone could not satisfy the public interest in transparency and accountability. Knowing that procedures exist is fundamentally different from knowing whether any given Deputy Director has an actual or potential conflict and what that conflict might be.

The Tribunal agreed with the Commissioner that the appellant was pursuing legitimate interests in seeking to ascertain whether relevant Agency staff have conflicts of interest and whether such conflicts are managed appropriately. This was particularly pertinent given the Agency's role in investigating water and sewerage companies.

On the crucial question of necessity, the Tribunal found that disclosure of the disputed information was reasonably necessary and proportionate. The Agency's argument that internal oversight by more senior staff constituted a 'lesser measure' was insufficient to meet the legitimate interests in public transparency and accountability.

Regarding the balancing test, the Tribunal departed from the Commissioner's approach. The Decision Notice had concluded that Deputy Directors, being less senior than Directors, would have lesser responsibilities and decision-making powers, and would therefore expect their declarations to remain private. However, the Tribunal found this analysis flawed. The actual role of Deputy Directors involved substantial responsibility, decision-making authority on potentially nationally significant matters, and explicit accountability to the public.

The Agency had not provided evidence demonstrating that Deputy Directors would have an expectation of privacy. Against this, several factors pointed towards an expectation of potential disclosure: the seniority and nature of their roles, the fact that the Agency is a public authority subject to FOIA, their accountability to the public, and the fact that their names already appeared on the publicly available organogram.

The Tribunal found no evidence that disclosure would cause unwarranted damage or distress to Deputy Directors. The Agency had not adduced any witness statements from affected individuals expressing concern about disclosure.

The Agency argued that disclosure would be neither fair nor transparent because its privacy notice did not address how declarations of interest would be processed. The Tribunal was not persuaded. Critically, the Agency accepted that disclosure of Directors' declarations would be fair and transparent despite the same privacy notice applying. The only material difference was the individuals' expectations, which the Tribunal had already found were not established.

The Tribunal observed that if inadequacies in a privacy notice could be relied upon to prevent disclosure under FOIA, this would effectively circumvent the legislation. Public authorities should have privacy notices that cater for potential disclosure of employees' personal data under FOIA.

The Tribunal clarified that the request covered all staff who held the relevant roles at any time during the period specified, not merely those in post at the time of the request. The Agency had initially misinterpreted the scope, and the Tribunal considered it remiss not to have sought clarification under section 16.

The Tribunal also noted that FOIA provides an entitlement to 'information' rather than specific documents, so the appellant was not entitled to copies of the actual forms themselves.

Importantly, the Tribunal recognised that declarations of interest might contain personal data of third parties other than Deputy Directors (such as relatives or friends mentioned in declarations). The Tribunal's findings regarding expectations and the balancing test applied only to Deputy Directors. The substituted decision notice permits the Agency to withhold personal data of other third parties under section 40(2).

The appeal was allowed. The Tribunal issued a substituted decision notice requiring the Agency to disclose declarations of interest for Deputy Directors and Area Directors (in addition to Directors as already ordered by the Commissioner), subject to the ability to redact personal data of third parties other than Deputy Directors and Directors. The disclosure must be made within 35 days, with failure to comply potentially being dealt with as contempt of court.

Ethereum's price action has turned quiet again. After recent volatility, ETH has slipped back into consolidation, frustrating traders looking for follow-through in either direction. Yet despite the lack of momentum, price behavior itself is beginning to tell a more constructive story.

Rather than extending lower, Ethereum continues to hold a crucial support zone, even after briefly slipping below short-term moving averages. This kind of price behavior often signals stabilization, not weakness, especially when downside attempts fail to attract sustained selling pressure.

So what's next for the ETH price? When will it break the resistance and rise above $3500?

Ethereum Price is Holding, Not Broken

On higher timeframes, Ethereum has managed to defend an area that previously acted as demand during prior pullbacks. While ETH has not reclaimed aggressive resistance levels yet, it has also avoided a deeper breakdown, suggesting sellers are struggling to push the price meaningfully lower.

This is reinforced by Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin, as shared by popular analyst Michael van de Poppe. After briefly dipping below short-term momentum levels, ETH/BTC failed to sustain trade below ~0.052 BTC, quickly reclaiming that zone and compressing back into its prior range. ETH/BTC is not printing lower lows. Instead, price is consolidating above a defended support band, signaling that selling pressure is being absorbed rather than extended.

Supply Dynamics Largely Evolving as Price Remains Choppy

The weakening downside in ETH/BTC aligns with broader Ethereum supply dynamics. Ethereum's active wallet count has reached a record 175.5 million, with 5.16 million new wallets added in 2026 alone, pointing to expanding participation even as the relative price remains compressed. At the same time, liquid ETH supply continues to decline. More ETH is moving into staking and long-term holdings, reducing the amount of supply that can rotate quickly back into Bitcoin during periods of uncertainty.

Large treasury accumulation reinforces this trend. BitMine Immersion now holds approximately 4.24 million ETH, or about 3.52% of the total Ethereum supply, after adding 40,302 ETH in a single day. This type of accumulation is insensitive to short-term ETH/BTC fluctuations and removes supply from active rotation.

Together, these factors help explain why ETH/BTC has struggled to break down meaningfully. With less ETH available to rotate and increasing long-duration holding, downside continuation against Bitcoin is losing strength, even without a decisive upside breakout.

Institutional Absorption Adds Another Layer

One of the clearest contributors to ETH's tightening supply comes from BitMine Immersion's treasury accumulation. The firm now holds approximately 4.24 million ETH, after adding 40,302 ETH in a single day, bringing its total exposure to roughly 3.52% of Ethereum's circulating supply.

This is not tactical positioning. At current prices, BitMine's ETH holdings represent a multi-billion-dollar balance-sheet allocation, accumulated without waiting for upside momentum or breakout confirmation. In short, Ethereum is not on exchanges, is not rotating against Bitcoin and is not responding to short-term volatility. 

When combined with declining exchange balances and rising staking participation, BitMine's accumulation reinforces a key price dynamic: Ethereum's relative supply is shrinking at current ETH/BTC levels, even as price remains compressed.

What This Means for Ethereum's Next Move

Ethereum's price has remained stable because selling pressure is easing while long-term supply continues to tighten. Exchange balances are falling, staking participation is rising, and active wallets have reached 175.5 million, showing broader ownership even as price stays range-bound. At the same time, large holders such as BitMine Immersion have absorbed significant supply, now holding over 4.2 million ETH, reducing the amount available for quick selling.

These dynamics explain why Ethereum has struggled to move lower despite recent volatility. While immediate upside may remain limited, renewed demand could meet a tighter market. In that case, ETH could test $3,450–$3,500, with a stronger move opening the path toward $3,700–$3,800. Downside risk increases only if ETH slips below $3,250.

FAQs

Markets often lag fundamentals. When supply tightens without a clear demand trigger, price can stay range-bound until a catalyst forces repricing, such as macro shifts or renewed inflows.

Extended consolidation usually compresses volatility, increasing the probability of a sharper move later. Traders often see this as a setup phase rather than a signal to exit.

Long-term holders and entities accumulating off exchanges benefit most, as reduced liquid supply can amplify upside moves once demand accelerates.

A sustained ETH/BTC breakout, changes in macro liquidity, or increased institutional inflows could act as catalysts by shifting demand dynamics against a tightening supply backdrop.

Bitcoin BTC$89,487.41 traded little changed Wednesday after gaining yesterday as the dollar weakened. Ether ETH$3,018.11 gave up some of its gains.

Instead, advances came from other parts of the altcoin market. Hyperliquid's native HYPE token extended gains, adding 11% since midnight UTC, and Solana liquid staking token JTO$0.3888 surged 32%, its biggest one-day gain since December 2023, according to CoinDesk data.

The Dollar Index (DXY) fell to a four-year low on Tuesday, crucially below a trendline dating back to 2011 despite an attempt by President Donald Trump to reassure markets by saying the dollar is "doing great," and that he is not "concerned."

Dollar strength or weakness has a direct impact on the crypto market because the majority of assets are traded against the U.S. currency. The inverse correlation was a key talking point in the previous bear market, when the dollar rose by 22% between November 2021 and October 2022 while bitcoin lost more than 70% of its value.

Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture

Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale.

What to know: 

Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token.

The ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

Altcoins including Hyperliquid, River, and Pump.fun have seen a sustained rally over the past week, notching double-digit gains over the period.

Hyperliquid is the clear winner among the top 100 coins by market cap, surging 65% over the past week, according to CoinGecko data. Pump.fun, Canton and River and followed closely with 33.6%, 23.3% and 21.8% gains respectively.

The surge in altcoins comes as Bitcoin consolidates between $95,000 and $81,000, which has seen the top crypto's dominance form a local top around 59.94 to 59.50. Bitcoin is currently trading at $89,373, up 1.9% on the day, per CoinGecko data.

Meanwhile, the past week has seen altcoin dominance explode from roughly 6.7% to 7.06%.

“Traders are looking for quick wins in projects that have solid fundamentals,” Rachel Lin, CEO and Co-founder of SynFutures, told Decrypt.

As a result, users on prediction market Myriad, owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, flipped bullish on Pump.fun's outlook Wednesday after a week of bearish sentiment. Myriad traders now place a 56% chance on PUMP's next move taking it to $0.005 rather than $0.001.

Interestingly, a market on Hyperliquid's outlook that resolved when it hit $30 Tuesday also showed a late flip to bullish sentiment after a week in which bears dominated.

Myriad users expect Hyperliquid's airdrop will occur before Pump.fun's, assigning a 54% chance to this outcome.

The trend signals where speculative capital is moving during a period of macro uncertainty, revealing a shift in risk appetite beneath the market's surface.

The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies, has trended lower from nearly 110 in January 2025 to 95.70 this week. This dollar softness reinforces expectations of looser financial conditions.

“The value of the dollar is great," U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox News Tuesday.

Most people don't realize what Trump just said:

For 12+ months, the US Dollar has been in a sharp decline, falling -10% in 2025 in its worst year since 2017.

Minutes ago, for the first time, President Trump commented on the decline in the USD:

“The U.S. dollar's relative oversupply compared to other assets is manifesting in depreciation and sector rotations,” Lacie Zhang, Market Analyst at Bitget Wallet, told Decrypt. “This potential asset inflation underscores the need for diversified portfolios to capitalize on these inflows.”

Zhang noted that each altcoin's surge is driven by a distinct catalyst.

“River benefits from capital inflows and high short-term trading volumes, while Hyperliquid gains from strong silver trading activity, boosting project revenues,” the analyst said. Pump.fun's role as meme coin infrastructure, meanwhile, “signals renewed interest in the meme sector, encouraging projects to focus on real utility and community-driven momentum.”

Such selectivity suggests a maturing market, SynFutures' Lin said, noting that, “A few winners are emerging, but there are so many more tokens than before that liquidity for tokens that don't capture mindshare won't accrue value.”

Analysts see a phased recovery forming for the altcoin sector in the coming months.

“Following Q4 2025's corrections, the altcoin market is in a bottoming phase in Q1 2026, with opportunities for phased rebounds driven by improving sentiment and liquidity,” Zhang said. She emphasized that projects prioritizing fundamentals such as adoption and innovation will build the long-term resilience needed to navigate short-term volatility.

For now, the rally in select altcoins stands as a testament to capital seeking opportunity, even as the crypto market waits for Bitcoin to decisively reclaim its bullish momentum.

The United States has officially declared its ambition to rule the crypto industry, as investors search for the best altcoins to buy. The White House recently praised President Donald Trump for making the US the “crypto capital of the world.” 

But the real alpha lies in the pre-market. DeepSnitch AI presents an opportunity for those who want to make massive profits from the top altcoins in the market. 

With over $1,380,000 raised and a price up 145% to $0.03681, DeepSnitch AI is a 200x presale gem.

In a recent official communication on X, the White House declared “promises made, promises kept,” celebrating the end of the previous administration's “crusade to crush crypto.” The centerpiece is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which the administration casts as the key to making the United States the “global leader in cryptocurrency.”

Moreover, the machinery of government is aligning with this pro-crypto stance. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have announced a joint event to discuss “harmonization between the two agencies” and their efforts to deliver on the President's promises. 

Investors searching for the best altcoins to buy in 2026 should consider DeepSnitch AI.

In the hunt for high-upside crypto projects, DeepSnitch AI stands alone as the investment with the highest potential. The project has already raised more than $1,380,000, and the token price has surged to $0.03681, delivering a 145% gain to early buyers. But the reason investors are projecting a massive 200x return is that it is one of the few projects that can stay relevant even in bear markets. 

Moreover, the team's strategic decision to postpone the public launch is a game-changer that sets DeepSnitch AI apart from every other asset on the market. By delaying the listing, the team has created a closed information loop accessible only to current holders. 

Investors can also make passive income from this presale with the uncapped, dynamic rewards pool. More than 31 million tokens have been staked, and this is an opportunity to earn rewards while waiting for the massive launch. 

While other coins are subject to daily market crashes, DeepSnitch AI is building value that could unleash 200x gains for those who position themselves now.



Solana ($SOL) is one of the contenders among the best altcoins to buy, but its recent performance suggests it may be cooling off. The token has seen a price decline of 2% in the last seven days as of January 27th, underperforming the market. 



More concerning is the trading volume, which has crashed by 50% in the last 24 hours to $3.5 billion. This sharp drop in activity signals a potential pause in the coin's growth engine. Despite the slump, fundamental developments continue. Mantle recently launched its MNT token on Solana via a new cross-chain portal, enhancing liquidity for the multichain ecosystem. 

Acurast is one of the most promising altcoins of the week. The token has recorded a price increase of 103% in the last seven days as of January 27th, crushing the global market and its Ethereum ecosystem peers.

But the sentiment for Acurast is currently bullish, although the Fear & Greed Index remains in fear territory at 29. Price predictions forecast the token to hit $0.4667 by the end of 2026, a further 117% increase. 

While these numbers are impressive, buying after a 100% pump is risky. On the other hand, DeepSnitch AI offers the upside of Acurast without the risk of buying a local top.

The US is becoming the crypto capital, and DeepSnitch AI is the capital multiplier you need. This is the top pick among the best altcoins to buy.

It is the wealth creation event of 2026. And with the promo codes, you have a better chance to enter this massive opportunity and ride the 200x potential to the moon. Investors are accumulating, don't be left out.

DeepSnitch AI is the top contender for 200x returns among the best altcoins to buy.

The GENIUS Act creates a clearer regulatory framework, boosting institutional confidence in promising altcoins like DeepSnitch AI.

Acurast was considered undervalued before its recent 103% rally. Now, investors looking for the next big move are rotating into DeepSnitch AI.

Silicon Valley's dominance is no longer guaranteed, and its collapse is now a conceivable outcome rather than a fringe thought experiment. That is the warning from Balaji Srinivasan, former Chief Technology Officer of Coinbase.

The former Coinbase executive argues that mounting political risk and structural policy shifts could reduce the Valley “from one to zero” within the next decade, while crypto-native networks emerge as its natural successors.

Srinivasan outlined a scenario in which Silicon Valley's core economic engine, venture capital, breaks down under the weight of:

Central to his thesis is California's proposed 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, a ballot initiative that would impose a one-time 5% excise tax on individuals with net worth exceeding $1 billion.

“There is a scenario in which Silicon Valley could literally go to zero in the next ten years,” Srinivasan wrote. “The successors would be China and the Internet: namely Chinese tech companies and Internet-based crypto protocols, because those have embedded political protection in a way Silicon Valley simply doesn't.”

Srinivasan argues the tax strikes directly at the “power law” economics that underpin startup funding. Venture capital depends on the possibility of extreme upside—rare, outsized exits that compensate for widespread failure.

Remove the prospect of billionaire outcomes, he contends, and the incentive structure collapses.

“No prospect of billionaires means no angel funding means no Silicon Valley,” Srinivasan said, warning that even the attempt to pass such measures could chill risk-taking and early-stage investment.

Legal firms, including Baker Botts, have flagged extensive constitutional vulnerabilities in the proposal. These range from Dormant Commerce Clause violations to concerns about retroactivity and takings.

Still, PwC estimates the initiative could raise roughly $100 billion if approved in November 2026. This signals a rising political appetite for taxing concentrated tech wealth, despite legal uncertainty.

Beyond taxation, Srinivasan frames the threat as a broader erosion of the political “platform” tech companies rely on, comparable to a failing operating system.

He points to growing instability around property rights, stock compensation, visas, IPO pathways, and regulatory treatment of emerging technologies such as AI and crypto.

The former Coinbase executive argues that hostility now comes from both sides of the political spectrum. For parts of the left, tech represents concentrated capital and inequality; for parts of the right, it symbolizes globalization and cultural displacement.

This dual pressure, Srinivasan says, leaves the industry politically isolated.

While some founders have relocated to Texas, Miami, Dubai, or Singapore, he warns most companies remain deeply embedded across California, Delaware, and New York—jurisdictions he describes as increasingly hostile to concentrated tech power.

Yet Srinivasan does not predict the end of technological progress—only the end of Silicon Valley's monopoly over it.

In his view, tech is already decentralizing. Hardware manufacturing has shifted toward China. Unicorn startups now operate in more than 400 cities globally. Open-source AI models are reducing reliance on centralized talent hubs.

Crypto, he argues, is uniquely positioned to thrive in this environment. Unlike traditional tech firms, crypto protocols operate globally, are not anchored to a single jurisdiction, and derive resilience from decentralization.

Srinivasan likens the moment to an extinction event. Silicon Valley, he suggests, resembles the dinosaurs, dominant but fragile.

Crypto and internet-native networks, by contrast, are the mammals: smaller, undervalued, but structurally adapted to survive political shock.

As California's wealth tax proposal advances toward a 2026 vote, the question is more about where and in what form its next chapter will be written, rather than whether tech will continue.

One of the most remarkable properties associated with Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) is superfluidity, in which the system exhibits zero viscosity and flows without dissipation. The superfluid phase has been observed in wide-ranging bosonic systems spanning naturally occurring quantum fluids, such as liquid helium, to engineered platforms such as bilayer excitons and cold atom systems1,2,3,4. Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid—termed a supersolid5,6,7,8. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained unknown9,10,11. Here we report observation of a superfluid-to-insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magnetoexcitons. Mapping the transport behaviour of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid on increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low-temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase.

(a) Counterflow conductance (GCF, black trace) and parallel flow conductance (GPF, red trace) as a function of Δν measured at T = 0.3. (b) Counterflow conductance as a function of Δν measured at T = 0.3 K and 1.5 K. The Δν-regime of the exciton superfluid (ES) and exciton insulator (EI) are marked by red and blue shaded background, respectively. The superfluid corresponds to a large counterflow conductance, whereas it is insulating in parallel flow measurement. On the other hand, the exciton insulator displays zero conductance in both parallel flow and counterflow measurements. However, the insulator undergoes a reentrant transition into a superfluid phase with increasing temperature. (c) Counterflow and parallel flow conductance, GCF and GPF (black and red traces), as a function of temperature measured at Δν = −0.57, where the low temperature ground state is an exciton insulator. (d) Counterflow and parallel flow conductance, GCF and GPF (black and red traces), as a function of temperature measured at Δν = −0.44, where the low temperature ground state is an exciton superfluid. All measurements are performed in a Corbino-shaped sample (C1) at ∣νtotal∣ = 1 and B = 29 T. (e) GCF and GPF as a function of Δν near the low-temperature transition induced by Δν. A peak in GPF, marked by the vertical arrow, is observed near the transition. (f) GPF as a function of T measured at Δν = −0.57. Near the EI-to-ES transition with increasing temperature, GPF exhibits a small peak, which is marked by the black vertical arrow.

A new study led by Colgate Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy Cosmin Ilie, working with Jillian Paulin '23 of the University of Pennsylvania, Andreea Petric of the Space Telescope Science Institute, and Katherine Freese of the University of Texas at Austin, proposes a single idea that could address three major mysteries from the universe's earliest era. The researchers suggest that dark stars may help explain the appearance of unexpectedly bright "blue monster" galaxies, the presence of very massive black holes at extremely early times, and the strange objects known as "little red dots" seen in images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

The earliest stars formed in regions dominated by dark matter, specifically at the centers of small dark matter structures called microhalos. Several hundred million light-years after the Big Bang, clouds made of hydrogen and helium cooled enough to begin collapsing under their own gravity. This process led to the birth of the first stars and marked the start of the cosmic dawn, a formative period in the universe's history.

During this time, conditions may have allowed a rare type of star to form. These stars could be powered not only by nuclear fusion, but also by energy released when dark matter particles annihilate. Known as dark stars, such objects could grow to enormous sizes and may naturally evolve into the seeds that later become supermassive black holes.

JWST Reveals Unexpected Early Galaxies

JWST has now observed the most distant objects ever studied, offering an unprecedented look at the early universe. These observations have challenged long standing theories about how the first stars and galaxies formed. One of the most surprising findings is a large population of galaxies known as "blue monsters." These galaxies are extremely bright, very compact, and contain little to no dust.

Before JWST, no simulations or theoretical models predicted that galaxies with these properties should exist so early in cosmic history. Their discovery has forced astronomers to reconsider how quickly stars and galaxies could have formed.

Overmassive Black Holes and Little Red Dots

JWST data have also intensified an ongoing mystery involving supermassive black holes. Some of the earliest observed galaxies appear to host black holes that are far larger than expected for their age. Explaining how the seeds of these larger-than-expected supermassive black holes (SMBHs) formed so quickly remains a major challenge.

In addition, JWST has revealed a new category of compact objects known as "little red dots" (LRDs). These dust-free sources date back to cosmic dawn and are unusual because they emit little to no X-ray radiation, something astronomers did not anticipate based on existing models.

Why Current Models Fall Short

Taken together, the blue monster galaxies, early overmassive black holes, and little red dots point to serious gaps in pre-JWST theories of early galaxy and black hole formation. The findings suggest that widely accepted models need substantial updates to account for what JWST is now seeing.

"Some of the most significant mysteries posed by the JWST's cosmic dawn data are in fact features of the dark star theory," Ilie said.

Growing Evidence for Dark Stars

Although dark stars have not yet been confirmed through direct observation, the new study strengthens the case for their existence. It builds on photometric and spectroscopic dark star candidates identified in two separate PNAS studies published in 2023 and 2025, respectively.

The authors describe in detail how dark stars could account for the properties of blue monster galaxies, little red dots, and early galaxies hosting massive black holes. The paper also presents the most recent spectroscopic analysis, reporting evidence for distinctive helium absorption features in the spectrum of JADES-GS-13-0. A similar feature had previously been identified in JADES-GS-14-0.

Why Dark Stars Matter

Dark stars are among the most intriguing theoretical objects in modern astrophysics. If confirmed, they could offer a way to directly probe the properties of dark matter particles. This would complement ongoing efforts to detect dark matter in laboratory experiments on Earth, whether through direct detection or particle production, and could help connect cosmic observations with fundamental physics.

This lifeform's extraordinary biology could hold the key to anti-aging breakthroughs.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Homo sapiens have remarkable regenerative abilities—wounds heal, bone fractures “thread” back together, and some organs can even regrow from devastating injury—but none of these biological bonafides compares to the healing power of the humble starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis). 

Located along the eastern coast of the U.S., with a few introduced populations scattered along the western U.S. coast and the southeast coast of Britain, this sea anemone is a member of the sea-dwelling phylum Cnidaria, which is well-known for its full-body regenerative abilities—so much so that some animals in this phylum, such as the jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, are functionally immortal. Because of this ability to seemingly defy the aging process, these animals have figured prominently in anti-aging research.

Now, in a study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers from the University of Vienna have possibly identified small, multi-potent cells in scarlet sea anemones that basically allow cnidarians to continually drink from the proverbial fountain of youth. In humans, stems cells allow limited regeneration of certain cells in our body (which is why they're central to the exploration of anti-aging therapies), however, other animals display much greater, whole-body regenerative abilities compared to us humans. 

Because it can reproduce asexually (though it can multiply sexually as well) and can be raised easily in laboratory conditions, N. vectensis has quickly become the go-to species for studying the immortal abilities of cnidarians more broadly (a concept known as a “model organism”). While scientists have known that the scarlet sea anemone shows little to no signs of aging, they haven't been able to identify stem cells that drive this unending youth mainly due to their extremely small size.

University of Vienna's Ulrich Technau, the senior author of this new study, and his team used a new method called “single cell genomics” in the hunt for these missing stem cells. The scientists were able to discern the stem cell lineage of certain cells developed based on transcriptome profiles, which are a collection of mRNA transcripts. 

“By combining single-cell gene expression analyses and transgenesis,” University of Vienna's Andreas Denner, the first author of the study, said in a press statement. “We have now been able to identify a large population of cells in the sea anemone that form differentiated cells such as nerve cells and glandular cells and are therefore candidates for multipotent stem cells.”

The team looked specifically at highly-conserved (i.e. unchanged via evolution) genes nanos and piwi, which are regulatory proteins involved in stem cell differentiation as well as gametogenesis—the process of creating germ cells and gametes (sperm and eggs). When the team mutated the nanos2 gene using CRISPR gene scissors, they discovered that this protein was necessary for forming germ cells as well as somatic cells and likely appeared in nature around  600 million years ago. 

Now that scientists have enticing stem cell candidates, future studies will delve deeper into the mechanisms that make cnidarians, such as the scarlet sea anemone, adept fighters against the ravages of aging that afflict nearly every other species on the planet.

Researchers have unveiled plans to investigate the mysterious production of ‘dark oxygen' on the sea floor — large amounts of the gas that seem to be coming from a region too deep for sunlight to power photosynthesis.

The discovery of the oxygen 4,000 metres below the surface of the Pacific Ocean was first published in 2024 in Nature Geoscience1. The team behind it is embarking on a fresh series of studies to verify their findings and establish what could be causing the phenomenon.

At a press conference in London last week, the researchers unveiled a suite of instruments specifically designed to look at oxygen production, either on the sea floor or in laboratory experiments that reproduce deep-sea conditions, including 400 atmospheres of pressure. The Nippon Foundation, a Tokyo-based charity, is funding the follow-up studies with a grant of US$5.2 million.

By May, project scientists will travel to the Clarion–Clipperton Zone — the region between Hawaii and Mexico where the original discovery was made — aboard the research vessel Nautilus. Speaking at the event, team leader Andrew Sweetman, a sea-floor ecologist at the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban, UK, described two probes — each with different capabilities — designed to land on the sea floor to take measurements and samples.

“We will be taking landers that are specifically built to look at dark-oxygen production,” he says. The probes will have pH sensors to measure the concentration of protons in the seawater — high levels of which would suggest that water molecules are splitting, and that molecular oxygen is forming. The landers that made the original discovery could not measure pH because they were not designed to detect or study oxygen production, says Sweetman.

The original study found dark oxygen in a region containing polymetallic nodules, ancient nuggets of valuable metals such as manganese and cobalt that form on ocean floors over millions of years. This led the team to speculate that these nodules, which look like large black truffles, could be catalysts for water-splitting, similar to those used to produce hydrogen gas in electrochemical cells. But this is not the only way that oxygen could be produced deep beneath the surface — microbes could play a part.

The new suite of experiments is designed to both confirm the team's original findings, and to investigate what could be producing dark oxygen. “Our primary culprits are electrochemistry and biology. Perhaps they work separately, perhaps they work in tandem,” said team member Jeff Marlow, a geobiologist at Boston University in Massachusetts, at the press conference. “We will build microscale maps of microbes, minerals and metabolic activity in nodules,” he added.

Chemist Franz Geiger at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, says he will conduct pressure-chamber experiments on polymetallic nodules retrieved from the sea floor to investigate the rocks' electrochemistry and examine their surfaces using special transmission electron microscopes that work in liquid cells. This tool will be able to map the chemical states of metals on the surface in the presence of saltwater.

Custom-built arrays of electrodes will measure voltage differences between hundreds of locations across a nodule, to see whether they could catalyse water splitting.

Eat more garlic to smell attractive? The surprising ways diet can shape your body scent

Beneath fancy perfumes and deodorants, our food choices may be quietly shaping our natural scent in unexpected ways

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Sushmita Pathak & Alex Sugiura

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

In late 2024 Nicola Coughlan, the actor famous for her work on Derry Girls and Bridgerton, was asked about her work with Ncuti Gatwa, who played the 15th Doctor on Doctor Who. Her reply was: “He's amazing—and he smells amazing.”

Look, I get it. How someone smells, whether it's good or bad, can leave a long-lasting impression. That's why we pour so much money into scented bath washes, deodorants and perfumes.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

But under all of those products remains our natural scent. And while factors such as illness and how often we bathe can affect that smell, so can food, according to a number of studies.

Freelance science journalist Sofia Quaglia has covered this research, and we spoke to her about the surprising ways what we eat can affect how we smell. Here's that conversation.

Thank you so much for joining us today. So is it, like, if I eat a lot of jelly beans, I'll start smelling sweet? [Laughs.]

Sofia Quaglia: [Laughs.] I don't think—no, it's not that clear-cut. So obviously, caveat here is that this is a very new field, and so we're only starting to collect data. We don't have that much data that we can really draw really, really good lines about, like, “Smelling sweet is because you've eaten sweet stuff,” or “Smelling sour is because you've eaten sour stuff.”

And in general it's not really that straightforward of a process, right, 'cause the food goes through our body and gets digested inside our gut. And then either we're smelling because our breath smells a certain way because of the volatile chemicals coming back up from our gut, or because they've gone through our bloodstream and we're sweating them out, right? So the sugars and the foods and the delicious jelly beans go through a lot of processes before they affect how we smell. [Laughs.]

Pierre-Louis: One of the things that I found surprising in your article was the work that researchers did on the way garlic makes bodies smell. Can you talk about that work?

Quaglia: Yeah, I love that. So obviously, we all love to eat garlic; it makes things super tasty. But then our breath doesn't smell exactly as delicious afterwards. [Laughs.] I know a lot of people wouldn't fancy a kiss with garlic-smelling breath. And so researchers—it's one of the reasons researchers targeted it, right? They're like, “Oh, it's the most annoying of the smells when you're, when you're smelling it on somebody's breath. Let's see what happens to body odor after garlic,” right?

And so the researchers actually had about 40 men wear some armpit pads—like, yeah, like, absorbent pads under their armpits—collecting their sweat for about 12 hours. And then they made some of them eat a little bit of garlic, some of them eat loads of garlic, and some of them take some, like, garlic supplements.

Then they had [about] 80 women rate the scent from those pads, which is kind of gross if you think about it too much. [Laughs.]

Pierre-Louis: Yeah, how do you sign up for that study? [Laughs.]

Quaglia: I have not. I did not sign up for this.

And then the women basically had to rate the men's smell, right, according to, like, subjective ratings that—of how they felt, whether they were pleasant and attractive or masculine and intense. So they filled out a survey.

And the findings suggested that the men with a little bit of garlic consumption weren't making these women react in any particular way, but those eating a lot of garlic were perceived as very sexy, so their rankings for sexiness went up. So the smell of garlic under the armpit was smelling good [Laughs], was smelling delicious, was smelling sexy.

The researchers themselves, I spoke to them when—after they conducted the study. They were quite confused, too. They were like, “We had to do this three times 'cause we didn't think the data made sense,” right? You would expect garlic to smell nasty under an armpit as well. So they were also confused and surprised, and they thought it was quite funny to have this data.

And they've actually thought long and hard about it, and their theory right now is that, you know, maybe—because garlic is, is a good food for your health, right? It's a healthy food. It has a lot of antioxidants. It has a lot of antimicrobial properties that improve people's health. Maybe that's what's making someone smell subconsciously more sexy. It's because, you know, we've evolved to select romantic partners or sexual partners that are healthy because of the way that evolution works and how our bodies are wired to think about, like, “Oh, we need to procreate.” So maybe that's what's going on? This evolutionary lens is how the scientists have been trying to explain it.

Pierre-Louis: So the solution is: eat a garlic-heavy diet, but really make sure to brush your teeth.

Quaglia: Exactly. Brush your teeth, and then just go around with your armpits kind of just, like ...

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Quaglia: Musty. [Laughs.]

Pierre-Louis: You can't see Sofia [Laughs], but she's lifting up her arms to, to illustrate her armpits to us.

But the garlic research did sort of fall in line with the broader research that suggested eating a lot of fruits and veggies tends to make us smell better, at least from a sweat perspective. It can be, depending on how gassy you are as a human, it could be hit or miss with your GI track and your breath. But when it comes to sweat in particular it does seem that, like, lots of fruit, lots of veg are pretty good for us.

Quaglia: Yeah, so while maybe our pee smells a little weird after we have asparagus or we can get a little gassy after some, some veggies, similar studies where they had kind of people wear sweat pads and stuff—I think this one was done in Australia—found that the men who were eating more fruits and vegetables were kind of smelling better. They were smelling more fruity, more floral, more sweet, and kind of more widely, yeah, the fruits and veg were making them more attractive to women who were smelling their scent.

And again, researchers kind of justify that by saying, “Okay, well, it's probably because, you know, veggies, fruits, they're healthy for our diet, they make our bodies healthy and strong, and so that's maybe what our body scent is then subconsciously communicating.”

But again, these are really small studies with small samples, so we don't have, like, loads of data. But all in all, it seems to be that there's a trend or a pattern here.

Pierre-Louis: Are there foods that—or things that we consume that may make us less appealing, like, smell less great?

Quaglia: Although there isn't a lot of data and we're just starting to see emerging trends, researchers have started to see a little bit of patterns on stuff that are making us smell a little bit less pleasant. So for instance, [some of] that same team that put the absorbent pads for garlic [Laughs], they also looked into whether meat makes us more attractive.

They had men who were either eating a lot of meat or a nonmeat diet for two weeks, and then they had, again, women rate their scents for pleasantness, attractiveness, masculinity and intensity. And the odor of the men who weren't eating the meat was, on average, rated more attractive, more pleasant and less intense.

And again, the researchers kind of had to rack their brains about this 'cause they were like, “Oh, but what—I mean, we, evolutionarily, we've always eaten meat. Why would that make us smell less pleasant?” This was not what they were expecting to find because meat is considered kind of, like, an important part of the human diet.

But the researchers also did know, you know, early humans were eating meat, sure, but they were eating, like, a lot less meat than what we're eating today, and they weren't eating the super ultraprocessed meat that we eat now. They were eating different types of meat. They were eating game. So maybe that's kind of the effect that we're seeing there.

And another one is alcohol. Although alcohol might make us feel relaxed and in a better mood, it does seem to be one of those that doesn't smell that good.

Pierre-Louis: I feel like, with alcohol in particular, we kind of know that intuitively. If anyone, you know, went to college and drank a lot [Laughs], there's a smell that happens after you've had a, a hard night of drinking that is not great. But the meat was a little bit surprising, especially now, in an era where there are so many people pushing, like, meat-only diets. It does feel like [Laughs], in addition to the health effects that can come from subsisting off of just meat, it also might make you less attractive to people you might want to be attractive to.

Quaglia: [Laughs.] Yeah, again, this is very early, early days data ...

Pierre-Louis: Right.

Quaglia: These are very small studies, so I don't know if we can really make huge, sweeping statements, but for sure there seems to be a little bit of a subtle shift, so depending on how much you care about how you smell [Laughs], that could be something to take into consideration.

I think an important caveat to point out here is so much of this is also culturally mediated. Things that somebody growing up in a certain type of culture might not find attractive in scent, somebody from another culture might. So we need to take into consideration all of that and kind of see that there's obviously, like, subjective preferences; there's cultural preferences. If you've grown up eating rice and curry your whole life, you're obviously going to have a different predisposition towards that scent, compared to somebody who's never eaten rice and curry before, right?

So there's a lot of cultural mediation here that we need to think about, and there's a lot of context. That's why it's been quite hard to set up these experiments, right, aside from the icky parts of, like, how do we collect men's sweat under their armpits? [Laughs.] So I think this is a super fascinating area of study, for sure.

Pierre-Louis: But we also kind of know that scent is important intuitively. Like, everyone talks about, like, how a newborn baby smells or, you know, wearing your partner's old hoodie because it still smells like them when they're away from you. So we kind of know, like, yes, it's culturally mediated, but there does seem to be a there there in the sense of, like, the way a person smells can really factor into whether you're attracted to them or you're repelled by them.

Quaglia: For sure, and what's super fascinating here is that each one of us has a unique scent profile, right, like a fingerprint. There's a growing body of research here that shows that everything from our personality type, like, whether you're an extrovert or whether you're an introvert, to our mood and our health really affects the way we smell, you know?

It comes from genes. It comes from hormones. It comes from health, from hygiene. It comes from whether you're a male or a female, whether you're young or old, gay or straight, dominant or subordinate, ovulating, pregnant, sick, happy, sad. So, like, all of these things affect our odor and our scent and the way our, our body smells.

So diet is just, like, one of the small bits and pieces that goes on top of that, right? That's also why it's hard to say, “Okay, I'm gonna make decisions about how I smell from now on just based on my diet,” because [Laughs] there's a lot of other things at play, for sure.

Pierre-Louis: Nope, sorry, what I've heard is, I'm going to live on a broccoli- and carrot-only diet from here on out—with apples: broccoli, carrot and apples. [Laughs.]

Quaglia: And jelly beans. Don't forget the jelly beans.

Pierre-Louis: Can't forget the jelly beans.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common malignancy with limited durable responses to first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based therapies. Emerging evidence implicates the gut microbiome in modulating ICI efficacy. In the investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2a TACITO trial, we evaluated whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from complete ICI responders enhances clinical outcomes in treatment-naive patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) receiving pembrolizumab + axitinib. The primary endpoint was the rate of patients free from disease progression at 12 months after randomization (12-month progression-free survival (PFS)). Secondary endpoints were median PFS and median overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), safety and microbiome changes, after randomization. Forty-five patients randomly received donor FMT (d-FMT) or placebo FMT (p-FMT). Although the primary endpoint was not met (70% versus 41% for d-FMT versus p-FMT, respectively, P = 0.053), the secondary endpoint of median PFS was significantly longer with d-FMT (24.0 months in the d-FMT arm versus 9.0 months in the p-FMT arm; hazard ratio = 0.50, P = 0.035). The ORR was 52% of patients in the d-FMT arm and 32% of patients receiving placebo. Microbiome analysis confirmed donor strain engraftment and increased α-diversity and larger microbiome shifts (β-diversity) compared with baseline composition in the d-FMT treatment group. Acquisition or loss of specific strains, but not total engraftment, was associated with the primary endpoint. Our findings support the safety and potential efficacy of selected donor FMT to enhance ICI-based treatment in mRCC, which deserves further investigations. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04758507.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs) have changed the management of different cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The combination of pembrolizumab (a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor monoclonal antibody) with axitinib (a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor) has significantly improved overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC)1, and it is currently used as first-line therapy in this population. However, most patients experience disease progression within 16 months, with limited therapeutic options thereafter.

A growing body of evidence suggests that the composition of the gut microbiome may affect the efficacy of ICIs in several epithelial tumors, including RCC2. First, the use of antibiotics, which are known to disrupt the gut microbiome3, has been associated with worse clinical response to ICIs in different types of cancer4, including RCC5. Also, several microbial taxa and/or ecological communities have been associated with response to ICIs in different epithelial cancers2, and the transfer of gut microbiome from humans to mice was proven to influence the response to ICIs in cancer mouse models6. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) provided clinical benefit in ICI-refractory7,8,9 or treatment-naive10 patients with advanced solid tumors, mostly melanoma, without serious adverse events (SAEs). However, thus far, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy of FMT in mRCC. Our phase 2a placebo-controlled RCT aims to evaluate whether FMT from patients with mRCC with complete response to ICIs was effective in improving response to combined first-line therapy with pembrolizumab and axitinib in patients with mRCC.

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated phase 2a RCT, we enrolled patients with metastatic, histologically confirmed RCC who were eligible to receive pembrolizumab and axitinib as first-line therapy. We excluded patients unable to undergo FMT, with a history of concomitant gastrointestinal or autoimmune disorders, with prior exposure to systemic immunomodulators or with ongoing or recent (<4 weeks prior to enrollment) antibiotic use. Full eligibility criteria are described in Methods. The primary endpoint was the rate of patients free from disease progression at 12 months after randomization (12-month PFS). Secondary endpoints were median PFS and median overall survival, ORR, safety and microbiome changes, after randomization.

After a baseline visit, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive donor FMT (d-FMT) or placebo FMT (p-FMT) three times in 6 months, unless disease progression occurred. Both groups underwent the first procedure by colonoscopy, followed by capsulized FMT after 12 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. Due to the potential delay in treatments depending on donor feces availability, we reevaluated patients 2–5 days before the first treatment to collect a stool sample closer to treatments and check their eligibility based on the following predefined withdrawal criteria: actual provision of the first treatment more than 8 weeks from the start of ICI therapy and actual changes in the eligibility criteria evaluated at the time of enrollment.

Fifty-four patients were assessed for eligibility, and 50 patients were enrolled and randomized to treatments between 11 February 2021 and 11 November 2023 (Fig. 1).

The FAS included all patients who had received at least one treatment. The per-protocol population included all patients who had received treatments without significant delay (≤2 weeks).

The 45 patients who received at least the first allocated treatment (23 in the d-FMT arm and 22 in the p-FMT arm) were included in the full analysis set (FAS). Thirty-eight patients (17/23 in the d-FMT arm and 21/22 in the p-FMT arm, overall 84%) received further treatments, until they were eligible, within or no later than 2 weeks after the planned schedule and were included in the per-protocol population. In the d-FMT arm, three patients received the second FMT with a delay of 16 weeks each. Moreover, one patient received the second treatment with a 7-week delay and the third treatment with a delay of 26 weeks, and, for another patient, the second treatment was delayed by 4 weeks and the third treatment by 8 weeks. Reasons for delay were the unavailability of FMT capsules and/or the unavailability of patients to attend procedures timely. One patient in the p-FMT arm received the second treatment with a 8-week delay because of their inability to travel.

In the FAS population, 35 patients received two FMTs (19 in the d-FMT arm and 15 in the p-FMT arm), and 28 of them received three FMTs (15 in the d-FMT arm and 13 in the p-FMT arm). Disease progression was the most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation. One patient in the d-FMT arm did not receive the third FMT, despite being free from disease progression, because of logistic reasons, as initially FMT capsules were unavailable (with a delay also in the second treatment), and then the patient was not able to reach our center. Thirteen months after randomization, the patient experienced disease progression and was then not eligible to receive treatments anymore.

The baseline characteristics of the two treatment groups in the FAS population were well balanced (Table 1). Most participants were male (73%), and the median age at the time of treatment initiation was 62 years (range, 41–79 years). According to the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk model, 69% of participants had intermediate-prognosis and poor-prognosis disease. Concerning the tumor histology, most patients had clear cell RCC (n = 40, 89%), whereas a slight minority had papillary (n = 4, 9%) and chromophobe (n = 1, 2%) RCC. The most common sites of metastasis include lung (n = 33, 73%), lymph nodes (n = 18, 40%) and liver (n = 8, 18%).

We identified five patients with long-term complete response to ICI as candidate donors. Two of these individuals—one 57-year-old man and one 52-year-old woman with RCC, both experiencing complete response after nivolumab + ipilimumab and nivolumab alone, respectively—passed the screening process (Methods) and were eligible to donate.

At the data cutoff on 6 February 2025 (2 months after the last study visit), the median follow-up time was 32 months (interquartile range (IQR), 22–37 months). Overall, 31 of 45 patients (69%) in the FAS population experienced disease progression. A PFS event occurred in 14 of 23 patients in the d-FMT arm (61%) and in 17 of 22 patients in the p-FMT arm (77%). Median PFS was significantly improved in the d-FMT arm (24.0 months, 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.0–40.0 months) compared with the p-FMT arm (9.0 months, 95% CI: 2.2–15.2 months) (hazard ratio = 0.50, 90% CI: 0.27–0.92, P = 0.035; Fig. 2a). As hypothesized for the primary efficacy outcome, the proportion of patients without progression or death 12 months after randomization was higher in the d-FMT arm than in the p-FMT arm (d-FMT: 16/23 patients, 70%; p-FMT: 9/22 patients, 41%; P = 0.053). After adjusting for established prognostic factors in mRCC—that is, IMDC criteria and presence of liver metastases—findings were similar to those arising from the unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.23–0.99, P = 0.048).

a, Median PFS. Median PFS was significantly improved in the d-FMT arm (24.0 months, 95% CI: 8.0–40.0 months) compared with the p-FMT arm (9.0 months, 95% CI: 2.2–15.2 months) (hazard ratio = 0.50, 90% CI: 0.27–0.92, P = 0.035). b, Median overall survival. Median overall survival was longer in the d-FMT arm than in the p-FMT arm (41.0 months versus 28.3 months, hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.13–0.99, P = 0.167). The two-sided Breslow test was applied to assess statistical significance.

Seventeen of 45 patients (38%) died by the data cutoff, specifically six of 23 patients in the d-FMT arm (26%) and 11 of 22 patients in the p-FMT arm (50%). Median overall survival was longer in the d-FMT arm (41.0 months) than in the p-FMT arm (28.3 months) although not significantly (hazard ratio = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.13–0.99), P = 0.167; Fig. 2b).

The ORR in the FAS population was 52% (12/23 patients, 95% CI: 0.33–0.71) in the d-FMT arm and 32% (7/22 patients, 95% CI: 0.14–0.55) in the p-FMT arm. Complete response was observed in two patients (9%) in the p-FMT arm and in none of the patients in the d-FMT arm. Five patients (23%) in the p-FMT arm and 12 patients (52%) in the d-FMT arm experienced a partial response. Stable disease was found in nine patients (39%) in the d-FMT arm and in eight patients (36%) in the p-FMT arm, and two patients (9%) in the d-FMT arm and seven patients (32%) in the p-FMT arm had progressive disease.

Overall, 49 patients (all randomized patients except one patient who withdrew his consent) were included in the safety analysis (Extended Data Table 1). Generally, experimental treatments were well tolerated. Adverse events strictly related to the experimental procedures occurred rarely. One patient experienced grade 2 diarrhea after colonoscopic p-FMT, but this symptom was self-limited and disappeared in few days. Only one patient in the p-FMT arm experienced a grade 3 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) (oral mucositis) during the intake of frozen capsules, which led to the discontinuation of their ingestion. No deaths related to experimental treatments were reported. No transmission of any infectious agent after d-FMT was observed.

Grade 3 or higher adverse events related to axitinib and/or pembrolizumab occurred in 28% (7/25) of the patients in the d-FMT group and in 16% (4/24) of the patients in the p-FMT group and led to the interruption of treatments in 8% and 6%, dose reduction in 12% and 12% and treatment discontinuation in 8% and 0% of patients in the d-FMT arm and in the p-FMT arm, respectively.

Among adverse events of special interest (which included gastrointestinal adverse events), the most common of all grades were diarrhea (d-FMT: 52% versus p-FMT: 44%) and aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) increase (d-FMT: 20% versus p-FMT: 28%), and the most common high-grade (grade 3 and grade 4) events were again diarrhea (d-FMT: 12% versus p-FMT: 4%) and AST/ALT increase (d-FMT: 12% versus p-FMT: 8%), all non-significantly different.

We collected stool samples throughout the study from the 45 patients in the FAS population (n = 246 samples, collected at baseline and, respectively, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks and 52 weeks after the first treatment in both study arms) and the two donors (n = 9 samples, with collection of all donor stool aliquots administered to the patients). Samples were metagenomically sequenced at high depth and profiled with the computational tools in the bioBakery suite11 (Methods).

As a first step, taxonomic profiles obtained via MetaPhlAn 4 (ref. 12) were used to compare the baseline microbiome and the microbiome effects of the treatments in each arm. As expected, given the randomized study design, the overall baseline microbiome compositions (Extended Data Fig. 1) did not differ between treatment groups in terms of Shannon α-diversity (P = 0.15; Fig. 3a), species richness (P = 0.66; Fig. 3a) and Bray–Curtis dissimilarity (P = 0.92; Fig. 3b) before treatments. Donors had similar diversity levels to patients (Fig. 3a), but their microbiomes stood out as outliers in terms of composition (Fig. 3b), which was likely linked to the most abundant species in donors being Bifidobacterium adolescentis (SGB17244) (average 12.5%), whereas this was only the 30th most abundant species in patients (average 0.7% relative abundance). We also noticed that the donor providing 98% of the stool aliquots administered to the d-FMT group lacked metagenomically detectable Akkermansia muciniphila (SGB9226), a 50% prevalence species at the patientʼs baseline, having, instead, the rarer (9% prevalence in patients) related clade recently proposed for reclassification as Akkermansia massiliensis (SGB9228)13,14. Candidatus Cibionibacter quicibialis (SGB15286) (average 9.2% relative abundance), Ruminoccocus bromii (SGB4285) (5.2%) and Bifidobacterium longum (SGB17248) (4.7%) also composed relevant fractions of the donors' microbiome (Extended Data Fig. 1).

After treatments, we observed an increase in Shannon α-diversity versus baseline at week 1 (P = 0.05), week 4 (P < 0.001), week 12 (P = 0.02) and week 24 (P = 0.048) follow-ups (Fig. 3c) and significantly increased species richness versus baseline at week 4 follow-up (P = 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 2) in the d-FMT group. Notably, such longitudinal increase in α-diversity was not observed in any of the follow-up timepoints of the p-FMT group (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 2). We also observed a significantly higher number of species acquired after treatments (that is, absent at baseline but present in follow-up samples) among patients receiving d-FMT versus those in the p-FMT arm, corroborating the hypothesis that their microbiome enrichment was driven by FMT (P < 0.006 across all timepoints; Fig. 3d). Despite such α-diversity increase, the d-FMT arm also showed a higher percentage of baseline species lost compared with the p-FMT arm, with a significant difference between arms only at week 4 follow-up (median 19.9% versus 14.8%, P = 0.045) but with a clear trend across other follow-up timepoints (Fig. 3e).

FMT had a considerable modulatory effect of FMT also on microbiome composition, with significantly higher Bray–Curtis dissimilarity between posttreatment and baseline microbiomes in d-FMT versus p-FMT patients at the week 4 follow-up (P = 0.015; Fig. 3f). As both absolute α-diversity and β-diversity deviation to the baseline was increased in the d-FMT arm compared with the p-FMT arm after treatments, the preplanned microbiome-related secondary outcomes were achieved.

We next evaluated whether these broad microbiome changes were associated with the primary efficacy outcome. We focused on the week 1 and week 4 follow-ups as the only timepoints allowing for statistical comparisons—that is, the ones with five or more individuals in each group (PFS > 12 months versus PFS > 12 months) of the d-FMT arm. In both arms, the number of acquired species and the species-level compositional shift after baseline were not associated with the primary outcome (Extended Data Fig. 3). Notably, the percentage of baseline species lost at follow-up was higher among individuals with PFS > 12 months in the d-FMT arm (week 1 median 28% versus 20%, P = 0.056; week 4 median 24.3% versus 18.2%, P = 0.078; Fig. 3g) but not in the p-FMT arm (week 1 median 19% versus 18%, P = 1; week 4 median 12.9% versus 15.5%, P = 0.64; Fig. 3g). This effect of donor FMT in depleting baseline species might be linked to a rewiring of the recipient microbiome that favors immunotherapy clinical response.

To directly associate the quantitative level of donor FMT success with the effect of donor strains on the recipient microbiome, we used a StrainPhlAn-based pipeline to infer the donor strain engraftment rate (DoSER), defined as the number of strains of the donor that are present in each recipient's sample after the FMT.

Only a small proportion of donor strains were already present in patients at baseline, possibly as a consequence of previous direct or indirect contact between individuals or, more likely, of the presence of shared clonal strains in the local population, and, as expected, this fraction did not differ significantly between arms (median DoSER: d-FMT 2.2% versus p-FMT 2.2%, P = 0.73; Fig. 4a). The DoSER in patients receiving d-FMT was consistently higher than in the p-FMT arm throughout the whole study period (P < 0.001 across all timepoints starting from week 1 follow-up; Fig. 5a). Specifically, the p-FMT DoSER remained as low as the baseline one (one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test P > 0.22 across all timepoints versus baseline, with medians ranging between 1.1% and 2.2%). As expected, individuals in the d-FMT arm showed very high DoSER (median at week 1 follow-up: 18.1%; Fig. 4a) already after the first treatment, confirming a microbiologically successful FMT. High engraftment rates were sustained throughout the study with the aid of the additional treatments (week 4: 14.6%; week 12: 13.9%; week 24: 20.5%; week 36: 24.0; week 52: 17.4%), with a positive correlation observed between strain abundances in the donor aliquots and strain engraftment frequency (Extended Data Fig. 4).

a, Box plots with the DoSER (Methods) comparing each arm at each follow-up sample collection (week 1, week 4, week 12, week 24, week 36 and week 52). The two-sided Mann–Whitney test was applied to assess statistical significance. b, Box plots with the donor strain replacement rate (Methods) with respect to the baseline comparing each arm at each follow-up sample collection. The two-sided Mann–Whitney test was applied to assess statistical significance. c, Box plots with the DoSER in the d-FMT arm comparing patients with or without PFS > 12 months at each follow-up sample collection. The two-sided Mann–Whitney test was applied to assess statistical significance only at week 1 and week 4 follow-ups. Across all box plots, box edges represent the lower and upper quartiles, the center line indicates the median, and whiskers extend to the most extreme data point that is no farther than 1.5 times the IQR. d, Bar plots with the percentage of patients in the d-FMT arm at week 1 follow-up acquiring the donor strain of each donor species according to presence (blue) or absence (orange) of PFS > 12 months. Species are ordered by the prevalence difference between groups (no − yes), with only species differing by at least 25% between groups depicted. A two-sided Fisher's exact test was applied to assess statistical significance, with only P values reaching significance (P < 0.05) shown. e, Bar plots with the percentage of patients in the d-FMT arm at week 1 follow-up acquiring the donor strain of each donor species according to presence (blue) or absence (orange) of PFS > 12 months. Species are ordered by the prevalence difference between groups (no − yes), with only species differing by at least 25% between groups depicted. A two-sided Fisher's exact test was applied to assess statistical significance, with only P values reaching significance (P < 0.05) shown.

a, Median PFS. The median PFS was 18.8 months in the d-FMT arm and 5.1 months in the p-FMT arm (P = 0.033). b, Median overall survival. The median overall survival was 41 months in the d-FMT arm, similar to the overall population, versus 21.5 months in the p-FMT arm (P = 0.164). The two-sided Breslow test was applied to assess statistical significance.

The effect of d-FMT was also recapitulated by the strain replacement rate with respect to the baseline (Methods), which increased over time in both arms, because of expected longitudinal changes in the gut microbiome (P = 0.002 and P = 0.004 across the longitudinal comparison week 1 versus week 52 follow-ups for the d-FMT arm and the p-FMT arm, respectively) but was significantly higher in the d-FMT arm (P < 0.003 across all cross-sectional comparisons between arms; Fig. 4b).

We next evaluated whether the DoSER was associated with PFS at the 12-month follow-up after randomization. We found that patients in the d-FMT arm who experienced PFS > 12 months showed similar engraftment rates to patients with PFS < 12 months both at week 1 (median DoSER: 12.0% versus 20.0%, respectively, P = 0.15; Fig. 4c) and at week 4 (median DoSER: 14.5% versus 14.8%, respectively, P = 0.53; Fig. 4c) follow-ups. These findings suggest that, despite the clear clinical benefit of d-FMT, the absolute number of donor strains engrafting in patients does not appear to be relevant in influencing it.

We then set out to test whether the engraftment success or failure of particular strains was linked with outcomes. This was done by evaluating the fraction of individuals acquiring the donor strain of each species in each group (progression free versus disease progression at the 12-month follow up after randomization) at week 1 (Fig. 5d) or week 4 (Extended Data Fig. 5a) follow-ups. The acquisition of the Blautia wexlerae (SGB4837) strain from the donor at week 1 was positively associated with 12-month PFS (percentage of recipients acquiring strain with versus without PFS > 12 months: 50% versus 0%, P = 0.047; Fig. 5d). On the other hand, acquisition of the donor strain of a yet-to-be-described species (SGB14845) of the family Oscillospiraceae (percentage of recipients acquiring strain with versus without PFS > 12 months: 7% versus 71%, P = 0.006; Fig. 4d) was inversely associated with 12-month PFS. The same pattern was observed for the acquisition of the donor strain of the rarer—as opposed to the prevalent A. muciniphila (SGB9226)—A. massiliensis sp. nov. (SGB9228) (percentage of recipients acquiring strain with versus without PFS > 12 months: 0% versus 57%, P = 0.006; Fig. 4d) at the week 1 follow-up.

Besides assessing acquisition of donor strains, we also evaluated at week 1 (Fig. 4e) and week 4 (Extended Data Fig. 5b) the loss of strains present in the recipients at baseline. The loss of the Ruminococcus bromii (SGB4290) baseline strain at the week 1 follow-up was associated with a shortened PFS (percentage of recipients acquiring strain with or without PFS > 12 months: 7% versus 57%, P = 0.025; Fig. 4d). On the other hand, loss of the baseline Escherichia coli (SGB10068) strain or the baseline strain of an uncharacterized Clostridium species (SGB6179) at the week 1 follow-up was associated with 12-month PFS. All patients in the d-FMT arm who experienced disease progression before 12 months did not lose the baseline strain of those two species, whereas, respectively, 36% and 43% of the patients who had a PFS longer than 12 months did so, although these associations were not significant (P = 0.12 and P = 0.06, respectively; Fig. 4e).

At the data cutoff on 6 February 2025, 27 of 38 patients (71%) in the per-protocol population experienced disease progression—specifically, seven of 17 (41%) in the d-FMT arm and 17 of 21 (81%) in the p-FMT arm. Median PFS was significantly improved in the d-FMT arm (26.9 months, 95% CI: 7.5–not evaluable) versus the p-FMT arm (8.7 months, 95% CI: 2.8–15.4 months) (hazard ratio = 0.43, 90% CI: 0.20–0.92, P = 0.028; Extended Data Fig. 6a).

The proportion of patients without progression or death 12 months after randomization was significantly higher in the d-FMT arm than in the p-FMT arm (d-FMT: 12/17, 71%; p-FMT: 8/21, 38%, P = 0.046).

Sixteen of 38 patients (42%) died by the data cutoff: five of 17 (29%) in the d-FMT arm and 11 of 21 (52%) in the p-FMT arm. Median overall survival was not significantly longer in the d-FMT arm (41 months) versus the p-FMT arm (28.3 months) (hazard ratio = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.13–0.99), P = 0.146; Extended Data Fig. 6b), probably because of the insufficient number of events.

The ORR in the per-protocol population was 59% (10/17 patients, 95% CI: 0.36–0.78) in the d-FMT arm and 33% (7/21 patients, 95% CI: 0.17–0.55) in the p-FMT arm. Complete response was observed in two patients (9%) in the p-FMT arm versus none of the patients in the d-FMT arm. Five patients (24%) in the p-FMT arm and 10 patients (59%) in the d-FMT arm experienced a partial response. Stable disease was found in five patients (29%) in the d-FMT arm and in seven patients (33%) in the p-FMT arm. Two patients (12%) in the d-FMT arm and seven patients (33%) in the p-FMT arm had progressive disease.

In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population at data cutoff, 33 of 50 patients (67%) experienced disease progression (d-FMT arm: 16/25, 64%; p-FMT arm: 17/25, 68%). Median PFS was not significantly longer in the d-FMT arm (23.2 months, 95% CI: 7.4–39.1 months) than in the p-FMT arm (9.2 months, 95% CI: 0–20.5 months) (hazard ratio = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.33–1.35, P = 0.18; Extended Data Fig. 7a). Sixteen patients in the d-FMT arm and 10 patients in the p-FMT arm achieved 12-month PFS (d-FMT 64% versus p-FMT 48%, P = 0.20).

Nineteen of 50 patients (38%) died by the data cutoff (d-FMT arm: 8/25, 32%; p-FMT arm: 11/25, 44%). Median overall survival was non-significantly longer in the d-FMT arm (40.9 months, 95% CI: 39.2–42.7 months) than in the p-FMT arm (28.2 months, 95% CI: 20.1–36.5 months) (hazard ratio = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.20–1.30, P = 0.146; Extended Data Fig. 7b).

The ORR in the ITT population was 52% (13/25 patients, 95% CI: 0.33–0.70) in the d-FMT arm and 28% (7/22 patients, 95% CI: 0.14–0.55) in the p-FMT arm. We observed a complete response in two patients (8%) in the p-FMT arm and in none of the patients in the d-FMT arm. Five patients (20%) in the p-FMT arm and 13 patients (52%) in the d-FMT arm experienced partial response. The disease was stable in 11 patients in the p-FMT arm (44%) and in nine patients in the d-FMT arm (36%), respectively, whereas two patients (8%) in the d-FMT arm and seven patients (28%) in the p-FMT arm had disease progression as best response.

As a post hoc analysis, we evaluated efficacy outcomes in patients with intermediate-prognosis or poor-prognosis disease based on IMDC classification, who typically benefit from pembrolizumab + axitinib combination more than those with favorable-prognosis disease1. In this subpopulation, differences between the two treatment groups became larger in all evaluated efficacy outcomes. The median PFS was 18.8 months in the 16 patients of the d-FMT arm and 5.1 months in the 15 patients of the p-FMT arm (P = 0.033; Fig. 5a). The 12-month PFS was achieved by 10 of 16 patients (63%) in the d-FMT arm and by four of 15 patients (27%) in the p-FMT arm (P = 0.045). The median overall survival was 41.0 months in the d-FMT arm, similar to the overall population, versus 21.5 months in the p-FMT arm (P = 0.164; Fig. 5b). The ORR in this subset was 50% (8/16 patients, 95% CI: 0.28–0.72) in the d-FMT arm and 8% (1/13 patients, 95% CI: 0.0–0.35) in the p-FMT arm.

To our knowledge, the TACITO trial is the first RCT to investigate the effect of targeted FMT in patients with mRCC undergoing first-line combination therapy with pembrolizumab + axitinib as well as the first study to evaluate PFS and overall survival as clinical endpoints, with several intriguing findings.

First, donor FMT was superior to placebo in significantly improving the median PFS, with a considerable difference in its duration (24.0 months in the d-FMT arm versus 9.0 months in the p-FMT arm; hazard ratio = 0.50, P = 0.035). However, when evaluating the 12-month PFS (the primary outcome), the statistical difference between arms was only close to the pre-set significance threshold (70% versus 41% for d-FMT versus p-FMT, respectively, P = 0.053). This difference may suggest that stronger effects of donor FMT might be appreciated in a longer run than 1 year, both for clinical reasons (because the main cancer therapy in the control arm remains active, effects of FMT on PFS are expected to be more impactful after its median value) and for microbiological reasons (the donor microbiome may exert its effect over 12 months, especially in those patients who received all treatments).

We observed a notable but non-significant difference in the overall survival between the two groups (41 months in the d-FMT arm versus 28.3 months in the p-FMT arm). We are continuing to follow-up our cohort to confirm this hypothesis. Finally, we observed a 52% response in the d-FMT arm compared with 32% in the p-FMT arm. In the control arm, response rate was lower than previously reported for this combination in the KEYNOTE-426 phase 3 trial1, which may be related to the inclusion of patients with non-clear cell histology as well as the evaluation of the PFS from the point of randomization during the study.

The post hoc analysis of patients with intermediate or poor prognosis based on IMDC criteria showed stronger results of d-FMT compared with p-FMT.

First, for the primary outcome, the absolute difference between the two arms was larger and significant for patients in this population (64% in the d-FMT arm versus 27% in the p-FMT arm, P = 0.045) than in the overall population. Moreover, the ORR of these patients was similar to that of the overall population in the d-FMT arm (52% versus 50%) but dropped considerably in the p-FMT arm (32% versus 8%). These results suggest that patients with intermediate or good prognosis at baseline might benefit more from donor FMT as an add-on to cancer immunotherapy. Further studies on this specific subgroup are warranted. Notably, as already observed in studies coming from our center and other groups15,16,17,18,19,20,21, donor FMT is safe, with no FMT-related SAEs reported in the study period.

These clinical results were associated with interesting microbiological findings.

First, we observed a significant increase in both α-diversity and β-diversity in the d-FMT arm compared with the p-FMT arm after treatments (secondary outcomes of our study). These findings, together with the finding that the DoSER was consistently higher in patients receiving donor FMT than in the p-FMT group throughout the whole study period, confirm that the donor FMT was microbiologically successful in our study.

After assessing the microbiological validity of our intervention, we investigated potential associations between posttreatment microbiome changes and clinical results. Neither α-diversity and β-diversity nor the DoSER was associated with 12-month PFS, suggesting that qualitative rather than quantitative dynamics of donor FMT might be relevant in determining clinical outcomes.

Then, we found that immediate post-FMT (week 1 follow-up) acquisition of the B. wexlerae donor strain was significantly associated with 12-month PFS. B. wexlerae is a beneficial anarerobic bacterium, which produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), already associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with rectal cancer22. Moreover, its oral administration had anti-inflammatory effects and ameliorated obesity and diabetes in mice23.

On the other hand, we found an inverse association between the engraftment of A. massiliensis (SGB9228) and the primary outcome. This finding may have several explanations.

A. massiliensis is a novel species defined from the recent proposed reclassification of A. muciniphila. Previous studies found an association between the abundance of A. muciniphila and response to ICIs24,25,26, but deeper analyses support this association only for A. muciniphila sensu stricto rather than for A. massiliensis (SGB9228)27. Notably, an overabundance of A. muciniphila was previously associated with resistance to ICIs and was highlighted as an indirect sign of dysbiosis (as observed in patients with a history of antibiotic exposure)24,27. Moreover, direct experimental evidence shows that Akkermansia strains can be hardly replaced by other external Akkermansia strains, due to their high genomic similarity28. Therefore, patients with adequate baseline abundance of A. muciniphila could have not been colonized by A. massiliensis, and the combination of these beneficial strains and of the donor strains could have contributed to the clinical success of the d-FMT. Overall, these results support further investigations.

Moreover, we observed that the d-FMT group experienced over time not only a significantly higher acquisition of new species but also a significantly higher loss of baseline species compared with the p-FMT group. We also found a borderline significant association between the proportion of species immediately lost after treatment (week 1 follow-up) and the 12-month PFS in the d-FMT group but not in the p-FMT group. We found that the loss of an E. coli strain (SGB10068) in recipients was associated with PFS > 12 months, whereas the inverse association was found for an R. bromii strain (SGB4290). These results might be explained by the well-known inflammatory features of several E. coli strains29 and by the ability of R. bromii to hydrolize resistant starch and to support, consequently, the growth of beneficial SCFA-producing bacteria30. Although the detected loss can also be the effect of falling below the level of detection as a consequence of relative abundance increase of other species, this finding suggests an effect of donor FMT in displacing, or at least depleting, originally present patient species besides the more expected enrichment with donor microbiome components. Also here, further investigations on the taxonomy and functional potential of these microbes are advocated.

Notably, we did not use antibiotic preconditioning, as this trial was started before our discovery of its association with microbiome engraftment31 and the publication of relevant studies7,8. Although we did not observe any association between quantitative engraftment and clinical response, we acknowledge that the engraftment rate immediately after donor FMT was 18%, which is much lower than that observed in patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (where FMT is mostly successful), who usually undergo an antibiotic preconditioning before FMT and have a history of previous antibiotic therapies. In addition, it remains unclear whether healthy donor FMT or patient donor FMT (as used here) is the best approach.

This study has some limitations. The sample size was relatively small, with only 45 patients evaluated for the primary endpoint. Some baseline characteristics could not be completely well balanced due to the reduced sample size. Finally, most stool aliquots were provided by a single donor, whose microbiome was rich in Bifidobacteria, A. massiliensis (associated with PFS < 12 months if acquired) and R. bromii (the loss of which in patients was associated with negative response). We also identified other donors, but they were not willing to donate for logistical reasons. Although there are advantages to relying on a single donor, the lack of immediate stool availability led to delays in treatment for nine patients. Although the effects of this protocol deviation are unclear, findings from the per-protocol sensitivity analysis suggest that timely provision of donor FMT might be associated with improved clinical outcomes. The recruitment of stool donors is a critical step for an academic FMT center32, and the difficulties in its consistent fulfillment is one of the factors that limit the testing of FMT worldwide33. The investigation of further approaches to microbiome modulation, such as microbiome consortia/live biotherapeutic products, could overcome the issue of stool shortage and is also supported by the promising results coming from already available studies34,35,36.

The TACITO trial was an investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a clinical trial that aimed to evaluate whether donor FMT from complete ICI responders is effective in improving response to combined first-line therapy with pembrolizumab and axitinib in patients with mRCC.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on the Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice guidelines as well as in compliance with local and institutional regulations. The study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB)/local ethics committee (ID: 2664) and was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration identifier: NCT04758507, registration date: 11 February 2021). All enrolled patients gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. This study was conducted by following CONSORT guidelines37, and a CONSORT checklist is provided in Supplementary Table 1.

The full study protocol is available in the Supplementary Information file.

Patients were enrolled in the Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli IRCCS, a tertiary care center and academic hospital in Rome, Italy, and were either screened from our oncology outpatient clinic or referred to our center from seven other Italian hospitals, all referral centers for RCC. The inclusion criteria were as follows: histologically confirmed RCC; metastatic disease; radiological assessment within 8 weeks before enrollment; patient eligible for therapy with ICIs for mRCC or started within 8 weeks; ability to provide written informed consent; and ability to be compliant with the scheduled procedures.

We excluded patients for the following reasons: major comorbidities; concomitant gastrointestinal or autoimmune disorders or HIV, HBV or HCV infection; continuative corticosteroid therapy; previous treatment with systemic immunosuppressants or immunomodulatory drugs; and antibiotic therapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

Predefined withdrawal criteria before the start of treatments (checked at the pretreatment evaluation visit, described below) were as follows: voluntary withdrawal of the patient; absence of the planned eligibility criteria at the pretreatment evaluation visit; and actual provision of the first treatment (FMT or placebo) later than 8 weeks from the start of ICI therapy. We predefined this criterion as a late provision of the first treatment that could affect the efficacy of FMT. The delay of further treatments was not considered a criterion to withdraw patients from the study as the donor microbiome can engraft the recipient gut up to 6 months, based on available evidence38. Patients who experienced a disease progression during the study procedures were discontinued from further treatments. Moreover, patients who withdrew their consent to participate in the study at any time were discontinued from the trial.

The last enrolled patient received his first treatment on 16 December 2023 and had his last follow-up visit on 5 December 2024.

Two of the 25 patients randomized in the d-FMT arm did not receive the first treatment as the timespan between the scheduled procedure and the start of their cancer therapy was longer than 8 weeks due to unavailability of donor stools. Three of the 25 patients randomized in the p-FMT arm did not receive the first treatment for the following reasons: one patient withdrew consent before the scheduled procedure; one patient had no metastatic disease at internal reevaluation of the baseline computed tomography scan; and one patient was not treated within 8 weeks from the start of cancer therapy, because of his logistical unavailability to reach our center.

ITT set. This set was used for sensitivity analyses and included all randomized patients, regardless of study treatment.

FAS. This set was used for efficacy analyses (primary and secondary efficacy outcomes) and included all randomized patients who received at least the first treatment (regardless of completion status).

Per-protocol set. This set was used for sensitivity analyses and included all randomized patients who received all assigned treatments for which they were eligible (so, unless disease progression, consent withrawal or other conditions for study discontinuation occurred) within the planned schedule (regardless of their number), without delays.

Safety set. This set includes all randomized patients, regardless of study treatment. Only the TRAEs and the adverse events of special interest, which included gastrontestinal toxicities, have been collected prospectively. Incidence of treatment interruption or discontinuation related to the axitinib and/or pembrolizumab as well as the incidence of grade 3–5 adverse events in each treatment arm have been collected retrospectively.

Moreover, we conducted a post hoc analysis by excluding patients with favorable-prognosis disease based on the IMDC score.

The primary efficacy endpoint was 12-month PFS, defined as the number of participants free from tumor progression, as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solids Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, 12 months after randomization39, in the FAS population.

Secondary efficacy endpoints were median PFS, median overall survival and ORR in the FAS population, safety and microbiome changes after treatments.

Safety was evaluated in the per-protocol and FAS populations.

PFS and ORR were determined using RECIST version 1.1, as assessed by local investigators. PFS was defined as the time from randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Overall survival was evaluated from the date of randomization to death from any cause or the last contact.

ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a partial or complete response.

Safety was assessed as the incidence, nature and severity of TRAEs, recorded and classified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

Microbiome changes after treatments were defined as the number of participants with significant increase in α-diversity (assessed by Shannon index) and β-diversity (assessed by Bray–Curtis dissimilarity) of their gut microbiota after treatments, compared with baseline.

Screening, baseline and pretreatment assessments were all conducted in combination by physicians from the Gastroenterology Unit and from the Oncology Unit.

During the screening visit, after a thorough discussion of the study details with the investigators, potentially eligible patients who were willing to participate in the study signed the informed consent. Then, we evaluated the patient and reviewed inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure the eligibility of the patient for the trial.

The baseline assessment included the collection of patient medical history, including the following data: age, gender, date of cancer diagnosis, nephrectomy status and date, histology, Fuhrman grade, diagnosis of metastatic disease and site of metastases, Karnofsky scale, IMDC score, complete blood count and starting date of cancer therapy. Moreover, all patients underwent a full clinical examination. At the end of the baseline visit, enrolled patients were randomized to study treatments.

The pretreatment assessment occurred within 2–5 days before the first scheduled experimental procedure (FMT or placebo). Here, investigators reviewed the eligibility criteria to check their actual validity as well as the time distance between the start of ICI therapy and the first treatment (to be no longer than 8 weeks).

Stool donors were selected within the historical cohort of our Oncology Unit among patients with advanced RCC who had experienced a complete response to PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab or nivolumab).

Once identified, available patients from this cohort were screened according to protocols recommended by international guidelines, based on a multilevel framework32,40,41. First, donor candidates underwent a specific questionnaire aimed at addressing the following: known history or lifestyle-related risk factors for potentially communicable diseases (for example, drug addiction or promiscuous sexual behavior); recent (<6 months) use of specific drugs (for example, antibiotics); a family history of gastrointestinal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease; systemic diseases; and the use of drugs that could be excreted in feces with potential risk for the recipients. Subsequently, selected patients underwent blood and stool examinations to exclude potentially transmittable diseases. Candidates who passed these two steps were qualified as eligible for donating and repeated this screening procedure every 2 months32,40,41. At the time of each donation, the chosen patients underwent a further questionnaire to screen for any recent acute digestive disease, newly contracted infectious diseases or other potentially harmful situations (for example, risky sexual contacts) and a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 (after March 2020)32,40,41. Moreover, each stool donation provided by qualified donors underwent direct stool testing, which included a culture assay for detection of multidrug-resistant bacteria, a rapid molecular assay for common intestinal pathogens (Seegene, RT–PCR Allplex Gastrointestinal Panel Assay) and a stool molecular assay for SARS-CoV2 (since March 2020)32,40,41. An extended description of the donor screening is available in the study protocol. Selected donors were also asked to provide stool samples for microbiome analysis every 6 months.

Five patients with long-term complete response to ICI were identified as candidate donors.

Three donors did not pass the screening process (two for chronic use of proton pump inhibitors and another one for history of previous colorectal surgery for diverticulitis), whereas two of them were eligible to donate.

Donor 1 was a 57-year-old man who underwent radical nephrectomy and retrocaval lymph node resection for a clear cell RCC at original pT3a pN1 M0 disease stage. After 4 months, for disease recurrence with more than 60 bilateral pulmonary metastases (the largest of 14 mm in size), he started first-line systemic therapy with nivolumab + ipilimumab, achieving a complete response that is still lasting after 6 years of therapy (that is, May 2025). He provided the vast majority (n = 56/57, 98%) of stool aliquots. The other donor who passed the screening process (donor 2) was a 52-year-old woman who developed lung and pancreatic metastases 2 years after nephrectomy for a clear cell RCC (pT2, grade 2) and received third-line therapy with nivolumab after disease progression to sunitinib for 3 years and everolimus for subsequent 3 years. Nivolumab led to a complete disease response, and, as of today (that is, May 2025, 9 years after), she is still under therapy with no evidence of target lesions.

For each donation, feces was collected by the donor in the morning and rapidly transported to our hospital in a refrigerated bag (within 4 hours from defecation). After the completion of the questionnaire already described, stool donations were brought to the FMT laboratory of our center (Microbiology Unit) for direct stool testing. Immediately after this step, they were manufactured as fecal aliquots for colonoscopic FMT and/or as FMT capsules, based on specific needs related to planned treatments, following recommendations by international guidelines32,40,41. All manufactured aliquots or capsules were quarantined for 24–48 hours while waiting for results of the direct stool testing, and positive donations were then discarded. Also, stool donations less than 60 g were considered insufficient to prepare a stool aliquot or a capsule set and were discarded42. All procedures were performed within a biological safety cabinet (Biosafety Level 2). Using specific strainer bags (Seward), the fecal material was first diluted with nearly 200 ml of sterile saline (0.9%) for fecal aliquots and nearly 100 ml of sterile saline for FMT capsules, and glycerol (Monico S.p.A.) was added up to a final concentration of 10% to cryopreserve bacteria at −80 °C. Then, this suspension was homogenized automatically through a Stomacher 400 homogenizer (Seward), which allowed a simultaneous filtration of the solution. The homogenization program chosen was 260 rev min−1 for 1 minute43. Further filtration and purification of the fecal suspension were performed using sterile gauzes and a funnel. The deriving solution was blended and, after the supernatant was strained, transferred into a sterile flask.

For the manufacturing of colonoscopic FMT aliquots, the fecal suspension was divided, in ready-to-use aliquots of at least 60 g and nearly 200 ml, as previously described43, and aliquots were frozen at −80 °C up to 6 months. Eligible aliquots were thawed in a warm (37 °C) water bath on the day of fecal infusion.

For the manufacturing of FMT capsules, the fecal suspension was poured into a sterile container ready for capsule production. Specifically, size 1 capsules were filled with 0.420 ml of fecal suspension and, then, encapsulated with size 00 capsules (Farmalabor), with nearly 150 capsules for each stool donation44,45. Capsules were quickly stored at −80 °C, in plastic boxes, for up to 6 months.

Each suspension bottle or capsule box was labeled with a unique barcode of the corresponding donor, and with the date of collection/manipulation, to assure its complete traceability, as recommended by international guidelines40,41. The personnel involved in the manufacturing of FMT were not involved in any part of the clinical trial and had no contact with patients.

All colonoscopy procedures were performed in the morning, under sedation. Before colonoscopy, patients in both groups underwent bowel cleansing with 4 l of Macrogol (SELG ESSE) the day before the procedure. All procedures were performed by two expert endoscopists (G.I. and G.C.) using pediatric colonoscopes and carbon dioxide insufflation. Both fecal aliquots and placebo aliquots were delivered through the operative channel of the scope after reaching the cecum or the more proximal point of the large bowel, using 50-ml syringes filled with the infusate during colonoscopy. After the procedures, patients were monitored in the recovery room of our endoscopy center for nearly 3 hours. Patients were requested to fast for at least 6 hours after the procedure and were allowed to have a light meal thereafter.

Patients were scheduled to receive capsulized FMT, respectively, 12 weeks (±2) and 24 weeks (±2) after the first treatment. Delay in receiving the scheduled treatments longer than 2 weeks was considered a protocol deviation. Patients received a styrofoam box, filled with dry ice and 10 capsule containers. Each container included 15 capsules. Patients were instructed to put capsule containers at −20 °C (the home freezer) and to take five capsules three times a day (at least 1 hour after a meal) for 10 days, for a total of 150 capsules. Originally, we planned to give 120 capsules for each treatment cycle, but we slightly increased the number of capsules as FMT capsules needed to be filled with a slightly lower quantity of fecal material to avoid them becoming damp and then potentially identifiable by the participants. Patients were asked to report the capsule assumption and to bring back capsule containers after the end of therapy, to monitor the assumption of capsules.

Follow-up visits were performed in combination by physicians from the Gastroenterology Unit and from the Oncology Unit. Follow-up visits were scheduled at week 1, week 4, week 12, week 24 and week 52 after the first treatment, respectively. At each follow-up visit, the investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of treatments, as described in the ‘Study endpoints' subsection. Dates and status of disease progression, as well as date and type of best response, were recorded. Unscheduled follow-up visits were offered if requested by the patients.

Samples were collected during the pretreatment visits and at the planned follow-up visits by using a stool collector with a DNA/RNA Shield buffer (Zymo Research), brought directly by patients to our center in a refrigerated box within 6 hours from collection and then stored at −80 °C for up to 36 months before being shipped in dry ice to the next-generation sequencing facility of the Department of Cellular, Computational and Integrative Biology of the University of Trento (Trento, Italy) for DNA extraction and sequencing. DNA extraction consisted of sample homogenization followed by DNA isolation with the PowerSoil Pro DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen). Metagenomic sequencing libraries were prepared with the Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with a target depth of 7.5 Gbp for patient samples (n = 247) and 15 Gbp for donor samples (n = 9).

Metagenomes underwent quality control with our previously validated preprocessing pipeline (available at https://github.com/SegataLab/preprocessing). This consisted of removal of low-quality reads (Q < 20 or Q > 2 ambiguous bases or <75 bp) with TrimGalore (version 0.6.6) and removal of reads mapping against the human genome (hg19) or the Illumina spike-in phiX 174 as identified with Bowtie 2 (version 2.3.4.3). Remaining reads were sorted and split to create standard forward, reverse and unpaired quality-controlled FASTQ files for each metagenome. After this quality control, one metagenome with <3 Gbp was discarded, with the vast majority of the remaining ones (98.8%) having >7.5 Gbp (approximately 50 million reads). These were then used as input in MetaPhlAn 4 (version 4.1)11,12 using the marker genes database vJun23_202307 to generate taxonomic profiles at species-level genome bin (SGB) resolution for each sample.

DoSER was defined as the number of strains (that is, specific genomic variants within species that can be profiled at the single-nucleotide level from metagenomes) of the donor that are present in each recipient's sample after the FMT. In the case of d-FMT samples of individuals who had experienced donations from multiple aliquots, the pool of strains present in any of the received aliquots is considered in this estimation. For example, a DoSER of 50% in a sample means that half of the strains that are detectable in the administered donor's fecal samples were also observed in that specific post-FMT recipient sample. As the fraction of a patient's microbiome strain pool is also present in a different patient's microbiome, the DoSER inference can be applied to any pair of samples, including samples from unrelated individuals not linked by FMT. The DoSER on unrelated individuals (for example, the baseline of the d-FMT group) is used here to assess the baseline strain sharing in a target population (as some strains might be clonally spreading in a population, and there can be direct or indirect social interactions within populations leading to strain transmission46); it can be applied also in the case of p-FMT patients to verify the absence of a donor's effects in this arm. To detect engraftment of donor strains, we rely on our strain-sharing inference method previously reported31 plus recent improvements to the pipeline46,47. In brief, this consists of building strain-level phylogenies for all SGBs detected in the aforementioned taxonomic profiles using StrainPhlAn 4 (version 4.1)11,12. Those phylogenetic trees depict the relationship between conspecific strains detected in each sample of our cohort, with their phylogenetic distance being able to provide information on whether the same strain is observed in two samples. To reliably identify those strain-sharing events, we define SGB-specific strain boundaries. This is done by augmenting the phylogenetic trees with strains from publicly available longitudinal metagenomic datasets (n = 16 datasets including 4,322 stool metagenomes from 1,334 healthy individuals48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64) and by leveraging previous observations that, in close longitudinal samples (<6 months apart) of the same individual both having a given SGB, the same strain of that SGB will likely be observed, whereas, in unrelated (for example, from different cohorts/populations) samples having the same SGB, different strains of that SGB will likely be observed. That considered, the SGB-specific strain boundary (or strain-sharing threshold) is defined as the threshold that best separates pairwise phylogenetic distance distributions from longitudinal samples from those of unrelated samples, following criteria defined previously46. After this step, a strain-sharing matrix indicating how many strains are shared between each pair of samples in our cohort is generated. This is used to compute the DoSER, defined as the number of donor strains detected in the patients (considering all donor samples administered to the recipient up until that point) over the total number of SGBs typed at strain level in the donor. To allow comparison of the DoSER between arms, the main donor baseline aliquot administered to the d-FMT arm is used as reference for the p-FMT arm. The strain replacement rate was defined as the number of different strains profiled in longitudinal samples of the same individual over the common SGBs typed at strain level in both samples.

An online random number generator software (https://www.sealedenvelope.com) was used to provide random permuted blocks with a block size of four and an equal allocation ratio; the sequence was hidden until the interventions were assigned. Blocked randomization of patients was performed by an external individual not involved in the study.

To mask treatments to recipients, both infusate bottles and syringes were covered with dark-colored paper before the infusion, and the patients were sedated. Placebo capsules were made of cellulose and were identical in appearance to the FMT capsules, to ensure the blinding of patients and study staff. Moreover, both placebo suspension bottles and placebo capsule boxes were labeled with similar barcodes as FMT ones. Physicians who evaluated patients at follow-up (clinical outcome assessors) were blinded to administered treatments, as were authors involved in outcome analysis.

Sample size calculation was based on the hypothesis of the superiority of FMT + standard of care (SOC) over SOC alone. The 1-year PFS rate for SOC has been reported to be nearly 60%. The alternative hypothesis is that FMT can improve the 1-year PFS rate from 60% to 80% when associated with SOC. A total of 50 patients is required to enter this two-treatment, parallel-design study. The probability is 80% that the study detects a treatment difference at a one-sided 5.0% significance level, if the true hazard ratio is 0.436. This is based on the assumption that the accrual period will be 36 months, the follow-up period will be 36 months and the median survival is 15.1 months. The total number of events is expected to be 36.

Data were summarized as median and range when referred to quantitative variables and as absolute counts and percentages if related to categorical items and reported according to the randomized arm. Survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method and compared with the Breslow test. We chose this test as it gives more relevance to initial events. In our study, early disease progression would be more important than late disease progression, as the patient who experiences progression is not allowed to receive further FMTs, which are expected to strengthen the donor effect. Therefore, early events would be more important than late events in reducing the global efficacy of the donor FMT.

Median survival times were reported with their 95% CIs. A Cox proportional hazard model was implemented after checking the proportionality assumptions, and the hazard ratio with its 90% CI was presented. Differences between proportions were assessed with the chi-square test.

A non-parametric approach was followed to analyze microbiome features based on Wilcoxon signed-rank or Mann–Whitney test when applied to quantitative variables either paired or unpaired, respectively, and Fisherʼs exact test for categorical items. The PERMANOVA test evaluates whether the average microbiome structure or the compositional variability differs significantly between groups65. This test was applied on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrices to evaluate compositional microbiome differences between arms at baseline.

IBM-SPSS version 28.0 statistical software, GraphPad Prism version 10, R version 4.4.2 (‘survival' and ‘survminer' packages) and Python version 3.10.12 (‘scikit-bio' and ‘scipy' packages) were used for the analyses.

Heatmap with relative abundances of baseline patient samples. The initial donated aliquot of each donor are also shown. Species shown are the ones present at > 0.1% relative abundance in at least 30% of samples.

Species richness changes compared to baseline for the d-FMT arm (top panel) and p-FMT arm (bottom panel) at each follow-up sample collection (week-1, week-4, week-12, week-24, week-36, week-52). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to assess statistical significance.

a) Boxplots with the number of species acquired as compared to baseline at week-1 (left panel) or week-4 (right panel) for each arm comparing patients with or without PFS > 12 months. The Mann-Whitney test was applied to assess statistical significance. b) Boxplots with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity to baseline at week-1 (left panel) or week-4 (right panel) for each arm comparing patients with or without PFS > 12 months. The Mann-Whitney test was applied to assess statistical significance.

Scatterplots show the association between the mean relative abundance (log scale) of gut microbiome species in donor samples (x-axis) and their strain-level engraftment frequency (y-axis) across patients in the d-FMT arm at six post-treatment follow-ups (week-1, week-4, week-12, week-24, week-36, and week-52). Engraftment frequency was calculated as the proportion of recipients in whom a given donor strain successfully engrafted. Donor species abundances are calculated as the mean relative abundances across all donor aliquots administered to recipients up to a given timepoint. Only patients receiving donations from the main donor in the trial are included in this analysis. Statistical significance was evaluated with the Spearman's rank correlation test, with trendline and 95% confidence intervals also shown.

a) Barplots with the percentage of patients in the d-FMT arm at week-4 follow-up acquiring the donor strain of each donor species according to presence (blue) or absence (orange) of PFS > 12 months. Only species differing by at least 25% between groups are depicted. A Fisher's exact test was applied to assess statistical significance. b) Barplots with the percentage of patients in the d-FMT arm at week-4 follow-up acquiring the donor strain of each donor species according to presence (blue) or absence (orange) of PFS > 12 months. Species are ordered by the prevalence difference between groups (no - yes), with only species differing by at least 25% between groups are depicted. A Fisher's exact test was applied to assess statistical significance. Across all panels statistical significance is represented as *: p < 0.05.

a) Median PFS. In the PP population, seven of 17 patients in the d-FMT arm (41%) and 17 of 21 subjects in the p-FMT arm (81%) experienced a disease progression. Median PFS was significantly improved in the d-FMT arm (26.9 months, 95% CI 7.5-NE months) compared with the p-FMT arm (8.7 months, 95% CI 2.8-15.4 months) (HR: 0.43, 90% CI: 0.20-0.92, p = 0.028). b) Median OS. In the PP population, five of 17 patients in the d-FMT arm (29%) and 11 of 21 patients in the p-FMT arm (52%) died. Median OS was nonsignificantly longer in the d-FMT arm (41 months) than in the p-FMT arm (28.3 months) although not significantly (41 months in the d-FMT arm vs 28.3 months in the p-FMT arm, HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.99, p = 0.146). The Breslow test was used for the statistical analyses.

a) Median PFS. In the ITT population, median PFS was longer in the d-FMT arm (23.2 months, 95% CI: 7.4-39.1 months) than in the p-FMT arm (9.2 months, 95% CI: 0-20.5 months), although nonsignificantly (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.33-1.35, p = 0.18; b) Median OS. Median OS was nonsignificantly longer in the d-FMT arm (40.9 months, 95% CI: 39.2-42.7) than in the p-FMT arm (28.2 months, 95% CI: 20.1-36.5) (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.20-1.30, p = 0.146). The Breslow test was used for the statistical analyses.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) improve outcomes in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) but are hindered by immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Modulation of the gut microbiome may enhance efficacy and mitigate toxicity, yet the safety and mechanisms of healthy donor fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mRCC remain unexplored. In this phase 1 trial, 20 treatment-naive patients with mRCC received encapsulated healthy donor FMT (LND101) combined with ipilimumab/nivolumab (n = 16), pembrolizumab/axitinib (n = 3) or pembrolizumab/lenvatinib (n = 1). The primary endpoint was safety, defined by the incidence and severity of irAEs. Secondary endpoints included clinical response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1), gut microbiome and immune correlates and patient-reported quality of life. The safety endpoint was met with 50% (10/20) of patients experiencing grade 3 irAEs and no serious FMT-related toxicities or grade 4 or 5 irAEs. Among evaluable patients, the objective response rate was 50% (9/18), including two complete responses (11%, 2/18). Notably, most treatment responders did not develop any grade 3 or higher irAEs. Alpha (α) diversity improvement and durable engraftment of taxa and metabolic functions associated with anti-inflammatory properties correlated with reduced toxicity and improved response. Conversely, patients experiencing grade 3 irAEs exhibited expansion of Segatella copri, particularly with ipilimumab/nivolumab, and elevated levels of donor-derived microbial enzymes previously linked to pro-inflammatory activity. Resilience to toxicity correlated with the maintenance of protective metabolites and increased levels of immune regulatory cells, whereas the presence of grade 3 irAEs and S. copri enrichment was associated with high immune dysregulation. These findings demonstrate the safety and potential for functional microbiome engraftment to optimize response and minimize toxicity in ICI-treated mRCC. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04163289.

ICIs have transformed the management of mRCC, yielding durable responses and improved survival in a subset of patients1. However, most patients ultimately succumb to mRCC within 5 years2, and many experience a range of irAEs, including life-threatening toxicities that may require treatment interruption, discontinuation or immunosuppressive therapy, potentially compromising outcomes3,4. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for strategies that can both mitigate treatment-limiting toxicity and augment ICI efficacy.

The composition and functional capacity of gut microbiota are recognized as critical determinants of antitumor immunity, particularly in the context of ICI therapy, through the production of immunomodulatory metabolites and direct interaction with host immune cells5,6,7,8,9,10. The microbiome also appears to influence the risk of irAEs, suggesting a role for microbiota-targeted strategies in toxicity management and efficacy11,12,13.

Recent studies have provided proof of concept for microbiome modulation as a therapeutic adjunct in melanoma14,15 and mRCC16. FMT from healthy donors demonstrated efficacy in resolving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-induced diarrhea and restoring immune homeostasis in patients experiencing severe irAEs17,18,19. Moreover, the use of live biotherapeutic products, such as CBM588, has shown promise in enhancing clinical outcomes in mRCC20.

These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of microbiome-based interventions in reducing treatment-related toxicity and improving outcomes in mRCC. However, the safety and clinical activity of healthy donor FMT in mRCC remain unexplored, and its mechanism of action is unclear.

In this phase 1, single-center trial, we report the safety, preliminary efficacy and exploratory translational analyses of combining LND101—a healthy donor-derived encapsulated FMT product—with ICI-based regimens in previously untreated mRCC. Through an integrated analysis of clinical, microbiome, metabolomics and immune profiling data, this study elucidates key microbial and host determinants of toxicity and response, providing a foundation for rational development of next-generation microbiome-augmented, immune-based combination therapies.

PERFORM is an open-label, single-center, phase 1 trial evaluating the safety, feasibility and preliminary activity of LND101—an encapsulated healthy donor FMT product—administered prior to and during ICI-based therapy in previously untreated mRCC. Between 13 February 2020 and 28 November 2023, 20 patients were enrolled in the PERFORM trial (Fig. 1a). Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmed advanced or mRCC classified as intermediate-risk or poor-risk disease by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria21 with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and adequate organ function. Key exclusions included prior systemic therapy for advanced disease, recent antibiotic use, active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppression, chronic gastrointestinal disorders, active infection or contraindications to FMT.

The primary endpoint was safety, defined as the incidence and severity of irAEs based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). Secondary endpoints included the incidence of grade 3 or higher irAEs, objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), longitudinal effects of FMT on gut microbiome composition, circulating metabolites, cytokines, immune cell subsets and health-related quality of life assessed by EuroQol health questionnaire instruments (EQ-5D-5L). Exploratory endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival and multiomics integration to identify microbial and immune correlates of toxicity and response. Tumor tissue analyses and long-term clinical outcomes beyond the current data cutoff prespecified in the trial protocol were not included in this report.

At data cutoff (30 May 2025), median follow-up was 21.9 months (range, 5.6−53.3), and five patients (25%) remained on systemic therapy. Median time on treatment from first FMT was 13.4 months (range, 0.3−53.2). The median age was 60 years (range, 47−71); 16 patients (80%) were male, and four (20%) were female. Nineteen patients (95%) had clear cell histology, and one (5%) had unclassified RCC, histologic grade 4, with nuclear pleomorphism and multinuclear giant cells showing rhabdoid and sarcomatoid differentiation; and 12 patients (60%) had stage IV disease at presentation (Table 1). Two patients received antibiotics during the course of the trial (patient 4, prophylactically with steroids after cycle 1; patient 13, after cycle 3 of ipilimumab/nivolumab).

Seven rigorously screened healthy donors (median age, 35 years) provided stool22,23 (Supplementary Table 1). Each patient received one full dose and two half-doses of oral encapsulated FMT (LND101) from a single donor. A polyethylene glycol-based bowel preparation was administered before the first FMT only. The full dose comprised 36−40 capsules (80−100 g of stool), followed by two half-doses of 20−25 capsules each (50−60 g of stool). Patients subsequently received ipilimumab/nivolumab (n = 16), pembrolizumab/axitinib (n = 3) or pembrolizumab/lenvatinib (n = 1) at least 7 days after the first FMT, continuing until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (Fig. 1b). Biological samples (blood and stool) were collected from patients at prespecified timepoints (Extended Data Fig. 1a).

All 20 patients were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population for safety analysis, which was the primary endpoint and defined in the protocol as the incidence and severity of irAEs. The only FMT-related toxicity was a grade 1 gastrointestinal event in one patient (5%) (Table 2). Fifteen patients (75%) completed all three planned FMT doses. Five patients did not complete all three planned FMT doses: three (patients 2, 4 and 9) due to immune-related colitis, one (patient 16) because the FMT donor tested positive for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and one (patient 20) due to immune-related arthritis. None of these events was attributed to FMT-related toxicity. Except for the Shiga toxin finding, dosing was withheld out of caution for ICI-related toxicities rather than FMT.

Any-grade irAEs occurred in 17 patients (85%), mostly within 3 months of ICI initiation (Table 2). Grade 3 irAEs occurred in 10 patients (50%), including colitis (n = 6), diarrhea (n = 3), arthritis (n = 1), rash (n = 1), anorexia (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), immune-related pain (n = 1), transaminitis (n = 1) and hyperglycemia (n = 1); all required treatment interruption or discontinuation (Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Among patients receiving pembrolizumab/axitinib or pembrolizumab/lenvatinib (n = 4; patients 10, 11, 15 and 18), no grade 3 or higher irAEs occurred. No grade 4−5 or unexpected toxicities related to FMT or systemic therapy were observed.

Radiographic assessments were performed every 12 weeks using RECIST v1.1 (ref. 24). Two patients (3 and 15) had no measurable disease at baseline and were excluded from response or PFS analyses but remained in safety monitoring (primary endpoint), overall survival analysis and exploratory translational assessments. Thus, efficacy analyses were conducted in the per-protocol population (n = 18).

Among 18 evaluable patients, nine (50%) achieved an objective response, including two complete responses (CRs) (11%), and six (33%) had primary progressive disease (PD) as best response. Twelve patients (67%) achieved clinical benefit, defined as CR, partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) ≥6 months (Fig. 1c−e). To assess donor influence on efficacy, we stratified patients by donor and averaged their best overall response (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Clinical response was observed in recipients of FMT from five of the seven donors (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Of the two patients with non-measurable disease, patient 3 discontinued ipilimumab/nivolumab after 8 months due to toxicity and remains progression free at 54 months. Patient 15 completed pembrolizumab and continues axitinib without progression at 32 months.

Only one of nine responders (11%) experienced grade 3 irAEs. By contrast, eight of the nine non-responders (89%) developed grade 3 irAEs, including six with grade 3 colitis. A two-sided χ2 test with Yates' correction confirmed a significant association between response and toxicity (χ2 = 8.00, P = 0.005), with responders showing fewer grade 3 irAEs (Fig. 1f). After a median follow-up of 21.9 months, median PFS was 11.15 months in the per-protocol population (n = 18), and median overall survival was 36 months in the ITT population (n = 20) (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e).

At baseline, most patients reported no limitations in mobility, self-care or daily activities, and 40% reported mild anxiety/depression. Median baseline Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was 73. Over the first four cycles, quality of life remained stable, with no evidence of FMT-related decline (median VAS change +2) (Extended Data Table 1a). Patients who developed grade 3 irAEs had persistently lower global health scores and more functional impairments compared to those without, consistent with the burden of toxicity rather than FMT (Extended Data Table 1b).

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal samples from patients at five timepoints and their respective FMT donors (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1a). At baseline and after FMT, there were no significant differences in α-diversity between patients and donors (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Baseline diversity also did not differ between patients who developed grade 3 irAEs and those who did not. Prior to the fourth immunotherapy dose (week 10), patients without grade 3 irAEs exhibited significantly higher gut microbial diversity by the Shannon (Fig. 2a) and inverse Simpson (Extended Data Fig. 2c) indices. This suggests that more even and diverse microbial communities after FMT are associated with less severe toxicity. Responders similarly showed significantly higher α-diversity than non-responders at 10 weeks after FMT (Fig. 2b).

One-way ANOVA was used to compare diversity across clinical subgroups at each timepoint, followed by Tukey's HSD test for pair-wise comparisons. Adjusted P < 0.05 values for multiple testing are shown. Variability is normalized to baseline Bray−Curtis dissimilarity to their respective donor between patients with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) grade 3 irAEs (c) and between R (n = 9) and NR (n = 9) patients (d). Each line represents one patient. Mean and s.e.m. are represented. Statistically significant within-group comparisons from baseline to later timepoints, as well as between groups at T4 and T5, are shown. P values were calculated using the paired t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (based on Shapiro−Wilk test) with FDR correction for within-group comparisons and between-group comparisons. Variability of strain engraftment rate (the number of engrafted strains after FMT divided by the number of strains that could engraft from the donor) over time between patients with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) grade 3 irAEs (e) and between R (n = 9) and NR(n = 9) patients (f). Each dotted line represents one patient. Mean and s.e.m. are represented. Statistically significant within-group comparisons from baseline to later timepoints, as well as between groups, are shown.

Box plot bounds represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, with the central line representing the median and the whiskers representing the maximum or minimum values within 1.5× interquartile range. Points outside this range are shown as outliers.

Normalized Bray−Curtis dissimilarity of the overall cohort did not show a significant shift of microbiome after FMT in patients (Extended Data Fig. 2d). However, patients with grade 3 irAEs displayed a transient moderate donor-like shift 1 week after FMT that was not sustained, with progressive divergence over time despite two subsequent half-doses (Fig. 2c). By contrast, those without grade 3 irAEs exhibited a modest but consistent reduction in dissimilarity, becoming significantly more donor-like by week 10 (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2e).

Similar to patients with grade 3 irAEs, non-responders demonstrated a transient reduction in dissimilarity 1 week after FMT that was not maintained over time. By contrast, responders exhibited a progressive and sustained reduction in dissimilarity, culminating in significantly greater donor−recipient similarity at week 10 after FMT (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2f). These results were validated by the Jaccard index, a complementary beta (β) diversity metric based on the shared presence or absence of microbial taxa (Extended Data Fig. 2g,h).

Strain engraftment of the overall cohort revealed a significant engraftment of donor strains in recipients (Extended Data Fig. 3a). The subset analysis showed that both patient groups (with and without grade 3 irAEs) demonstrated acquisition of donor strains over time (Fig. 2e). As most patients without grade 3 irAEs were also classified as responders, we compared strain-level engraftment by response status. Consistent with the toxicity analysis, both groups showed evidence of donor strain acquisition; however, responders exhibited significantly higher engraftment 7 weeks after FMT compared to non-responders (Fig. 2f).

Analysis of β-diversity profiles at baseline and 10 weeks after FMT revealed substantial overlap at baseline, with no clear compositional separation between patients who later developed grade 3 irAEs and those who did not (Fig. 2g). However, by 10 weeks after FMT, we observed a divergence in microbial community structure between the two groups (Fig. 2h), suggesting that the engrafted microbiome evolved differently in patients depending on the levels of toxicity experienced. To identify microbial species driving this divergence, we performed β-diversity ordination with fitted vectors for influential taxa. This analysis demonstrated that taxa such as Segatella copri, Prevotella sp. Marseille-P4119 and Parabacteroides massiliensis were most influential in patients with grade 3 irAEs, whereas Alistipes finegoldii and Barnesiella intestinihominis contributed to the community shift in patients without grade 3 irAEs (Fig. 3a).

Analysis of the differential abundance among patients with or without grade 3 irAEs after FMT revealed that patients with grade 3 irAEs exhibited marked enrichment of S. copri at 10 weeks after FMT. By contrast, patients without severe irAEs demonstrated increased abundance of several short-chain fatty acid-producing taxa with known anti-inflammatory properties, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium siraeum and Oscillospiraceae bacterium (Fig. 3b)25,26,27.

To determine whether functional engraftment paralleled taxonomic shifts, we profiled longitudinal donor−patient dissimilarity using Enzyme Commission (EC) annotations and Aitchison distance. After FMT, the overall cohort did not shift in its distance to the donor compared to the baseline standing (Extended Data Fig. 3b). However, subset analysis revealed that patients without grade 3 irAEs progressively acquired a donor-like functional profile. By contrast, those with grade 3 irAEs showed increasing divergence from their donors over time, indicating failed functional engraftment. The divergence between the two groups reached statistical significance at week 7 after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), supporting a link between global functional engraftment and protection from irAEs. Stratification by clinical subgroup further revealed that non-responders with grade 3 irAEs (NR-G3 irAEs) exhibited increasing functional dissimilarity from their donors. By contrast, responders without grade 3 irAEs (R-No-G3 irAEs) showed a durable shift toward donor-like EC profiles (Extended Data Fig. 3e).

Although patients without grade 3 irAEs acquired higher overall compositional similarity with their donors (Fig. 2c), both groups exhibited donor−strain engraftment over time (Fig. 2e). To identify specific functional traits transferred from donors and their relationship to toxicity, we performed targeted metagenomic analysis using Multivariate Association with Linear Model, version 3 (MaAsLin3)28, applying stringent significance and effect size thresholds to identify EC activities that (1) were differentially abundant in donors associated with each toxicity group and (2) retained this pattern in corresponding patients 10 weeks after FMT. Several key enzymes—including branched-chain amino acid transaminase (EC 2.6.1.42; amino acid and nitrogen metabolism), arginine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.19; β-polyamine and arginine catabolism) and uridine diphosphate-N-acetylmuramate:L-alanine ligase (EC 6.3.2.8; peptidoglycan biosynthesis and cell wall assembly)—were significantly higher in donors whose microbiota were transplanted into patients who subsequently developed grade 3 irAEs, compared to donors for patients without severe toxicity (Extended Data Fig. 4). These donor-specific functional signatures were faithfully engrafted in the respective recipients, indicating robust transfer of relevant microbial pathways that may influence clinical outcomes, even with incomplete taxonomic engraftment. Conversely, patients receiving FMT from donors with low abundance of these pro-inflammatory or stress-adaptive enzymes maintained lower levels after FMT and did not develop grade 3 irAEs.

Taxonomic profiling identified S. copri as the predominant taxon enriched in three FMT donors (1, 5 and 11) (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Supervised β-diversity analysis based on S. copri presence showed distinct clustering for these donors relative to others (Extended Data Fig. 5b).

Patients harboring S. copri at baseline who received FMT from S. copri-high donors exhibited marked enrichment of this species over time (Extended Data Fig. 5c). S. copri enrichment correlated with grade 3 irAEs (Fig. 3a,b); however, given its baseline prevalence in patients, we performed strain-level tracking to clarify its engraftment dynamics.

Metagenomics profiling showed that patients with S. copri exceeding 10 counts per million (CPM) at 10 weeks after FMT were more likely to develop grade 3 irAEs, regardless of donor or recipient origin (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 5d). Notably, at the strain level, our analysis revealed that the majority of S. copri detected at 10 weeks after FMT originated from donors 1 and 5 (Fig. 3d). Two patients (15 and 18) with high S. copri did not develop grade 3 irAEs—one donor-derived, one self-enriched—prompting assessment of treatment effects. Analysis revealed that only patients receiving ipilimumab developed grade 3 irAEs, particularly colitis, in the context of high S. copri abundance higher than 10 CPM, irrespective of S. copri source (Fig. 3e).

To validate the role of ipilimumab, we analyzed data from our MIMic trial29, in which donors 1 and 5 participated. Among melanoma recipients of FMT + anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), S. copri levels did not differ by toxicity, and some patients without irAEs had high abundance (Extended Data Fig. 5e).

Because most responders in the PERFORM trial did not develop grade 3 irAEs, we examined S. copri and therapeutic response. Among patients with S. copri >10 CPM receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab, only one responded (Fig. 3f), suggesting that S. copri enrichment under dual ICI associates with resistance in mRCC.

To contextualize these findings, we compared S. copri−response associations across three melanoma FMT trials14,15,29. Notably, patients in the Baruch et al.14 and Davar et al.15 studies, which used patient donors, exhibited higher median post-FMT levels of S. copri compared to those in the MIMic trial that used healthy donors (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Accordingly, we analyzed the MIMic cohort separately, which showed no difference in S. copri levels among responders and non-responders after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 6b). By contrast, in the Baruch et al. and Davar et al. trials, non-responders had significantly higher S. copri levels after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 6c).

To determine the effect of FMT on systemic immune and inflammatory pathways as a secondary endpoint, we profiled plasma metabolites of patients at all five timepoints, using targeted liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (LC−MS/MS). In patients without grade 3 irAEs, targeted plasma metabolomic profiling revealed preservation or increases in a range of metabolites previously associated with immune function30,31,32 (Fig. 4a). At 10 weeks after FMT, these patients maintained significantly higher circulating levels of cortisol, stearoylcarnitine, L-histidine, L-cysteine, inosine triphosphate (ITP), pyruvic acid, isocitric acid and citraconic acid (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). By contrast, patients with grade 3 irAEs showed significantly decreased plasma levels of these metabolites over time. Stearoylcarnitine and ITP were also enriched in responders 10 weeks after FMT, similar to patients without grade 3 irAEs (Fig. 4c). Moreover, high levels of plasma metabolites such as vitamin A, isocitric acid and stearoylcarnitine after FMT correlated with response, improved PFS and no grade 3 irAEs (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 6f−h).

Statistical analysis was conducted using two-sided unpaired t-tests with Benjamini−Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons.

Analysis of the plasma metabolomic profile of patients with high and low S. copri levels who received ipilimumab/nivolumab revealed distinct metabolic signatures (Fig. 4f). Patients with S. copri CPM > 10 exhibited increased levels of indoxyl sulfate and 3-aminoisobutanoic acid and decreased levels of ceramide (d18:1/16:0) and sphingosine-1-phosphate, compared to patients with S. copri CPM < 10. These differences highlight a shift toward a more pro-inflammatory and metabolically dysregulated plasma profile in the S. copri-high group (Fig. 4f).

We performed immune profiling of patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by flow cytometry and quantified plasma cytokines and chemokines to assess systemic immune effects of FMT and immune-based therapy as a secondary endpoint. Unsupervised t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis of CD3+ T cells identified two subpopulations (TC1 and TC2) enriched in patients with grade 3 irAEs. TC1, comprising memory CD8+CD45RO+CD45RA−CD38+HLA-DR+ICOS+/− cells, was significantly elevated at 10 weeks after FMT compared to patients without grade 3 irAEs (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b and Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, TC2 (memory CD4+CD45RO+CD45RA−CD38+HLA-DR+ICOS−) increased only in patients with grade 3 irAEs (Extended Data Fig. 7a,c and Supplementary Table 2). Supervised analysis showed that CD38+ expression on regulatory T (Treg) cells, linked to immunosuppressive activity, rose longitudinally in patients without grade 3 irAEs but was transient in those with toxicity (Extended Data Fig. 7d)33.

Patients with grade 3 irAEs also exhibited reduced circulating immunoregulatory CD56++CD16− natural killer (NK) cells alongside diminished DNAM1 expression, a marker of NK cell function and cytokine production capacity, at 10 weeks after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f)34.

By contrast, patients without grade 3 irAEs showed increased monocyte subpopulation M2 at 10 weeks after FMT, representing non-classical monocytes (CD14−CD16++CSF1RLowCD163−CD40+DNAM1−HLA-DRLowCD33−) (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h and Supplementary Table 3), whereas those with grade 3 irAEs displayed higher CD163 expression on intermediate monocytes (Extended Data Fig. 7i).

Similar to patients with grade 3 irAEs, the TC1 subpopulation was moderately elevated in non-responders versus responders and lacked CD38+ Treg expansion (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). Additionally, DNAM1 expression on CD56++CD16− NK cells decreased in non-responders 10 weeks after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 7l).

Immune profiling by S. copri status in patients receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab revealed distinct immune signatures: the TC1 subpopulation expanded in the S. copri-high patients, paralleling grade 3 irAEs and non-responders (Extended Data Fig. 8a).

S. copri-low patients also showed increasing conventional memory cells (CD4+CD45RO+CD45RA−, CD8+CD45RO+CD45RA−) and declining naive T cells (CD4+CD45RA+CD45RO− and CD8+CD45RA+CD45RO−) (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

In S. copri-low patients, DNAM1 expression on all monocyte subsets declined moderately, whereas CD163 and CD33 increased on intermediate monocytes in S. copri-high patients (Extended Data Fig. 8c−f). Additionally, S. copri-high patients showed decreased CD56++CD16− NK cells, unlike the S. copri-low group (Extended Data Fig. 8g). Overall, S. copri-high patients mirrored the immune phenotype of grade 3 irAEs, with elevated CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ memory cells, upregulated immunosuppressive monocyte markers and loss of regulatory NK cells.

At 10 weeks after FMT, patients with grade 3 irAEs exhibited elevated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a driver of neutrophil-mediated inflammation, along with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) and reduced CCL22, a Treg-recruiting chemokine. By contrast, patients without grade 3 irAEs had higher levels of tissue repair and immunoregulatory factors, including EGF and CCL22 (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Similarly, responders showed elevated EGF and CCL22, as well as increased interleukin-7 (IL-7) and CCL4, whereas interleukin-27 (IL-27) was elevated in non-responders (Extended Data Fig. 8i). Finally, S. copri-high patients demonstrated increased IL-10 and IFNα2 at 10 weeks after FMT compared to baseline, a change not observed in S. copri-low patients (Extended Data Fig. 8j).

This phase 1 study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of combining healthy donor-derived encapsulated FMT (LND101) with ICI-based therapy in mRCC. FMT did not increase the incidence or severity of irAEs, and the overall toxicity profile aligned with expectations for each standard regimen, supporting that LND101 can be safely integrated into ICI therapy. Patient-reported outcomes further confirmed that encapsulated FMT did not impair quality of life. Most patients achieved clinical benefit despite intermediate-risk or poor-risk disease, and most responders remained free from severe toxicity—a novel observation in mRCC35,36 suggesting that healthy donor FMT may enhance efficacy while mitigating irAEs.

These positive effects require not only the successful engraftment of a diverse array of microbial taxa but also the transfer and maintenance of key anti-inflammatory microbial functions. Patients with higher α-diversity and greater functional engraftment—particularly of short-chain fatty acid-producing and anti-inflammatory taxa—were largely protected from severe irAEs and more likely to respond to treatment. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the development of grade 3 irAEs itself contributes to reduced diversity, for example, through inflammation.

Conversely, expansion of the pro-inflammatory taxon S. copri characterized patients with grade 3 irAEs. A threshold abundance higher than 10 CPM at 10 weeks after FMT predicted severe toxicity in patients receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab, regardless of whether S. copri originated from donor or recipient microbiota, highlighting the clinical relevance of both donor screening and post-FMT monitoring of this taxon in patients. By contrast, F. prausnitzii, a butyrate-producing commensal with anti-inflammatory properties, was enriched in patients without severe toxicity. Preclinical work shows that F. prausnitzii supplementation mitigates ICI-induced colitis while maintaining antitumor activity37. In addition, live biotherapeutic formulations of F. prausnitzii (for example, EXL01; Exeliom Biosciences) are under clinical development as adjuvants to ICI therapy38. Our findings suggest that F. prausnitzii may represent both a biomarker of resilience to toxicity and a therapeutic strategy for mitigating irAEs.

Our findings support a model wherein engraftment of a diverse, functionally balanced microbiome confers resilience against immune-mediated toxicity and enhances response, whereas the overrepresentation of pro-inflammatory species such as S. copri—particularly at critical abundance thresholds—predisposes to dysregulated immunity, increased irAEs and diminished therapeutic benefit. These insights underscore the importance of both taxonomic and functional criteria in the rational selection of FMT donors and the design of future microbiome-based interventions (Extended Data Fig. 9).

Preservation of gut microbial diversity—particularly higher α-diversity after FMT—was associated with both favorable clinical response and reduced toxicity. Patients without grade 3 irAEs demonstrated more durable donor microbiome engraftment compared to those who developed toxicity. This pattern of durable engraftment was also present among responders, including robust strain-level engraftment. Notably, patients without grade 3 irAEs also exhibited greater functional engraftment, as evidenced by the acquisition of beneficial metabolic pathways from donor microbiota.

Targeted analysis of enzyme activities revealed that donors associated with toxicity-free outcomes harbored lower levels of microbial enzymes that promote bacterial stress tolerance and the production of immunostimulatory microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), including peptidoglycan fragments and lipopolysaccharides39,40. By contrast, enrichment of these pro-inflammatory metabolic pathways in donors linked to grade 3 irAEs may contribute to heightened mucosal immune activation and increased susceptibility to irAEs after FMT.

The nature and extent of functional engraftment, rather than taxonomic engraftment alone, emerged as a key determinant of clinical outcomes, underscoring the need to consider microbial metabolic capacity in donor selection and the design of FMT products.

Our study also provides new mechanistic insights into the role of S. copri in modulating toxicity and resistance to combination immunotherapy. High levels of S. copri in donor or recipient microbiomes strongly associated with grade 3 irAEs in patients receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab. Strain-level tracking revealed that S. copri enrichment in recipients was primarily derived from donors, further supporting the causative role of this taxon in adverse outcomes. Although S. copri is frequently present at baseline, our data suggest that its expansion under the selective pressure of FMT and dual ICI therapy drives a dysregulated immune environment predisposing to resistance and toxicity. Consistent with this, in our prior FMT trial using healthy donors and single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy, S. copri abundance was not associated with increased toxicity or resistance; however, increased S. copri after FMT was observed in patients with melanoma in the refractory setting who received FMT from patient donors and remained resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy, underscoring the context-specific effects of this taxon in ICI therapy.

Metabolomic profiling highlighted protective metabolic adaptations in patients without severe toxicity who maintained or had increased plasma levels of metabolites central to immune regulation, cellular stress response and energy production—including cortisol, L-histidine, L-cysteine, stearoylcarnitine and pyruvic acid—whereas patients with grade 3 irAEs showed significant depletion. These findings highlight a distinctive metabolic profile in patients protected from severe toxicity, supporting the hypothesis that maintenance of specific metabolic pathways underlies resilience to immune-mediated injury and favorable outcomes with FMT and ICI therapy. We previously reported increased L-histidine levels in responder patients with melanoma after FMT29. In the PERFORM trial, most responders also avoided grade 3 irAEs, suggesting a potential protective role for L-histidine after FMT in patients with cancer.

We also observed a post-treatment decrease in plasma homocysteine among patients without grade 3 or higher irAEs and treatment responders. Homocysteine is a pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory metabolite of one-carbon/sulfur amino acid metabolism, and elevated levels have been linked to endothelial dysfunction and increased cytokine production41,42. Gut microbiota disturbances (dysbiosis) can impair B vitamin (folate/B12) and sulfur amino acid metabolism, thereby driving hyperhomocysteinemia, increased intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation43. By restoring microbial−host metabolic homeostasis via healthy donor FMT, our findings suggest that lowering homocysteine may reflect a reduced inflammatory milieu that corresponds with both fewer severe irAEs and improved tumor response.

Immune profiling revealed systemic differences associated with grade 3 irAEs. Elevated CD38+ and HLA-DR+ memory T cells—previously linked to severe irAEs in melanoma44,45—were also increased in patients with grade 3 irAEs and in those with high S. copri levels 10 weeks after FMT, represented by TC1 and TC2 subpopulations. The TC1 subpopulation was likewise enriched in non-responders, consistent with reports that dysfunctional CD38+CD8+ cells confer resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy46. Notably, although TC1 cells also rose longitudinally in patients without grade 3 irAEs, this group uniquely displayed a sustained increase in CD38+ Treg cells, which may protect against excessive inflammation—an effect absent in patients who developed irAEs. This pattern mirrors melanoma cohorts, where CD38+HLA-DR+ memory T cell expansion alongside Treg loss has been associated with irAEs during ICI therapy45. Elevated CCL22 in patients without grade 3 irAEs and in responders may facilitate Treg recruitment47. Consistently, CD38+ Treg cells were enriched in responders after FMT, aligning with evidence that systemic Treg expansion associates with improved ICI responses in melanoma48.

Beyond divergent T cell responses, systemic changes were also evident in monocytes and NK cells. Sustained DNAM1 expression on monocytes in patients with high S. copri may facilitate extravasation into inflamed tissues and contribute to irAEs, whereas enrichment of immunosuppressive markers (CD163 and CD33) on intermediate monocytes and elevated IL-10 in patients with grade 3 irAEs or high S. copri suggest a compensatory response to tissue damage and immune activation49. By contrast, non-classical monocytes (M2 subpopulation) were elevated in patients without grade 3 irAEs, potentially protecting against gastrointestinal toxicities alongside CD38+ Treg cells. These non-classical monocytes have been linked to tissue repair and inflammation resolution in inflammatory bowel diease50. Additionally, higher EGF and sphingosine-1-phosphate in patients without grade 3 irAES or low S. copri may suppress immune-related colitis by promoting epithelial regeneration, barrier integrity and anti-inflammatory macrophages51. Together, these findings suggest that distinct monocyte trajectories are associated with the development of irAEs after FMT.

Patients with grade 3 irAEs and high S. copri levels and non-responders exhibited a marked loss of circulating immunoregulatory NK cells (CD56++CD16−) with reduced DNAM1 expression, indicating altered NK maturation and function. This depletion may be driven by elevated NK-activating cytokines such as IFNα2, observed in S. copri-high patients, and could promote both resistance and irAEs, including TH1-mediated colitis34. Overall, patients with grade 3 irAEs and high S. copri levels at 10 weeks after FMT displayed an expansion of CD38+HLA-DR+ICOS+/− CD8+ memory T cells, accompanied by a loss of immunoregulatory CD56++CD16− NK cells, and exhibited a shift in the immunosuppressive state of monocytes. Together, this imbalance may create an immune milieu unable to restrain excessive activation, predisposing S. copri-high patients to irAEs and reduced therapeutic response. Larger datasets are required to validate these findings.

Findings from the FMT-LUMINATE trial (NCT04951583) further implicate S. copri in irAEs: patients with melanoma receiving FMT from S. copri-high donors developed irAEs, whereas pembrolizumab-treated patients with lung cancer receiving FMT from the same donor did not52. The trial also showed that LND101 can eliminate potentially harmful bacteria in responders.

In summary, our integrated multiomics analysis demonstrates, to our knowledge for the first time, that successful and durable functional engraftment of a diverse, anti-inflammatory microbiome is associated with improved clinical response and reduced toxicity in patients with mRCC receiving FMT and ICI-based therapy. The use of healthy donors allows scalable FMT programs for clinical trials, and encapsulated FMT offers a more patient-friendly alternative to traditional endoscopic delivery (Extended Data Fig. 9). Together, our results underscore the importance of functional donor screening and targeted modulation of the microbiome in optimizing the safety and efficacy of next-generation immune-based therapies. However, our study was not powered to define the ideal donor microbiome composition to enhance immunotherapy efficacy without additional toxicities, and the small sample size is the primary limitation of our study. Validation in larger, multicenter trials is necessary to refine donor selection, clarify microbiome−immunity mechanisms and confirm these exploratory findings.

The PERFORM trial (NCT04163289) is an open-label, single-center, phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of LND101—a healthy donor-derived microbiome transplantation product—in combination with doublet immunotherapy or immunotherapy plus targeted therapy in patients with mRCC. The study was conducted at the London Health Sciences Centre after approval by the Western University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board, in accordance with applicable national and international regulatory guidelines. These included the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (C.05.001), the United States Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Part 56), the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Administrative oversight was provided by the Clinical Research Unit at the Verspeeten Family Cancer Centre, which also established a data safety monitoring committee (DSMC) to provide independent oversight to ensure participant safety and protocol adherence.

All 20 enrolled participants were adults with mRCC. Sixteen (80%) were male and four (20%) were female. The median age was 60 years (range, 47−71). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with institutional research ethics board approval and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Participants did not receive financial compensation for enrollment or participation in the study.

Sex was recorded for all participants based on self-report at enrollment. Gender identity was not separately collected, consistent with institutional clinical trial standards during the study period. Sex was not used as an inclusion or exclusion criterion, and the study was not powered to evaluate sex-based differences in safety, clinical outcomes, microbiome engraftment or immune correlates. Therefore, no sex-stratified analyses were performed. The unequal distribution of males and females (16 males and four females) further limited the feasibility of such analyses. However, sex distribution is reported transparently, and future larger studies will be required to assess potential sex-related differences.

Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed advanced (not amenable to curative surgery or radiation) or metastatic RCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IV), classified as favorable, intermediate-risk or poor-risk disease according to IMDC criteria, which consider time from diagnosis to treatment <1 year, hemoglobin below the lower limit of normal, corrected calcium >10 mg dl−1, elevated neutrophil or platelet counts and Karnofsky performance status <80%. Additional requirements were investigator-assessed evaluable disease, ability to ingest oral capsules, provision of written informed consent, acknowledgment of potential non-infectious risks of FMT and recovery to baseline or ≤grade 1 toxicity (per CTCAE v5.0) from prior treatments unless adverse events were clinically insignificant. Adequate organ and marrow function was required, defined by absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mm3 without growth factor support, white blood cell count ≥2,000/mm3, platelets ≥100,000/mm3 without transfusion, hemoglobin ≥9 g dl−1 without transfusion, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤3× the upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤1.5× ULN (≤3× ULN in patients with Gilbert syndrome) and serum creatinine ≤1.5× ULN or creatinine clearance ≥40 ml min−1 calculated by the Cockcroft−Gault equation.

Patients were excluded if they had received prior systemic therapy for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic RCC, including investigational agents, or if they had received radiation therapy for bone metastases within 2 weeks or any other radiotherapy within 4 weeks of study entry. Exclusions also applied to patients with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior radiotherapy, those who were pregnant or breastfeeding or those planning to conceive during the study or within 120 days after the last immunotherapy dose. Additional exclusions included known immunodeficiency (for example, HIV infection or prior transplantation), systemic corticosteroid use >10 mg of prednisone equivalent daily or other immunosuppressive therapy (with allowances for adrenal replacement, short-term prophylaxis or inhaled/topical formulations) and systemic antibiotic use within 2 weeks of the first FMT. Patients with chronic intestinal disease (including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption or colonic tumors) or absolute contraindications to FMT (such as toxic megacolon or severe dietary allergies including shellfish, nuts or seafood) were not eligible. Use of concurrent systemic or local antineoplastic therapy was prohibited, although concurrent bisphosphonate or denosumab for bone metastases was permitted.

Other exclusions included active central nervous system metastases or leptomeningeal disease unless stable (≥4 weeks after radiotherapy or ≥8 weeks after major surgery), active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids or immunosuppressants (except vitiligo, type 1 diabetes or resolved childhood asthma/atopy), history of non-infectious pneumonitis requiring steroids or current pneumonitis, serious uncontrolled comorbidities (for example, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, ischemia, arrhythmia, bleeding disorders, severe pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disorders or active systemic infection, including hepatitis B or C) and active infection requiring systemic therapy. Patients who had received live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of treatment initiation were excluded, although inactivated injectable influenza vaccines were permitted while intranasal live attenuated vaccines were prohibited. Additional exclusions included psychiatric or substance use disorders likely to interfere with study compliance and concurrent use of probiotic-containing food products during immunotherapy.

The planned enrollment for the trial was 20 patients, determined prior to the first participant's inclusion. The rationale for the sample size was that, at the time the study was initiated, there were no existing publications assessing the use of encapsulated FMT (LND101) in combination with doublet immunotherapy or immunotherapy plus targeted therapy in this patient population.

Given the novelty of the approach and the fact that this was the first study of encapsulated healthy donor FMT in combination with ICI-based regimens in mRCC, no formal statistical calculation could be applied to determine sample size. Instead, the rationale was safety-driven: a cohort of 20 patients was considered adequate to detect an unforeseen safety signal yet small enough to avoid and limit unnecessary exposure should the intervention prove unsafe or detrimental. Thus, 20 patients were determined to provide an appropriate balance between patient safety and the ability to generate meaningful preliminary safety data to inform the design of future randomized studies. The trial was overseen by an institutional DSMC composed of five members, including at least two independent oncologists not involved in the conduct of the study. The DSMC reviewed safety data at 6-month intervals. As an additional safety precaution, the first three patients were monitored for 3 months to assess for any new adverse event or those that occurred at a higher grade than those previously reported in clinical trials, according to the National Cancer Institute's CTCAE v5.0. In the event of such findings, the DSMC was empowered to recommend protocol modification or cessation of the trial. This phase 1 study was not statistically powered to evaluate efficacy.

Feces collection and encapsulation were conducted under the supervision of the Division of Infectious Diseases at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, Canada. Each set of capsules (one full dose and two half-doses) contains material from a single donor only. Patients were required to consume 36−40 capsules for the initial full dose, followed by two half-doses of 20−25 capsules each, under supervision and within 2 hours of capsule defrosting, followed by a 30-minute period of observation.

Public-facing campaigns (hospital press releases, advertisements, flyers and social media) were launched to recruit healthy individuals who were interested in being stool donors. Interested individuals were prescreened using a self-administered email screening questionnaire (age, location, occupation and basic health). Individuals who self-reported eligibility on the questionnaire were subsequently contacted over the phone by study coordinators to review eligibility (questionnaire and inclusion and exclusion criteria). After the screening, the individual's health was assessed by laboratory tests, and the medical history was recorded. Final eligibility was confirmed after a comprehensive physician assessment.

A healthy donor who has a body mass index of 18.5−30 kg m−2 and who satisfies the following criteria was selected for donation22,53.

Donors were excluded for any underlying metabolic disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, insulin resistance or atherosclerosis. Positive stool test or nasal swab results for any multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE/CPE), SARS-CoV-2 or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)). Any of the following symptoms 14 days before any stool collection: fever, cough, loss of taste, anosmia, fatigue/malaise, myalgia, sore throat, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, chest pain, rash, conjunctivitis or headache. Any symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 or known SARS-CoV-2 infection within the last 3 months. New rash or spots indicative of monkeypox (Mpox). Any symptoms suggestive of the Mpox virus or may have been recently infected or exposed to the Mpox virus within the last 3 months. Donors were also excluded if they were men who have sex with men or women with a male partner who has sex with men. A history of any gastrointestinal or liver disorders or cancers, including, but not limited to, gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), microscopic colitis, motility disorders (including gastroparesis and irritable bowel syndrome) or diverticular disease. Previous surgery to the intestine, liver or gallbladder (except remote appendectomy). History of any malignancy. Use within the last 3 months of any antibiotics. Hospitalization within the last 3 months. Recent travel to a developing country (within the last 3 months). New sexual partner (within last 3 months). Street drug use, family history of diabetes, coronary disease or gastrointestinal or liver disease, colon cancer or familial malignancy. Psychiatric history (major affective disorder, psychotic illness or ongoing use of any psychiatric medications). Any positive laboratory results for a transmissible pathogen. Alcohol intake with a cutoff value of <10 g per day in women and <20 g per day in men. Urine test for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Serology for HIV 1/2, HTLV 1/2, hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis BsAg, hepatitis BcAb, hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, Epstein−Barr virus, Helicobacter pylori, syphilis, strongyloidiasis, schistosomiasis, amebiasis, anti-TTG antibody and, if travel history, trypanosomiasis. Throat swab for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Rectal swab for chlamydia, gonorrhea, MRSA and Mpox. Nasal swab for MRSA, SARS-CoV-2 and Mpox.

FMT capsules (LND-101) were prepared according to an established protocol as described in a Canadian study29. In brief, donor stool was processed aerobically under biosafety level 2 conditions. The material was then encapsulated, flash frozen at −55 °C on dry ice and stored at −80 °C for up to 2 months before use. Capsules were thawed at room temperature approximately 30 minutes prior to ingestion. Donations of 80−100 g (for a full dose) and 50−60 g (for a half-dose) were processed individually without pooling by mixing in 0.9% normal saline and glycerol and were filtered using a stomacher bag. The filtrate was centrifuged, and the final sediment was mixed to incorporate residual liquid, allowing it to be pipetted into capsules. Size 1 gelatin capsules (PCCA 30-1005) were manually filled and over-encapsulated twice with size 0 (PCCA 30-1126) and size 00 (PCCA 30-3533) capsules. Finally, the capsules were flash frozen at −55 °C on dry ice and stored at −80 °C for up to 2 months until 30 minutes prior to ingestion. One donation of 80−100 g produced approximately 40 capsules (full dose), and 50−60 g produced 20−25 capsules (half-dose).

Frozen capsules were shipped on dry ice to the London Health Sciences Centre, where patients received their follow-up half-doses after the first full FMT treatment at St. Joseph's Hospital, London. Capsule temperatures were continuously monitored using an EL-GFX-TC Thermocouple Data Logger to ensure stability during shipment. Upon arrival, capsules were stored at −80 °C and used for FMT within 2 months of manufacturing. The capsules are triple-encapsulated with hard gelatin shells to delay dissolution and protect against gastric acid, ensuring release in the distal small intestine and colon. SARS-CoV-2 testing was conducted according to our previously published protocol22. In brief, donors received a questionnaire before each stool sample dropoff, which included COVID-19 symptoms, positive COVID-19 tests, any infectious symptoms, including Mpox, and recent travel outside Canada. If the donors passed the questionnaire, they were allowed to drop off their stool samples. During each visit, donors were also required to provide a nasal swab for COVID-19 testing (polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT−PCR)), and a portion of the stool sample was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 RT−PCR and MDROs. Stool donations were processed and quarantined (−80 °C) until PCR and MDRO results became available.

Patients underwent a standard bowel preparation with 250−4,000 ml of polyethylene glycol with electrolytes (PEG3350) solution (as tolerated) the evening before the first FMT administration with LND101. In brief, after an early light supper the evening prior to the first full-dose FMT, patients underwent a standard polyethylene glycol electrolyte bowel preparation identical to that used for colonoscopy (up to 4 l, consumed in 200-ml aliquots every 15 minutes until clear watery stools were achieved). Water or clear liquids were permitted until 2 hours before capsule ingestion, which occurred the following morning over approximately 30 minutes under supervision. Patients received LND101 orally on a defined schedule, initiated prior to standard immunotherapy (for example, nivolumab/ipilimumab) or immunotherapy combined with a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted agent (for example, lenvatinib and axitinib). Two half-doses (20−25 capsules, equivalent to 50−60 g of feces) were administered at weeks 3 and 6 without bowel preparation. The specific systemic therapy was selected by the treating physician in accordance with Canadian guidelines.

Patients received either dual ICIs or anti-PD-1 therapy combined with a VEGF inhibitor. Publicly funded regimens followed standard protocols: nivolumab (3 mg kg−1 every 3 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg kg−1 every 3 weeks) up to four cycles, followed by maintenance nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks or 480 mg every 4 weeks) or a combination of pembrolizumab with a VEGF-targeted agent (for example, lenvatinib and axitinib).

To allow microbiota engraftment, the first immunotherapy dose was given at least 7 days after the initial FMT (Fig. 1b). Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, completion of therapy or death, at the physician's discretion.

Radiographic assessments were performed every 12 weeks for the first 2 years and then at least annually for up to 5 years or more often if clinically indicated. Imaging modalities included computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, with efforts made to use the same modality throughout follow-up.

Tumor response was evaluated according to RECIST v1.1, with immune-related RECIST (iRECIST) applied when relevant. CR was defined as the disappearance of all targeted lesions; PR as ≥30% reduction in the sum of target lesion diameters from baseline; PD as a ≥20% increase in target lesion size or the appearance of new lesions; and SD as the absence of CR, PR or PD for ≥3 months. ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR, and clinical benefit was defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR or SD lasting ≥6 months. For correlative analyses, patients achieving CR or PR were categorized as responders, and those with SD or PD were classified as non-responders.

Clinical data, including demographics, imaging results and adverse events, were prospectively collected at each visit and entered into a secure REDCap electronic database (version 12.4.17; Vanderbilt University, 2022). Access was restricted to authorized clinical research staff and the principal investigator. Each participant was assigned a unique study ID with the master linking log securely to preserve confidentiality.

Biological samples, including stool and blood, were collected at five predefined timepoints: (1) at baseline (prior to any intervention), (2) 1 week after the first full-dose FMT and just before initiating systemic therapy, (3) 4 weeks after the first FMT and prior to the second immunotherapy dose, (4) 7 weeks after the first FMT and prior to the third immunotherapy dose and (5) approximately 10 weeks after the first FMT and prior to the fourth immunotherapy dose. Samples 3 and 4 were obtained 1−3 days after the first and second half-dose FMTs, respectively.

At each timepoint, clinical assessments were performed alongside routine laboratory evaluations, including renal and liver function tests, complete blood count, electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase. Organ function was documented at baseline and monitored throughout follow-up. Participants were free to withdraw consent at any time without affecting their clinical care. Samples collected prior to withdrawal were retained for analysis.

Adverse events were graded using CTCAE v5.0 (ref. 54). Toxicities occurring after the first FMT but before initiation of immunotherapy-based combination were attributed to FMT. Adverse events occurring within 90 days of starting immunotherapy were considered related to the combination of FMT and immunotherapy-based combination, whereas those occurring beyond 90 days were attributed to immunotherapy-based combination alone. All adverse events were managed in accordance with standard clinical practice guidelines. Immunotherapy and/or VEGF-TKI were temporarily held or permanently discontinued in cases of severe toxicity, at the discretion of the treating oncologist. All events were reviewed by the trial principal investigator to ensure standardized attribution and grading.

The Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Side Effect Toolkit was used to guide dose modifications. The full guidelines are publicly available on the CCO website: https://www.cancercareontario.ca/en/guidelines-advice/modality/immunotherapy/immune-therapy-toolkit.

The primary endpoint of the PERFORM trial was safety and tolerability of LND101 when administered in combination with immunotherapy-based regimens. Safety was assessed by the incidence and severity of irAEs graded according to CTCAE v5.0 (ref. 54). Attribution categories were unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable or definite. irAEs were defined as those with attribution of possible/probable/definite. For the primary analysis, we report irAEs of any grade using a uniform threshold of ≥possible. In a prespecified sensitivity analysis, to reduce potential noise from non-specific low-grade events, we restricted grade 1−2 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) to probable/definite while retaining possible/probable/definite for grade 3 or higher. The combination was considered safe if irAEs did not occur more frequently or with greater severity than expected from the relevant product monograph of each backbone regimen. Given that patients received different standard regimens (for example, nivolumab/ipilimumab, pembrolizumab/axitinib and pembrolizumab/lenvatinib), the incidence and spectrum of observed irAEs were interpreted relative to the established toxicity profile of each respective regimen. This framework enabled assessment of whether the addition of LND101 introduced excess or unexpected immune-related toxicity beyond the known safety spectrum. As prespecified in the protocol, all safety analyses were restricted to irAEs, which represent the most clinically relevant toxicities in the context of microbiome−immunity interactions.

Secondary endpoints included the incidence of grade 3 or higher irAEs occurring from treatment initiation to 120 days after the last immunotherapy dose; clinical response assessment by RECIST v1.1 (ref. 24); longitudinal changes in gut microbiome composition from fecal samples; immune activation markers (for example, circulating cytokines and immune cell subsets); and health-related quality of life, assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.

Exploratory endpoints included characterization of the tumor microenvironment and immune profile and assessment of PFS and overall survival using the Kaplan−Meier method. In accordance with the trial protocol, adverse events focused on immune-related events, which represent the most clinically relevant toxicities in the context of microbiome−immune interactions. This prespecified focus also guided downstream translational analyses for the exploratory endpoints, ensuring alignment between clinical and mechanistic endpoints. By focusing on irAEs, the study was able to interrogate mechanistic links between the microbiome and immune-related toxicity without confounding from regimen-specific non-immune adverse events.

Safety analyses were conducted in the ITT population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of LND101 in combination with immunotherapy-based therapy (n = 20). Overall survival and correlative analyses for toxicity (microbiome, immune and metabolomic) were also performed in the ITT population.

Efficacy analyses and correlative analyses based on clinical response were conducted in the per-protocol population, defined as all patients with measurable disease at baseline according to investigator assessment (n = 18). The ORR was calculated as the proportion of patients achieving CR or PR per RECIST v1.1. The clinical benefit rate was defined as CR or PR or SD lasting ≥6 months. PFS was analyzed in the per-protocol population (n = 18). Kaplan−Meier methods were used to estimate PFS and overall survival, with medians and 95% confidence intervals reported.

Patient-reported quality of life was analyzed in all patients with available EQ-5D-5L assessments. Baseline distributions across the five domains and global VAS scores were summarized descriptively. Longitudinal changes from baseline were evaluated through median score differences and distribution shifts across cycles, with particular attention to cycle 4 to align with early clinical response and safety assessment windows. Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed stratified by the occurrence of grade 3 or higher irAEs.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics, safety events and correlative endpoints. No formal hypothesis testing or adjustment for multiple comparisons was planned, consistent with the exploratory nature of this phase 1 study.

Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA LP Tagmentation kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were dual-indexed and sequenced as paired-end 300-bp reads on the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platform. In total, 3,914.1 Gb of raw sequencing data were generated, corresponding to an average of approximately 57.3 million paired-end reads per sample (150-bp average read length) across 113 samples prior to quality control and preprocessing.

Initial preprocessing involved trimming sequencing primers, removing reads shorter than 75 bp and discarding low-quality reads (quality score < Q20) using Trimmomatic version 0.39 (ref. 55). Reads containing two or more ambiguous nucleotides were also filtered out. Contaminant sequences were removed by aligning reads to the human reference genome (hg19) and the phiX174 control genome using Bowtie 2 version 2.5.4 (ref. 56) with the very-sensitive-local preset to conservatively exclude host genome reads. After preprocessing, an average of 55.8 million paired-end reads per sample remained and were retained for downstream analyses.

Taxonomic composition was profiled from shotgun metagenomic data to the species level using MetaPhlAn version 4.1.1 (ref. 57) with the mpa_vJune23 reference database. This profiling identified a total of 1,494 microbial species and 1,591 species-level genome bins (SGBs). The unclassified_estimation parameter was set to ensure accurate estimation of unclassified. Bowtie 2 alignment and SAM output files were retained for downstream analyses. Relative abundance tables were merged using MetaPhlAn's merge_metaphlan_tables.py utility and normalized to CPM for subsequent statistical analysis.

Functional profiling was conducted using the HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN) version 3.9 (ref. 58). For nucleotide alignment, the ChocoPhlAn database (mpa_vJun23) consistent with MetaPhlAn was used, and UniRef90 served as the protein database. The HUMAnN pipeline was executed with DIAMOND version 2.1.8 (ref. 59). The output included gene family abundances, pathway abundance and pathway coverage tables. These tables were merged using the humann_join_tables utility. Gene families were regrouped to EC numbers using the humann_regroup_table function with the uniref90_level4ec mapping. All tables were CPM normalized for downstream statistical analysis.

After functional profiling, all resulting tables were transferred from the HPC cloud environment to a local workstation for subsequent analysis in R version 4.5.0. A unified list structure was constructed in R, incorporating all relevant data layers, including metadata, species-level abundance, ECs, gene families, pathway abundance, pathway coverage, genus-level profiles and SGBs. Sample identifiers were standardized across all tables to ensure consistency, allowing for accurate linkage between metadata and metagenomic data. MetaPhlAn annotates features hierarchically from Kingdom to SGB, and filtering was performed to isolate the species and SGB levels for downstream analysis. The dplyr R package version 1.1.4 and tidyr R package version 1.3.1 were used for data manipulation, and the ggplot2 version 3.5.2 package was used for all visualizations.

α-Diversity was calculated at the species level using Shannon and inverse Simpson indices via the vegan R package (version 2.7-1)60. Shannon index accounts for both richness (number of species) and evenness (distribution of abundances), making it sensitive to rare species. By contrast, the inverse Simpson index emphasizes dominant species and provides a measure of how evenly distributed the microbial community is. Together, these indices offer complementary views of within-sample diversity.

To assess whether α-diversity differed between clinical subgroups, we performed one-way ANOVA separately at each timepoint, using the diversity metric as the outcome and clinical subgroup as the predictor. To correct for multiple comparisons and identify specific differences between group pairs, Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc test was applied after each ANOVA. This allowed for pair-wise comparisons while controlling the family-wise error rate and minimizing type I error. Timepoints with fewer than two group levels were excluded from testing. Statistically significant pair-wise comparisons (adjusted P < 0.05) were annotated in visualizations.

β-Diversity was first assessed at the species level using Bray−Curtis dissimilarity, which captures differences in community composition by accounting for shared species and their relative abundances. This measure emphasizes differences in dominant taxa, making it particularly useful for identifying compositional shifts in microbial abundance profiles. To visualize these compositional changes over time, Bray−Curtis dissimilarity matrices were subjected to principal coordinate analysis (PCoA).

Group-level differences were statistically assessed using PERMANOVA (adonis2 function, vegan package, 999 permutations) at baseline (timepoint 1) and 10 weeks after FMT (timepoint 5) to determine whether microbial communities diverged based on clinical subgroups.

We further examined which microbial species were most strongly associated with the observed ordination axes using environmental vector fitting (envfit function, vegan). This analysis identified species whose relative abundance patterns aligned significantly with the PCoA structure.

The significance of each species was tested through 999 permutations, and only those with P < 0.05 were retained. From these, the top 12 species with the highest vector magnitude (calculated from their contributions to PCoA axes 1 and 2) were selected and plotted as arrows to highlight their directional influence on community variation.

To quantify the similarity between each patient's microbiome and their respective donor's profile over time, two additional dissimilarity measures along with Bray−Curtis—Jaccard and Aitchison distances—were calculated.

Jaccard dissimilarity, used on species-level data, is based on presence/absence and evaluates overlap in community membership, regardless of abundance. This allowed us to track whether patients were acquiring donor-like species, even in small amounts.

Aitchison distance, used on EC profiles, applies a centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation, making it more appropriate for compositional functional data. It enabled us to assess convergence or divergence in functional potential between patients and their donors over time.

For species (Jaccard and Bray−Curtis) and enzyme (Aitchison) distances, we calculated the dissimilarity between each patient and their respective donor across timepoints. These values were normalized by each patient's baseline (pre-FMT) distance to generate fold changes. This normalization allowed for patient-specific tracking of relative shifts in similarity to the donor.

Two types of statistical comparisons were conducted on the fold change data: (1) within-group comparisons across timepoints, to assess whether each clinical group showed a significant shift in donor similarity over time, and (2) between-group comparisons at timepoints 4 and 5 only, to assess the similarity of samples to the donor at 7 weeks and 10 weeks after FMT. For each test, the Shapiro−Wilk test was first applied to determine the distribution of the data. If both baseline and current values followed a normal distribution, a two-sample t-test was used; otherwise, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied. To control for multiple testing in the within-group comparisons, P values were adjusted using the Benjamini−Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method in each test.

Differential abundance analysis of species was conducted using the lefser function from the lefser package (version 1.18.0)61. Patients were grouped based on grade 3 toxicity status for this analysis. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) first applies a non-parametric Kruskal−Wallis test to identify features with significantly different abundances between the two groups. It then uses linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to estimate the effect size of each discriminatory feature. A heatmap was generated using the pheatmap R package (version 1.0.13) for species with LDA > 2 to visualize their abundance patterns across all timepoints and both clinical groups, highlighting the longitudinal dynamics of discriminatory taxa.

Features with LDA > 2 were retained for downstream analysis. The LDA score reflects both statistical significance and effect size; features passing this threshold also meet the default significance cutoff of P < 0.05 from the Kruskal−Wallis test used within the LEfSe method. Therefore, no additional statistical testing was applied to features selected based on this LDA threshold.

Differential analysis of EC numbers was performed using MaAsLin3 (ref. 28) on CPM-normalized HUMAnN output. MaAsLin3 fits generalized linear models for each microbial feature to test for associations with metadata while adjusting for covariates. It supports multivariable modeling, normalizes and transforms input data and applies FDR correction to control for multiple testing. For each feature, MaAsLin3 reports effect sizes, P values and FDR-adjusted q values, enabling robust identification of differentially abundant features.

In this analysis, two covariates were included: toxicity status (whether the recipient developed grade 3 toxicity) and timepoint, with donor samples assigned to T0. Donor samples were grouped according to the toxicity status of their respective recipients, thereby assessing whether features in the donor microbiota were associated with future toxicity outcomes in patients. This combined selection approach was implemented to ensure that the identified enzyme features were both significantly different at baseline between donors (based on recipient outcome) and retained in recipients at 10 weeks after FMT (timepoint 5), suggesting potential functional persistence.

Candidate enzyme features were selected based on a joint P < 0.05, a joint q < 0.1 and an absolute model coefficient > 0.1, indicating both statistical significance and a meaningful effect size. Only enzymes that passed these thresholds at both the donor (T0) and patient (T5) timepoints were retained as candidate features.

Species were ranked by their total cumulative abundance (CPM) across all collected trial samples. Taxa names were cleaned by removing prefixes and truncating them to species-level labels. Separate compositional visualizations were created for donors and patients. For donors, the mean CPM values of each top taxon were calculated across all donations of a donor and displayed per donor. For patients, the same top taxa were profiled over time (T1 to T5). The patient's label was modified to reflect their experience of grade 3 toxicity.

Strain profiling was performed using StrainPhlAn version 4.0 (ref. 62) on SGBs identified by MetaPhlAn. To improve the sensitivity and resolution of strain-level engraftment detection, we incorporated publicly available metagenomic samples from three previously published FMT trials: Baruch et al.14, Davar et al.15 and Routy et al. (MIMIC study)29. Including these datasets enhanced marker selection quality and increased the phylogenetic signal for strain tracking across samples.

For each sample, consensus marker genes were extracted using the sample2markers.py and extract_markers.py utility on the MetaPhlAn SAM output, and the list of relevant SGBs was generated by enabling the print_clades_only option in StrainPhlAn. Marker filtering parameters were set to include rare but valid SGBs by setting the minimum percentage thresholds on per-sample marker coverage to 0, the minimum number of samples sharing a marker to 20 and requiring that each marker be present in at least 10% of the samples (–sample_with_n_markers_perc 0, –sample_with_n_markers 20, –marker_in_n_samples_perc 10).

Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for each SGB using marker gene alignments, and normalized pair-wise phylogenetic distances were calculated. To define same-strain pairs, SGB-specific thresholds were optimized using Youden's index, which maximizes the separation between longitudinal (same-host) and unrelated (inter-host) sample pairs.

Strain engraftment was inferred when the post-FMT recipient shared a strain with their donor for a given SGB and this strain was absent in the recipient's pre-FMT sample. The engraftment rate was defined as the number of engrafted strains divided by the number of strains that could engraft, where engraftable strains are those detected in both the donor and the recipient after FMT sample but not present in the recipient at baseline. This approach allowed high-resolution detection of donor-derived strain persistence after FMT.

Two types of statistical comparisons were conducted on the strain engraftment rate data: (1) within-group comparisons, to assess whether each clinical group showed significant changes in engraftment relative to baseline, and (2) between-group comparisons at timepoints 2, 3, 4 and 5, to evaluate differences in engraftment rates based on clinical outcomes. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied for each comparison. Multiple testing correction using the Benjamini−Hochberg FDR method was performed separately for each of the within-group comparisons and the between-group comparisons. This ensured that P values were adjusted independently for each analysis context.

Metagenomic samples from three published FMT trials (Baruch et al.14, Davar et al.15 and Routy et al.29) were downloaded and processed as described above. Taxonomic profiling was performed using MetaPhlAn version 4.1.1 with the mpa_vJune23 database. S. copri abundance (CPM) was extracted from each trial's merged abundance table and averaged per patient at the pre-FMT and post-FMT timepoints, if multiple samples were collected. Significant differences in S. copri levels were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with P values adjusted using the Benjamini−Hochberg FDR method.

Blood samples were collected in EDTA anticoagulant vacutainers. For plasma collection, blood was centrifuged at 200g for 20 minutes with no brake. Plasma was collected and frozen at −80 °C for metabolomics and cytokine and chemokine quantification. For PBMC isolation, blood was diluted with PBS, and PBMCs were isolated using Lymphoprep density gradient medium (STEMCELL Technologies, 07861) in SepMate tubes (STEMCELL Technologies, 85460). Blood was layered on Lymphoprep medium and centrifuged at 1,200g for 15 minutes at room temperature with brake. PBMCs were collected, and red blood cells were removed using ACK lysing buffer and washed. PBMCs were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells per milliliter in freezing medium (RPMI 1640 + 12.5% human serum albumin + 10% DMSO). Samples were frozen in a Mr. Frosty container for 24−48 hours at −80 °C and stored at −150 °C for long-term storage.

Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. One million cells were then stained with Zombie Aqua for 20 minutes at room temperature. Fc receptors were blocked with TruStain FcX for 10 minutes at room temperature, followed by labeling with a cocktail of extracellular antibodies (Supplementary Table 4) in the presence of Brilliant Stain buffer and Monocyte Blocker for 20 minutes on ice. Cells were subsequently fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and resuspended in staining buffer (5% heat-inactivated FBS in PBS) for acquisition. For FOXP3 intracellular staining, cells were fixed with the eBioscience Foxp3 / Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set for 50 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized, and Fc receptors were blocked again with TruStain FcX for 10 minutes at room temperature. Anti-FOXP3 staining was performed in permeabilization buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by fixation with 2%. paraformaldehyde. Data were acquired on a BD FACSymphony A1 cytometer, followed by analysis using FlowJo version 10.6.2 and GraphPad Prism 9 software.

Data were first normalized using CytoNorm to remove batch effects, followed by supervised gating analysis using fluorescence-minus-one controls (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). For unsupervised clustering analysis, T cells (CD3+) and monocytes (CD14+CD16+/−) were first gated on live CD45+ cells. Using DownSample, each population was downsampled to 10,000 events for T cells and monocytes. Sample populations were concatenated, and unsupervised dimensionality reduction was conducted using t-SNE, followed by clustering analysis using FlowSOM and ClusterExplorer. Statistical analysis was conducted using a two-sided unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test for comparisons at T5 or a two-sided Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test with Benjamini−Hochberg correction for multiple within-group comparisons

Plasma cytokine levels were quantified by Eve Technologies using the Human Cytokine 48-Plex Discovery Assay (HD48). The multiplex assay was performed using a Luminex xMAP technology platform, allowing simultaneous quantification of 48 human cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Each specimen on each panel was run in singlet on the Luminex xMAP technology, and data were analyzed by Eve Technologies using standard curve interpolation. Statistical analysis was conducted using a two-sided unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test for comparisons at T5 or a two-sided Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test with Benjamini−Hochberg correction for multiple within-group comparisons

Metabolomic analysis of patient plasma was conducted according to a previously published targeted metabolomics method63. In brief, 20 μl of plasma was added to 80 μl of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade methanol, and 5 μl of diluted internal standard (diluted 1:1 with HPLC-grade methanol; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, MSK-A2-1.2) was added to each sample, which was then vortexed, incubated for 30 minutes at −80 °C to precipitate proteins and then centrifuged at 15,000g to clarify. Then, 10 μl of supernatant was diluted in 990 μl of buffer containing 95% acetonitrile and 5% 20 mM ammonium carbonate (pH 9.8). Quality control samples were prepared by pooling 10 μl of each sample. All samples, including quality control samples, were then analyzed by hydrophilic interaction or reversed-phase liquid chromatography and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with a SCIEX QTRAP 5500 triple quadrupole linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometer.

Data were captured using Analyst version 1.6.2 software (SCIEX); peak integration was performed using Skyline version 24.1. An in-house R script was used for data normalization against pooled quality control samples and removal of metabolites with low signal or high quality control variance (version 4.4.2, http://www.r-project.org, accessed on 15 July 2021). Scaling, heatmaps and t-tests and multiple hypothesis correction (Benjamini−Hochberg) were performed using MetaboAnalystR (version 4.0). The survival graphs were generated using the ITT population. Survival plots were generated using the R package survminer (version 0.5)64.

Across successive protocol amendments for the PERFORM trial, updates primarily focused on expanding eligibility criteria, clarifying safety endpoints and broadening translational objectives.

The protocol title and scope were revised to include patients treated with either doublet immunotherapy or anti-PD-1 plus VEGFR-TKI combinations, reflecting evolving standards of care in mRCC. Therefore, corresponding modifications were made throughout the Background, Inclusion Criteria and Treatment Plan sections to incorporate regimens such as pembrolizumab/axitinib, pembrolizumab/lenvatinib and nivolumab/cabozantinib. The primary endpoint remained safety—irAEs assessed by CTCAE v5.0—and secondary endpoints included clinical response (RECIST v1.1), gut microbiome, immune correlates and patient-reported quality of life (EQ-5D-5L).

Methodological refinements included mandating stool sample 3 for longitudinal microbiome analysis and adding new collaborators for biospecimen analyses to enable multiomic integration (metagenomics, metabolomics, immune profiling and tumor epigenomics). Shipping instructions, appendix references and consent documents were updated accordingly to ensure consistency and transparency in sample handling and data sharing. Administrative corrections included reference formatting, version control and inclusion of new institutional contact information. Overall, these amendments maintained the original study intent—evaluating safety, tolerability and mechanistic correlates of healthy donor encapsulated FMT combined with standard ICI-based regimens—while broadening translational depth and improving operational clarity to support future multisite expansion.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved outcomes for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma, yet over half of patients exhibit primary resistance. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may overcome resistance to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. The clinical activity and safety of FMT plus anti-PD-1 in NSCLC or anti-PD-1 plus anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) therapy in melanoma have not been evaluated. Here we report results from FMT-LUMINate, a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 trial assessing healthy donor FMT plus anti-PD-1 in NSCLC (n = 20) or anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 (dual ICI) in melanoma (n = 20), in the first-line setting. Eligible patients received a single FMT via oral capsules prior to ICI initiation. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) in NSCLC. Secondary endpoints included ORR in melanoma, safety and donor−host microbiome similarity. In NSCLC, the ORR was 80% (16/20), meeting the study primary endpoint. In melanoma, the ORR was 75% (15/20). FMT was deemed safe in both cohorts by an independent data and safety monitoring committee, with no grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) in NSCLC and 13 (65%) patients experiencing grade 3 or higher AEs in melanoma. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed that responders developed a distinct post-FMT gut microbiome composition, independent of acquired donor−recipient similarity or strain-level engraftment. Responders exhibited significantly greater loss of baseline bacterial species compared to non-responders, with frequent depletion of Enterocloster citroniae, E. lavalensis and Clostridium innocuum. This finding was reproduced across three published FMT oncology trials. We recolonized antibiotic-treated, tumor-bearing mice with post-FMT stool from two responder patients, and reintroduction of the specific bacterial species that were lost after FMT abrogated the antitumor effect of ICI. Taken together, these findings confirm the clinical activity of FMT in combination with ICI and suggest that the elimination of deleterious taxa is required for FMT-mediated therapeutic benefit. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04951583.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved therapeutic outcomes for patients with NSCLC1 and cutaneous melanoma (herein referred to as melanoma)2. Patients with NSCLC and tumor proportion score (TPS) PD-L1 ≥ 50%, in the absence of a first-line actionable oncogenic alteration, are treated with single-agent anti-PD-1 such as pembrolizumab, with an expected objective response rate (ORR) of 39−45%1,3,4. In patients with melanoma, dual therapy with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) in combination with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) is among the most commonly used frontline regimens, yielding an ORR of 50−58% and durable improvements in overall survival (OS) compared to single-agent ipilimumab2. Despite improvements in OS, approximately half of patients will not respond to these regimens5, highlighting an urgent need to improve the efficacy of ICI. Over the past decade, the gut microbiota has emerged as one of the hallmarks of cancer and as a key determinant of response to ICI6,7,8,9,10,11,12. First, preclinical studies demonstrated that FMT from non-responder (NR) patients induced resistance to anti-CTLA-4 (ref. 7) or anti-PD-(L)-1 (refs. 6,8,9,10) therapy in murine models, and response to ICI was restored after FMT from responder (R) patients13. Gut microbiota sequencing of stool samples from clinical cohorts of patients with solid tumors has demonstrated that enrichment of potentially deleterious bacteria, including Enterocloster and Clostridium spp., were associated with resistance to ICI14,15. This dysbiosis can be further compounded by iatrogenic insults such as antibiotics16,17,18,19, now validated as an independent negative prognostic factor across multiple oncology settings. Subsequently, two phase 1 clinical trials demonstrated the first proof of concept that FMT from patients with response to anti-PD-1 could overcome primary or acquired resistance to ICI20,21,22. Soon thereafter, the phase 1 MIMIC trial demonstrated the potential of healthy donor FMT to decrease primary resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with melanoma23,24. However, the clinical activity of FMT in combination with ICI in patients with NSCLC remains unknown. In addition, the safety and clinical activity of FMT in combination with anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 in patients with melanoma has not been described. Moreover, the mechanism by which FMT enhances the activity of ICI in humans remains poorly understood. Here we report the clinical activity of FMT combined with anti-PD-1 in patients with NSCLC and with anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 in patients with melanoma. We also describe how the loss of deleterious bacteria prevalent at baseline—but no longer detected after FMT—may modulate the therapeutic effects of FMT when combined with ICI.

A total of 59 patients were screened for eligibility between 18 November 2021 and 6 March 2024 (Fig. 1a), of whom 20 were enrolled in the NSCLC cohort and 20 were enrolled in the melanoma cohort. The primary endpoint was ORR in the NSCLC cohort. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) at 1 year, OSat 1 year, disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response in the NSCLC and cutaneous melanoma cohorts, ORR in the cutaneous melanoma cohort, safety of FMT with ICI and acquired donor−host similarity as measured by the Bray−Curtis dissimilarity index25. Endpoints in the uveal melanoma cohort were exploratory and, therefore, are reported separately (see ‘Outcomes and sample size' in the Methods).

Patients in the NSCLC cohort were enrolled if they had no first-line actionable oncogenic alterations, PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% and no prior exposure to anti-PD-1 therapy. Patients in the melanoma cohort were enrolled irrespective of BRAFV600 mutational status, and prior adjuvant anti-PD-1 was permitted, provided the last dose was administered more than 6 months prior to enrollment. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are reported in the Methods. Patients underwent single FMT from a healthy donor delivered by oral capsules, administered the day after bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) laxative and within 1 week before first-line anti-PD-1 monotherapy (pembrolizumab) in the NSCLC cohort or dual anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 (nivolumab and ipilimumab) in the melanoma cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Ten individual healthy donor volunteers provided feces, with 10 donors participating in the NSCLC cohort and six donors participating in the melanoma cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1b), with donor demographics presented in Supplementary Table 1.

Baseline characteristics for the enrolled patients are presented in Table 1. For the NSCLC cohort, median age was 68 (range 52−82) years, and 11 (55%) patients were male. Sixteen (80%) patients had adenocarcinoma histology, and 18 (90%) patients had stage IV disease, with two (10%) harboring unresectable stage III disease not amenable to curative-intent therapy. Twelve (60%) patients had PD-L1 TPS < 90%. For the melanoma cohort, median age was 56 (range 27−88) years, and 13 (65%) were male. Nine (45%) patient tumors harbored BRAFV600 mutations. No patients were treated with BRAF/MEK inhibition for metastatic disease prior to enrollment. Seventeen (85%) patients had stage IV disease, including six (30%) with liver metastases at baseline and two (10%) with brain metastases at baseline. Median follow-up for the study was 24 months. The primary endpoint for this study was ORR in NSCLC. The ORR in the NSCLC cohort was 80% (95% confidence interval: 58.4−91.9), with 16 patients experiencing a partial response, exceeding the prespecified primary endpoint of 64% and, thereby, meeting the criteria for a positive study outcome (Fig. 1b,c). The DCR in NSCLC was 95% (three of four patients who did not achieve response experienced stable disease ≥6 months) (Fig. 1b,c). The median duration of response was 8.7 months (95% confidence interval: 3.1−20). The PFS and OS at 1 year were 65% (95% confidence interval: 47.1−89.7) and 100%, respectively (95% confidence interval not evaluable) (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b).

A key secondary endpoint of the study was activity of FMT in combination with anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 in the melanoma cohort. The ORR in the melanoma cohort was 75% (95% confidence interval: 53.1−88.8), with 11 partial responses and four complete responses (Fig. 1d,e). The DCR was also 75% (Fig. 1d,e). The median duration of response was 10 months (95% confidence interval: 0−20.9). The PFS and OS at 1 year were 58% (95% confidence interval: 39.4−85.4) and 79% (95% confidence interval: 62.9−99.6), respectively (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). These results demonstrate clinical efficacy of FMT in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC and with anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 in melanoma.

FMT alone prior to ICI initiation resulted in grade 1 AEs in 35% of patients, most commonly diarrhea and changes in stool appearance, consistent with our previously published phase 1 trial23 (Extended Data Table 1). No patient experienced previously unreported AEs related to FMT or to ICI. In the NSCLC cohort, any-grade AEs attributable to FMT plus anti-PD-1 occurred in 17 (85%) patients, and no patients experienced grade 3 or higher AEs. Corticosteroids were used in three (15%) patients for grade 2 AEs (arthritis, pancreatitis and pneumonitis). One patient who experienced grade 2 pneumonitis discontinued therapy due to this AE; however, this patient was symptom free with continued response maintained at last follow-up. One patient with grade 2 arthritis was treated with subsequent hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate. This patient was also symptom free with continued response at last follow-up. In the melanoma cohort, any-grade AEs related to FMT plus anti-PD-1 plus anti-CLTA-4 occurred in 19 (95%) patients, and 12 (60%) patients experienced grade 3 AEs and one patient experienced a grade 4 AE. The most frequent grade 3 or higher AE was diarrhea or colitis, occurring in 20% of patients. Three (15%) patients experienced myocarditis. Additional details on the myocarditis cases are presented in Supplementary Table 2. Thirteen (65%) patients in the melanoma cohort required corticosteroids for AEs. Two (10%) patients required second-line immunosuppression (one patient was treated with infliximab for grade 3 diarrhea, and one patient was treated with infliximab and plasmapheresis for grade 4 myocarditis). The median onset of grade 3 or higher AEs was 40 days from the start of anti-PD-1 and anti-CLTA-4. Fourteen (70%) patients in the melanoma cohort discontinued ICI due to toxicity, and six (30%) patients completed all four cycles of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4. The combination of FMT with ICI in both cohorts was deemed safe by an independent data safety and monitoring committee (DSMC) with AEs consistent with known toxicity profile of ipilimumab plus nivolumab, in accordance with the predefined safety criteria outlined in the protocol; however, the DSMC concluded that severe AEs reported in the melanoma cohort had an earlier onset than previously reported in the literature26. Additionally, myocarditis was deemed an AE of special interest for monitoring in future FMT trials.

Given the accelerated onset of AEs and potential signal for increased incidence of myocarditis only in the dual anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4-treated melanoma cohort, we investigated these potential adverse safety signals by exploring the association between donor and development of AEs. Among the 13 patients who experienced grade 3 or higher AEs, six were attributed to donor 5 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Moreover, all the fecal donations provided by donor 5 led to grade 3 or higher AEs in the melanoma cohort (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Additionally, two out of the three patients who experienced myocarditis received FMT from donor 5 (Supplementary Table 2). The two patients who developed myocarditis after receiving FMT from donor 5 experienced myocarditis of rapid onset (22 days and 25 days, respectively, after the first dose of ICI), compared to a relatively delayed onset (205 days) observed in the third patient who received FMT from donor 9.

Due to the relatively high number of healthy donors used in our study, we performed unsupervised clustering of donor gut microbiota composition and observed two distinct donor clusters (P = 0.001) (Fig. 2a), also observed in the NSCLC and melanoma cohorts when analyzed separately (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). Cluster B, comprising samples from donor 5 and donor 11, was characterized by high relative abundance of Prevotella spp., including Segatella copri (previously Prevotella copri clade A), Prevotella sp. Marseille-P4119, Prevotella stercorea and an unknown species in the Prevotellaceae family (SGB1472) (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a), also observed in each cohort when analyzed separately (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). Conversely, cluster A, consisting of the remaining donors, contained primarily other taxa (Fig. 2b) as well as a significantly lower relative abundance of Prevotella spp. compared to cluster B (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Differential abundance analysis comparing patients who developed grade 3 or higher AEs confirmed that P. sp. Marseille-P4119, P. stercorea and Prevotellaceae GGB1146 SGB1472 were enriched in patients who developed grade 3 or higher AEs (Fig. 2c). S. copri, P. sp. Marseille-P4119 and P. stercorea were enriched after FMT compared to baseline in the patients who experienced grade 3 or higher AEs (Fig. 2d). Post-FMT engraftment at the sample level of P. sp. Marseille-P4119, P. stercorea and Prevotellaceae SGB1472 was associated with grade 3 or higher AEs (P < 0.001, P = 0.023 and P < 0.001, respectively, using Fisherʼs exact test). Patients without signs of severe toxicity did not exhibit enrichment of Prevotella spp. after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 3c).

Group differences were assessed using Fisher's exact test (two-sided). D, donor; Dim, dimension.

Donor 5 was a Prevotella-rich donor who had participated in our previously published phase 1 study (MIMIC) involving patients with melanoma treated with FMT and monotherapy anti-PD-1, in which five (25%) patients experienced grade 3 or higher AEs23. However, donor 5 feces did not lead to toxicity in these anti-PD-1 monotherapy-treated patients. Moreover, FMT from Prevotella-rich donors was not associated with grade 3 or higher AEs in patients with NSCLC (Extended Data Fig. 3a). An analysis including all patients who experienced grade 3 or higher AEs in our current study and previously published phase 1 study23 revealed that feces from cluster B donors caused toxicity only in patients receiving dual PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade (P = 0.051) (Fig. 2e,f), with increased proportion of a subset of CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood after FMT in those who developed grade 3 or higher AEs (P = 0.026). (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Engraftment of S. copri was associated with these CD4+ T cells in patients who were treated with dual PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade and not in the context of single-agent ICI (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Of note, although there was a numerical association between the development of grade 3 or higher AEs and clinical response (Extended Data Fig. 3d), these results were not statistically significant. There was no association between the engraftment of Prevotella spp. and response (P > 0.05 for all Prevotella spp. using Fisherʼs exact test). Taken together, these results highlight that the gut microbiome—specifically, engraftment of donor-specific Prevotella spp.—was associated with the development of immune-related AEs in the context of dual immune checkpoint inhibition.

We next explored the impact of the donor on the efficacy of FMT and ICI. Unlike the donor effect that we observed with respect to AEs, no donor effect was detected with respect to efficacy—each donor, or donor cluster, led to a proportional number of responses and non-responses (Extended Data Figs. 3a and 4a). We next explored microbiome features associated with clinical outcomes. Alpha (α) diversity as measured by the Shannon index27—which measures the number of species (richness) and their relative abundances (evenness)—was similar between the healthy donors and patients at baseline in the NSCLC and melanoma groups (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Beta (β) diversity28—which measures the differences in microbial composition between samples—did not differ significantly between the R patients and the NR patients at baseline in the NSCLC (P = 0.4) and melanoma (P = 0.9) groups (Fig. 3a,b). After FMT, although there was no difference in α-diversity between R patients and NR patients (Extended Data Fig. 4b), we observed response-associated shifts in the global microbiota composition in both the NSCLC (P = 0.09) and melanoma (P = 0.006) cohorts (Fig. 3a,b).

Group differences in dispersion were assessed and measured using β-diversity dispersion. c–d, LDA using LEfSe representation in NSCLC (n = 65 samples from n = 19 patients; c) and melanoma (n = 79 samples from n = 20 patients; d) after FMT comparing R to NR. Significant values had LDA scores greater than 2 and P < 0.05. e–f, Heatmap representation comparing responders at baseline compared to 1 month after FMT in NSCLC (n = 28 samples from n = 15 patients; e) and melanoma (n = 26 samples from n = 14 patients; f). Bacteria with P < 0.05 according to Wilcoxon test between timepoints are shown in the heatmaps.

We next computed the Bray−Curtis dissimilarity index23,25, which measures the acquired degree of similarity between the recipient patients and their matching donor. No significant differences were observed between R patients and NR patients, indicating similar levels of donor microbiota acquisition according to response status (Extended Data Fig. 4c). We next explored strain-level engraftment using the StrainPhlAn pipeline29 as described in Methods, which measures specific subspecies (strains) that engrafted from the corresponding donor. Both R patients and NR patients exhibited effective strain-level engraftment from donors with no significant difference in absolute number of strains engrafted between R and NR (Extended Data Fig. 4d). These results suggest that the global shift distinguishing R patients from NR patients observed after FMT was not driven by acquired donor−host similarity or strain engraftment from the donor.

Next, we examined species-level differential abundance between R patients and NR patients after FMT. In NSCLC R, we observed enrichment of beneficial bacteria14,30,31, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Gemmiger formicilis and Akkermansia muciniphila, after FMT, whereas enrichment of deleterious bacteria such as Streptococcus vestibularis and Fusobacterium nucleatum occurred in NR (Fig. 3c). The terminology ‘beneficial' versus ‘deleterious' refers to bacterial classification described in recent articles14,30,32,33,34,35 as associated with a ‘healthy' or ‘immunosensitive' status versus a diseased or immunoresistant status (including cancer and any chronic inflammatory disorders, respectively). In the case of melanoma R patients, we observed a relative enrichment of Bacteroides eggerthii, Bacteroides faecis and Alistipes senegalensis after FMT compared to NR patients (Fig. 3d). In both NSCLC and melanoma R patients, we observed a relative enrichment in Oscillospiraceae (also called ‘Ruminococcaceae') family members after FMT, consistent with their previously reported association with favorable ICI response30,35,36 (Fig. 3e,f). Among R patients, a concomitant relative depletion of deleterious bacteria14,30,31, including E. lavalensis, Clostridium scindens and C. innocuum, was observed after FMT compared to baseline (Fig. 3e,f). Aside from Firmicutes SGB15368, there was no overlap in enriched species between NSCLC and melanoma R patients after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Altogether, these results indicate that the post-FMT shift in the gut microbiome in R patients was not dictated by acquired donor−host similarity or strain engraftment from the donor, with limited overlap of enrichment of beneficial species after FMT in the NSCLC and melanoma cohorts.

To better understand the taxonomic drivers of clinical outcome and the global shift in the microbiome distinguishing R from NR after FMT, we next examined changes in the absolute number of species-level genome bins (SGBs, metagenomically inferred microbial taxa approximating species-level resolution)37 across key categories: (1) present uniquely in the donor, (2) present uniquely in the patient at baseline, (3) present in the patient at baseline and the donor, (4) lost SGBs relative to the SGBs detected in the patient at baseline and (5) new SGBs that were neither detected in the patient at baseline nor derived from the donor (Fig. 4a,b). Although the number of SGBs engrafted from the donor was similar in R patients versus NR patients (P = 0.15) (Extended Data Fig. 5a), we noted that the magnitude of SGB loss calculated from the patient at baseline was significantly higher in R compared to NR after FMT (P = 0.016) (Fig. 4c). The magnitude of SGBs loss from baseline in R patients was maintained in both NSCLC (P = 0.011) and melanoma (P = 0.096) subgroups (Fig. 4d). In accordance with the lack of differences in α-diversity (Extended Data Fig. 4b), we did not observe any significant decrease in overall SGBs counts in R patients over time after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 5b). This stability of overall SGBs count over time in R patients was explained by an acquisition of SGBs from the donor (category 1) or new SGBs (category 5) (Extended Data Fig. 5b). We confirmed that overall biomass did not change in R patients or in those with high median SGBs loss over time by performing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of the 16S rRNA gene (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d).

a–b, Representative bar plot of absolute number of SGBs from one NR (a) and one R (b) patient with melanoma. c–d, Absolute loss in SGBs after FMT according to response status for FMT-LUMINate NSCLC and melanoma (n = 122 samples from n = 32 patients) (two-sided) (c) and for NSCLC (n = 54 samples from n = 15 patients) and melanoma (n = 68 samples from n = 17 patients), P value computed by Wilcoxon test (two-sided) (d), subgroups.

Two weeks later, MCA-205 sarcoma cells were inoculated, and anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 was injected intraperitoneally every 3 days. As of day 3, mice also received oral gavage with bacterial cocktail or NaCl every 3 days. j, Tumor measurements at euthanization for n = 10 mice per group, results from three independent experiments using two different R samples and two different cocktails; P values were calculated using Mann−Whitney−Wilcoxon test (two-tailed).

The top SGBs lost in R patients included canonically harmful taxa associated with ICI resistance14,30,31, including Enterocloster citroniae, Enterocloster bolteae, C. innocuum, Clostridium saudiense, Clostridium spiroforme, Ruminococcus gnavus (now a member of Mediterraneibacter genus), Dialister invisus and Sellimonas intestinalis (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). Although Akkermansia muciniphila was one of the most frequently depleted species in NSCLC R, patients with aberrantly high relative abundances of A. muciniphila exceeding the 77th percentile (associated with dysbiosis31,35) experienced elimination of this species (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Examining the impact of the donor on on the degree of SGBs lost, we observed heterogeneity among individual donors (Extended Data Fig. 5h), with a trend for more pronounced SGB loss in cluster B (P = 0.07) (Extended Data Fig. 5i).

We next sought to validate our metagenomics findings using orthogonal approaches. We employed a validated qPCR-based assay of 108 selected species30,38 and confirmed that qPCR relative abundances significantly correlated with shotgun metagenomic data (Extended Data Fig. 6a). This qPCR-based approach—which, unlike metagenomics, is not limited by sequencing depth—demonstrated that the magnitude of species lost relative to the patient's baseline significantly correlated with the corresponding losses detected by metagenomics (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4g). Moreover, using this qPCR assay, loss of species from the patient's baseline was also associated with response (P = 0.012) (Extended Data Fig. 6b). To further strengthen this observation that loss of baseline SGBs was more strongly associated with response than the acquisition of donor-derived SGBs, we performed high-throughput culturomics in four R patients at baseline and at 1 month after FMT. At baseline, we isolated a mean of 54 species, spanning a total of 217 strains, compared to after FMT with a mean of 45 species, spanning a total of 183 strains (P = 0.171) (Extended Data Fig. 6c). As observed in the metagenomics results, we confirmed that significantly more species were lost in these R patients after FMT—defined as species detected in the sample at baseline but no longer detected in the post-FMT sample by culturomics—compared to those engrafted from their respective donors (P = 0.029) (Fig. 4h). Similar to the metagenomics results, the lost species in R patients belonged to genera that are considered as harmful, such as Enterocloster, Streptococcus and Dialister (Extended Data Fig. 6d).

We then processed publicly available metagenomic data from published FMT trials and applied our SGB loss pipeline to these data. We observed similar results with regards to elimination of baseline SGBs associated with R patients in our previously published phase 1 trial (MIMIC)23 of FMT in combination with anti-PD-1 in patients with untreated melanoma (P = 0.018) (Extended Data Fig. 7a) and in the first two published studies of FMT in combination with anti-PD-1 in refractory melanoma (P = 0.074 for Baruch et al.21 and P = 0.002 for Davar et al.20) (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Accordingly, pooling these results together validated the conclusion that loss of baseline SGBs was associated with favorable clinical responses (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4f). Consistent results were obtained when reanalyzing the metagenomic data from our study as well as all published studies using an independent metagenomics pipeline (BiomScope), whereby NR patients exhibited higher retention of their baseline species (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Taken together, these findings suggest that microbiome remodeling by depletion of pre-existing species may be more critical to therapeutic response than engraftment of specific donor-derived species.

Finally, to validate the relevance of lost bacterial species observed in patients, we performed FMT in antibiotic-treated specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions8,39 (Fig. 4i). We recolonized antibiotic-pretreated mice with stool sourced from two R patients with NSCLC after FMT as previously performed23. To assess the functional relevance of specific bacterial losses after FMT, we reintroduced a cocktail of bacteria isolated from the baseline sample that were depleted after FMT, specifically, for R1 (Streptococcus mutans, C. innocuum, Streptococcus parasanguinis and Enterocloster lavalensis) and for R2 (Enterocloster clostridioformis, Streptococcus anginosus and Clostridium tertium) into FMT-recipient mice by gavage. Activity of anti-PD-1 with or without anti-CTLA-4 was inhibited in the groups of mice receiving FMT plus the cocktails compared to controls receiving R FMT alone (P = 0.028 for anti-PD-1 alone and P = 0.022 for anti-PD-1 combined with anti-CTLA-4), suggesting that the loss of deleterious species is necessary to achieve the full therapeutic benefit of FMT when combined with ICI (Fig. 4j and Extended Data Fig. 7e,f).

Our results suggest that the response to FMT may be better explained by the loss of a group of deleterious bacteria rather than solely by the engraftment of individual donor strains. To investigate how bacterial loss affects the function of the global microbiome composition, we conducted untargeted plasma metabolomics to assess systemic changes in the metabolic profile after FMT. Across all cohorts, NR patients showed a significant within-group time effect for increased levels of quinolinic acid and kynurenine (P < 0.001) (Fig. 5a). Both quinolinic acid and kynurenine are metabolites of the tryptophan pathway and have been causatively linked to resistance to ICI40,41,42. In line with the notion that absence of bacterial loss was associated with resistance to therapy in our study, patients with low proportion of bacterial loss relative to their baseline had higher concentrations of plasma tryptophan after FMT (P = 0.004) (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Next, examining the metabolomic profile in the feces, we found that metabolism of the tryptophan pathway significantly decreased over time in R patients, and distinct species contributed to these tryptophan pathway dynamics in NSCLC compared to melanoma, consistent with cohort-specific bacterial signatures affecting responders in each malignancy (Fig. 5b). Taken together, these results suggest functional redundancy across different taxa in both the plasma and feces, with convergence of effects on the tryptophan pathway distinguishing R patients from NR patients after FMT.

In addition to the metabolomic profile, we examined the impact of bacterial loss on circulating inflammatory markers using high-throughput proteomics. Patients with high proportion of bacterial loss relative to their baseline exhibited distinct clustering of systemic circulating inflammatory proteins after FMT (P = 0.001) as opposed to patients with low bacterial loss, where no distinct clustering was observed (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Patients with high bacterial loss exhibited significant increase in distinct circulating pro-inflammatory proteins after FMT, including IFNγ, CXCL9, CXCL13, CCL20, CD8A, CD4 and CD28, whereas patients with low bacterial loss exhibited no distinct changes in circulating proteins after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 8c). We next investigated the impact of bacterial loss on the metabolic profile and on systemic immunity. Patients with pronounced bacterial loss exhibited an increase in the frequency of circulating CD69+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5c) (see Extended Data Fig. 9 for the gating strategies and Supplementary Fig. 3a for this subset in R versus NR after FMT) but a decrease in circulating CD127lowCD25highCD4+ regulatory T cells (Fig. 5d). Linking these findings with the metabolic profile, high plasma concentrations of quinolinic acid were associated with a reduced frequency of circulating CD8+ lymphocyte subpopulations, including PD-1+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 3b, showing this subset in R versus NR after FMT) and PD-1+CD45RA−CCR7− effector memory CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 3c, showing this subset in R versus NR after FMT). High quinolinic acid was also associated with an increased frequency of circulating CD127lowCD25highCD4+ effector memory regulatory T cells (Fig. 5g). Taken together, these results suggest that failure to eliminate baseline deleterious taxa may sustain an immunosuppressive metabolic and systemic immune milieu that compromises ICI responses.

Our study demonstrates that FMT from healthy donors can enhance the clinical activity of ICI in two malignant diseases treated with two different ICI backbones. In patients with treatment-naive NSCLC and high PD-L1 expression, FMT prior to anti-PD-1 monotherapy resulted in an ORR that exceeded the prespecified efficacy threshold, meeting the primary endpoint in our study. In addition, the ORR of 80% observed in NSCLC was higher than previously described historical data, which range from 39% to 46%1,3,43. In the melanoma cohort, administration of FMT before combination nivolumab and ipilimumab similarly yielded an ORR of 75%, exceeding the historical expected response rate of ipilimumab and nivolumab of 50−58%44. This supports the potential of FMT to overcome primary resistance to ICI and will be assessed as part of the CanBiome2 (NCT06623461) randomized trial evaluating FMT (LND-101) in combination with ICI in 128 patients.

FMT was well tolerated in combination with anti-PD-1 in patients with NSCLC, with no grade 3 or higher AEs, whereas, in historical cohorts, single-agent pembrolizumab led to grade 3 or higher AEs in approximately 10% of patients1. However, in the melanoma cohort receiving dual ICI therapy, we observed a potentially accelerated onset of immune-related AEs and also a higher-than-expected frequency of myocarditis at 15%, which has an incidence of less than 1% in the literature45. In addition, the median onset of severe toxicity was 40 days, compared to 60 days in the literature26. These toxicities clustered in recipients of FMT donors enriched in Prevotella spp. and were not observed in patients receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy (this donor provided FMT seven times in the MIMIC trial in combination with anti-PD-1 monotherapy and once in the NSCLC cohort also receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy, and none of these patients experienced grade 3 or higher AEs). These findings suggest a context-dependent interaction between specific microbial taxa and ICI backbone and implicate Prevotella spp. as a potential driver of AEs in the setting of dual immune checkpoint blockade targeting both PD-1 and CTLA-4. As such, myocarditis has been designated an AE of special interest in the ongoing randomized CanBiome2 trial (NCT06623461), where this safety signal will be prospectively monitored. In addition, donor 5 has been excluded from participating in future FMT trials. Our study highlights the importance of donor selection for future trials.

Mechanistically, our results suggest that clinical benefit from FMT is not mediated by the number of specific donor-derived strains. Although certain taxa, including F. prausnitzii, were enriched in some R patients, these associations lacked overlap across cohorts. In addition, strain-level engraftment did not differ between R and NR patients across our study and in multiple published studies23. By contrast, clinical responses were associated with a robust pattern of depletion of several deleterious bacterial species, including SIG1 (ref. 30), present at baseline from the Clostridium, Enterocloster, Streptococcus and Dialister genera. This pattern of bacterial loss was validated by metagenomics, qPCR and high-throughput culturomics. It is important to note that the two latter techniques are not limited by sequencing depth. Moreover, this pattern of microbial depletion was corroborated in three published FMT trials20,21,23 and also in the concurrent TACITO trial46, underscoring its general validity across different geographies (Asia, Europe and North America), pathologies and treatment regimens. Notably, the TACITO trial demonstrated a significant improvement in median PFS, and elimination of baseline species was noted only in the FMT group and not in the placebo group. In our study, when reintroduced into tumor-bearing mice after oral gavage of favorable FMT, these harmful bacteria led to anti-PD-1 resistance. These findings suggest that therapeutic response of FMT may result from the elimination of immunosuppressive pathobionts. In line with this speculation, we detected consistent signals at the functional level, with relative depletion of the immunosuppressive tryptophan pathway and specific tryptophan metabolites, particularly kynurenine and quinolinic acid, among R patients after FMT. Of note, serum tryptophan has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with cancer47. Mechanistically, tryptophan metabolism has been found to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to promote immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment48,49,50. In our study, high bacterial loss was associated with a favorable immunometabolic profile—characterized by increased effector CD8+ T cells, decreased regulatory T cells and reduced tryptophan metabolism.

This study has several limitations, including the single-arm design, use of multiple donors and limited power for R/NR comparisons due to the low number of NR patients. In addition, the interplay among toxicity, efficacy and bacterial loss from the intestinal tract must be explored in future mechanistic studies. Nonetheless, our data provide strong evidence in favor of the efficacy of FMT in the context of immune checkpoint inhibition. Our study identified a potentially pharmacodynamic biomarker for FMT efficacy, which is the elimination of deleterious bacteria from the intestinal microbiota. This finding may affect the design of next-generation live biotherapeutic products that should be designed not only to engraft but also to induce the depletion of deleterious pathobionts from the intestinal lumen.

To our knowledge, the FMT-LUMINate phase 2 clinical trial provides the first prospective evidence that FMT from healthy donors can enhance the efficacy of ICI in NSCLC in combination with anti-PD-1 and in melanoma in combination with anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA-4, demonstrating that FMT efficacy is reproducible across tumor pathologies and ICI backbones. Our findings that Prevotella spp. is associated with accelerated toxicity only in the context of anti-CTLA-4 therapy highlight the need to select donors and rationally design future FMT studies according to the ICI backbone. Mechanistically, the therapeutic effect of FMT may be driven by the elimination of deleterious bacteria—most notably Enterocloster, Clostridium and Streptococcus spp.—that were present at baseline. This bacterial depletion was associated with a favorable immunometabolic milieu, including reduction in quinolinic acid and expansion of CD8+ memory T cells. These results offer an actionable framework for donor selection, biomarker development and design of next-generation microbial therapies aimed at selectively eliminating immunosuppressive pathobionts.

The FMT-LUMINate trial (NCT04951583) is a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 trial that included patients with advanced NSCLC, cutaneous melanoma and uveal melanoma who were being treated with first-line ICI therapy. Biological sex was considered in the study based on self-report. Gender was not considered in the study. Patients were 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC, cutaneous melanoma or uveal melanoma and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0–2 was required. Previous treatment with palliative surgery or radiation was allowed. For the melanoma cohort, previous adjuvant anti-PD-1 was allowed provided the last dose occurred more than 6 months prior to enrollment. For the melanoma cohort, previous treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors was allowed. Major exclusion criteria included previous treatment with anti-PD-1 in the NSCLC cohort, a history of autoimmune diseases, active bowel disease, the use of daily corticosteroids >10 mg of prednisone or equivalent, symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease. Patients were enrolled and treated at five academic centers in Canada: the Centre hopitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM; Québec), the London Regional Cancer Program (LRCP; Ontario), the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Québec (CHUQ; Québec), McGill University Health Centre (MUHC; Québec) and Lakeridge Health (Oshawa, Ontario). The research ethics board at each institution approved the conduct of the trial in accordance with current federal regulations, including the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (C.05.001); the US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Part 56); International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practice Guidelines; and the Declaration of Helsinki. The Unité d'Innovations Thérapeutiques at the CHUM was responsible for administrative functions, including the establishment of a DSMB, which provided safety oversight for the trial. Trial monitoring of the conduct of the trial and data management were performed by Ozmosis, Inc. All patients provided written informed consent and were able to withdraw consent at any time without compromising their cancer treatment. Patients were not financially compensated for their participation in this study.

The clinical trial and correlative analyses were approved by the CHUM Ethics Review Board and each participating center (ethics number MP-02-2022-10121/21.173). For culturomics analysis, this was conducted under project number 2025-12377 through biobank numbers MP-02-2018-7132/17.035 and 16.161.

Patients underwent a standard bowel preparation with 4,000 ml of PEG3350 liquid solution the evening before a single FMT using oral capsules. FMT capsules (now developed as LND-101) are produced using 80−100 g of feces per dose from screened healthy donors under the supervision of the Division of Infectious Diseases at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, Canada. Each dose of capsules contained the feces from a single donor. Major exclusion criteria for healthy donors included any known transmissible pathogen, history of medical illness, any history of major infection, such as COVID-19, monkeypox and hepatitis, and recent travel. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria was previously published23,51. Donor assignment was performed according to donor availability, without particular selection other than the screening requirements. Patients were required to consume 36–40 capsules under supervision and within 2 hours of defrosting the capsules, followed by a 30-minute period of observation. If a patient required antibiotics for an active infection throughout the study protocol, a ‘salvage' FMT was performed within 14 days of the last dose of antibiotics52. Salvage FMT was not performed if the treating investigator deemed that the procedure would interfere with patient safety (that is, antibiotics administered during a severe adverse event (SAE) period). Patients were not required to undergo a second bowel preparation in the event of salvage FMT. In the event of Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis, salvage FMT was not required.

Donor screening procedures are listed in Appendix 4 of the protocol and as previously published23.

FMT capsules were prepared according to an established protocol as described in our previous study23. In brief, feces donations (80–100 g) were processed separately without pooling by mixing in 0.9% normal saline and glycerol and were filtered using a stomacher bag. The filtrate was centrifuged, and the final sediment was mixed to incorporate residual liquid to allow pipetting into capsules as previously published23.

ICI therapy was publicly funded. For the NSCLC cohort, patients received pembrolizumab at 2 mg kg−1 every 3 weeks, as per the standard of care. For the melanoma cohort, patients received ipilimumab 3 mgkg−1 intravenously plus nivolumab 1 mg kg−1 intravenously every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by maintenance nivolumab 3 mg kg−1 every 2 weeks or nivolumab 6 mg kg−1 intravenously every 4 weeks. The first cycle of ICI was initiated within 7 days after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Therapy continued at the discretion of the treating oncologist until unacceptable toxicity, completion of 2 years, progression or death. Routine imaging was completed every 3 months for the first 2 years. Acceptable imaging included computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at the discretion of the treating oncologist who was encouraged to use the same modality of imaging throughout whenever possible. The assessment of treatment response was conducted as per RECIST v1.1 (ref. 53) and iRECIST54 when applicable at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. Assessment of treatment response at all other timepoints was done by investigator-assessed RECIST. The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or a partial response and designated as ‘R' for the translational studies. All other patients (the proportion with stable disease or progressive disease as best response), were designated as ‘NR'.

At each clinic visit, patient data, to include demographics, clinical and imaging assessments and adverse event recording, were collected per protocol using a secure, password-protected, electronic data capture web-based tool (Medidata Rave Unified Life Science Platform). Patient fecal and blood samples were collected at the following timepoints: before FMT (baseline), the first cycle of ICI therapy (1 week) and the second cycle of ICI therapy (1 month), 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year. A complete clinical assessment was conducted at each visit with routine lab work per standard of care. Patients were permitted to withdraw consent at any time with no impact on treatment, although analysis of previously obtained samples was retained.

FMT and ICI-related toxicities were evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) grading scale55. Toxicities were attributed to FMT only if the investigator deemed the AE to be related to FMT and if the AE occurred before the first cycle of ICI. AEs were managed by the treating investigator in accordance with routine clinical practice guidelines. Any patient who experienced an SAE had ICI therapy suspended until resolved or discontinued at the discretion of the treating investigator. All AEs were reviewed by the trial sponsor to ensure consistency in attribution and grading.

The primary outcome of the study was the ORR in the NSCLC cohort, defined as the proportion of patients whose best objective response was either a complete response or a partial response. Best objective response was determined as the best response recorded from the first dose of study treatment until the last tumor assessment prior to initiation of subsequent therapy.

Secondary outcomes included DCR, defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete response, partial response or stable disease lasting more than 6 months; ORR in the melanoma cohort; and safety of FMT in combination with ICI. Additional secondary outcomes to be reported subsequently include PFS and OS at 12 months in both the NSCLC and cutaneous melanoma cohorts. Microbiome engraftment was evaluated by acquired donor–host similarity using the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index.

Each cohort was analyzed independently, as outlined in the study protocol, given their differing disease biology and treatment context.

Sample size was determined as follows: for the NSCLC cohort, assuming that the ORR rate is 39% (null hypothesis)3, a sample size of 18 patients has 80% power to detect an ORR of 64% (alternative hypothesis) using a one-sided binomial test with 0.10 level of significance. Because the prespecified primary endpoint of the study was ORR in the NSCLC cohort, there was no prespecified sample size calculation for the cutaneous melanoma cohort.

The present paper focuses on the NSCLC and cutaneous melanoma cohorts given prespecified primary and secondary endpoints in these groups outlined in the study protocol. Given that the uveal melanoma cohort was explicitly defined to be an exploratory cohort, the uveal melanoma cohort results will be reported separately.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread disruptions to clinical trial operations56,57,58—including delayed site activations and reductions in outpatient oncology services—accrual to the trial was slower than anticipated. The protocol was amended to a total target of 20 patients, enabling evaluation of the primary and key secondary endpoints while maintaining feasibility under pandemic-related constraints.

A total of 199 fecal samples collected from 39 patients enrolled underwent whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Stool aliquots were preserved at –80 °C in DNA/RNA Shield Buffer (Zymo Research) until processing. DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep (M) Tagmentation Kit (Illumina), following the manufacturer's instructions, and purified with a 0.7× ratio of Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Sequencing was conducted on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell (Illumina) at the University of Trento's in-house sequencing facility (Trento, Italy). Raw reads were processed through a quality control pipeline available at https://github.com/SegataLab/preprocessing. In brief, reads were filtered out if they had low quality (Q < 20), were shorter than 75 bp or contained two or more ambiguous bases. Host-derived reads (human genome hg19 and Illumina spike-in phiX174) were also removed. On average, each sample yielded approximately 48 million high-quality reads. Five samples failed internal quality control and were excluded from downstream analyses. Taxonomic profiling was carried out using MetaPhlAn 4 (database version vJun23_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202307). Of the 194 samples that passed quality control, 12 were excluded from the downstream analysis: 10 of excluded samples occurred during unscheduled visits, and two excluded samples were collected after salvage FMT. Because the salvage FMT typically involved a different donor, all samples occurring after the patient received salvage FMT were excluded.

Microbiome sequencing data were processed and analyzed using the phyloseq package (version 1.50.0). Taxonomic assignments and abundance tables were imported into a phyloseq object, including corresponding sample metadata. α-Diversity analysis was performed using the vegan package (version 2.7.1), calculating richness and Shannon index. Principal component analysis was done with the packages prcomp (version 4.4.2) and factoextra (version 1.0.7), visualizing the variance explained by the principal components and the top contributing taxa. For the donor clusters unsupervised analysis, one sample from cluster A was removed from the visualization but included in the cluster calculation. PERMANOVA analysis was performed with 999 permutations using the ‘adonis' function from the vegan package. Strain sharing between the patients and donors was calculated using StrainPhlAn4 with an in-house database for strain identification as previously published. Bray−Curtis dissimilarity was calculated between the samples and their corresponding donor samples using the ‘distance' function from phyloseq. These distances were then adjusted to their corresponding baseline sample to observe the fold change over time. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) was performed to identify microbial taxa that differentiate between subject groups according to their response, cohort or toxicity development using the package yingtools2 (version 0.0.1.184). We filtered taxa to be in at least 10% of the samples (prevalence cutoff of 5%). Features with LDA scores greater than 2 and P < 0.05 were retained. Taxonomic abundance patterns between groups were visualized via heatmaps generated by the ComplexHeatmap package (version 2.22.0). The analysis was based on differentially abundant taxa between conditions using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

The strain-level analysis to assess strain engraftment was performed following the procedure previously published23. Phylogenetic trees were generated for each SGB with StrainPhlAn4. The thresholds on normalized phylogenetic distances to define same-strain pairs were determined for each SGB separately by comparing the distances between pairs of longitudinal samples to the pairs of unrelated samples in the corresponding phylogenetic tree, and their separation was maximized with Youden's index. Strain engraftment of an SGB was detected if the donor sample had the same strain of the SGB as the post-FMT sample.

For all patients with available corresponding donor shotgun metagenomic sequencing data, SGBs in each sample were categorized as follows: ‘Baseline' for the SGBs unique only to the patient at their baseline sample; ‘Donor' for the SGBs present in the sample that matched unique SGBs from the respective donor sample but were not found in the baseline sample; ‘Both' for unique SGBs that were found in both the baseline sample and the matching donor sample; ‘New' for SGBs not present in either the ‘Donor' or the ‘Baseline'; and ‘Lost' when SGBs that were identified at baseline were no longer present in the sample. To calculate the proportion of lost SGBs, we divided the ‘Lost' SGBs by the total amount of SGBs present at baseline.

Shotgun metagenomic samples were also processed with the HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN3) pipeline (version 3.8). We evaluated the stratified pathway abundances from the MetaCyc database. Pathways with zero total abundance across all samples were filtered out. Differential abundance analysis between baseline and post-FMT was performed using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0).

Gene abundance profiling was performed using both the 10.1 million-gene integrated catalog of the human gut microbiome59 and the 8.4 million-gene integrated reference catalog of the human oral microbiome60. Filtered high-quality reads were rarefied to 20 million by seqtk and then mapped with an identity threshold of 95% of each catalog using Bowtie (version 2.4.4). A gene abundance table was generated with BiomScope software61 through a two-step procedure. First, the uniquely mapped reads (reads mapping to a single gene in the catalog) were attributed to their corresponding genes. Second, shared reads (reads that mapped with the same alignment score to multiple genes) were attributed according to the ratio of their unique mapping counts. For quantification of species, gene abundance was normalized using the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads strategy (normalization by the gene size and the number of total mapped reads reported in frequency), and species abundance was determined from the average abundance of the first 100 core genes of each species provided in the annotation of the each million-gene catalog. Species with fewer than 10 core genes detected were counted with an abundance equal to zero. Species are reported as Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) that were defined and described previously62.

Species were first categorized for each patient according to their presence status in baseline timepoint of patient and donor, defining the following categories: both, only patient, only donor and new categories. Species never seen at any timepoint were discarded. Species were then grouped by category and filtered for at least 10 observations—for example, seen in one of the categories for at least 10 patients. The proportion of patients with the species present at a given timepoint is called the species retention. The curve displaying species retention was obtained as the median of all retention values of the different species in a specific category, with 95% confidence intervals for median. P values were calculated using the Mann−Whitney−Wilcoxon test.

High-throughput culturomics was done as previously performed63. A total of 0.3 g of stool from enrolled patients was resuspended in 1 ml of sterile 1× PBS. From this suspension, seven serial dilutions were prepared, and 50 µl of each dilution was plated onto 5% Columbia agar supplemented with sheep blood (COS; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plates were incubated aerobically and anaerobically in an anaerobic chamber (5% H2, 5% CO2 and 90% N2) at 37 °C for up to 72 hours. Anaerobic conditions were achieved using sealed Zip bags (Becton Dickinson) containing GasPak anaerobic generators (Becton Dickinson). In parallel, enrichment cultures were performed by inoculating 200 µl of stool suspension into BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Aerobic (Becton Dickinson) for aerobic conditions. For anaerobic conditions, BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F (Becton Dickinson) and Yeast Casitone Fatty Acids Broth with Carbohydrates (YCFAC) were used. All broth cultures were supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood and 5% filtered rumen fluid (0.22 µm). At multiple timepoints (24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 10 days, 15 days, 21 days and 30 days), serial dilutions from enrichment broths were plated on COS agar and incubated under the same aerobic and anaerobic conditions. After incubation, isolated colonies were subcultured onto fresh COS agar and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 72 hours. Colonies were then purified and subjected to identification. Bacterial identification was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). For each isolate, a double spot was deposited onto a 96-spot MSP target plate, overlaid with 1 µl of a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (prepared in 50% acetonitrile and 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid) and allowed to dry. Spectra were acquired using a MicroFlex LT/SH mass spectrometer (Bruker) and analyzed via FlexControl version 3.4 and MALDI Biotyper Compass version 4 software. Identification was achieved by comparison to the Bruker MBT Compass BDAL reference library and an in-house spectral database. Colonies yielding identification scores higher than 1.9 were considered reliably identified at the species level. Isolates with scores lower than 1.9 were further analyzed by whole-genome sequencing for taxonomic assignment. Bacterial species detected in patient samples at baseline were compared to those identified 1 month after FMT. Due to lack of donor samples available for culturomics, we used the corresponding donor shotgun metagenomics sequencing sample. Species detected at baseline but absent at the 1-month post-FMT timepoint were classified as lost. Conversely, bacterial species present in both the donor sample and the recipient 1 month after FMT—but not detected in the patient at baseline—were defined as engrafted from the donor. Engraftment from the donor versus lost from baseline was compared using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test using GraphPad Prism (version 10.4.2) software.

Fifty microliters of plasma was mixed with 500 μl of ice-cold extraction solution (methanol:water, 9:1, v/v, at −20 °C) containing isotopically labeled internal standards. The mixture was vortexed for 5 minutes at 2,500 rpm to ensure thorough homogenization and efficient extraction of endogenous metabolites. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were collected and aliquoted into multiple fractions to be analyzed by different liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC−MS)64. Targeted detection of polyamines and bile acids was performed by LC−MS/MS using a 1290 Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a 6470 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QQQ 6470) (Agilent Technologies). For polyamine quantification, 10 μl of extract was injected into a Kinetex C18 analytical column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.6-μm particle size; Phenomenex), equipped with a C18 guard column (5 mm × 2.1 mm). The column was maintained at 40 °C using a Peltier oven. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a binary mobile phase consisting of (A) water with 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% HFBA, both freshly prepared. The initial mobile phase composition was 95% A and 5% B, followed by a linear gradient to 30% B over 7 minutes. The column was washed with 90% B for 2.25 minutes and then re-equilibrated with 5% B for 4 minutes. The autosampler was maintained at 4 °C. Mass spectrometry parameters included gas temperature of 350 °C, gas flow rate of 12 l min−1 and capillary voltage of 2.5 kV. For bile acid analysis, 10 μl of sample was injected onto a Column Poroshell 120 EC-C8 1,200 bars (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.9-μm particle size; Agilent Technologies), protected by an XDB-C18 guard column (5 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm). The column was also maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase consisted of (A) water with 0.2% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile:isopropanol (1:1, v/v), both freshly prepared. Initial conditions were 70% A and 30% B, followed by a shift to 38% B over 2 minutes, maintained for an additional 2 minutes. A rapid gradient from 38% to 60% B was applied over 30 seconds. The column was washed with 98% B for 2 minutes and re-equilibrated at 30% B for 1.5 minutes. Autosampler temperature was kept at 4 °C. Instrument parameters were set with gas temperature of 310 °C, gas flow rate of 9 l min−1 and capillary voltage of 4.5 kV. In addition, pseudo-targeted metabolomic profiling was performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHPLC−HRAM) on a Dionex U3000 UHPLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as previously described65,66. All targeted treated data were merged and cleaned with a dedicated R package (@Github/Kroemerlab/GRMeta). We applied the ComBat function from the sva R package (sva version 3.52.0) to correct for inter-batch effect. Batches were divided into two groups. The batch correction model included a design matrix preserving the biological signal from key clinical covariates. Clinical features associated with samples included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), tumor type and time of first dose of ICI. ComBat was applied on log10-transformed AreaQCCorr values.

Metabolite longitudinal data were analyzed using generalized additive models (GAMs) with the mgcv R package (version 1.9-3) using the ‘gam' function. Each metabolite was fitted with a GAM model that included the two groups (R and NR) present in the study. Before applying any model, data were cleaned by removing individuals with only one timepoint of analysis and duplicated samples. After cleaning the dataset, this metabolite analysis comprised 100 samples from 35 patients, each having at least two timepoints sampled (from two to four). Data normalization was performed before model fitting. Metabolite intensities were transformed using square root normalization with the ‘sqrt' function from R base (version 4.5). Individual GAMs were fitted for each metabolite with the following model structure:

Smooth terms for time with group-specific evolution over time using factor smooth interactions

Random effects for individual patients

Tweedie distribution to account for the data distribution characteristics

Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation method

Time was modeled with penalized splines. The effective degree of freedom (edf) indicates the complexity of the time curve. In the fitted models, edf values excedeed 1, which is consistent with a nonlinear pattern. Model performance was assessed by calculating root mean squared error to evaluate model accuracy deviance explained and R2 to assess how much the model explained the signal variance, along with residual analysis and concurvity assessment. Temporal evolution was evaluated from the fitted group-specific time smooth across the entire observation window. Reported P values are the significance tests for these time smooths, assessing the null hypothesis of no within-group time effect (flat curve). Temporal evolution was evaluated through model outputs and P value. Between-group differences were calculated using the ‘difference_smooths' function from the gratia package (version 0.10.0) to compute differences between R and NR smooth curves with 95% confidence intervals. Figures displaying temporal evolution were created using smooth estimates calculated with the ‘smooth_estimates' function from the gratia package. Both trajectory and difference plots were generated using the ‘ggplot' function from the ggplot2 package (version 3.5.2) and combined using the ‘plot_grid' function from the cowplot package (version 1.1.3). P values were displayed using the ‘ggsignif' function from the ggsignif package (version 0.6.4). Data manipulation was performed using the dplyr package (version 1.1.4) and tidyverse (version 2.0.0). All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.5).

We used Precision Microbiome Profiling (PMPTM) (Bio-Me), which is a validated qPCR method for analyzing the gut microbiome composition, based on TaqMan technology on the OpenArray format (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This assay targets 108 bacterial species and subspecies (107 bacteria and one fungal species). Standard curves for the assays were created using reference materials quantified by fluorescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent). The reference materials were acquired from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ or the American Type Culture Collection. Standard curves for each qPCR assay were used to convert the quantification cycle (Cq) value into number of genomic copies per microliter of sample; this number was transformed into normalized absolute quantification. qPCR was performed on 220 samples in total (n = 181 patients and n = 39 donors), and only patient samples with corresponding SGB category information were included in the final analysis (n = 104 samples). Quantitative PCR and metagenomics relative abundance were visualized using the ComplexHeatmap package in R, and a Kendall score Kendall's τ was computed using the ‘cor.test' function in the ‘stat' package using pairwise complete observations. Spearman′s r correlations were performed using GraphPad Prism.

Multiplex high-throughput proteomics was performed using the Immuno-Oncology Panel (Olink) and analyzed per the manufacturer's instructions. All Olink data are reported as linearized normalized protein expression (NPX), per the manufacturer's instructions. Olink data were visualized in R using the OlinkAnalyze package using ‘olink_umap_plot' using manyfold approximations and projections using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and ‘olink_volcano_plot'. For volcano plots, Benjamini−Hochberg-corrected P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to assess the relative abundance of total bacterial DNA in stool samples by targeting the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The primer pair used was 891F (5′-TGGAGCATGTGGTTTAATTCGA-3′) and 1033R (5′-TGCGGGACTTAACCCAACA-3′)67. For each reaction, 400 ng of extracted DNA was combined with 500 nM of each primer and 1× qPCRBIO SyGreen Blue Mix Hi-ROX (PCR Biosystems). Amplification was carried out using a real-time PCR system, and threshold cycle (Ct) values were obtained. Bacterial load was estimated by comparing sample Ct values to a standard curve generated using serial dilutions of Escherichia coli genomic DNA, allowing for the approximation of bacterial DNA concentration in ng μl−1. Non-parametric Mann−Whitney−Wilcoxon test to compare SGB loss groups and two-way ANOVA were performed in GraphPad Prism.

Aliquots of cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), each containing 5 × 106 cells preserved in fetal calf serum (FCS) with DMSO, were quickly thawed, gently washed and resuspended in FACS buffer consisting of 1× PBS supplemented with 5% FCS and 2 mM EDTA. To exclude non-viable cells, samples were incubated with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Surface staining was performed using fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies sourced from BD Biosciences, R&D Systems, MBL, BioLegend, Miltenyi Biotec and Cytek (see reagent list for detailed panel composition; Supplementary Table 3). Data were acquired with a Cytek Aurora 5-laser spectral analyzer, and data analysis was performed using FlowJo version 10.8.1 software.

Flow cytometry analysis of PBMCs followed a sequential gating strategy that excluded debris, cell doublets and non-viable cells, ultimately selecting for viable CD45+ immune cells. The resulting CD45+ live-cell populations were exported as new .fcs files using FlowJo version 10.8.1, and these curated datasets served as input for UMAP and Single-cell Cytometry Annotation Network (Scyan) analyses.

The UMAPs were computed and displayed using the Scanpy package68 on alive CD45+ cells.

Cell type annotations were automatically performed using Scyan69 a biology-driven model that leverages prior knowledge of cell types. This approach allowed us to identify nine main populations: basophils, natural killer cells, B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, double-positive T cells and double-negative T cells. Subsequently, for each patient, separate .fcs files were generated for each of these nine populations. The percentages of all subpopulations were then determined through manual gating using FlowJo version 10.8.1.

All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee at the Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM) and carried out in compliance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines (ethical protocol C22017Br). Murine experiments were conducted using 7-week-old female wild-type C57BL/6 SPF-reared mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Mice received 3 days of antibiotics solution containing ampicillin (1 mg ml−1), streptomycin (5 mg ml−1) and colistin (1 mg ml−1) (Sigma-Aldrich), which was added to the sterile drinking water of mice before FMT. Three consecutive FMTs, using patient feces (ethics approval was obtained (MP-02-2022-10121/21.173, MP-02-2018-7132/17.035 and 16.161)), were performed at day −15, day −14 and day −13 (Fig. 4i). FMT was performed by thawing fecal material, and 200 µl of the suspension (100 mg ml−1) was then transferred by oral gavage. An additional 100 µl was applied on the fur of each animal.

Two weeks after the first FMT, mice were implanted subcutaneously with 0.8 × 106 MCA-205 cells. When tumors reached 25−35 mm2 in size or 35−45 mm2 in size for anti-PD-1 monotherapy and anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 experiments, respectively, mice were treated four times intraperitoneally every 3 days with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (250 μg per mouse; Bio X Cell, clone RMP1-14) or anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody plus anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (100 µg per mouse; Bio X Cell, clone 9D9). Additionally, the mice received a 200-µl gavage of NaCl or bacterial cocktail group starting 3 days after the tumor implantation and at each treatment. Tumor sizes were measured with manual calipers. The mice were euthanized 2 days after the last treatment. Experimental groups were compared using the Mann−Whitney−Wilcoxon test in GraphPad Prism.

For murine experiments, bacterial cocktails were prepared as follows. Bacterial strains used in the murine experiments were isolated from patients at baseline enrolled in the FMT-LUMINate clinical trial and stored at –80 °C. Bacteria were cultured from frozen stocks on fastidious anaerobe agar plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PB0225A) for 48 hours at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. Prior to cocktail formulation, the identity of each isolate was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. After identification, bacterial colonies were collected, resuspended in sterile NaCl and adjusted to an optical density of 1.0, corresponding to approximately 1 × 109 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter.

MCA-205 fibrosarcoma cells, class I MHC H-2b syngeneic cell lines for C57BL/6 mice, were used for this study and obtained from Jonathan Stagg's laboratory. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 UI ml−1 penicillin−streptomycin. All reagents were purchased from Gibco-Invitrogen. Cell lines were checked for mycoplasma using PlasmoTest Mycoplasma Detection Kit (InvivoGen).

All statistical analysis and visualization were done in R or GraphPad Prism (version 10.4.2). P values were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05, and all P values were two-sided.

A comprehensive review finds that tea, especially green tea, is strongly associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), obesity, diabetes, and several forms of cancer. Beyond these well known benefits, tea consumption is also linked to brain protection, reduced muscle loss in older adults, and anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Together, these findings point to tea as a beverage with broad potential to support long-term health. At the same time, the review highlights important concerns related to certain modern tea products, particularly bottled and bubble teas, which may include artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and other additives.

Tea is produced from the leaves of Camellia sinensis and has been consumed worldwide for centuries. It was first used mainly for medicinal purposes before becoming a widely enjoyed daily drink. Researchers have long been interested in tea because it contains high levels of polyphenols, especially catechins, which are believed to play a key role in its health effects. The review examines tea's influence on multiple health outcomes using evidence from laboratory research as well as human studies. While green tea has been studied extensively, much less is known about the health effects of other varieties, including black, oolong, and white tea, particularly when comparing their benefits. The review also considers potential risks tied to additives and contaminants found in some commercially produced tea beverages.

Study Highlights Gaps in Current Research

The findings were published in Beverage Plant Research by Mingchuan Yang & Li Zhou's team, Tea Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The authors emphasize that additional research is needed to more clearly define both the benefits and possible risks of tea consumption across different populations and tea types.

How Tea Affects the Heart, Metabolism, and Weight

According to the review, green tea stands out for its protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Studies show it can help lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol levels. Large cohort studies also suggest that people who regularly drink tea have a lower risk of death from all causes, reduced rates of CVDs, and a decreased likelihood of developing certain cancers. Tea may also play a role in weight management and diabetes control. Evidence indicates that green tea catechins can support weight loss and improve metabolic markers in individuals with obesity.

Brain Health and Muscle Preservation in Aging

Tea consumption is also associated with benefits beyond heart and metabolic health. Research suggests that regular tea drinkers, particularly older adults, show lower rates of cognitive decline and fewer biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's disease. In addition, tea catechins may help slow age-related muscle loss. This effect could support better muscle strength, physical function, and overall performance in seniors.

Potential Risks From Processed Tea Products

Despite tea's many advantages, the review cautions that not all tea products offer the same health value. Bottled teas and bubble teas often contain added sugar, artificial sweeteners, and preservatives that may weaken or offset tea's natural benefits. The authors also note concerns about pesticide residues, heavy metals, and microplastics found in tea. While these contaminants are not considered a significant risk for most people at typical intake levels, they may be more relevant for individuals who consume large amounts of tea over long periods. The review also discusses how tea can interfere with the absorption of certain nutrients, including non-heme iron and calcium, which may be important for people following vegetarian diets or those with specific nutritional requirements.

Freshly Brewed Tea Offers the Most Benefit

Overall, the review concludes that tea provides clear health benefits, especially when consumed in its traditional, freshly brewed form. Moderation is advised when it comes to processed options like bottled tea and bubble tea due to their added sugars and preservatives. The authors suggest that regular, moderate intake of brewed tea may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. They also note that future studies examining long-term consumption, differences among tea varieties, and the impact of contaminants will be essential for refining guidance on tea's health effects.

Last year, a swarm of AI browsers from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Opera, and The Browser Company launched with the aim to replace Chrome with features like sidebar assistants and automated tasks. Now Google is flexing its own AI muscle by adding similar features to Chrome, the world's largest browser by market share.

While Google had introduced Gemini to Chrome last September, the assistant lived in a floating window. With this update, the company will put its AI helper into a persistent sidebar, so you can ask questions about the current website or other open tabs.

One interesting feature Google demoed to press ahead of today's launch involved multiple tabs. When you open different tabs from a single web page, the Gemini sidebar understands them as a context group. This is helpful when you are comparing prices or different products you're considering purchasing.

Before today, the Gemini in Chrome feature was available only to Windows and macOS users. With this rollout, the sidebar will be available to Chromebook Plus users as well.

Google is also taking advantage of its newly launched personal intelligence feature, which connects to your Gmail, Search, YouTube, and Google Photos accounts, allowing you to ask questions based on your own data. This feature will roll out in Chrome in the coming months, meaning that you can ask Gemini in the sidebar about things like your family's schedule, or ask it to draft an email and send it without switching to Gmail.

There's a new Nano Banana integration coming to Chrome, too, that allows you to modify an existing image with another image or product that you find while browsing.

However, the most ambitious feature is called auto-browse, which aims to handle tasks for you by using your personal information and traversing websites on your behalf. For instance, you can ask the agentic feature to go to a particular website and buy an item for you, and find a discount coupon. The agent will ask for your intervention when performing data-sensitive tasks, such as logging into a website or making a final purchase. 

Last year, the company explained that these features would use Chrome's password manager or saved card details, but said its AI models wouldn't be exposed to any of these details.

This feature is rolling out initially to AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S.

Browser-based agents are finicky and often fail to complete tasks. Google's demo, just like tons of other AI demos, involved shopping and travel planning. In real-world use cases, agents often don't get the intent or break during traversing different sites, and that would be a challenge for wider adoption.  

The company said that in its early testing, users have used the feature for tasks such as scheduling appointments, filling out tedious online forms, collecting their tax documents, getting quotes for plumbers and electricians, and filing expense reports.

The company said that the Gemini sidebar support and Nano Banana integration are arriving starting today, while the personal intelligence feature will be available in the “coming months.”

Google debuted a new “Auto Browse” feature for Chrome on Wednesday. The tool, powered by Google's current Gemini 3 generative AI model, is an AI agent designed to take over your Chrome browser to help complete online tasks like booking flights, finding apartments, and filing expenses.

The release of Auto Browse is part of Google's continued integration of AI features into Chrome. Last year, Google dropped the “Gemini in Chrome” mode to answer questions about what's on web pages and synthesize details from multiple open tabs.

Auto Browse, which users can access by launching the Gemini sidebar in Chrome, will only be available today in the US to subscribers of Google's monthly AI Pro and AI Ultra plans. It's unclear when Auto Browse will become available to nonpaying users and additional countries.

Google's rollout squares with Silicon Valley's vision for the future of web browsing, which includes a whole lot more AI and a whole lot less of you. Whether it's a browser designed from inception around generative AI, like OpenAI's Atlas, or one that's been retrofitted with new AI-based tools, like Google's Chrome, almost every option available to consumers now has some level of baked-in AI. (The Vivaldi browser is a notable exception for users who want to avoid AI-powered web browsing.)

In a prelaunch demo, Charmaine D'Silva, a director of product management for Chrome, showed me an example of Auto Browse helping her shop online. “Instead of having to remember where I bought something and try to reorder something,” she said, “I can now delegate to Auto Browse within Gemini to be able to go ahead and buy jackets for me.” By typing a message to the Gemini sidebar in Chrome, D'Silva requested the bot reorder a jacket she bought last year, and to find a discount coupon code before making the purchase.

Auto Browse in action.

When initiated, Auto Browse takes over Chrome and makes ghostly clicks in its own tab while it attempts to complete the given task. “Use Gemini carefully and take control if needed,” reads a disclaimer on the demo version. “You are responsible for Gemini's actions during tasks.” Even though you're sending it off into the digital wilderness, Google still sees you as responsible for what its bot does online while following your requests.

For now, the automation only goes so far. Tasks that are deemed by Google to be more sensitive, like posting on social media and swiping your credit card, still require a bit of user oversight. In these situations, the Chrome bot will lay out the steps it took to get that far in and ask the user if they would like to proceed.

Anyone interested in experimenting with Auto Browse should strongly consider the security implications of this kind of automation. Despite Google's efforts to make it safer to use, Auto Browse and similar AI-based tools are still at risk of being deceived by prompt injection attacks when visiting malicious websites, which trick the bot into acting in ways that the initial user did not intend.

I'll be testing Auto Browse this week to get a sense of its initial strengths, weaknesses, and what the tool actually means for average Chrome users. Generally, I'm skeptical about agentic AI tools designed to make your life more efficient and sweep up all your digital chores. The bots are almost always overhyped, and I've found them to be consistently unreliable. Still, Google is insistent on realigning the web browsing experience around AI. Given Google's track record for pushing out new features gradually, you should expect Auto Browse to roll out more widely in the near future.

The San Francisco Police Department is investigating an accident involving a Zoox autonomous vehicle that crashed into the driver's-side door of a parked car, TechCrunch has learned.

Officers responded to the crash, which occurred at around 2 p.m. local time on January 17 near the intersection of 15th and Mission Streets, according to the department. The Zoox robotaxi was traveling along 15th street when a street ambassador named Jamel Durden opened the driver's-side door of his 1977 Cadillac Coupe DeVille, according to Mission Local, which first reported the crash.

Durden's hand was reportedly smashed during the crash, and the Zoox vehicle suffered damage to its glass doors. The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) told TechCrunch the Zoox vehicle was carrying a passenger at the time, which has not been previously reported. That passenger was an employee of Zoox, according to the company, and was not injured, which the SFPD confirmed.

The police department declined to provide TechCrunch with an incident report “[d]ue to the fact it is still an open investigation.” Zoox filed its own police report about the incident, the company told TechCrunch, but said no additional details have been requested. In a statement on January 20, Zoox said it was “cooperating with local authorities to provide an accurate account of the incident.”

The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which regulates autonomous vehicles in the state, has also met with Zoox about the January 17 crash. The DMV told TechCrunch that Zoox filed a crash report “in compliance with California regulations.” That report is not yet publicly available. 

Zoox is in the early stages of building out its robotaxi service in San Francisco. In November, the company started offering free rides to members of the public who are part of the “Zoox Explorer” early-rider program. The company is operating a similar program in Las Vegas, Nevada.

This rollout has come with challenges. The Amazon-owned company issued a recall in December to fix an issue where some of its vehicles were crossing center lanes and blocking crosswalks. (Zoox also issued two different software updates during recalls earlier in 2025 before it started offering public rides.)

The January crash in San Francisco happened when Durden “suddenly opened” the door of his car into the path of the robotaxi, according to Zoox. The company said the robotaxi “identified the opening door and tried to avoid it but contact was unavoidable.” (Durden could not be reached for comment.)

Zoox also said it offered medical attention to Durden, who allegedly declined. According to Mission Local, Durden refused medical treatment until his car was towed.

“Safety and transparency are foundational to Zoox, and we are cooperating with local authorities to provide an accurate account of the incident,” the company said in a statement.

Amazon announced another round of layoffs Wednesday morning, impacting roughly 16,000 employees, just months after the company cut thousands of corporate jobs last fall.

The announcement came in a blog post by Amazon's Senior VP of People Experience and Technology, Beth Galetti, and follows a previous round of layoffs in October that affected about 14,000 corporate workers. Amazon said U.S.-based employees will have time to search for new roles within the company, while those who are unable to find one or choose not to will receive a severance package.

“Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months,” wrote Galetti. “That's not our plan. But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate. That's never been more important than it is today in a world that's changing faster than ever.”

While Galetti framed the layoffs as part of routine organizational adjustments, her message did little to ease fears that more cuts could be coming. After all, “That's not our plan. But…” is not a phrase anyone wants to hear.

She added that Amazon is still hiring and investing in strategic areas that are “critical” to the company's future. It feels fair to assume that one of these areas is AI.

So far, Amazon has been careful not to say outright whether AI is wholly responsible for its recent job cuts.

In the announcement for the October layoffs, Galetti described AI as the most transformative technology the company has ever seen, saying it allows companies to innovate faster than ever before and requires Amazon to operate more “leanly.”

But during an investor call in October, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pushed back on the idea that the company's recent layoffs were driven primarily by AI or financial pressures.

“What I would tell you is, you know, the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI driven, not right now at least,” Jassy told investors. “It's culture.”

Wednesday's blog post echoed that same explanation.

“As I shared in October, we've been working to strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy. While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now,” Galetti wrote.

Still, Jassy has previously been more candid about the long-term impact AI could have on Amazon's workforce. In a blog post last summer, he acknowledged that as the company rolls out AI tools across its business, the technology will likely lead to fewer jobs overall.

He wrote, “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”

Despite the layoffs, Amazon's business is booming. The company is set to report its final quarterly earnings for 2025 next week, but in its most recent earnings report, Amazon said sales rose 13% to $180.2 billion in the three months ending September 30.

Artificial intelligence has gotten a bad reputation lately, and often for good reason. But a team of scientists at Google's DeepMind now claims to have found a revolutionary use case for AI: helping humanity unravel the “dark matter” of our genome more effectively than ever before.

In a study published today in Nature, DeepMind researchers debuted their deep learning model, dubbed AlphaGenome. Compared to existing models, AlphaGenome can predict the function of much longer sequences of DNA while still maintaining a similar level of accuracy, the researchers claim. The team is hopeful its model can become a valuable tool to analyze how subtle variations in human DNA can affect our health and biology, particularly in the vast majority of the genome that works silently in the background.

“We are thrilled to introduce AlphaGenome: our solution to deciphering the complex regulatory code,” said Pushmeet Kohli, vice president of research at Google DeepMind, in a press briefing held Tuesday.

Our DNA contains the instructions for building and regulating every biological aspect of ourselves. But only a tiny portion of our genes, 2% or so, actually carry the code for the tens to hundreds of thousands of proteins that perform the functions a body needs to survive, such as insulin or collagen. The other 98% of our DNA is made of non-coding regions, more eloquently known as the dark matter of our genome. Scientists once assumed our genetic dark matter was comprised of worthless junk DNA, but we now know that it contains sequences vital to regulating our protein-making genes.

Scientists Launch Wild New Project to Build a Human Genome From Scratch

While scientists have mapped out most of the human genome, we still know very little about how many of these genes work, especially those found in non-coding regions; we're also largely in the dark about how variations in these genes can affect their functioning. Long before AI became a cultural buzzword (and punching bag), scientists had been using deep learning models—trained on lab data—to more efficiently sift through the mountains of the human genome and to predict a gene or DNA sequence's function. But DeepMind researchers say AlphaGenome is the most comprehensive and accurate DNA sequence model to date.

The DeepMind researchers trained the model on both human and mouse genomes. It can reportedly analyze up to 1 megabase (Mb)—about 1 million DNA letters—at a time, compared to older models capable of analyzing upwards of 500 kilobases (kb), though at some cost. From that sequence, the model is said to “predict thousands of functional genomic tracks.” These tracks aren't just limited to how a gene or DNA sequence is expressed but also other less visible functions. These include the interactions between coding and non-coding regions of DNA, or the structure of chromatins (the loose packages of genetic material typically found in a cell; chromosomes are the more neatly packaged version).

In the paper, the researchers also detailed how AlphaGenome matched or outperformed other existing AI models in 25 out of 26 tests measuring how well it could predict the effects of a genetic variant. More than just accuracy, however, the model can do more at once; it can simultaneously predict nearly 6,000 human genetic signals tied to specific functions, according to the researchers.

At least some outside scientists have praised the capabilities of AlphaGenome, while noting that it can't solve every lingering mystery about our genetic code just yet.

“At the Wellcome Sanger Institute we have tested AlphaGenome using over half a million new experiments and it does indeed perform very well,” Ben Lehner, head of Generative and Synthetic Genomics at the University of Cambridge's Wellcome Sanger Institute, told the Science Media Center. “However, AlphaGenome is far from perfect and there is still a lot of work to do. AI models are only as good as the data used to train them. Most existing data in biology is not very suitable for AI—the datasets are too small and not well standardized.”

‘Better Drugs, Better Health': A Human Genome Pioneer Talks About the Future of Genetics

All that said, the DeepMind researchers—and others in the field—believe AlphaGenome marks a true milestone in AI genomics, one that could help make the technology practical for broader use. They argue that AlphaGenome, or similar models, could now be used to better diagnose rare genetic diseases, identify mutations that drive cancer, or uncover new drug targets.

President Donald Trump's administration appears to believe that general rules don't apply. Whether it's disappearing undocumented immigrants, shooting US citizens and deploying the National Guard against them, capturing the leader of a sovereign nation, or threatening to take control of Greenland, Trump's reach appears limitless.

But despite the bravado, there is one situation that, so far, Trump has been unable to bend to his will: the case of Tina Peters, a former election clerk in Mesa County, Colorado, who became a hero in the election denial community after she used another person's credentials to facilitate an associate watching a software update of her county's election management system.

Peters has served roughly 14 months of a nine-year prison sentence, and figures in the election denial community like former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn have been campaigning for her release ever since. Over the last few months, Trump has joined in, seemingly pressuring the state of Colorado to release Peters.

Unlike the nearly 1,600 January 6 prisoners Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of on his first day in office, the president cannot pardon Peters because she was convicted on state rather than federal charges—though this didn't stop Trump issuing a “pardon” on Truth Social last month. Nevertheless, Trump is now conducting an increasingly intense pressure campaign against Colorado and its Democratic governor, Jared Polis, whom Trump has called a “sleazebag” and a “scumbag” for refusing to release Peters.

Polis has since said he is considering granting clemency to Peters, a decision that has left elected officials in the state, both Democrats and Republicans, baffled and worried. Those who spoke to WIRED warned that reducing jail time for Peters—who continues to maintain her innocence and has shown no signs of remorse—would endanger the lives of election workers ahead of the midterms in November.

“I have major concerns that [commuting Peters' sentence] emboldens the far right that has been attacking our elections and election officials,” Jena Griswold, Colorado's secretary of state and the state's top election official, tells WIRED. “I am concerned about the message that it sends to those of us who have been on the front lines in this threat environment, doing the work, day in and day out. The idea that the work we do to protect our elections and democracy can be so quickly undermined and the effect that has on election officials.”

Polis declined to be interviewed, but his spokesperson Shelby Wieman tells WIRED, “The Governor takes the responsibility of clemency very seriously, and his team reviews all applications submitted. He will review this inmate's application just like he would any other.”

Peters first came to national attention in May 2021 when she allowed Conan Hayes, a former pro surfer who later worked for pillow-salesman-turned-election-denier Mike Lindell, unauthorized access to election equipment in Mesa County, as part of a scheme to prove that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from Trump. QAnon promoter Ron Watkins subsequently published the data taken from Mesa County in 2021, which also appeared on the conspiracy-filled Gateway Pundit website. The information was widely hailed by election deniers as further proof that US elections were rigged, even though widescale election rigging in 2020 was never actually proven, and Trump's own officials called it the most secure election in history. (Hayes was never charged with a crime.)

Peters was officially charged in March 2022 when she was already campaigning to become Colorado's secretary of state. In June 2022, Peters lost the Republican primary but immediately questioned the validity of the result. A recount added 13 more votes to her total, but she still lost the primary by over 88,000 votes.

Peters was convicted in August 2024 on seven of the 10 charges she was facing, including four felonies. At her sentencing hearing in October 2024, district judge Matthew Barrett said: “You are no hero. You're a charlatan who used and is still using your prior position in office to peddle snake oil that's been proven to be junk time and time again.” She is due for parole in September 2028.

While Peters has been incarcerated at the medium-security La Vista Correctional Facility for women in Pueblo, she has continued to be portrayed as a hero among the election denial community. Trump appeared to pay little attention to her cause, but in recent months, as Peters' legal team was preparing to appeal her conviction, something changed.

The first signs the Trump administration was taking an interest in the case came in early March, when the Department of Justice announced it was reviewing Peters' conviction. The announcement came just weeks before Trump criticized Polis for hanging an unflattering portrait of the president in the State Capitol.

In May, Trump posted for the first time about Peters' case on Truth Social: “Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment,” Trump wrote. “This is a Communist persecution by the Radical Left Democrats to cover up their Election crimes and misdeeds in 2020.”

Trump then called for the Department of Justice to “to take all necessary action to help secure the release of this ‘hostage' being held in a Colorado prison by the Democrats, for political reasons.”

He repeated his call for her release in another Truth Social post in August, threatening to take “harsh measures” if Peters was not freed. In early September, Trump announced the relocation of Space Command from Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado to the Army's Redstone Arsenal in Alabama.

In November, the Federal Bureau of Prisons sent a letter to Colorado to get Peters transferred to a federal prison, a request that can only be initiated by state authorities. Days after the letter was sent, Trump once again posted in support of Peters on Truth Social, writing: “FREE TINA PETERS, WHO SITS IN A COLORADO PRISON, DYING & OLD.”

Election workers and some Colorado officials have now come to believe that the president is engaging in a pressure campaign on Colorado. In recent months, the administration has threatened to remove the state's control over its wolf reintroduction program, Trump announced plans to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research based in Boulder, and on December 30, Trump vetoed plans to complete the Arkansas Valley Conduit, an infrastructure project designed to bring clean drinking water to some 50,000 people in the southeast part of Colorado. The Trump administration also appears to now be trying to claw back federal grants from low-income families in Colorado.

Throughout this period, Trump has continued to post about Peters' cause on Truth Social, specifically targeting Polis, whom he called “the SLEAZEBAG Governor of Colorado” on December 3. On New Year's Eve, Trump wrote on Truth Social: ”Hard to wish [Peters] a Happy New Year, but to the Scumbag Governor and the disgusting “Republican” (RINO!) DA … I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell. FREE TINA PETERS!” (Trump has posted about Peters' cause eight times on Truth Social over the last nine months.)

At the time, Peters' legal team, led by Peter Ticktin, who attended the New York Military Academy with Trump, were putting in the work. On December 7, Ticktin sent a nine-page letter to Trump outlining his client's case and seeking a pardon. Four days later, on December 11, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Today I am granting Tina a full Pardon for her attempts to expose Voter Fraud in the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election.” Though Trump has no power to pardon those convicted on state charges, Ticktin claimed it applied to his client.

Peters's legal team has applied for clemency from the governor. While Polis didn't initially seem likely to entertain the idea, in recent weeks he has hinted that he is considering commuting her sentence, which he has labeled “harsh.”

“You look at every case on clemency on the merits,” Polis told CBS recently. “You have somebody who is nonviolent, a first-time offender, elderly. On the other hand, does she take full accountability for her crime? We don't look at this in isolation.”

Polis' possible change of heart has left many in Colorado baffled. Earlier this month, Griswold, together with a Colorado county clerk and the director of the state's clerks association, sent Polis a letter urging him not to commute Peters's sentence.

“I do not believe that giving in to a vengeful president makes the retribution stop,” Griswold tells WIRED. “Trump is a lawless president. He disregards the law, he disregards the Constitution, and when people do not cave, he then starts retribution. I believe giving in leads to more illegal actions and outrageous actions from the president.”

“Donald Trump and I have known each other since we were 15 years old,” Ticktin tells WIRED, adding that he has spoken to the president about the case directly but says Trump's actions are not about retribution: “By Governor Polis standing up to Donald Trump for something that's unreasonable, he's drawing more attention to the state and causing the state to be looked at more, [but] I don't think that it's retaliation by Donald Trump.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about whether Trump is conducting a retribution campaign against Colorado, but instead provided a list of reasons why each action was taken—even including responses to two issues WIRED didn't raise: childcare funding and disaster relief.

Election clerks around Colorado have already been meeting to discuss Peters' possible pardon and following an online meeting this month, all but one of the members of the Colorado County Clerks Association agreed to the wording of the letter Griswold sent to Polis.

Matt Crane, the executive director of the clerks' association, says that for his members, just months out from critical midterm elections, even the suggestion that Peters' sentence could be commuted sends the wrong message, and potentially endangers lives. Election workers have been under threat for years, and just this past summer an election office in Archuleta County in southern Colorado was firebombed by a suspect who, according to the arrest affidavit, believes in election denial conspiracy theories.

“The environment is already hostile for election officials because of the lies coming from the president and his supporters, so this stuff with Tina just exacerbates that,” says Crane. “If the governor commutes her sentence, it sends a very clear message that it is OK for people to undermine our institutions and attack our elections, both the election itself and the people who do the work, because they'll have a ‘Get Out of Jail Free' card.”

It's looking to cut around 1,700 positions, mostly at the management level.

Despite the massive AI infrastructure build-out and a bumper earnings call on Tuesday, ASML, the only company in the world that manufactures the tools that make the cutting-edge chips that are currently in high demand, announced that it plans to lay off some of its employees. According to the company's announcement, it's streamlining its Technology and IT & Data organizations, with the former moving “from a project/matrix setup to one where most of our engineers will be dedicated to a specific product and module.” This reorganization is meant to simplify processes and decision-making throughout the company.

“As a result of these proposed changes, some roles — mainly at the leadership level — may no longer be required,” ASML said in its press release. “At the same time, to retain our engineering capability, we will create new engineering jobs to strengthen existing technology projects and embark on new ones to support our own and our customers' growth plans. While this will allow some of our impacted colleagues to move to new roles, we have to acknowledge that some will leave ASML as a result.” This isn't just a minor trim for the two departments, too. Even though ASML still plans on creating roles in Manufacturing, Customer Support, and Sales, it expects to reduce its headcount by 1,700 positions, mostly affecting the Netherlands and the United States.

ASML has a practical monopoly on chipmaking tools, and it stands to benefit from the continuing growth of the semiconductor industry. Despite that, it seems that it wants to maintain a lean and efficient workforce, even as it's growing its headcount and footprint with its Eindhoven expansion expected to be online by 2028. “As our FY 2025 financial results demonstrate, we are choosing to make these changes at a moment of strength for the company,” the company stated. “Improving our processes and systems will allow us to innovate more and innovate better, generating further responsible growth for ASML and our stakeholders.”

This is one of the first major announcements of layoffs in the tech industry for 2026, which has been hit with over 100,000 job cuts in just the first half of last year. Intel took the lead with the layoffs, prompted by the financial disaster that first came to light in 2024, with Microsoft and Meta following closely behind. However, these job losses aren't caused by a contraction of the tech industry — instead, it's driven by industry shifts, with AI and automation taking over many entry-level positions. ASML's announcement, though, is different, with many of the affected personnel expected to be from leadership positions — mostly middle managers and up.

The next Saw wants to interrogate one of Jigsaw's oldest philosophies. Diane Lane is joining Mike Flanagan's Exorcist movie. Plus, get a look at what's coming on this week's Starfleet Academy. Spoilers, away!



A rumor from Daniel Richtman (via Comicbook) alleges that, after a string of misfires (Madame Web innocent), Sony is potentially now more open to working with Marvel Studios on allowing the MCU to use some of the Spider-Man characters it owns the adaptive rights to.

Deadline reports Diane Lane has joined the cast of Mike Flanagan's Exorcist movie in a currently undisclosed role.

Hidden away in an article on the Blake Lively controversy, Puck (via World of Reel) reports Ryan Reynolds is now working on a fourth Deadpool movie.

In a recent interview with Letterboxd, James Wan revealed Saw 12 will take Jigsaw's philosophy of ignoring “scumbag(s)” who still “appreciate life” to task.

Leigh and I both want to recapture the spirit of that first film and revisit Jigsaw's philosophy, which is that he goes after people who don't appreciate their lives. If you're a scumbag, but you appreciate your life, he doesn't see you as someone who's wasting your life, so I want to go back to what we touched on in the first movie with regard to that.

At the same time, I want to honor what people have come to love about the franchise, whilst trying to do something fresh and new that we haven't seen before.

Later in the interview, Wan erroneously calls the film “the eleventh installment” of the franchise, possibly casting Spiral: From the Book of Saw into the realm of franchise apocrypha.

This next movie would be the eleventh installment, and there've been lots of films in this world. We need to do something different in order to reach out to a new generation that didn't grow up with it.

In another recent interview with MovieWeb, Madelaine Petsch revealed she's attached to a remake of a “deep cut” 70's horror film still trying to acquire funding.

There's one film from the '70s that I really want to remake, but I'm in the process of figuring that out so I don't want to say it yet. But I'm really excited about it if it happens. It's so cool. I don't know how no one's remade it yet. t's kind of like a deep cut though. I hadn't heard about it until very recently, and then I watched it and I was like, ‘This is crazy! I have to remake this.'

Elsewhere, James Gunn impishly shared these images detailing an elaborate marketing plan for “Chocos”, the fictional sandwich cookie beloved by the Martian Manhunter.

Do you even need to ask? Yes, Apple's new $13-a-month or $130-a-year Creator Studio bundle is a great deal. It packs in Apple's image editing, video editing, music editing software into one package and throws in a few “freemium” takes on classic apps to boot. The other major creative app subscription—Adobe Creative Cloud—will cost you $70 a month. If you're a student, paying just $3 per month or $30 a year for Creator Studio is well worth the cost, the equivalent of three Starbucks coffees and a snack.

And if you came here to hear me complain about the new icons for apps like Pixelmator Pro, Final Cut Pro, and Logic Pro, then here's your free catharsis. They're ugly and confusing. Pixelmator Pro's icon is an especially strange case. It's trying to insinuate it's a layers-based app, but nothing about its selection of lines and squares reveals that it's built for both art and photo editing. Apple has maintained that the whole point of the new icon selection is consistency. But you don't have to be too mad. Each app is still available for a one-time purchase. Hell, if you have a legacy purchase of any of these apps, you'll still have access to the same icons in their own separate app, even if you subscribe to a new Creator Studio account.

Apple Creator Studio

Creator Studio is a fantastic deal, and would be better with even more Adobe-specific features.

Pros

Cons

Creator Studio still won't be the perfect equivalent to Adobe's Creative Cloud subscription. It lacks some InDesign-like features for layout or some of Adobe's Firefly AI-centric features that touch up images or generate them whole cloth. There are other apps, like Affinity Suite, that may fill the void and help you avoid paying the exorbitant Adobe tax on its subscription-only software products. And if you want these apps permanently on-device, you can spend $300 for Final Cut Pro, $200 for Logic Pro, or $50 for Pixelmator Pro. There's no option to subscribe to only one of these apps. It's all or nothing.

Apple granted me early access to the Creator Studio suite before its full launch on Jan. 28. It finally allowed me to leave Adobe behind for the sake of editing my photos. Despite the odd and pointless freemium features in Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, there's a lot to like here. If Apple keeps expanding features for its creative apps, Adobe will have a tough time arguing you need to spend $240 per year or more for access to Photoshop.

Not much has changed in these apps, even though they may look completely different. Pixelmator Pro now sports a Liquid Glass look. Before you start imagining that all the app's text has become as illegible as on your iPhone used to be before Apple let you change the UI's opacity, the actual app itself is relatively clean. With the default dark gray background, the toolbar is still perfectly legible with a similar layout to before the update. You can change the background color to something lighter, though that may impact how well you can see your work.

Apple imagines today's “creators” are increasingly multidisciplinary. That, in effect, is admitting that specialized jobs by industry experts are being replaced with a do-it-yourself attitude. Hell, if it's made for TikTok, who cares if it's the best quality? I can bemoan the state of the creative industry all I want, but it doesn't actually change what I do. I'm a sub-amateur photographer who's recently grown obsessed with a Ricoh GRIIIX point-and-shoot camera, so Pixelmator Pro's photo touch-up capabilities are a godsend. I previously paid $20 a month for Photoshop to access much of the same feature set for handling my RAW photos and settings to achieve the right look. Of course, I don't have access to some Lightroom features that would help me apply settings to hundreds of RAW photos at once. If Apple ever adds such specific features for mass exporting files, I'd be in a much better position.

The big new edition for Pixelmator Pro is an iPad version. So if you have a Mac and an iPad, you can swap between your projects seamlessly with an iCloud account. I've perused the app on Apple's tablets, and the UI closely resembles the Mac version down to the default orientation of the toolbar and layers window. The big difference is that you could use an Apple Pencil for drawing out images, stenciling, or outlining. Apple scaled the UI on the iPad for a smaller screen, though there is still enough functionality on an 13-inch iPad Pro M5 that I didn't have any issues. I still prefer using my MacBook Pro for photo editing thanks to the quick access to an SD card reader.

Pixelmator Pro works great in either setting. And that makes sense, because Pixelmator—before Apple bought it—used to exist on iPad. That legacy app is now called Pixelmator Classic. Its only lingering use is for light editing. Hence why this new app is so important for iPad's app lexicon. What's more, Apple added a selection of templates if you want to make a poster or your next resume. There are quite a few example templates available, though there likely aren't enough for most expert creatives to find exactly what they're looking for.

Apple also added Photoshop-like transform and warp tools, useful for bending images around objects for when you're mocking up a new t-shirt or mug design. Inevitably, Pixelmator Pro tries to do too many things, and it loses some focus on finer features. Lacking those Lightroom features for large-scale editing will be a dealbreaker for many users. The funny thing is, Apple could have included its Photomator app within the bundle—maybe with some UI improvements—which would have sweetened the deal. That app is still separate and costs $34 per year for a subscription or $120 as a one-time purchase. Some users will appreciate Pixelmator Pro's capabilities and lack of bloat, while others may find they miss that one Illustrator feature. It's certainly Adobe's biggest Photoshop competitor. For my uses, I'll have no reason to return to Adobe's expensive ecosystem.

One of the hallmark features for the Creator Studio subscription is how it “upgrades” several Apple-made documents apps, namely Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. All non-paying users still have access to these apps, but for $13 a month, you get “premium” AI features stuffed into each. Don't worry; if you're not paying, you're not missing much unless you have a need for royalty-free graphics.

Each app gets access to a library of custom themes and templates. These can prove helpful if you're planning to craft a slideshow that isn't built on the same old Canva theme you've seen a million times. If I wanted to craft some content in Keynote, the other big addition is the ability to use AI to generate content or images inside the app. Despite striking a deal with Google to use its Gemini AI model in Apple products, these AI features are currently still using OpenAI's models.

So when I asked my Mac to craft a slideshow of “Why Cans Beat Bottles for Your Drinking Water,” it rounded out a half-dozen slides, trying its best to articulate why the iron taste of canned water in your mouth is better than a reusable water bottle. It even crafted a quote from “Anonymous,” reading: “Drinking water from a can transforms hydration into a refreshing ritual.” There was a lot of content missing, enough that you'll end up modifying whatever the AI sticks in there anyway. It can give you a head start on a project, but I'd hesitate to leave any AI text in a slideshow, even if you're only showing it off to your bored colleagues.

Previously, Apple's single AI image generator, Image Playground, could only generate cartoonish pictures based on preset themes and your own photos. Now, without any fanfare, Apple's letting users generate “photorealistic” images through the Keynote and Pages apps. Compared to Google's latest image models like Nano Banana Pro, the images created by these OpenAI models bear tell-tale signs of image generation, including missing fingers and plastic-looking skin.

So most people are better off opting for the new Content Hub. It includes a collection of various royalty-free images, graphics, and backgrounds for you to stick inside your pages to make your next work presentation minutely less dull. This will not be enough to avoid paying for a Getty or Shutterstock subscription. Despite having a wide assortment of images, you'll inevitably be unable to find the exact image you're looking for. I had a hard time finding stock photos when searching for specific subjects. You'll find a lot more clip art than stock photos.

You'll find some worthwhile features amid the AI junk. These apps now have access to Pixelmator Pro's super resolution feature for 3x image upscaling. The Numbers app includes a “Magic Fill” feature that—despite the dumb name—can notify you if there's missing information in some of your cells. If you wanted to avoid Pixelmator Pro entirely, you could construct a quick poster just using Pages and one of the available templates. Some of these features sound like the kinds of additions that would come as part of a routine macOS update, rather than as part of a paid subscription.

Final Cut Pro also has a few extra features for this big subscription push. The biggest enhancements are transcript search and visual search. These use on-device AI to find specific footage or quotes inside your clips, which should make it easier to find the right section to drop into your timeline. The feature worked fast and seamlessly when I tried it on an M5 MacBook Pro.

The transcriptions were also on point based on the videos I plugged into it. The only thing missing is a page that would grant users access to full audio transcriptions. That would be useful for me personally in my work as a tech journalist. For now, I'll have to stick with Whisper for on-device transcription without paying a princely sum to services like Otter or Plaud.

Both Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro now make use of a nifty beat detection feature. It gauges where each beat is in a piece of music and generates a beat grid along the timeline. This lets you auto-snap clips to the beat, making it far easier to create a professional-looking music video without minutely trimming clips for the edit.

But I'll admit, there's going to be a reason for me to use Logic Pro. One of my two New Year's resolutions for 2026 is to learn Korean. The other is to build a Nerdy Gurdy (a build-it-yourself hurdy-gurdy), learn how to play, and then use it to record some custom samples with the help of a Teenage Engineering EP-1320 Medieval. It's the kind of ambition that's either doomed for failure or at least a heap of consternation. Maybe I'll have a reason to jump into Apple's music editing software sometime in the future.

Which is the point of Apple's creative apps bundle in the first place. If you use two out of three of these apps, $13 is still far less than you would spend from Adobe. That doesn't mean there aren't free alternatives available that may also tide you over. But there are amenities to sticking with Apple, namely access to your iCloud to maintain your documents across devices. More than anything, Adobe has the hard task trying to invite me back to a subscription-only model that costs more than six times as much as Apple's bundle.

The Ryzen 7 9850X3D claims a new title as the world's fastest gaming processor, but it lives in the shadow of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, with a higher price, higher power consumption, and only marginal performance gains.

Technically, the fastest gaming CPU on the market

Runs relatively cool

5% to 7% uplift in lightly-threaded tasks

Around 30% higher power consumption in games compared to Ryzen 7 9800X3D

For close to four years, AMD has enjoyed an annual cadence of reviews claiming its mainstream, eight-core 3D V-Cache processors are the “world's fastest gaming processor.” And that's true. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU you can buy, and it's not particularly close when looking at the competition from Intel and AMD's own non-X3D parts. The new Ryzen 7 9850X3D once again claims the crown as the world's fastest gaming processor, but unlike in years past, where AMD owned that title with overwhelming force, today, it wins by a technicality.

Launching at $499, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D deals in such thin margins that it's easy to lose it in the shuffle. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D launched at $479, and you can find it for around $465 now. The 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D is slightly more, with a street price around $560 now, while the 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D maintains its halo product status with a going price of around $670.

The Ryzen 7 9850X3D is spiritually similar to Intel's usual KS releases; a binned chip with higher clock speeds that isn't meant for mass-market appeal. The difference compared to Intel's KS releases — and the issue with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D more broadly — is that it doesn't target the same market. It's not a halo product; AMD already has that with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D. And it isn't a wholly unique entry, offering only marginal gains over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D for a marginally more expensive price and significantly higher power consumption.

Even if prices remain as they are now (and I don't suspect that'll happen), it's hard to conjure a situation where the Ryzen 7 9850X3D is a better choice than the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. There are some stand-out games where an extra 400MHz on the boost clock speed offers high single-digit performance gains, but in many games and apps, the gains are in the low single-digits, if there's any performance gain at all. If anything, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D looks like a way to keep the price of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D from slipping further, lest it finally drop below the $450 mark.

Our extensive benchmarking will paint a clear picture of what the Ryzen 7 9850X3D offers, or more importantly, what it doesn't. We have test results for productivity, gaming, and power in the pages ahead, so without further ado.

The Ryzen 7 9850X3D is easy to parse because it's identical to the base Ryzen 7 9800X3D in all but name and clock speed. Like the original model, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D features a single compute die (CCD) with eight Zen 5 cores, with a 96MB chunk of L3 SRAM placed under the CCD. Placing the SRAM under the compute die gives the CCD direct access to the IHS, improving thermal performance and allowing AMD to offer full multiplier-based overclocking, something that wasn't possible on older 3D V-Cache chips that have the SRAM on top of the compute die. All Zen 5 X3D chips place the SRAM chunk under the CCD.

AMD's eight-core 3D V-Cache CPUs have been winners dating back to Zen 3, even in the face of the Ryzen 9 7950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D that sport higher core counts. AMD struggled with CCD-to-CCD latency on these chips previously, though AMD driver updates and the shift toward placing the SRAM under the compute die have wrangled those downsides.

The Ryzen 7 9850X3D carries the same 120W TDP as the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, as well as the same 104MB of cache, split across 8MB of L2 and 96MB of L3. Clock speed is the differentiator, with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D sporting a 400MHz lead over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, clocking at 5.6GHz out of the box without any help from PBO or manual overclocking (both of which are still supported).

Intel still has yet to answer 3D V-Cache, though that could change later this year as Intel is expected to introduce bLLC to its Nova Lake desktop processors. For now, AMD's X3D chips remain the best for gaming performance, and it's not particularly close. Double-digit improvements over both Intel and AMD's own non-X3D chips are expected across games, and are only exaggerated in titles that particularly enjoy more cache to play with.

Competition isn't much of a concern for the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, at least for everything except the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. This is the first time AMD has re-released an X3D chip with a better bin, and it begs a simple question: Why?

With PBO, a 200MHz boost is already possible on the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and although you can push the Ryzen 7 9850X3D up by that same 200MHz, the gap between the two chips remains small. AMD tells me that the Ryzen 7 9850X3D is for gamers who want the best of the best, particularly in those frequency-sensitive titles. That may be true, but my read on the situation with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D is slightly different after testing the chip myself.

It seems mainly targeted at OEMs, or perhaps, system builders that haven't already picked up the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. It's not dissimilar to the Ryzen 7 5700X3D, though in this situation, moving to a higher bin instead of a lower one. It's important to keep this context in mind. Using the Ryzen 7 9800X3D as the basis for comparison sets you up for disappointment; this chip was never meant to be an upgrade to AMD's existing Zen 5 X3D lineup.

With that context in mind, let's get into the meat of the review with gaming benchmarks, productivity results, and our power and efficiency testing.

Later this year, Snap is expected to launch the latest consumer version of its AR glasses, Specs. In anticipation of that big event, the company has launched a new subsidiary, Specs Inc., focused solely on further developing the glasses.

Snap announced the new company on Tuesday, explaining that the move would allow for “greater operational focus and alignment” as it continues to iterate on its product. It shows that, like other tech giants (see: Meta and Apple), Snap is getting serious about its smart glasses — although it's worth noting that the company has been developing its AR hardware for quite a long time.

In fact, Snap originally began working on the technology behind Specs over a decade ago, although the last time the company offered a consumer version of the glasses was in 2019. Since 2024, the latest version of the hardware (technically its fifth generation) has been a developer-only product, which has allowed Snap to work on populating the wearable with the kinds of programs that will hopefully make it a hit when it comes time to launch.

As Snap has continued to refine its product, other companies have charged to the front of the AR glasses race, most notably Meta — which has cut deals with major eyewear companies (Ray Ban and Oakley via its partnership with those brands' owner, EssilorLuxottica) while enjoying growing demand in the U.S. Snap obviously hopes to make a meaningful entrance into that market once its glasses are released later this year.

At CES earlier this month, I met up with Russell Patton, product manager for Specs, who gave me the opportunity to demo Snap's new headgear. Patton, who guided me through a tour of the device's user experience and latest features, said that “the spatial nature” of Specs meant that there were a lot of user experiences that could be enjoyed that aren't possible with a phone. That spatial experience is largely powered by the glasses' four cameras, which allow for hand tracking and enable the company's Snap Spatial Engine, which is the software component that projects the device's AR imagery.

Specs run on a distinct operating system, Snap OS, which released its latest version last September. The newest version notably includes an improved browser (which I was able to test-drive by visiting the TechCrunch website), as well as an AI-powered function (dubbed “spatial tips”) that can provide auto-generated information about whatever you happen to be looking at (while staring at a table full of snacks, the glasses gave me tips for which were the healthiest). Also included is a “travel mode,” which Snap says can help travelers translate foreign street signs and menus.

Then there are the games. During my demo, I managed to flail my way through a round of Avatar: The Last Airbender, which was quite a lot of fun. The headsets also have the ability to synchronize with one another, meaning that two different people wearing different sets of glasses can see the same thing in the same physical space. As you might imagine, that opens the door for collaborative gaming.

The form factor of the glasses I used was a bit cumbersome (at nearly 8 ounces, they're a bit heavy), and it had a propensity to heat up after usage, although the team told me that the particular pair of glasses I was using had been in use all day. The physical makeup of the hardware is also expected to change before it launches publicly.

The company hasn't provided a firm release date yet, so interested consumers will have to keep their eyes peeled for that announcement. 

Correction: The third generation of Spectacles for consumers launched in 2019, not 2018 as previously stated. This article was updated after publication to reflect the correct year.

Google is the latest investor to back Redwood Materials as the battery recycling and cathode production startup scales a new energy storage venture to power AI data centers and other industrial sites. 

Redwood Materials, founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, last October raised $350 million in a Series E round led by venture firm Eclipse. The round included a new strategic investment by Nvidia's venture capital arm, NVentures.

More investors, including newcomer Google, have piled in since, pushing the Series E to $425 million, the company said. Existing investors Capricorn and Goldman Sachs have also returned with fresh investments.

The company's valuation was not publicly disclosed, but a source familiar with the round told TechCrunch its post-money valuation was north of $6 billion, more than a billion higher than its previous valuation. This latest investment pushes Redwood's total capital raised to $4.9 billion.

The attraction for Google, Nvidia, and others in this latest round appears to be energy storage — and its ability to power data centers — a newer business venture within Redwood.  

Redwood Materials was founded in 2017 to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries and laptop computers. Redwood processes that scrap and extracts materials that are traditionally mined, like nickel and lithium. The newly processed materials are then sold to customers such as Panasonic, which use them to make batteries.

Redwood has continued to expand its business beyond recycling. The Carson City, Nevada-based company added cathode production several years ago, and last summer, launched an energy-storage business that repurposes EV batteries that aren't quite ready to be recycled and turns them into micro-grids that can supply power to AI data centers and large-scale industrial sites.

That new business, called Redwood Energy, got its start as the demand for data centers skyrocketed.

“As electricity demand surges — driven by AI, data centers, manufacturing and electrification — energy storage is no longer optional; it is essential infrastructure,” the company said in a blog post announcing the new funding.

And Redwood seems to have the means to power at least some of those data centers. The company said in June it recovers more than 70% of all used or discarded battery packs in North America, many of which can have a second life as energy storage.

Redwood said last year it had more than 1 gigawatt-hour worth in its inventory and expected to receive another 4 gigawatt-hours over the coming months. The company expects to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours of grid-scale storage by 2028.

Emily Choi-Greene says she's the type of person who supports tax increases on her ballot. But a new proposal in the Washington State Legislature is a step too far, in her view.

“This one attacks the very few people willing to take a risk on themselves to found a startup,” said Choi-Greene, co-founder and CEO of Seattle-based cybersecurity startup Clearly AI.

Choi-Greene was one of several startup leaders who voiced opposition during public testimony on Tuesday against SB 6229 and HB 2292, which would broaden the state's capital gains tax and directly impact founders, early employees, and investors. 

As we reported earlier this week, the proposed bills would apply the capital gains tax to profits from the sale of qualified small business stock, or QSBS, even when gains are fully exempt under federal law. 

It would mean startup founders or early employees who take stock instead of a bigger salary, and investors who back early-stage companies, would owe new taxes potentially totaling tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars when a company is acquired or goes public.

Startup leaders in the Seattle region say the bills could spur founders and investors to build companies somewhere else. 

“Founders are mobile. This sends a clear signal that Washington is not the place to build and hire,” said Amy Harris, director of government affairs for the Washington Technology Industry Association, said during her testimony.

Choi-Greene, who testified remotely from her company's office in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, said she and her husband took a “huge risk and a huge pay cut” when they left Amazon to launch Clearly AI in 2024. She said “we can barely afford to run this startup.” 

“We dip into our savings to build this company with the hope that we'll still be able to afford our children's college tuition with QSBS,” she said. She added that they structured early employee equity so it could qualify for QSBS.

Nicole Doyle, a Seattle-based entrepreneur who leads the city's Founder Institute accelerator, said that opposing the bill isn't about asking to be exempt from supporting Washington. 

“In fact, many of us believe in paying our fair share,” Doyle said. “We're asking not to single out the kind of long-term, high-risk equity that the federal law is deliberately trying to encourage.”

During his testimony in Olympia on Tuesday, Aviel Ginzburg, a Seattle-based venture capitalist at Founders' Co-op and leader of the startup community Foundations, described the proposed law as a “job destruction bill” and an “extinction-level event” for both founders and investors in the Seattle region. He said the bill would move Seattle into a “third-tier innovation system.”

Mia Shigamura, senior analyst at the Washington State Budget and Policy Center, argued that the bill would help balance the state's tax code. Washington is one of a few states without a personal income tax, relying instead on sales, property, and business taxes such as the B&O tax.

“Research shows that the QSBS exemption benefits multimillionaires and billionaire venture capitalists more than the truly small businesses that it was intended to benefit,” Shigamura said in her testimony.

Rep. April Berg, chair of the House Finance Committee who is co-sponsoring HB 2292, said the bill is “about tax fairness and consistency.” 

“House Bill 2292 simply closes a loophole and treats these gains the same way that we treat other long-term capital gains,” she said. 

Asked by Rep. Cyndy Jacobsen about the threat of entrepreneurs leaving to a more tax-friendly state, Rep. Berg said she doesn't think people move based on taxes. 

“Folks are making decisions all the time about whether to stay or leave, and I don't necessarily think our tax code is a basis of those decisions,” Berg said.

QSBS is a long-standing federal incentive designed to reward the risk of starting and funding young companies. Founders, early employees, and investors can exclude up to 100% of eligible gains from federal capital gains taxes if they meet strict requirements, including holding the stock for at least five years and the company meeting federal asset limits at the time the stock was issued.

Washington's existing capital gains tax law, approved in 2021, does not explicitly reject QSBS treatment. Most states conform to federal QSBS treatment, with the exception of California, Pennsylvania, Alabama, and Mississippi.

But can Intel deliver?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Geopolitical concerns, political pressure from the U.S. government, potential tariffs imposed on semiconductors produced outside of the U.S., and capacity constraints are pushing Apple and Nvidia to consider outsourcing production and packaging of some of their processors to Intel in the U.S., reports DigiTimes. The two companies are reportedly considering outsourcing some of their non-core products to Intel in 2028. Neither of the companies have confirmed the plans.

Apple and Nvidia are reportedly considering using Intel's 18A (or rather 18A-P) or Intel 14A process technology, though it remains to be seen whether Intel has enough advanced capacity for third-party customers in 2028. In addition to the sheer scale of production that Intel must offer to land orders with Apple and Nvidia, it will also have to offer an easy way to port chip designs from TSMC process nodes to its own fabrication technologies, as well as deliver the desired performance and power consumption targets. Yet, keeping in mind that both companies are reportedly looking at Intel primarily due to political pressure, geopolitical concerns, and tariff risks, they might relax some of their demands if key goals are met.

Apple is reportedly holding discussions with Intel about producing some of its entry-level M-series processors for Mac computers, currently made by TSMC, using Intel instead. While the alleged plan marks a cautious re-engagement with Intel after Apple's transition away from Intel x86 CPUs to its in-house designed custom silicon starting in 2020 and completed in 2022, the renewed talks are driven less by technology considerations and more by geopolitical reasons, cost and tariff concerns, and risk diversification.

Apple's vanilla M-series processors power cost-sensitive laptops and tablets. These CPUs feature relatively small die sizes, relatively cheap packaging, as well as relatively high tolerance for yield and performance variability while being sensitive to costs. Therefore, producing these system-on-chips (SoCs) that are aimed solely at the U.S. market makes sense in the U.S.. Although actual systems are assembled in Asia for now, U.S. policy seems to be semiconductor-centric, not device-centric. Meanwhile, to meet U.S. policy requirements, Apple will have to conduct both silicon production and packaging operations in the U.S.

While Apple's vanilla M-series CPUs are important products for the company, they are not as crucially important as A-series SoCs for iPhones and are not as performance-demanding as M Pro and M Max offerings. Yet, to produce M-series chips at Intel, it is vital that Apple can port its latest micro-architectures to Intel's nodes without major performance degradation to remain competitive on the American market, as this is the key market for the company's popular products like the MacBook Air or iPad Pro.

Nvidia is reportedly pursuing a similar tactic, but in the case of the AI GPU developer, things are much more complicated. The company reportedly plans to make some of I/O dies for its Feynman GPUs at Intel in the U.S. Furthermore, Nvidia intends to package some (25%) of its Feynman GPUs using EMIB technology at Intel's New Mexico facilities in America, according to DigiTimes. There might be a problem with such an approach, though.

Nvidia's Feynman will likely consume 5 kW – 6 kW of power, points at which traditional board-level voltage regulation will no longer scale, so these processors will require voltage regulator integration (IVR) into advanced packaging (i.e., CoWoS-L interposer). At these currents (we are talking thousands of Amperes here), delivering sub-1V directly from the motherboard leads to severe IR drop, PDN losses, and slow transient response that cannot support aggressive DVFS across large multi-die designs. As a result, building an IVR into packaging enables power to enter the package at a higher voltage (around 1.8 V), which cuts current per bump, improves efficiency, and cuts voltage ripple, while also enabling 10X – 100X faster response than on-board VRMs. To that end, packaging with integrated IVR becomes the primary enabler of performance scaling.

While EMIB can support co-packaged IVR components, as this will not be a true embedded IVR, it will not be enough for a 5 kW – 6 kW AI accelerator. Of course, Intel has Foveros technologies (including Foveros Omni, Foveros Direct 3D, etc.), but these are not direct alternatives to CoWoS-L. While Intel's Foveros technology can certainly support multi-kilowatt power delivery with low IR drop, it does so by vertically stacking dedicated power tiles with logic, which provides extremely fast regulation and fine-grained control. However, this approach prioritizes low inductance and transient response over embedded passive volume, and therefore represents a fundamentally different IVR philosophy rather than a direct analogue to CoWoS-L. To that end, if Nvidia would like to use Foveros Direct3D packaging for Feynman, it would have to redesign the GPU compared to one produced by TSMC for CoWoS-L.

Given complexities with using EMIB and Foveros for high-end data center Feynman GPUs, it is more likely that Nvidia will wait before TSMC brings its advanced packaging to America towards the end of the decade, as it is hardly viable to redesign these large GPUs for Foveros. Still, Intel could probably land packaging orders for Vera CPUs or introduce its custom Xeon CPUs for Nvidia sooner rather than later to land some business from the company it got $5 billion of investment from recently.

Is this the future of desktop Android computing?

Google has reportedly been working on folding ChromeOS into Android since 2015, but its efforts appear to have stalled in recent years. However, we've just seen some evidence of the company's work on this project through a bug report on the Chromium Issue Tracker. The company has since made the report private, but not before 9to5Google shared the screen captures. The device involved was reportedly an HP Elite Dragonfly 13.5-inch Chromebook running build ALOS: ZL1A.260119.001.A1. “ALOS” supposedly refers to Aluminum OS, which is the codename for the Android desktop that's being developed to replace ChromeOS.

The most obvious difference between ChromeOS and Aluminum OS is that the taskbar is slightly taller, making it more suitable for devices with larger screens. Google also moved the date and time from the lower right to the upper left corner of the screen, while the status settings seem to have been moved to the upper right corner, making it look a bit more similar to macOS. Google Chrome browser also remains mostly similar to what you get on Android but now comes with Extensions, and we also see an example of side-by-side multitasking on the large screen. But aside from that, we don't see any other major differences or features, especially given that it's just screen recording for a bug report.

 




Another tidbit of information we can garner from this is that the Android desktop version is seemingly running on old hardware — the HP Elite Dragonfly 13.5-inch Chromebook mentioned in the report launched in early 2022, featuring a 12th-generation Intel processor. Although it could be that Google is just using existing hardware to validate the operating system, it could also mean that it's planning to allow (or even force) existing ChromeOS users to update to Aluminum OS once it officially comes out.

There's no official announcement yet on the exact date that Aluminum OS will arrive, although Google said that it expects to deliver the new operating system by 2026. This leak shows that it's probably coming sooner, rather than later, especially as it already seems to be working and is probably already in an early, closed Beta stage. Nevertheless, many are curious as to what it can accomplish, especially as Windows 11 is known for its buggy updates, especially with the recent spate of issues, while macOS is often an expensive option that's out of reach for many buyers.

The traditional divide between identity and data security is closing rapidly, and that's bad news for security teams, according to a report released Tuesday by a provider of identity and data security solutions.

“[T]he next phase of cybersecurity disruption will come from adversaries scaling identity attacks to compromise data security as agentic AI becomes more prominent,” Netwrix, of Frisco, Texas, predicted in its forecast of trends that will be shaping cybersecurity in 2026 and beyond.

By 2026, identity security will see significant expansion in workflow orchestration and automation across provisioning, token validation, and privilege management, according to the report, based on research into real-world identity attacks and data-exposure paths observed by Netwrix researchers.

These workflows now determine who and what can access sensitive data, meaning failures in identity automation translate directly into data exposure risk, the report explained.

Adversaries are shifting their focus from individual credentials to identity orchestration, federation trust, and misconfigured automation, it continued. Since access to critical data stores starts with identity, unified visibility across identity and data security is required to detect misconfigurations, reduce blind spots, and respond faster.

That shift, experts warned, dramatically increases the potential impact of identity failures.

“Identity orchestration, federation trust, or faulty automation allow attackers to circumvent controls, have a bigger blast radius and more options for attacks,” said Netwrix Vice President for Security Research Dirk Schrader.

“Attackers go after identity orchestration because it's the leverage point that decides who gets access, when, and under what conditions,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Stealing one set of credentials yields limited reach and is often neutralized by MFA [multifactor authentication] or password resets.”

“Compromising the orchestration layer lets an attacker mint or hijack trusted sessions and tokens at scale, bypass controls by changing policy, and persist by creating new privileged identities or OAuth apps,” he continued.

“The impact becomes one-to-many across cloud and SaaS, and the activity can look legitimately ‘compliant' in logs,” he added.

Michael Bell, CEO of Suzu Testing, a provider of AI-powered cybersecurity services, in Las Vegas, explained that identity orchestration controls who gets credentials, how they're issued, and what they can do with them. “Attackers have figured out that compromising the system that grants access beats stealing individual keys,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Federation trust is particularly attractive because you compromise one identity provider and inherit trust across every system that federates with it,” he said. “Misconfigured automation is low-hanging fruit because most organizations rushed to deploy it without securing the service accounts and API tokens that make it run.”

The Netwrix researchers also found that the dependency between identity security and data security becomes more pronounced as AI-driven automation operates continuously and at scale.

AI automation is often a chain of agents, Schrader explained. “Each agent is a non-human identity that needs lifecycle governance, and each step accesses, transforms, or hands off data,” he said. “That means a mistake in identity governance — over-permissioned agent, weak token control, missing attestation — immediately becomes a data security incident — at machine speed and at scale — because the workflow keeps executing and propagating access and data downstream.”

“As AI automation runs continuously, authorization becomes a live control system, not a quarterly review,” he continued. “Agent chains amplify failures. One over-permissioned non-human identity can propagate access and data downstream like workflow-shaped lateral movement. Non-human identities sprawl fast via APIs and OAuth. Data risk also shifts dynamically as agents transform and enrich outputs.”

At scale, a small policy mistake becomes a massive data movement event, added Ensar Seker, CISO of SOCRadar, a threat intelligence company in Newark, Del. “The risk isn't only malicious AI, it's amplified mistakes — over-permissioned agents, weak scoping, stale privileges, over-broad connectors and missing guardrails on where data can flow,” he told TechNewsWorld.

AI consumes and acts on data continuously, and automated pipelines and models need broad, often real-time access to data, access that's granted and scoped via identity, explained Nathan Vega, head of product marketing at Starburst, a data and analytics platform company in Boston.

“Risk multiplies with automation,” he told TechNewsWorld. “A compromised service identity can cause automated data exfiltration, model poisoning, or large-scale misconfiguration in seconds, which is far faster than manual attacks.”

The researchers also reported that cyber insurers are shifting how they assess risk and set pricing. “Cyber insurers are shifting assessment and pricing because the old ‘once-a-year questionnaire' model didn't predict real losses,” Netwrix's Schrader said.

“Ransomware, systemic zero-days, cloud concentration, and third-party cascades create correlated, fast-changing risk — so self-attestation ages badly and pricing gets exposed,” he continued. “That's why many insurers are moving toward evidence-based underwriting with configuration and control signals, vulnerability and patch cadence, backup recoverability, and incident response maturity.”

One area that will come under increased scrutiny from insurers is network-edge vulnerability. “In 2025, cyberattacks targeting VPNs and firewalls skyrocketed in speed, volume, and size of ransoms demanded,” explained Paul Asadoorian, principal threat researcher at Eclypsium, a supply chain security provider in Portland, Ore.

“The trend of network device vulnerabilities being exploited will drive cyber insurers to require more rigorous protections of these devices,” he told TechNewsWorld. “This could include compensating controls such as monitoring the VPN gateways directly, as well as audits of their configuration to assure they are secure against attacks.”

“The report is absolutely right that the cyber insurance industry is changing how they think about incidents,” added Arvind Parthasarathi, founder and CEO of Cygnvs, a multinational cyber incident response solutions company.

“In the past, the idea was that a customer or a policyholder would never have a claim,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Now the world is shifting to where there's literally no amount of money that an organization can spend to guarantee that they will never have a major event or a breach.”

Rich Seiersen, chief risk technology officer at Qualys, a provider of cloud-based IT, security, and compliance solutions in Foster City, Calif., pointed out that in the year ahead, most analysts anticipate moderate hardening of the insurance market with gradual premium increases, more selective underwriting, and closer attention to security controls.

“However, it's doubtful that we'll return to the severity of previous hard markets, when applicants faced comprehensive questionnaires and long-lasting underwriting delays,” he told TechNewsWorld.

He conceded, though, that a major wildcard is the possibility of a systemic cyber event—a cloud outage, a widespread supply-chain compromise, or a high-impact ransomware wave that hits many insureds at the same time. “An event like that could push the market into a sharper hardening cycle,” he said.

“Still,” he added, “it's imperative to recognize that insurance pricing is shaped just as much by macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, capital flows, and reinsurance pricing, as it is by cyber-specific incidents. Losses matter, but wider financial conditions often dominate the cycle.”

Starburst's Vega noted the Netwrix report highlights an important shift: the security problem is increasingly about where control is enforced (identity, policy, governance) rather than purely about detection or telemetry volume. “Organizations should treat identity-orchestration, federated governance, and automation-hardening as first-order security problems, not afterthoughts,” he said.

“Investing in policy-aware, federated data access, strong identity lifecycle and runtime controls, and robust vendor-continuity planning will be the practical differentiators over the next three to four years,” he added.

The strongest takeaway from the report is that identity and data security can't be treated as separate programs anymore, maintained SOCRadar's Seker. The control plane (identity) and the asset (data) are now coupled by automation, human and machine.

“If you don't have unified visibility into which identities can touch which sensitive data, through which workflows, you'll keep losing to misconfigurations, over-permissioning, and fast-moving identity abuse,” he said.

“The report correctly identifies that identity and data security are converging into a single problem space,” added Suzu Testing's Bell. “The organizations struggling most are the ones still treating them as separate disciplines with separate teams and separate budgets.”

“The real AI risk isn't autonomous attacks,” he said. “It's the attack surface you're building by deploying AI without governing the identities and data access those systems require to function.”

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

It's been two days, and we're still chuckling about the opening scene of “Hard Salt Beef,” the second episode of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. Sure, the projectile poop in the season premiere will live on in infamy, but the sight of Ser Arlan of Pennytree casually airing out his enormous manhood is lodged forever in the memory of series protagonist Dunk—and is now similarly entrenched in the mind of every viewer, too.

Showrunner Ira Parker has already weighed in on the moment, explaining that Ser Arlan, who's portrayed by Danny Webb, had such a gritty life as a hedge knight that he wanted to give the man “his one special thing.” (Parker added a Boogie Nights reference on the very slight chance readers didn't get what he meant.)

Speaking of Dirk Diggler, that famously oversized character will likely come to mind when you behold this Instagram post from Waldo Mason, the show's prosthetic designer.

 View this post on Instagram



“Very proud to have forged Ser Arlan [of] Pennytree's formidable weapon for the opening moments of this episode!” Mason writes, giving credit to the whole team who helped create the 10-inch prosthetic penis. He also shouts out Webb for his dedication to making the illusion look as realistic as possible despite the “intimate application process”; the end result, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms audiences can agree, was a gasp-inducingly great success.

Props also for the discreet “tubing for urination,” which made the whole thing look even more believable.

You can scroll through the photos on Mason's post to see the mold itself (NSFW), as well as tastefully pixelated stills of Webb getting into character (ahem) behind the scenes, and the sight of Ser Arlan emerging stark naked in the episode itself. (Really extended pixelation on that last shot.)

So far A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is two-for-two with shocking moments relating to bodily functions. What might episode three have in store? Find out Sunday, when the next episode arrives on HBO and HBO Max.

AZX, a startup building bespoke AI solutions for customers that include utilities and energy companies, has raised a $6 million pre-seed round.

The Bellevue, Wash.-based business launched in October 2024, has grown to 20 employees, and its first quarter revenue spiked 10-fold compared to the same period last year.

“What makes AZX a little different is we're not a product-centric company. We're not a consultant-centric company. We're a client-, problem- and transformation-centric company,” said Aaron Goldfeder, AZX CEO and co-founder. “So everything we do centers around their business.”

AZX is melding AI tools including analytics, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, digital twins, physics models, machine learning models and generative AI to build custom apps and models to fix internal business processes within a company's operations. The products are designed to integrate into a client's existing systems.

The company's customers include Puget Sound Energy, CBRE, Trilliant, Franklin Energy and two undisclosed, investor-owned utilities.

Investors in the round are AI2 Incubator, SFV (Sustainable Future Ventures), Founders' Co-op, Kompas, Powerhouse Ventures, Ascend and Stepchange Ventures as well as individual investors including Brian Janous, former vice president of energy at Microsoft. 

The startups co-founders are:

All three also worked at Microsoft earlier in their careers. 

The startup is a public benefit corporation and Goldfeder said the team is eager to help utilities, energy companies and others addressing climate-related challenges. He noted that losses from natural disasters worldwide hit $320 billion in 2024, while utilities need to invest hundreds of billions of dollars to modernize their electrical grids.  

“All that needs help,” he said. “So we love being part of that solution.”

We are really seeing the fears of data collection from the 2000s and 2010s come to fruition as privatized surveillance now. Cambridge analytica should have been the warning shot but it wasn't enough.

These are CMMS and HHS data. The government literally collected it. On government forms.This thread is Exhibit A for how the tech-privacy community so often trips itself up. We have abuse of government data at hand. It's clear. It's sharp. Nobody denies the government has the data, how they got the data or how they're using it.So instead we go into parallel construction and advertising dragnets and a bunch of stuff that isn't clear cut, isn't relevant, but is someone's bogeybear that has to be scratched.

Also, don't forget that profit maximization means selling to the highest bidder, which might not be US govt. Certainly, there is means, motive, and opportunity for individuals with access to sell this info to geopolitical adversaries, and it is BY FAR the easiest way for adversaries to acquire it.It has happened before and it will happen again.

Palentir has certainly assisted, but the origin of the data collection here was public and then unleashed by the state to private entity.

Does this imply that undocumented aliens subject to deportation have been making claims on Medicare/Medicaid monies?

reply

No. HHS is broader than CMMS.Like, if these data were being used to audit the CMMS roles for illegal immigrants, that would be something. That's not what DHS is doing because I suspect they don't want to have to produce a report that says this was a made-up bit of electioneering.

Yes, it's surely public information and therefore ought to be subject to the same controls as any other personal health information. It seems moot that it was given to a private company; the issue just shifts to being that the private company (apparently) does not comply with data protection laws, e.g. HIPAA.

That's incorrect. A concentration camp is a place where a government or authority detains large numbers of people without normal legal process, usually because they belong to a particular group rather than because of individual crimes.Historical examples:- Nazi Germany (1933–1945)- British camps during the Second Boer War (1899–1902)- Imperial Japan- United States (1942–1945)

Similarly, Nazis did this with census machines so they knew how to scale concentration camps.In 2001, Edwin Black published a book about strategic partnership of IBM with Nazis since 1933 til end of WWII.

E.g. US camps holding Japanese immigrants during WW2.Sure, it might be somewhat hyperbolic (arguable, because ICE/current administration has few qualms dismissing constitutional rights whenever convenient), but the term is definitely not Nazi-exclusive (even the Germans had concentration camps long before Hitler, in Namibia)

And it has nothing to do with Jews.

reply

Jews were removed from public life at first, over-punished for minor infractions and deported or pushed toward self deportation. The thing to notice here is that Germany did not had that many Jews in the first place, they were rather small minority. The tens of thousands thing was possible only after Germans conquered foreign lands and started to kill non German Jews. The WWIII did not started yet, so yep, we are not there, but it is actually OK to comment on similarities before that.

Also, tens of people have already died in those concentration/detention camps.

I remember protesting against data retention laws in the early 2000s. People thought we were nuts for using historical examples about the Nazis abusing all kinds of records to hunt down Jews. History was never going to repeat itself that way.Until it did.

Until it did.

reply

What data-retention issues do you have with HHS having patients' home addresses?

reply

reply

There isn't a data-retention issue with HHS having home records, there is an abuse issue with DHS giving it to Palantir to VLOOKUP addresses out of.

reply

Kinda ironic but I think you've got the current situation a little backwards. Karp (who is Jewish) has boasted about Palantir being used to hunt down the “far right”: https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/28/palantir_boss_fii_spe...I think it's very important to focus on how data collection of this nature is bad, not that “because Nazis did it” it's bad. The latter is exactly what Karp wants, and he can turn around and say he's actually preventing Nazis. Similar to how the Holocaust narrative is used to justify the Palestinian genocide.

In retrospect what has actually happened with mass surveillance has been far worse than what the most unhinged conspiracy nut on shortwave radio or some crazy end times Geocities web site was predicting back then. The predictions of the conspiracy nuts were conservative.The big thing everyone got wrong was that we assumed people would care and put up resistance. We assumed people would choose technologies that protected their privacy and would get mad when highly invasive things were foisted on them. That never happened. Give people convenience and shiny and fun "content" like TikTok and YouTube and they'll consent to live in a total panopticon. They don't care.We're also seeing that people will choose wealth and comfort over rights and freedom. This bargain is being made all over the world to varying degrees, and the trend is toward increasingly authoritarian societies that offer a comfortable lifestyle as long as you don't question it too much. A quote I read a while back described the emerging system like this: "it's Brave New World unless you question it, then it turns into 1984 real fast."This is all a devil's bargain, but like the devil's bargain in fiction it's great at first. The devil really does deliver. It's all fun until you get dragged off to hell at the end.

Each individual data point seems normal or innocuous, but when you tie them all together and then leverage the tech panopticon you have an insane amount of detail on every person. There are no meaningful legal safeguards on how this data is used, especially when it's laundered through private contractors not subject to much oversight.When you couple this with increasingly unlimited powers granted to law enforcement agencies, you get a situation where a system could decide you're a threat and some just comes and beats the shit out of you, takes your property, or shoots you, and you have little recourse.The people cheering for this seem to think it'll never be used against them.

None of that is relevant to the article. It's about HHS data being queried to give ICE probable addresses. What you're doing is indistinguishable from whataboutism.I don't think that's your intent.

They are and should be separable. DHS hoovering up government data is orthogonal to private data collection. They could become related. But they aren't, and muddling a hypothetical problem with a clear, present and actual one is a good way to normalize the latter.

Keep in mind that DOGE made off with a huge stash of data, which combined with other data, such as voter registration data, twitter messages (public and private) and other such datastores could become an extremely efficient tool in messing with elections. The whole system is predicated on that being hard and so we trust the outcome of elections but with todays tools in the hands of the large US companies currently in cahoots with the Trump administration this is childs play.

Governments have to operate in a more open manner (at least those with a reasonable amount of democratic accountability do). So the dysfunction is made public more often, and likely used over decades for political point-scoring.It's similar to open source development.

I wouldn't be so sure about this. A lot of what markets do is unnecessary overhead needed to make markets work. Maintaining enough competition means having to pay the costs of having multiple organizations doing the same thing. Each must have their own strategy, HR, marketing, etc. A lot of work is unnecessarily repeated. A lot of behavior that is forced by competition, like advertising / patent and copyright systems / hiding research instead of sharing it is very wasteful. Profits going to the owners is also an overhead cost that might not be needed in other types of economic arrangements. All these costs need to be paid at every level of the production chain.We should also consider the goals of each type of organization. The goal of a business operating in a market is to maximize profit for the owners of the business. It's efficient at that. The goals of a government can be much more varied. They can't really be easily compared.

The go-to example is recording. Watch any "First Amendment auditor" video on YouTube (prepare yourself, most of them are a struggle to watch). I can walk into any government building, and as long as I'm in a publicly accessible area, I can record almost whatever and whoever I want. This includes otherwise private property that the government is leasing. I essentially cannot be kicked out unless I cause a disturbance as long as the location is open for public business. This is true for DMVs, county administrative buildings, police offices, jails, any government service with a public area and public hours.On the flip side, if Target wants to ban recording in their stores, not only can they do so with zero risk of litigation, but if you get trespassed you can be fined or go to jail for a violation. The penalties get even harsher for the same trespassing crime if it's a private residence and not a business.I'm sure we can come up with counterexamples, and maybe surveillance is the best one, but philosophically it's pretty easy to see why it's worse for the government to do a Bad Thing than for any individual or private enterprise to do the exact same Bad Thing.Edit: I'd love to hear a justification as to why this is being downvoted because nothing in the content warrants that.

Hell, you would probably have bipartisan support for nationwide crackdowns on employers who are employing anyone here illegally. They are undercutting American employees and dodging taxes. Who wouldn't be for that kind of law enforcement?Instead we get unaccountable masked men with guns murdering citizens and terrorizing an entire populace. Imagine if an "ICE raid" meant a team of accountants showed up at a business and gave them a hefty fine for employing anyone here illegally. It seems like that would be much more effective, which makes me genuinely wonder if the demonstration of strength through cruelty that we currently have hasn't been the goal all along.

It's almost worse in the USA because the corruption is only accessible to those in quasi-oligarchical roles.  There's some point at which increased corruption actually becomes more egalitarian (though obviously, not as egalitarian as zero corruption).

reply

In countries where the police and government officials can be bought for pocket change by the middle class, the masses have relatively more power vs the elite who control the central government.

reply

That's a real-world difference that gives the middle class more freedom to start a business that is really only feasible for the wealthy in the US.

You're comparing permitting processes. That's orthogonal to corruption. You can set up a beach bar in most of America without a permit and without getting cited for months on end, too, and plenty of people do it. (The pot-brownie sellers in Dolores Park aren't licensed.)

The classic example of the mental gymnastics do won't punish any of this is civil asset forfeiture. It's legalized theft. The Fourth mandment quite literally starts with:> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated ...You might think if you are stopped by police and you have cash on it, that it is your "effects" and it can't be seized without any crime but you'd be wrong. The legal theory surrounding this is that it is a civil action against property, not a criminal action against its owner, even though the basis for the civil action is a crime that not only doesn't have to be proven, it doesn't even have to be alleged.Medical info is just one prong of a massive effort to acquire all sorts of personal information, seemingly to build a database so citizens can be targeted. If you think it's going to stop at immigration enforcement, you're crazy.

I want it to be done without murder. Murder is bad.I don't care if it's done by ICE or the Pink Pony Friendly Airlift Service. They should do it per the law. They should not have to blow hundreds of thousands of dollars per deportation. And they should do it without murder, with murderers in their ranks being charged per the law.> to be fair, nazis were Germans…yes. That doesn't make being anti-Nazi racist against Germans.

This is nonsense. Given the same tendency is shared by large private organisations, this is throwing one's hands up with extra steps.Regulations and laws work. The fact that a section of the INA seems to compel pretty ridiculous amounts of inter-departmental data sharing is the issue.

I bet that if all conspiracy theorists will be more worried that their neighbors become crazy and would try to do something positive about it (talk to them, befriend them, influence them, etc.) the outcome might be better for everybody.

When Google ships its newly refreshed smart glasses this year—as the rumor mill is predicting, and as the hands-on demos posted just last week have all but confirmed it will—the company's tech will be joining a crowded field. But whether this rebirth of Glass will pop or fizzle comes down to whether Google can best its main competitor: Meta.

Meta is the undisputed champion of the smart glasses battlefield now, with its snazzy and fashionable frames born of brand partnerships with Ray-Ban and Oakley. The company has also reaffirmed its focus on face computing by recently laying off workers to reallocate resources from its Metaverse efforts to focus on its XR and AI-enabled gadgets. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Meta is looking to double its smart glasses production and wants to have the capacity to sell 20 to 30 million units by the end of 2026.

Smart glasses are a big business, and Google almost certainly has the muscle to break in. The company is taking a two-pronged approach by positioning its Android XR ecosystem as a way to get familiar mobile apps running on its glasses platform right away, and by partnering with eyewear manufacturers to make wearables that people will actually be excited to wear. If you remember the original Google Glass—and most people do, it was that bad—then you know how critical it is that Google gets this right.

“Even though Google was first, they're still kind of playing catch-up right now,” says IDC tech analyst Jitesh Urbani.

Google has been enlisting some outside help, working with partners like Samsung and XReal to build glasses that will likely have displays and powerful computing components on board. It has also partnered with glasses manufacturers Warby Parker and Gentle Monster with the goal of making models that are truly fashion-forward. Samsung is likely to release a bigger, beefier set of smart glasses this year, and those, like others coming soon, will also run Android XR and slot cleanly into Google's computing ecosystem.

The not-so-secret weapon in Google's arsenal here is Gemini, the company's AI model that powers its chatbot and an increasingly long list of its other software. Google has always relied on its software strengths, and Gemini, it turns out, is very good—so much so that it has made companies like OpenAI and Meta nervous and forced them to accelerate development on their own models. Apple has even partnered with Google to use Gemini to power features in its new version of Siri. And since Apple has some smart glasses ambitions of its own, it is likely Gemini could be used for AI features within them. That would give Google an unprecedented level of reach.

“They get to monetize Gemini outside of Android and they get the benefit of basically the entire iOS ecosystem optimizing for Gemini as well,” says Anshel Sag, a tech analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. “It's the closest I think we've come to an AI winner.”

Meta, the big fish in the smart glasses pond, has positioned the AI capabilities of its smart glasses as the platform's most useful feature. But Meta AI's conversational prowess doesn't exactly match what Google has accomplished with Gemini. Features like Meta's AI language translation or image recognition don't always work so well in the real world.

“Every time I use Meta AI, I wish it were Gemini,” Sag says. (He's talking to me through a pair of Meta Oakley Vanguards.) “I think we haven't fully realized the capability of AI in smart glasses until we get it in Gemini on a pair of Google glasses.”

Meta also does have some trust issues, stemming from its user privacy practices and its occasional data leaks.

“Meta is not the most trusted technology brand, shall we say, by some distance, when it comes to data privacy and security,” says Ben Hatton, a tech analyst at CCS Insights. “That may be holding the market back. If Meta is the only player, and Google can come in and say, this is all on device, this is all secure, this is all just kept within your device, then more heads may be turned.”

The place where Meta has the most leverage is in the style game. Its partnership with EssilorLuxottica—the parent company of Ray-Ban and Oakley—has helped it make smart glasses that generally look like something people would be happy to wear in public. The notable exception is the design of the chunky new Meta Display glasses, which still earn some style points even though they are bulky, a bit ill-fitting, and definitely “computer glasses.”

Google's new glasses will almost certainly also look heavy and weird. A little over a year ago, Google showed off its Android XR platform on some thick-framed chonks, and the Google glasses that have been appearing in recent news articles and in new demo videos shot this month look about the same. (Google has promised us our own demo very soon.)

Google's partnership with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster could also yield frames with a more appealing aesthetic, but those glasses will likely have fewer features than the more powerful models from Samsung and other Android XR partners.

“I don't think Meta's in trouble at all right now,” Urbani says. “Google is great as a tech company, but there's a lot they have to learn in terms of fashion and selling glasses.”

Google's broader goal with its smart glasses effort is the expansion of Android XR as a platform. Even if Google can't nail the fashion element, its software could attract a third party who can.

“Nobody actually wants to ship a pair of glasses and build an entire operating system and foundational AI model to run on it,” Sag says. “I think people want to build glasses with an operating system that already exists and with an application ecosystem that's already built.”

So when will you get to wear Google's new glasses and start pinging Gemini, taking video calls hands-free, and hailing Ubers from your face?

“I certainly expect them to be out by the middle of the year,” Hatton says. And maybe even before then. “If they're going to bring out sunglasses as a form factor, you probably want them out for spring so people can start thinking about buying them for the summer.”

The 70km (43mi) altitude reduction will reduce the risk of collisions for Starlink satellites.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Software reported that Starlink has reduced its altitude for a big chunk of its software constellation after one of Musk's satellites had a near-miss with a Chinese satellite. According to the South China Morning Post, the close call was the primary reason why the company announced the move to lower the altitude of more than 4,000 Starlink satellites from 550 km (340 mi) to 480 km (around 300 mi). SpaceX VP for Engineering Michael Nicolls also said on X that the company is doing this with a view to “increasing space safety.”

“Starlink is beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation focused on increasing space safety,” Nicolls wrote on the social media platform. “We are lowering all @Starlink satellites orbiting at ~550 km to ~480 km (~4400 satellites) over the course of 2026. The shell lowering is being tightly coordinated with other operators, regulators, and USSPACECOM."

According to Discover Magazine, there are about 15,000 satellites currently in orbit, most of which sit at the 500 to 1,000km low-earth orbit (LEO) altitude. Starlink owns the majority of this number, with Nicolls saying that it has over 9,000 operational satellites. However, it has plans to further expand this to a total of 34,400 satellites, with the U.S. FCC granting a 7,500-satellite expansion that would let it bring its current fleet to more than 19,000 units. Competitors like Amazon's Project Kuiper and China's SpaceSail also plan to launch their own satellite constellations with thousands of units, potentially turning the LEO part of outer space into a crowded space.

The move to reduce the altitude of nearly half of its fleet will reduce the risk of collisions, especially as countries and operators jostle for space. However, the 70km (43mi) altitude reduction also has some drawbacks. “Starlink satellites at an altitude of 560km experience an average daily orbital decan of about 101 meters, compared with about 267 meters at 485 km,” wrote the Chinese researchers. This meant these satellites would have to use more fuel to maintain their altitude, or else they risk re-entering the Earth's atmosphere and burning up prematurely. Nevertheless, the tradeoffs might be worth it, especially as the company and several others plan to fill our orbit with thousands of satellites more.

After nearly two decades, the baby whale came back—as a mother, with a baby of its own. Julie Albert, director of the Right Whale Sighting Network at Blue World Research Institute, a nonprofit, first laid eyes on the North Atlantic right whale known as Callosity Back in 2007 when it was still just a calf, swimming off the coast of Florida.

Immediately, she says, the whale stood out. Like other North Atlantic right whales, it had callosities—patches of thick, white, rough tissue on its skin. But unlike any other known right whale, this one had those markings on its back.

“That's how she got her name,” says Albert. “She's definitely an individual.” Then, on New Year's Eve 2025, Callosity Back returned to Florida. A call came through from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to say that an unidentified whale and her calf had been spotted off the state's central-eastern coast. Albert describes how she and her colleagues raced to the pool deck behind a nearby beachside hotel to get a better view and soon realized it was Callosity Back.

“I've been waiting 19 years to see this mother,” says Albert. The whale observers—joined occasionally by hotel guests—watched the mother and calf pair swimming for hours, until darkness finally fell.

Callosity Back's calf is just one of 21 right whale babies documented at the time of writing during the current calving season, which spans from mid-November to mid-April. It is unusual to see so many of these whales born so early in a single season. Researchers counted only 11 last year, for example.

In 2024, just 384 North Atlantic right whales were left in the wild in total, according to an estimate published last October. The species used to number in the many thousands, before commercial whaling almost wiped out these animals during the 18th and 19th centuries. North Atlantic right whales have never recovered and are now on the brink of extinction.

The baby boom is good news, says Albert. But it doesn't change the overall picture for these animals, which remain in great jeopardy. A series of collisions with vessels, or entanglements with fishing gear, could easily kill enough North Atlantic right whales to flip the species' fortunes the other way again, as happened in 2017, when 18 right whales died during a period of just six months. That year also saw the tragic death of whale rescuer Joe Howlett, who was killed after cutting fishing lines off a North Atlantic right whale in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

The people who monitor and protect right whales, and who know these animals' stories in great detail, will tell you that a flurry of calves, while wonderful in itself, by no means guarantees the species' long-term survival. But right whales are still worth fighting for, conservationists say, because their tiny population could yet swell again—if it gets the chance.

Callosity Back was born a survivor. Her mother is one of only two North Atlantic right whales ever documented to have given birth in chilly northeastern waters, far from the usual calving grounds off the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. (Right whale calves are born without blubber, meaning that exposure to cold water in the first weeks of life could kill them.)

Right now, researchers are continually watching for newborn right whales, and have been surprised by the 21 new arrivals. “In the 1980s and 1990s we only got over 18 maybe a couple of times, just to give that some context,” says Phil Hamilton, senior scientist at the New England Aquarium. “I'm hopeful that number might go up.”

Multiple females that have given birth in the past, but not during the last three years, are currently present in the calving grounds, so it's possible there will be an even higher tally of calves by the time spring arrives. Still, high variation from year to year is to be expected in such a small population of animals, stresses Hamilton, and it would be wise to consider the long-term population trend—which since 2010 or so has largely been downwards.

There is, though, other good news to consider: No North Atlantic right whale deaths were recorded during 2025, says Hamilton, though there were some injuries. In December, for instance, a male right whale called Division was spotted entangled in fishing gear—long lines wrapped around its head and mouth, even cutting into the animal's blowhole. Rescuers were able to cut some of the gear away, but it's possible sea lice will infect the wounds that the lines had already made in Division's skin, says Tonya Wimmer, director of conservation and co-executive director of the Marine Animal Response Society, a charity in Canada. “He's getting thinner, so it's not a good picture for him,” she says.

North Atlantic right whale observers constantly monitor the health of individual whales, follow their journeys along the eastern coast of North America as sightings are reported, and chalk up each new calf that appears. The New England Aquarium North Atlantic Right Whale Catalog contains millions of records, including photographs and written contributions documenting right whale sightings over the course of decades. Calves, in particular, always generate plenty of interest. “A new-born calf is very adorable to those of us who like right whales,” says Hamilton. “You get to see them nursing on the mothers, or lying on the mother's back.”

Hamilton and his colleagues are even working on a system to use photogrammetry—stitching photos together to make a 3D model of something—in order to measure the size and shape of female whales so they can tell when one is pregnant. It's possible to make a similar assessment with the naked eye if the whale is far enough along, and pregnancy tests can also be done by analyzing hormones in the animals' feces.

But getting so close to these whales brings with it an emotional burden. “It wasn't until I started the job that I heard the phrase ‘compassion fatigue' in the right whale community,” says Albert. “It's gut-wrenching sometimes. They don't have a happy story.”

Joel Cohen, a wildlife photographer and volunteer for the Right Whale Sighting Network, knows that hopeful news during the calving season is sometimes cruelly overtaken by what happens next. In late December 2022, he took the first photographs of a right whale calf born to a mother called Pilgrim, after it was spotted along Canaveral National Seashore. “A couple of weeks later we got amazing drone video of mom and calf,” he recalls. Cohen and colleagues were even able to tell that it was a female calf when it rolled itself over Pilgrim's back.

Roughly one year later, Pilgrim's calf came back to Florida as a juvenile. “She spent many hours, very close to shore, entertaining many people that got to see her,” says Cohen. But just nine days after that appearance, terrible news arrived. An aerial survey team caught sight of a North Atlantic right whale carcass off the coast of Georgia. “She was hit by a vessel,” says Cohen. He and Albert attended the necropsy, at which scientists found fractures to the young whale's skull, among other injuries. “I still feel the loss, and I still am processing it,” he says.

Cohen, who lives by the beach, adds that ever since the death of Pilgrim's calf, he has occasionally experienced nightmares. “I wake up, open the blinds, and there's a mom and calf dead on the beach,” he says. “It is an emotional toll.”

But there are reasons beyond the recent calving success to be at least a little optimistic about the future. Wimmer praises significant regulatory interventions in Canada to protect right whales, for example. “They've implemented dynamic fishing management—if whales are spotted, fishers will be pulled out of an area,” she explains.

Gliders—torpedo-shaped, ocean-going devices—have increasingly helped to track the presence of whales in relation to shipping in recent years. This is part of efforts to reduce vessel strikes. Conservationists say that if ships and leisure craft slow down in areas frequented by right whales, and if people keep their distance from the animals when sighted, then that will help their chances of survival.

“We want everyone to see the whales, but you gotta do that from land,” says Cohen. The Right Whale Sighting Network has a hotline people can call to report potential occurrences of North Atlantic right whales off the Florida coast. Despite the devastation of losing Pilgrim's calf two years ago, Cohen says he's more confident than ever that North Atlantic right whales can recover as a species. He's aware of individual whales that have lost calves, for example, but then gone on to birth new ones just a few years later.

“You see this resilience,” he says, explaining why he is so dedicated to fighting for these whales. “That makes you want to fight even more.”

Amazon is discontinuing its Amazon One palm recognition ID system for stores later this year, the company said in messages to users Tuesday night.

The company will discontinue Amazon One services at retail businesses on June 3, 2026, according to a support page for the service and email messages to customers. 

“In response to limited customer adoption, we're discontinuing Amazon One, our authentication service for facility access and payment,” an Amazon spokesperson said. “All customer data associated with Amazon One will be securely deleted after the service ends.”

The move coincides with a sweeping pullback from Amazon's physical retail experiments. Amazon announced Tuesday that it's closing all of its Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh locations, a total of 72 stores nationwide, concentrating its efforts instead on its Whole Foods Market locations and grocery delivery from Amazon.com.

Amazon One launched in 2020 as a way to help speed up in-store entry and payments, identifying customers who opted-in and eliminating the need for them to present a credit card to pay. It often worked in conjunction with the company's Just Walk Out technology, which uses cameras and sensors to let customers avoid using a checkout line.

The technology first debuted at two Amazon Go convenience stores near the company's Seattle headquarters, before expanding to third-party retailers and venues such as stadiums, airports, and convenience stores.

In 2023, Amazon rolled out Amazon One to more than 500 U.S. Whole Foods stores. It also started offering a version of Amazon One for building access and corporate security.

More recently, Amazon released a mobile app in 2024 for Amazon One, letting users sign up for the service on their phones.

The technology raised privacy and security concerns. It prompted a backlash from artists at Red Rock Amphitheatre outside of Denver in 2022.

Amazon did not provide specific reasons for the discontinuation of the service. The company said on its support page that some locations may begin removing Amazon One devices before June 3, but noted that Amazon One “will continue to be available to patients for check-in at existing healthcare locations until further notice.” 

Users can unenroll from the service manually by signing in at this page and scrolling to the “Unenroll” section.

According to Appfigures, the top five free iPhone apps right now in the U.S. are:

Yesterday, Apple blogger John Gruber of Daring Fireball posted the overall most popular iPhone apps for all of 2025, and the top five were:

I'm not the first person to point this out, but it's not exactly a stretch to infer that the three apps that have suddenly squeezed in between ChatGPT and Threads are on the list due to dissatisfaction with TikTok. Two are VPN apps, which can theoretically be used to access TikTok from a virtual network in a country where the U.S. version of TikTok is unnecessary, and one, UpScrolled, is an Australian video and text sharing app that recently went viral.  To refresh your memory on what's going on with TikTok, after years of trying to force Chinese-owned ByteDance to relinquish ownership and let a U.S.-friendly buyer take over, a legal entity was created earlier this month that can take ownership of TikTok, with Adam Presser as its new CEO. This allows TikTok to comply with a new U.S. law essentially requiring TikTok to be run by a U.S. company or be banned.But this entity, a complex joint corporate venture in charge of U.S. operations for TikTok, appears from the outside to be struggling to keep everything in order, amid the handoff from TikTok's Singapore base of operations (U.S. TikTok data was already largely housed in the U.S., so it's not clear if this transition actually involves any large, burdensome data transfers). According to an X post from TikTok, the problem is that there's been “a major infrastructure issue triggered by a power outage at one of our U.S. data center partner sites,” and there may be various glitches, service slowdowns, failures, and issues with user metrics. Oracle has further clarified that the TikTok issue stems from a weather-related blackout at one of its data centers. Oracle owns 15 percent of the new TikTok U.S. venture.The issues TikTok is referring to dovetail nicely with the descriptions of problems described by users likw videos that sit in review indefinitely, and posts that get low or zero view counts, often despite high numbers for other engagement metrics like comments or shares. Other general issues that fit with a data center interruption include a possible lack of analytics in TikTok Studio, livestreamers apparently getting random messages saying they need to stop streaming immediately, and irrelevant search results.However, the hiccups at TikTok are, at least in part, being perceived as the technical consequences of a right-wing takeover. That's in part because that 15 percent of TikTok U.S. now held by Oracle is controlled by the right-wing billionaire Larry Ellison, and the ownership transition is of course being shepherded along by the Trump Administration. And that's not to mention the fact that the Biden-era push to ban TikTok emerged amid paranoia that it was turning the youth into Maoist, Hamas-supporting terrorists. But have the rules on TikTok tangibly changed? For all anyone knows, no. It has re-emerged in the past few days that at some point in the past, new TikTok CEO Adam Presser talked publicly about an idiosyncratic and clunky moderation practice around Israel—treating the word “Zionist” as hate speech if it carries negative connotations. But this isn't some new TikTok policy rolling out to coincide with the transition to U.S. ownership (although, rather troublingly, at least one answer on X from Grok strongly implies that it is). It's more likely part of a rule change around Zionism that apparently rolled out in 2024. Gizmodo reached out to TikTok's U.S. joint venture for clarification about the causes of the platform's recent problems. In a reply, we received links to statements on X, including the one from Oracle. We followed up, specifically asking if any content rules had been changed since the ownership transition. We will update if we hear back. Around Sunday, TikTok users started writing that they felt like their political posts were being censored.“TikTok has been under new leadership for like a day and I made a slideshow with posts from the ICE rally today and it immediately got out under review and is not being published,” wrote Bluesky user @pnwpolicyangel.bsky.social.  Instagram user erinmayequade wrote:

“TikTok is cooked. They won't even post my last two videos — I can see them, but anyone else who goes to my profile won't even see them. Overnight, our federal government has silenced and suppressed dissent [on] one of our largest platforms. Not just content, but everything from certain people.”

It would be corporate malpractice to roll out such insidious and restrictive policies right out of the gate like this, particularly amid the present backdrop of political upheaval. Once again, TikTok still has not commented on this speculation from some of its users.But if it's true that users are flocking to other options for political reasons despite no hard evidence that the new TikTok U.S. joint venture has already begun some kind of crackdown on political speech, that also doesn't necessarily mean they're misled. They might just expect changes along the lines of what happened at Twitter when Elon Musk took over. Content standards there took a hard right turn very quickly. So with that in mind, some TikTok users might just be leaving preemptively at the first sign of an annoying glitch in order to avoid enduring even worse changes that they perceive to be on the horizon.

Nothing else much to it. In reality they're all going to have to register to do business in Canada/California/whatever and pay their taxes anyway. Structuring the parent in one of those jurisdictions just makes the legal wrangling about ownership and stock classes safer and more predictable to both investor and founder.

reply

While I think this was obviously more complicated than a single entity and probably required two sets of specialists rather than just one, it certainly worked and I would expect something similar is possible with Canada?The founders were not required to move to the US, but ended up doing so anyway.

VCs are not going to know that when evaluating a company. YC as the incubator and the first check in has an obligation to vet the situation for future investors. The easiest way for them to do that at scale is to ensure they are experts in a very small number of jurisdictions that are predictable.Honestly, it makes sense.

My hot take: given the 1 year delay on receipt of funds and the fact that it has the biggest impact on small teams, if you are going to scale a VC backed startup as fast as you need to - SR&D won't be the reason you succeed. If you are not scaling fast enough to make it - SR&D won't save you.If you stay in Canada and raise from Canadian VC's you'll get half the cash at half the valuation. The government makes that up to you in SR&D a year later.Found in Canada because it's your home and you love it. That's the only real reason. And it's a good one.

I don't have to deal with this as we are a (very) small business but it's a major headache for larger small businesses. Basically, as an employer it simply isn't fun to be forced to be in the "providing access to healthcare" business when that's not your core business.

reply

My US benefits were middling in terms of coverage and package when working for a large F500 and went about $16k USD on a 180k salary -- converted is about $19k CAD at todays rates.  Including co-pays and fees it's like 10% of salary.  At the time I was in a big city with great hospitals and doctors, but not noticeably better than Canada even at the higher price.

reply

It is for most large employers as it helps depress salaries and reduce competition from startups.  Employees will want to work for a large employer that lets them pay for health insurance with pre-tax dollars, among other tax advantaged benefits that having a well funded HR department can provide.  And employees cannot easily compare compensation at other employers so they are more likely to stick around than shop around, reducing the need to increase pay to keep up with the market.Employers can also tweak compensation by modifying deductibles/out of pocket maximums/healthcare provider networks, and most people's eyes will glaze over before they can figure out if they got an increase or decrease in their total compensation.

Since this is purely about ownership structure and equity governing law, I'm curious what the intersection you're seeing between these terms and "labour rights" are. We're a US company with employees in Europe (not even an HQ in Europe, just employees there), and I've learned more about European labor law idiosyncracies over the last few years than over the whole rest of my career, because I've had to.

Having a Canada-registered company is usually required to get government grants and loans from Canadian banks, although that's probably not very important to VC-backed companies. There are also some tax advantages to running a Canada-registered company if you're based out of Canada, plus it's much easier to find a local professionals (lawyers, accountants, etc.) familiar with Canadian corporations than US corporations.None of these issues should cause too many problems, but if given a choice, as a Canadian I'd certainly prefer to run a Canada-registered company over a US-registered one.

reply

Read the thread: clearly a lot of people are reading this as "you can't HQ in Canada, your team has to move".

reply

But I think that it counts for a little bit more than just "details for your finance person", since the tax and grant eligibility implications could mean that some startups would be better off incorporating in Canada and not taking the Y Combinator money. But if you're taking the VC funding route (which most applicants to Y Combinator are), then I agree that none of this should really matter very much.

reply

I don't think that's true. You can't have employees without a local subsidiary. If you're going through an EOR agency, they're contractors not employees.

reply

It's complicated. In theory, US states have more rights and powers ("The powers not delegated to the United States [...] are reserved to the States" [0]), but in practice, the Commerce Clause lets the Federal government do essentially anything that it wants. Canada's provinces are only given control over a specific set of topics [1], but their powers are almost absolute in these areas, since the courts almost never let the Federal government interfere.So for labour code specifically, US companies need to adhere to both Federal and state labour codes, while Canadian companies only need to follow a single provincial labour code.

What founders in Europe (say, in the Netherland, where YC invested in Servo7 in the W26 batch) do to accept funding from YC is a "flipped structure": they create a new Delaware Corporation, which then acquires the original company and runs it as a subsidiary. The founders retain the same ownership of the new DE company as they would have had they been in the US. Literally nothing else changes about the operation of the company.This structure is so standard that Canadian YC companies already tended to do it. You've got Dan in this thread talking about how he and Scott did it with Skysheets back in the mid-aughts. Whatever else YC is OK with, future priced-round investors want companies incorporated in the US.I'm sorry, but you were wrong; your analysis of what this change meant was based on a wildly false premise.

Uhh, we don't have universal coverage for everything health up here, we still have private benefits that our employers pay for as part of our compensation plans.Life insurance, dental, vision, prescriptions, physio, mental health, critical illness etc..It might be less than in the US, but it's not "no health insurance benefits to worry about".

The key issue is that the core of one's health insurance is not dependent on the employer or even being full-time employed.  This provides tremendous flexibility.  And I suspect not having things like pregnancy being seen as preexisting conditions is a big win for parents-to-be.Age or low-income (I think) provide provincial or federal assistance independent of employment also.  Medical expenses are also far easier to deduct on taxes in Canada vs. the US.

People have been saying they are moving to Canada for decades due to whatever recent events, statistics say otherwise.

Most Canadian YC founders incorporate their startups in the US (sctb and I did that, way back when), just like other international founders do and of course U.S. founders do, so the number of companies being affected by this change must be very small—small enough that it would be of little interest to the US govt.Most probably the change is because the number was too small to justify all the paperwork, legal hoops to jump through, compliance tracking, etc., that inevitably come with cross-border investments. The startups that YC funds are almost always so early-stage that it ends up being easier for everyone if the founders just incorporate in the US. (It would be like a software team saying "why are we putting all this extra effort into supporting platform X when we only have 3 users on platform X and they can all easily switch to platform Y".)But please understand that I'm just guessing here. The reason I'm posting at all is that I'd hate for any Canadian founders (or potential founders) to read a misleading headline and say "welp, I guess YC doesn't want us then". That is certainly not the case!

Canada loses a lot of its top talent every year to the US, mostly because of the TN visa. Canadian talent leaves Canada every year, and less investment is not going to help.This is made worse by Canadian investment culture being very conservative, and not loving startups in general.

So not only do we have fewer customers, we're competing against an economic juggernaut that shares our broad business rules, our culture and language (with one exception) and can market to us through all our media channels with very little friction.So unless you're in health care or some other regulated field that a US startup can't just expand into easily, it's a tough go.

  - Rents in industrial spaces are absurd in my area, and I suspect they are for most of Canada in any HCOL area. If you can't wing it out of your garage, your burn rate just exploded
  - Getting permits has been exorbitantly slow and complex
  - WorkSafeBC cooperation and inspections are a major time sink (gets better after the first stretch)
  - Getting certficates to export plants is—in my opinion—unnecessarily complex and slow, such that I don't think I'll even bother at this rate
  - Inter-provincial regulations and standards can be hard as hell to nail down. Asking random people on forums can yield better results than extensive google or LLM querying
  - Keeping track of things like write offs and deductions can span years for single costs. I understand why, but I don't like it
  - Admin and oversight often feels like half the job. I need to be on top of so many things that aren't 'the work', and it takes a lot away from focusing on making a better product
  - Shipping things is expensive as hell, and I anticipate this problem will worsen over time. Not a big deal if you don't ship anything
  - Depending on the type of business you've registered, the admin overhead at different times of the year can be significant

It probably sounds like I don't understand what regulations are for and I hate red tape, but that's not the case at all. I think small businesses are disproportionately slammed by some of the requirements they create, though. I also wonder if there are blanket policies which cause some people to be pressed much harder than necessary. It makes you wonder if any of it is worth it at all.Again though, if you just go around repairing things or you provide software services, your life will be orders of magnitude simpler. I used to have a sole proprietorship here in BC providing software consulting services, and it was fine. I had one tax hiccup in something like 10 years, and it wasn't a big deal. I rarely had to think about it.I do wonder if this friction could be part of why Canada arguably has a lack of interest and innovation when it comes to producing material goods. It's genuinely a pain in the ass to be allowed to do it by the books, and to continue operating accordingly.Caveat: I could be lazy and stupid

Can you expand a bit more on how difficult it is to deliver hardware product orders to other countries? Whichever countries you have experience in.

The primary tension and strain comes from deciding where your market is, I think. You can simplify your overhead in obtaining certificates and building your workflows by choosing to sell to a market where these factors are minimally taxing (like just selling in Ontario or across Canada), but in my case this limits my market too much. Not that many people in Canada are buying what I sell, but there are large markets in other countries that are underserved.I have a feeling hardware is much easier. What you're developing is probably not illegal or considered high risk where you want to sell it. In my case, some of the products I sell are banned outright because the province or state it's going to considers it invasive. Even with the certificates, I can't sell some species in some locations. Figuring out all of these requirements and rules in advance is essential so your shipments don't end up rejected and destroyed at the border.What kind of hardware are you manufacturing?

That doesn't strike me as "not at all" when the TN status is 1/ effectively a work visa, whether you like the strings attached or not, and 2/ a foot in the door that lets you move to a more permissive status down the line. A Waterloo or UofT grad can go from applying to a US job to their first day in a few weeks, and the only interaction they'll have with the immigration system will be getting asked for paperwork at the border. Compare that to a British or Japanese new grad, for whom there is essentially very few options unless they have excellent connections or that they display enough extraordinary abilities to be eligible for O-1.

A National Transportation Safety Board review of the mid-air collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet in January 2025 found that the Federal Aviation Administration was plagued by systemic safety issues in the lead-up to the accident that killed 67 people.

“The Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Organization had multiple opportunities to identify the risk of a mid-air collision between airplanes and helicopters at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. However, their data analysis, safety assurance, and risk assessment processes failed to recognize and mitigate that risk,” the board shared in findings.

The investigation suggests that the helicopter route was dangerously close to the path taken by civilian aircraft. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said that the FAA was supposed to conduct annual safety reviews of helicopter routes, but the board was unable to find evidence of such reviews taking place.

The NTSB also notified the FAA of 15,214 close-proximity events, 85 of which were serious. The investigators said at a hearing on Tuesday that reviews of such near-collisions were done on a case-by-case basis.

“The data was in their own systems,” Homendy told reporters. “This was 100% preventable.”

There wasn't a positive safety culture at the FAA's operational arm, Air Traffic Organization, NTSB investigators said, with some employees reporting facing retaliation for raising safety concerns.

Although safety concerns were raised over mid-air collisions in the D.C. airspace, investigators said, the Air Traffic Organization failed to respond to these concerns. Tower personnel also put together their own helicopter working group to “repeatedly” raise concerns and submit recommendations, Homendy said.

At the hearing, Homendy also said that there were “some concerns with an overreliance on AI by the FAA,” but stopped short of making any connection between the incident and AI use.

“They've got to be careful on the use of AI to pick up trends, to make sure it doesn't discount some reports,” Homendy said. According to NTSB's chief data scientist Loren Groff, the FAA has been using AI to sort through large volumes of pilot reports.

“There really does need to be a human understanding of what all of these things mean together,” Groff said.

The chair also signaled that the FAA has yet to learn from its mistakes.

“Commercial airlines have called me to say the next mid-air is going to be in Burbank, and nobody at the FAA is paying attention to us,” Homendy said.

The investigators said that the FAA still does not have a standardized definition of what constitutes a close-proximity event.

On top of inadequate safety measures by the FAA, the Army's aviation safety system was also riddled with failures, the report found. The army failed to allocate adequate resources to aviation safety management for D.C. area helicopter operations and also lacked a positive safety culture, according to investigators.

The close call issue in aviation is something that the NTSB has been ringing alarm bells over for years. Back in 2023, Homendy told a U.S. Senate panel that there was an increase in serious near-miss aviation incidents, and it was a symptom of a strained aviation system.

“We cannot wait until a fatal accident forces action,” Homendy said at the time.

On January 29th, 2025, over the Potomac River in Washington D.C., an Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed into an American Airlines regional flight from Wichita, Kansas, as it was about to land in Washington D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport. The incident has been deemed the deadliest plane crash in the country since 2001.

The tower at Ronald Reagan National Airport was managing both helicopter and flight traffic simultaneously. The tower was understaffed at the time, but the Board found that there were still enough personnel to separate the control positions. The decision was up to the operations supervisor, who had been working a really long shift and investigators believe that the “lack of mandatory relief periods for supervisory air traffic control personnel” could have led to poor performance.

“Keeping the helicopter control and local control positions continuously combined on the night of the accident increased the local control controller's workload and negatively impacted his performance and situation awareness,” the report found

The controllers notified the helicopter of the passenger plane approaching, but failed to warn the flight crew of the helicopter. The pilots could not see the helicopter coming, and the airplane lacked airborne collision avoidance systems that could have alerted the pilots to the risk posed by the helicopter.

When warned, the helicopter crew said they had eyes on the incoming flight, but had likely confused the aircraft with another, because the controller had not specified direction or distance.

The helicopter was also flying roughly 100 feet above its maximum altitude, and it's possible that the crew saw a wrong altitude reading. According to the NTSB's findings, the FAA and the Army failed to identify “incompatibility” between the error tolerances of barometric altimeters in the helicopters and the helicopter route, which meant that helicopters were “regularly” flying higher than they should and even potentially crossing into airplane paths.

“It is possible that incorrect settings may be present on other aircraft used throughout the Department of War armed services,” the board concluded.

Doctors may soon be able to tell just how sick a heart failure patient really is by using a routine MRI scan, thanks to new research from the University of East Anglia.

People with heart failure often need a test called right heart catheterisation, where a tube is inserted into the heart to measure oxygen levels in the blood. This helps doctors understand how severe the condition is.

But the invasive procedure is far from pleasant and carries risks, especially for older, frail or unwell patients.

In collaboration with researchers at the University of Leeds and Newcastle University, the team developed a way to estimate this crucial measurement of blood oxygen using a standard cardiac MRI.

Now, they hope their findings could potentially spare thousands from undergoing the risky tube procedure in future.

Heart failure affects hundreds of thousands of people in the UK and significantly weakens the heart's ability to pump blood. Doctors often need detailed information about a patient's circulation to decide on the best treatment.

We wanted to develop a safe, non-invasive alternative which could allow far more patients to be properly assessed - and allow repeat monitoring without the risks of a catheter test.

Our breakthrough could be a game changer for assessing advanced heart failure. It could allow us to measure risk more safely and more often, especially for patients who are too frail or high-risk for an invasive catheter procedure."

Prof. Pankaj Garg, lead researcher from UEA's Norwich Medical School and consultant cardiologist at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital

The team developed a method that uses a routine type of MRI measurement called T2 mapping to estimate how much oxygen is left in the blood as it returns to the heart - a key marker of how well the heart is coping.

Prof Garg said: "Blood with different oxygen levels behaves slightly differently in a magnetic field. By measuring how that blood reacts, we were able to develop a formula that predicts the oxygen reading without ever inserting a tube or taking a blood sample."

The researchers first tested the technique in 30 patients and found the MRI results closely matched the invasive catheter readings.

They then analysed 628 people with newly diagnosed heart failure, following them for around three years. Those with healthier oxygen readings on MRI were significantly less likely to die or end up in hospital due to their condition.

Crucially, this MRI-based measure stayed accurate even after accounting for age, other illnesses and overall heart function.

Prof Garg said: "One of the most important markers in advanced heart failure is how much oxygen is left in blood returning to the right side of the heart. Until now, getting that number has usually meant a tube test. Our study shows it can be estimated non-invasively from a standard heart MRI."

Senior author Dr Peter Swoboda, from the University of Leeds, added: "This means we may be able to read off a crucial haemodynamic number from an everyday scan - effectively turning a routine MRI into a much more powerful test, without putting a tube into the heart."

Co-author Dr Gareth Matthews, from the University of East Anglia, said: "Because this can be done as part of a standard cardiac MRI, it needs no extra hardware and no contrast dye, and adds only seconds to the scan.

"It has real potential to widen access to safer heart failure assessment across the NHS," he added.

The researchers say further studies are needed to confirm the findings in different hospitals and patient groups, and to understand how best to use the measure in day-to-day decision-making.

'Development and validation of a non-invasive model of mixed venous oxygen saturation in heart failure' is published in the journal JACC Advances.

The tiny zebrafish is helping researchers rapidly determine whether a newborn's genetic mutation is likely to cause spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), one of the leading causes of infant mortality worldwide.

The world-first research, led by Dr. Jean Giacomotto from Griffith University's Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, has featured on the front cover of EMBO Molecular Medicine this month (January).

SMA is a genetic disorder which causes progressive loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and loss of basic motor functions.

Without treatment, SMA is typically fatal, and while highly effective therapies now exist, they can exceed US$2 million per child per year and must be initiated before symptoms appear such as when a baby is able to sit but lacks sufficient neck strength to hold their head steady.

If treatment starts after the emergence of these symptoms, the child will have already experienced irreversible degenerative damage, leading to life-long problems and possibly death within the first years of life.

When a baby carries a mutation which has never been seen before, known as a 'variant of uncertain significance or VUS', clinicians face an impossible dilemma – start treatment immediately, risk unnecessary intervention, or wait and risk irreversible nerve damage."

Dr. Jean Giacomotto from Griffith University's Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics

To solve this, Dr. Giacomotto and his team developed a rapid zebrafish-based functional assay which could determine the pathogenicity of a novel SMN1 mutation within days, potentially informing urgent clinical decisions worldwide.

"Within a clinically meaningful timeframe, we were able to functionally test each baby's exact mutation and show it was not harmful," Dr. Giacomotto said.

"This research provides the clearest demonstration to date that zebrafish can play a decisive role in clinical variant interpretation, particularly in newborns flagged through expanding genomic screening programs.

"With genomic sequencing rising worldwide, clinicians are encountering more and more uncertain variants.

"This tiny fish offers a fast and affordable way to help resolve these cases and reduce distress for families."

More than 135 million American adults are either living with or at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D), elevating the need for more evidence-based dietary guidance to help this growing population achieve optimal health and reduce risks for T2D and its complications. Recently published findings from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrate that eating 6-7 ounces of beef per day does not impact risk factors for T2D, as well as other cardiometabolic health markers, in adults with prediabetes. The study, "Effects of Diets Containing Beef Compared with Poultry on Pancreatic β -Cell Function and Other Cardiometabolic Health Indicators in Males and Females with Prediabetes: A Randomized, Crossover Trial," was published in Current Developments in Nutrition. 

Results from this gold standard RCT build on existing scientific evidence that shows eating beef as part of a healthy dietary pattern supports heart health and does not adversely impact measures of blood sugar regulation or inflammation. When beef is consumed as part of a healthy dietary pattern, it helps fill essential nutritional gaps and does not adversely impact the cardiometabolic risk profile compared to poultry."

Kevin C Maki, PhD, Adjunct Professor in the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington, and senior author of the article

This RCT with a crossover design included 24 adults (17 males and 7 females; ages 18-74 years) with overweight or obesity and prediabetes, who were otherwise generally healthy. The participants each completed two 28-day dietary intervention periods, separated by a 28-day washout period. Participants consumed two entrées per day, each containing 3.0-3.5 ounces of cooked beef or poultry, in the form of fajitas, stew, burgers, burritos, or stir fry, as part of their habitual dietary pattern.

The development of T2D typically results from insulin resistance that occurs over an extended period, accompanied by progressive deterioration in the function of the pancreatic β-cells that secrete insulin. To assess glucose regulation, pancreatic β-cell function and glucoregulatory hormones were measured before and after each 28-day dietary intervention period. There were no statistically significant differences for any of the pancreatic β-cell function parameters or insulin sensitivity after 28 days of consuming 6-7 ounces of unprocessed beef or poultry per day.

"The study findings suggest that regular beef intake does not adversely affect metabolic or inflammatory risk factors compared with poultry in an at-risk prediabetic population," noted Indika Edirisinghe, PhD, Professor of Food Science and Nutrition, Illinois Institute of Technology. "Although the study duration was relatively short (one month), this time frame is generally considered sufficient to detect measurable metabolic outcomes."

This research was funded by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a contractor to the Beef Checkoff, which was not involved in the data collection or analysis, nor publication of the findings, except for reviewing a draft of the manuscript prior to submission.

Bottom line: A four-biomarker blood panel of aminopeptidase N (ANPEP), polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), CA19-9, and thrombospondin-2 (THBS2) enhanced the detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) compared to measuring CA19-9 levels alone.

Journal in which the study was published: Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR).

Author: Kenneth S. Zaret, PhD, professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which forms from the exocrine cells in the pancreas, is the most common form of pancreatic cancer, accounting for about 95% of cases. When detected at a localized, early stage, the five-year relative survival is about 44%, but once the disease has metastasized, the five-year survival drops to 3%. Most cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed at late stages.

"Pancreatic cancer usually doesn't present with symptoms until it's too late for surgery, when the cancer has already metastasized to other parts of the body," said Zaret. "Our goal was to look for biomarkers in the blood that appear in early-stage PDAC patients, to catch the disease early," he explained.

CA19-9 is a protein that is released into the blood by both cancer cells and normal pancreatic cells, and elevated levels of CA19-9 in the blood can be a sign of pancreatic cancer or other diseases. THBS2 is a protein that is expressed in PDAC tumor tissue, and when screened for in blood alongside CA19-9 using a bioassay, enables the test to better discriminate between PDAC and healthy patients, according to previous work from Zaret and colleagues. However, Zaret noted that these biomarkers are insufficient for routine early detection.

"CA19-9 is widely used to monitor diagnosed pancreatic cancer but isn't recommended as a standalone screening test-benign conditions can elevate it in some people, while others may have low levels, even if they have pancreatic cancer. THBS2 is investigational and can complement CA19-9, but its prediagnostic performance has been mixed," he said.

How the study was conducted: To identify novel biomarkers of pancreatic cancer, Zaret and colleagues analyzed plasma samples from two cohorts: 537 samples from the Mayo Clinic (Mayo) and 135 from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The cohorts included patients with confirmed pancreatic cancer, healthy individuals, and patients with benign pancreatic disease, which enabled the researchers to evaluate the ability of candidate biomarkers to differentiate between pancreatic cancer and benign conditions that could mimic cancer.

By comparing protein levels across the plasma samples, the researchers identified two proteins, ANPEP and PIGR, that showed elevated levels in samples from patients with early-stage PDAC, compared with samples from patients without cancer.

Zaret and colleagues then developed a panel that measured the blood levels of four biomarkers: the newly identified ANPEP and PIGR, along with the previously known biomarkers CA19-9 and THBS2.

Results: Across the two independent cohorts, Mayo and Penn, the four‑biomarker blood panel showed area under curve (AUC) values of 0.97 and 0.96, respectively, when comparing stage 1-2 PDAC and healthy controls. The AUC is a measure of the test's ability to distinguish between two groups, with 1.0 being a perfect score.

The panel was also able to distinguish cancer from benign pancreatic conditions with an AUC 0.87 for early‑stage PDAC and 0.91 for all stages in the Mayo cohort.

The four-biomarker panel correctly detected 91.9% of pancreatic cancers across all stages and 87.5% of early‑stage cases, compared to testing for the CA19-9 biomarker alone, which identified 82.7% of the PDAC cases overall and 76.2% of the early-stage cases. The improvement in all-stage cancer detection was statistically significant, whereas the gain in early‑stage detection did not reach statistical significance in spite of the 11.3% improvement in sensitivity.

Authors' comments: If confirmed in larger, prospective studies, the four-biomarker blood panel could improve the ability to identify which individuals with a high risk for pancreatic cancer would benefit from follow-up imaging, explained Zaret, adding that this could allow clinicians to detect more pancreatic cancers at an earlier, more treatable stage.

"With the addition of ANPEP and PIGR, the panel helps to overcome known limitations associated with CA19-9 and THBS2 testing-such as patients who genetically underexpress CA19-9 or tumors that present as different molecular subtypes-and could therefore reduce the number of missed cancer cases while keeping false positives low," he said.

Study limitations: One limitation of this study is that the cohorts did not include individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer, such as those with a family history, germline BRCA mutations, or new-onset diabetes, introducing a bias in test performance, noted Zaret.

Another limitation is the retrospective nature of the study, which means that larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the panel's real-world screening performance, Zaret explained.

Alzheimer Europe has today launched the "The Prevalence of Dementia in Europe 2025" report, which provides updated prevalence figures for the number of people living with dementia both for Europe as a whole, as well as the countries within. The report builds upon Alzheimer Europe's previous work in the "Dementia in Europe Yearbook 2019". Alzheimer Europe adopted the same methodology, seeking out community-based studies published since the Dementia in Europe Yearbook 2019, from which new prevalence rates across 5-year age bands were derived. These updated prevalence rates were then applied to population projections for 2025 and 2050 taken from the UN World Population Prospects (UN WPP) data 2024. 

For 2025, the number of people living with dementia is 9,065,706 for EU27 countries and 12,122,979 for EU and non-EU countries. The report also estimates that by 2050 there will be 14,335,788 people with dementia in EU27 countries and 19,905,856 people with dementia in EU and non-EU countries combined. This means that, by 2050, the estimated number of people living with dementia will increase by 58% in the EU27 countries, and by 64% in EU and non-EU countries combined.

To understand whether there had been any significant change in the estimated number of people with dementia, between 2019 and 2025, Alzheimer Europe used its estimates for EU27 countries, as a point of comparison. The overall numbers of people estimated to be living with dementia in the EU27 for the years 2025 and 2050, are broadly consistent across the two reports. However, among men, consistently higher prevalence rates were observed in each of the 70+ age bands, but in particular for the 70-74 band. The picture for women was generally more mixed. 

The projected increase in overall numbers reinforces the call that Alzheimer Europe and its member associations have been making for many years: EU and national decision-makers must take action to ensure that society supports people with the condition, their families and carers to live well as well as possible.

From a policy perspective, health and social care systems must have the necessary capacity and infrastructure to provide high-quality care and support to individuals living with dementia, from diagnosis through to end-of-life care. 

Furthermore, research agendas must, as a matter of priority, give dementia the status it deserves, prioritising basic research to better understand the condition, clinical studies to develop diagnostics and treatments, and demographic research looking at the populations affected, allowing for improved system responses.

This report comes at a time when the future budget of the EU is being discussed and we can see that the proposals are moving away from the previous strong commitment to health, social affairs and research, and putting greater focus on defence and economic activities, under the scope of competitiveness.

Alzheimer Europe's message for decision-makers at an EU and national level is clear: The number of people living with dementia will continue to grow over the coming decades. A failure to act now, to invest sufficiently in health, care and social protection systems, provide adequate support for research and implement strong preventative interventions, will exacerbate the challenges ahead.

Commenting on the publication of the report, Alzheimer Europe's Executive Director, Jean Georges, stated:

"The scale of the challenge posed by dementia across Europe is substantial and it is our sincere hope that our updated figures provide the impetus for decision-makers, both at the European and national levels, to prioritise dementia and ensure it is addressed across the domains of health, research, disability policy and support for informal carers. 

In particular, policy-makers must work to improve care services, make investments in health infrastructure for diagnosis and treatment, as well as help for family, carers and supporters of people with dementia. As part of this, they must take into consideration the changing demographics of the population and the prevalence of conditions such as dementia. 

Our Helsinki Manifesto sets out a blueprint of actions, at the EU and national level, to improve the lives of people with dementia, their carers and families. 

We reiterate the key calls from our Helsinki Manifesto: There is a clear need for a coordinated European Action Plan on Dementia and a dedicated research mission, each with ringfenced funding to ensure their proper implementation."

Because treatment of the whole prostate can lead to long-term side effects in patients with prostate cancer, interest in minimally invasive, focal treatment options has been growing for certain patients. A clinical trial published in BJU International generated promising results for a type of focal therapy, which directly targets the cancer and spares the remainder of the unaffected prostate gland.

The ProFocal Laser Therapy for Prostate Tissue Ablation (PFLT-PC) trial is the first pivotal trial of ProFocal®, a novel, cooled laser focal therapy device for prostate cancer treatment.

In the 100-participant trial, 84% of patients had no clinically significant prostate cancer on their 3-month post-treatment biopsy. The treatment provided similar cancer-related outcomes to those that have been reported for other focal therapy devices, but with an improved safety profile and low rates of incontinence.

This new technology is very promising with excellent cancer control while preserving patients' quality of life. Traditional radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy for prostate cancer results in very high rates of incontinence and erectile dysfunction. With this new technology, patients can have their prostate cancer treated with very low risk of suffering the side effects associated with traditional prostate cancer treatments."

Sapio Sciences, the science-aware™ AI lab informatics platform, today announced the results of new research examining scientists' sentiment around electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) and AI tools in modern laboratory environments. The study reveals widespread frustration with existing lab software, leading to repeated experiments, inefficient data use, and a growing reliance on unauthorized shadow AI. 150 scientists were surveyed across U.S. and European labs in biopharma R&D, contract research organizations, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Despite the significant investments made in digital lab technology, ELNs often fail to support effective scientific work. Only 62 % of scientists say their ELN allows them to work efficiently, and just 5 % report being able to analyze experimental results without specialist support.

Additionally, duplication is a persistent issue. Nearly two-thirds of scientists, 65 %, say they have had to repeat experiments because prior results were difficult to find or reuse, driving avoidable costs and delays across lab teams.

The survey highlights several ways today's ELNs are falling short:

Mike Hampton, chief commercial officer at Sapio Sciences, said:

“The survey clearly shows a growing mismatch between modern scientific practice and the capabilities of traditional ELNs. Most ELNs were designed as tools that focused on documenting experiments, not actively supporting scientists or guiding next steps. Today, scientists are working with increasingly complex data and are expected to move from results to decisions faster than ever, yet many ELNs still function like glorified filing cabinets.”

“When scientists can't analyze data or easily build on previous experiments without additional support, frustration turns into real cost. Unnecessary experiment duplication wastes reagents, instrument time, and specialist labor. At the same time, it limits curiosity and slows the pace of discovery across biopharma R&D.”

The research also shows how these frustrations are reshaping behavior in the lab. Almost half of scientists surveyed, 45 %, say they use public generative AI tools through personal accounts to support their work, despite the security, IP, and compliance risks associated with shadow AI.

Scientists aren't turning to public AI because they want to bypass governance. They're doing it because existing lab tools can't help them analyze results or determine next steps efficiently. When AI capability isn't available in governed environments, people will find it elsewhere, even when they do understand the risks.”

Sean Blake, Chief Information Officer, Sapio Sciences

When asked what they want from the next generation of ELNs, scientists consistently emphasized interaction, guidance, and interpretation rather than documenting experiments alone. Ninety-five percent want conversational, text-based interfaces, while 78 % want voice interaction. Almost all respondents, 96 %, say future ELNs must help interpret data, not simply capture it.

Scientists also want built-in, field-specific AI capabilities, with demand varying by discipline:

Rob Brown, head of the scientific office at Sapio Sciences, said:

“Our research clearly shows that second-generation ELNs have reached the limits of what scientists expect from them. As we shape the next generation of lab software at Sapio, the focus is on AI-enabled scientific analysis and design methods that keep scientists in control while actively supporting workflows, analysis and next-step decisions.”

The findings suggest scientists are not looking to relinquish control but to work with AI tools that actively support reasoning and interpretation within governed lab environments.

A major new study has found that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which applies magnetic energy to the brain, can be a cost-effective treatment option for the NHS in treating moderate and severe forms of depression that have not responded to other treatments.

The economic analysis, which is published in BMJ Mental Health, compared TMS to usual care in specialist mental health services, and found that TMS reduces depressive symptoms, eases pressures on informal carers and on NHS resources, and helps people get back to work.

TMS represents an investment in care that recovers its costs over time, primarily from savings to the wider health service and from fewer workdays being lost because of long-term depression.

The study was led by senior health economist Edward Cox from the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit at the University of Nottingham and Professor Richard Morriss from the Institute of Mental Health, National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, and the NIHR HealthTech Research Centre in Mental Health (MindTech).

Major depression is the leading cause of disability lost years worldwide (WHO, 2017), and suicide from depression is one of the biggest killers of people aged between 15-49. Antidepressants and therapy delivered as first or second-line treatments help two thirds of people with depression, but the remaining third have treatment resistant depression (TRD). This is defined as a lack of response to two courses of antidepressants.

TMS is an outpatient treatment where people have powerful magnetic pulses delivered to the left side of their head just in front of the temporal area of the scalp. The person is conscious and has at least 20 sessions over a four-to-six-week period.

Although TMS is safe and effective as a treatment for TRD and was approved in 2015 by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use in the NHS, it remains inaccessible for the majority of patients. Although TMS was invented in the UK, the equipment produced by UK industry, and has been proven effective and implementable within mental health care services, it is only available in one in seven NHS Trusts. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of evidence showing its value for money.

In this new study, experts set out to assess the cost-effectiveness of two forms of TMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (rTMS) and intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), compared to usual care for TRD. The study also seeks to establish the operational circumstances in which TMS could be deemed to represent value-for-money to the NHS and wider society.

Susan Varley, a patient who has received a course of TMS therapy, said: "As a previously high functioning nurse, I suffered severe depression and had to be admitted to hospital because of the severity of my depression. I tried all sorts of different treatments for my depression. Nothing worked. I then travelled to receive a course of TMS and it has transformed my life. I am back working as a nurse, lost four stone in weight and I am enjoying life again with family and friends. I strongly believe that others suffering like me should be given the option of TMS under the NHS."

Our economic analysis was informed via feedback from TMS experts across six mental health care services, and from the experiences of 442 participants suffering with difficult-to-treat forms of depression enrolled within two clinical trials. The study found that a proportion of patients receiving TMS therapies can expect to achieve faster and more sustained improvements in depressive symptoms compared to usual care, and that these gains represent a cost-effective allocation of scarce NHS resources.

It's important to recognize that the cost-effectiveness of TMS is dependent specifically on how it is going to be delivered in wider practice. Our study findings demonstrate that services that can achieve a streamlined high throughput model of care can expect to deliver a highly cost-effective treatment. Our findings should provide much needed evidence for policymakers to rationalise and establish cost-effective models for implementing TMS within the NHS."

Edward Cox from the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Nottingham

The team developed a decision-analytic model (DAM) to integrate evidence from three sources – (i) the BRIGhTMIND trial  – a large randomised controlled trial (RTC), funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme - a partnership between the NIHR and the Medical Research Council (MRC) - that showed TMS was effective for at least six months; (ii) The Specialist Mood Disorder (SMD) trial – the first UK multicentre outpatient RTC in patients with moderate of severe unipolar depression in the UK funded by the NIHR Applied Research Collaboration East Midlands; and (iii) a study-specific structured expert elicitation exercise, where experts highly experienced in the delivery of TMS therapies for depression were interviewed on the longer-term effectiveness and operational realities of providing treatment.

NICE typically considers medical interventions to be cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for a treatment [the expected cost to the health service per unit of benefit] falls within or below a threshold of £20,000–£30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. This threshold is set to rise to £25,000–£35,000 per QALY imminently.

From a health-service perspective rTMS and iTBS had ICERs of £12,093 and £12,959 per QALY compared to TAU, respectively. From a broader societal perspective both rTMS and iTBS improved health, reduced informal care hours and were cost-saving compared with TAU.

The study findings were sensitive to service delivery, but provided there is a high throughput of patients receiving TMS and currently recommended protocols for TMS are followed, then this research suggests that TMS is a cost-effective alternative to usual care. 

Professor Richard Morriss, Research Theme Lead for Mental Health and Technology at the NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, and the School of Medicine at the University, said: "Our view is that TMS should be considered as a cost-effective alternative for treating moderate to severe depression after the second course of treatment has failed.

"Compared to usual care, our study shows that TMS is cost-effective below the lowest NICE threshold for cost-effectiveness for health costs and cost saving if health, informal care and work productivity are included.

"Two main objections for implementing TMS for TRD in the NHS was that it was only effective for a short period and there was no UK economic study showing that it was cost-effective or cost-saving. The BRIGhtMIND study in 2024 proved that the treatment was effective for at least six months and this new study now shows cost-effectiveness in health costs and in terms of in wider societal costs too. With this in mind, we feel that it is time for the NHS to seriously consider implementing TMS in NHS services across the UK."

A neural circuit hidden in an understudied region of the brain plays a critical role in turning temporary pain into pain that can last months or years, according to new University of Colorado Boulder research.

The animal study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, found that silencing this pathway, known as the caudal granular insular cortex (CGIC), can prevent or halt chronic pain.

Our paper used a variety of state-of-the art methods to define the specific brain circuit crucial for deciding for pain to become chronic and telling the spinal cord to carry out this instruction. If this crucial decision maker is silenced, chronic pain does not occur. If it is already ongoing, chronic pain melts away."

Linda Watkins, senior author, distinguished professor of behavioral neuroscience, College of Arts and Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder

The study comes amid what first author Jayson Ball calls a "gold rush of neuroscience."

With new tools enabling them to genetically manipulate precise populations of brain cells, neuroscientists are now able to identify, with unprecedented granularity, potential targets for new therapies. Such therapies, including infusions or brain-machine interfaces, could someday provide safer and more effective alternatives to opioids.

"This study adds an important leaf to the tree of knowledge about chronic pain," said Ball, who earned his doctorate in Watkins' lab in May and now works for Neuralink, a California-based startup that develops brain-machine interfaces for human health.

About one in four adults have chronic pain, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and nearly one in 10 people say chronic pain interferes with their daily life and work.

Those with nerve-related pain often suffer from a condition called allodynia, an extreme sensitivity in which even light touch hurts.

Acute and chronic pain work differently. Acute pain serves as a temporary warning sign, initiated when an injured tissue-like a stubbed toe-sends a signal to the spinal cord and onward to the brain's pain center. Chronic pain is more like a false alarm, in which pain signals persist in the brain for weeks, months or years after the initial tissue injury has healed.

"Why, and how, pain fails to resolve, leaving you in chronic pain, is a major question that is still in search of answers," said Watkins.

In 2011, Watkins' lab published a study suggesting that the CGIC-a sugar-cube-sized cluster of cells hidden deep within the folds of a portion of the human brain called the insula-plays an important role in allodynia. Human studies have also shown that chronic pain patients have an over-active CGIC.

But for a long time, the only way to manipulate the CGIC was to remove it-an impractical approach for human treatments.

For the new study, the team used novel fluorescent proteins to observe which cells in the central nervous system light up when a rat sustains a sciatic nerve injury. The team then used cutting-edge "chemogenetic" tools to switch on or off genes inside specific populations of neurons.

The researchers discovered that while the CGIC plays a minimal role in processing acute pain, it plays a vital role in making pain persist.

According to the study, the CGIC signals the brain's pain processing center, or somatosensory cortex, which in turn tells the spinal cord to keep the pain going.

"We found that activating this pathway excites the part of the spinal cord that relays touch and pain to the brain, causing touch to now be perceived as pain as well," said Ball.

When the team turned off cells within this pathway immediately after injury, the rat's pain from injury was short-lived. In animals already experiencing chronic allodynia, disabling this pathway made the pain cease.

"Our research presents a clear case that specific brain pathways can be directly targeted to modulate sensory pain," said Ball.

It's still unclear what prompts the CGIC to start sending chronic pain signals. And more research is necessary before these lessons learned could be applied to help humans.

But Ball imagines a not-too-distant future in which medical professionals treat pain with injections or infusions that target specific brain cells without the systemic side effects and dependency risk that come with opioids. He also believes brain-machine interfaces, either implanted in or attached to the skull, could play a similar role in treating severe chronic pain. Numerous startups are now rushing to get to market first, he said.

 "Now that we have access to tools that allow you to manipulate the brain, not based just on a general region but on specific sub-populations of cells, the quest for new treatments is moving much faster," he said.

Sleeping without pillows may help lower high internal eye pressure, build-up of which causes optic nerve damage and glaucoma-the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide–in people with the condition, suggests preliminary research, published online in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.

Stacked pillows alter neck position, which may compress the jugular vein, thereby preventing the natural drainage of aqueous humor, explain the researchers. This fluid nourishes eye tissues without a blood supply like the cornea and lens and helps maintain eye shape and pressure.

Internal eye pressure, formally known as intraocular pressure, or IOP for short, fluctuates in response to changes in body posture, and the transition from an upright to a supine position during sleep represents the primary contributor to its increase at night, note the researchers.

To explore this further, they looked at the effect on IOP of sleeping with 2 regular sized pillows, providing a head elevation of 20–35°, in 144 adults with glaucoma (84 aged up to 44; 41 aged 45 to 59; and 19 aged 60 and above).

Seventy participants had normal tension glaucoma; 9 had high blood pressure in the eye, and 65 had primary open angle glaucoma, the most common and slowly progressive form of the condition-often due to clogged up aqueous humor drainage.

Between October 2023 and April 2024, each participant provided detailed information on their medical history, including glaucoma treatment, plus any smoking and alcohol consumption, and they underwent a comprehensive eye exam.

Their right eye IOP was measured every 2 hours for 24 hours, both when sitting and when lying down. When supine, their heads were subsequently raised to an elevation of between 20° and 35° by two normal sized pillows, and their IOP measured 10 minutes later.

They then reverted to sleeping on their backs until the next measurement. Four sets of complete measurements were obtained for each participant with and without pillows.

In all, 96 (67%) participants had a demonstrable increase in IOP when transitioning from a supine to an elevated position, with an average increase of around 1.61 mm Hg.

Internal eye pressure was significantly higher in the elevated position (17.42 mm Hg vs 16.62 mm Hg), with greater fluctuations over the 24 hour period.

At the same time ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), which measures the pressure available to push blood through the eye's tiny vessels, was significantly reduced when 2 pillows were used: 54.57 mm Hg vs 58.71 when supine. Reduced OPP is an indicator of a reduction in blood flow bringing oxygen and nutrients to the eye.

When the results were stratified further, they showed that young adults were much more likely to have significantly greater IOP than older adults as were those with primary open angle glaucoma.

Postural jugular vein blood flow was assessed in 20 healthy volunteers both with and without pillows. The inner cavity of the veins (lumen) was much more restricted with pillows than it was without, while blood flow was significantly faster.

"Traditional strategies of nocturnal IOP management are primarily limited to increasing the types and frequency of IOP-lowering medications or supplementary laser therapy," explain the researchers. "Given the well-documented influence of postural changes on IOP, positional modification emerges as a plausible strategy warranting further investigation."

This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers also acknowledge various limitations to their findings, chief among which were the small numbers of participants in each of the glaucoma groups.

Further research is needed to validate these preliminary findings, they emphasise, but they nevertheless conclude that the findings "may be linked to jugular venous compression induced by neck flexion, which could potentially compromise venous return and aqueous humour outflow.

"Patients with glaucoma may therefore benefit from avoiding sleeping postures that induce jugular venous compression to mitigate postural IOP elevation. Such behavioral adjustments represent a simple yet potentially effective adjunctive strategy for optimising long-term IOP management in clinical practice."

A newly approved National Cancer Institute-funded clinical trial aims to improve survival for head and neck cancer patients whose disease returns after radiation therapy – a setback that affects up to 40% of patients and is often associated with poor outcomes.

For these patients, surgery is currently the standard treatment, typically targeting tumors in the mouth, throat or lymph nodes of the neck. This Phase II trial will examine whether giving chemotherapy, or chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, before surgery can improve survival compared with surgery alone.

Even when a patient is a good surgical candidate, the operation is often aggressive and life-altering. It can mean losing the voice box, removing much of the tongue, or risking serious complications in the neck, and despite all that, outcomes are still not where we want them to be. We hope this trial identifies a treatment that will help patients live longer without the cancer returning."

Christina Henson, M.D., associate professor, University of Oklahoma College of Medicine and radiation oncologist, OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center

Henson is the radiation oncology chair for the trial, which will enroll patients in Oklahoma and across the United States.

Patients deemed surgical candidates will be randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) before surgery; the same chemotherapies plus the immunotherapy drug cemiplimab before surgery; or surgery alone. Cemiplimab, which harnesses the body's own immune system to fight the cancer, is a PDL1 inhibitor. The drug targets cancers that are positive for PDL1, a protein marker indicating the tumor may be vulnerable to immunotherapy. Most head and neck cancers are PDL1-positive, Henson said.

Henson's colleague Mark Newpower, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the OU College of Medicine, is the medical physics chair for the trial. Patients with especially high-risk cancer may receive radiation therapy following surgery.

"We have worked to standardize the technical details of this trial. It has been gratifying to contribute the institutional knowledge of our radiation oncology department," said Newpower, who is the lead proton physicist for OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center.

Gene-editing tools like CRISPR have unlocked new treatments for previously uncurable diseases. Now, researchers at the University of British Columbia are extending those possibilities to the skin for the first time.

The UBC team, together with researchers from the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité in Germany, has developed the first gene therapy capable of correcting faulty genes when applied directly to human skin. Outlined today in a paper published in Cell Stem Cell, the breakthrough could lead to new treatments for a wide range of genetic skin conditions, from rare inherited diseases to more common disorders like eczema.

With this work, we show that it is possible to correct disease-causing mutations in human skin using a topical treatment that is safe, scalable and easy-to-use. Importantly, the approach corrects the root cause of disease, and our data suggests that a one-time treatment might even be enough to provide a lasting and durable cure."

In the study, the researchers show the gene therapy can correct the most common genetic mutation behind autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a rare and life-threatening inherited skin disorder that appears at birth.

Affecting approximately one in 100,000 people, ARCI causes lifelong complications including extremely dry and scaly skin, chronic inflammation and a high risk of infections. There is currently no cure or effective treatment, and patients must manage their symptoms for life.

"For many patients, this condition is not only physically painful, but also deeply stigmatizing and isolating," said Dr. Hedtrich.

By testing the treatment in models made from living human skin, the team showed it can restore up to 30 per cent of normal skin function-a level that previous research suggests could be clinically meaningful for returning skin function to normal.

While ARCI affects relatively few people, the researchers say the treatment strategy could be adapted to many other genetic skin diseases, including epidermolysis bullosa-a severe skin blistering condition often called 'butterfly skin'-and potentially more common conditions such as eczema or psoriasis.

"The approach we developed is a platform technology," said Dr. Hedtrich. "It can be readily adapted to treat almost any skin disease."

Despite major advances in gene editing, applying the technology to skin diseases has remained a long-standing challenge. The skin's primary role is to protect the body from the outside world, making it difficult to deliver large biological therapies, such as gene editors, past its protective barrier.

To overcome this, the team developed a novel delivery method that uses lipid nanoparticle technology, or LNPs. These microscopic "bubbles of fat," pioneered by UBC professor Dr. Pieter Cullis and brought to global prominence through mRNA vaccines, are able to carry gene-editing technology into cells.

Using a clinically approved laser, the researchers first create microscopic, pain-free openings in the outer layers of the skin. This allows the lipid nanoparticles to pass through the skin barrier and reach skin stem cells beneath the surface. Once inside, the gene editor corrects the underlying DNA mutation, enabling the skin to begin functioning more normally.

"This is a highly targeted, localized approach," said Dr. Hedtrich. "The treatment stays in the skin and we saw no evidence of off-target effects, which is a critical safety milestone."

The study was conducted in close collaboration with Vancouver-based biotech company NanoVation Therapeutics, a UBC spin-off focused on developing LNP-based genetic medicines. The researchers now hope to bring the treatment into clinical testing and have already been working with regulatory authorities to define the necessary safety and efficacy studies.

"Our goal now is to take this from the lab into first-in-human clinical trials," said Dr. Hedtrich. "We hope this work will ultimately lead to a safe, effective treatment that can transform the lives of patients who currently have no real therapeutic options."

Older women who have a history of both depression and anxiety had a 78% higher risk of developing long COVID after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, report University of California San Diego researchers in the Jan. 27, 2026 online edition of the journal Menopause.

Some people have only anxiety. Some have only depression. When these conditions occur together, they usually indicate more severe mental illness."

Wael Al-Delaimy, MD, PhD, senior author, professor at the Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science, UC San Diego

"In this study, we measured the health of women over 20 years by analyzing data from the Women's Health Initiative. We found that older women with a combined history of both depression and anxiety, before the COVID-19 pandemic, were at the highest risk of long COVID complications."

Long COVID is a chronic condition in which people experience persistent symptoms that last three months or more after the initial infection.

People experiencing mental health illnesses are vulnerable to other diseases and may have trouble following public health guidelines.

"We hope that by characterizing these mental health risk factors public health officials and policymakers can target preventative measures to those with the greatest need," said co-author William Bruno, MD, MPH, associate physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the UC San Diego School of Medicine.

In addition, the community should stay vigilant and care for people who may be dealing with loneliness, isolation or existing mental illness should another pandemic or other isolating event occur, said Al-Delaimy.

The federally funded Women's Health Initiative is a long-term national study that began in the early 1990s, focusing on the health of postmenopausal women in the United States. The third extension of the study (2020-2027) included COVID-19 surveys. The average participant was 83 years old, and 414 participants met the criteria for long COVID.

Additional co-authors include: Aladdin H. Shadyab, UC San Diego; Nazmus Saquib, Sulaiman Alrajhi University; and Joseph S. Goveas, Medical College of Wisconsin.

The Women's Health Initiative program is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health and United States Department of Health and Human Services (75N92021D00001, 75N92021D00002, 75N92021D00003, 75N92021D00004, and 75N92021D00005).

A Purdue University team led by Kyle Cottrell has discovered a new therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer.

Triple-negative breast cancer is a particularly deadly form of breast cancer that currently lacks targeted therapies."

Kyle Cottrell, assistant professor of biochemistry, Purdue University

Cottrell, biochemistry graduate student Addison Young and their co-authors describe the discovery in the journal RNA.

The laboratory research spotlights double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA)-binding proteins. "Generally, people are taught in high school biology that RNA is single-stranded. That's not entirely true," Cottrell noted. Human cells contain many double-stranded segments of RNA, as do viruses.

"We have proteins that can recognize those double-stranded RNAs," Cottrell said. When cells detect that they've been infected with a virus, "they activate various pathways to stop the viral infection." But these dsRNA-sensing pathways present a problem when they are activated in the absence of a viral infection. "They have to be kept at bay most of the time. We don't have a great understanding of how that works."

RNA is a molecule that plays key roles in cellular and viral processes, including protein formation. DsRNA-binding proteins and dsRNAs in human cells attract keen biomedical scientific interest because of their many connections to autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders, Cottrell said. They have even been implicated in the aging process.

"As you age, your cells lose the ability to block some of these sensing pathways. They start activating dsRNA sensing pathways and cause inflammation."

Viral mimicry has helped fuel increased research interest in the role of dsRNA-binding proteins in cancer. When cells activate viral mimicry, they look as if they've been infected with a virus. The process creates a cellular state that has helped some new cancer immunotherapies to work better, Cottrell said.

In this latest work, Cottrell's team tracked the activity of a dsRNA-binding protein called PACT, for protein activator of interferon-induced protein kinase. This work and studies published this year by two other groups show that PACT suppresses another protein called RNA-activated protein kinase, or PKR.

Previously conflicting findings led to a controversy over PACT's role in PKR regulation. "Our evidence goes to the side that it's been a suppressor, not an activator," Cottrell said, which more firmly established that as PACT's role in triple-negative breast cancer.

"PKR is a double-stranded RNA sensor. It's a protein that exists in all of your cells and can detect when a cell is infected with a virus. It does that by sensing the double-stranded RNAs that come from the virus."

The RNA paper builds on previous work from Cottrell's group regarding two other proteins that act much like PACT. "They are suppressors of double-stranded RNA sensing. Their job is to block activation of double-stranded RNA sensors like PKR," Cottrell said.

The team identified both PACT's role in triple-negative breast cancer and the proteins that play similar roles because they all might serve as viable therapeutic targets.

Some cell lines depend on PACT while others don't. The researchers used the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 to remove PACT from the cells to see which pathways became activated or not.

"Cells can look a certain way because they're infected with a virus. They can activate certain pathways because they're infected with the virus to help fight that off. Or we can mimic that by changing something in the cells. We did that here," Cottrell said.

"Triple-negative breast cancer in particular seems to be quite sensitive to depletion of PACT, so it might be one of the better cancers to target for it. But there are definitely opportunities in other cancer types," Cottrell noted. The disease could especially benefit from target-specific therapies to replace chemotherapies that broadly hit all dividing cells, healthy and diseased alike. "You get terrible side effects with those."

The paper also highlights the importance of dimerization, the fusion of two separate molecules, called monomers, to regulate protein activity. Therapeutic targets for cancer and many other diseases are often enzymes - proteins that speed up chemical reactions. But PACT isn't an enzyme. Consequently, drug designers cannot inhibit its function by blocking its activity.

"We have to come up with some other way to prevent it from functioning. We found that PACT is a dimer. Two monomers of PACT come together, and if they don't dimerize, then it can't function. So, if you could block the dimerization, then you could inhibit its function in cells."

Cottrell plans to probe the unknown details of how dimerized PACT inhibits PKR. He would like to find a molecule that inhibits PACT dimerization as a therapeutic. "We're working toward that now," he said. "But beyond that, there are basic science questions on how the cell prevents activation of PKR or other double-stranded RNA sensors."

This work is part of Purdue's One Health initiative, which brings together research on human, animal and plant health, and was supported by the Ralph W. and Grace M. Showalter Research Trust Award, the National Institutes of Health, the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research, and the Department of Biochemistry in Purdue's College of Agriculture.

The City of Los Angeles has announced its first official hospitality house for the highly anticipated 2026 FIFA World Cup.

This summer, LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes will serve as Mexico's Hospitality House, which will also be known as Casa México — a community-centered hub uniting soccer aficionados through the rich cultural traditions of Mexico — launched in partnership with the Mexican Consulate General.

“It made perfect sense,”  said Leticia Rhi Buckley, CEO of LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, of when she was first approached with the idea from the Mexican Consulate General.

“We were really excited to explore how we could put forward the kind of programming that we do every day under this banner and ensure that communities like ours are part of these big global events happening in our city,” she added.

A total of 104 matches will take place across the United States, Canada and Mexico. This is the first time that the FIFA World Cup will be held in the U.S. in over 30 years, with eight games taking place in Los Angeles.

Mexico will kick off the competition with a match against South Africa in Mexico City on June 11.

Throughout the tournament, which will conclude on July 19, Casa México will offer free programming for fans, including live watch parties of the Mexican National Team, courtesy of its official media partner Telemundo 52 / KVEA, which is also the exclusive Spanish-language network airing the FIFA World Cup.

Earlier this week, Mayor Karen Bass welcomed the partnership during a press conference.

“There is no better place to bring people together than [Los Angeles], honoring our past with pride while also looking ahead to the future — inspiring the next generation of athletes, supporting an economic boost that will continue to benefit Angelenos and uplifting the millions of Mexican Americans that call L.A. home,” said Mayor Bass in a press release statement.

LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes is already thinking of ways to incorporate its current programming into the Casa México experience, including the popular Summer of Salsa concert series — which takes place one Friday a month during the summer — as well as film screenings, family days and temporary exhibits relating to the beloved sport and the community.

“This is our 15-year anniversary. What better way to celebrate the last 15 years and the legacy of the foundation with something like Casa México as we look towards the future of the organization,” said Rhi Buckley.

The downtown hub, located by Olvera Plaza, estimates over 20,000 visitors between June 11 and July 19, despite community fears over ICE enforcement decimating foot traffic in Los Angeles.

Last week, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to bar immigration enforcement officers from county-owned spaces, which would protect spaces like the LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes from the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown.

“We've had safety plans in place for a long time,” says Rhi Buckley about protecting patrons from immigration enforcement. “You can't be an institution like ours under this current government at the federal level and not be prepared to have plans in place.”

As excitement for the World Cup intensifies in the coming months, Rhi Buckley hopes visitors and soccer fans can celebrate the richness of this city and its Mexican influence at LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, which proudly champions Mexican culture through its corridors.

“This region, this country was built by us and by people like us,” said Rhi Buckley, “I hope people come to experience joy and connection, and recognize how much we have in common.”

What is the Women's Champions Cup? Teams involved in new FIFA competition and how new format works originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.

FIFA has continued to expand its competitions on offer, across both men's and women's football, to give fans more and more to consume.

While the football governing body expanded the Club World Cup to 32 participants, dragging it out to once every four years instead of annually, a similar step has been taken on the women's side.

The expansion and explosion of women's football has seen FIFA create a separate competition to crown a global club champion across the entirety of world football.

The Sporting News details where this competition came from, how it works, and who will be involved for the inaugural edition of the Women's Champions Cup.

FIFA created the Women's Champions Cup to bring together continental title winners from around the world to face off in a seven-team tournament.

Much like the old format of the Club World Cup on the men's side, the seven club champions from the latest continental tournaments are brought together to square off in a bracket-style competition.

Contestants from the three biggest confederations in women's football (UEFA, CONCACAF, and CONMEBOL) enter in the semifinals, whereas the other four participants play earlier rounds to determine the fourth semifinalist.

The first edition of the competition is taking place in 2026, with the semifinals and final held in London.

The Women's Champions Cup will be held annually, with the inagural edition concluding in London between January 28 and February 1, 2026.

The earlier rounds will be played during prior international windows, with the first round in October of the previous year and the second round in December.

Chelsea have confirmed that Raheem Sterling has left the club by "mutual agreement" as he seeks a new club in January. The Blues' misfit has finally departed Stamford Bridge, with his last competitive appearance for the club coming in May of 2024.

Chelsea have confirmed that they have reached an agreement with Sterling for the winger to leave the club, as he looks to find pastures new in which to continue his career. 

The club said in a statement: "Raheem Sterling has today departed Chelsea Football Club by mutual agreement, bringing to an end three-and-a-half seasons as our player, having signed in the summer of 2022 when he was transferred from Manchester City.

"We thank Raheem for the contribution he made while a Chelsea player and wish him well for the next stage in his career."

It is a far cry from the excitement showed by manager Thomas Tuchel when he was signed in 2022. At the time, the now-England boss said: "It was the number one priority and we are very excited and super happy that we could make it happen. He's a big improvement to our squad and is exactly what we were looking for in terms of age, experience, and style of play.

"Once the players arrive these days in a situation where they only have one year [left on their] contract, there's always room for negotiation and possibility. We went for it. We could convince him very quickly. He was convinced, he did everything that was needed to do, we gave our best to make it happen. It's a perfect fit.

"He gives us a lot of flexibility, mobility and attacking options at the front."

Sterling was demoted to the "bomb squad" by manager Enzo Maresca before the Italian's exit, with the ex-England winger falling down the pecking order in remarkable fashion. He was loaned to Arsenal in the 2024-25 season but failed to make any sort of impact in north London and returned to Stamford Bridge in the summer, despite him leaving for no loan fee at all.  He has not featured at all this season, however, and will now seek a new club.

Manager Liam Rosenior gave an update on the winger's future after taking the job, telling reporters: "I've said what I've had to say on Raheem. He's a player I have massive respect for. Huge respect for as a person and what he's achieved in the game. Now is not the right time to speak about his situation."

Per The Athletic, Sterling has been training away from the first team throughout the campaign, despite the fact that he is on a massive contract worth more than £300,000 per week. Maresca was particularly blunt when asked about the forward's situation while he was still in the dugout.

He said:  “My father is 75 years old and for 50 years he has been a fisherman, working from two o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock in the morning,” Maresca said. “This is sad in life – not a player and the way that they work.

“I've been in Raheem's situation and Axel's situation as a player and for sure I know that it's not the best feeling for a player because you want to train and play and then, for a different reason, the situation is the situation. I know that the club is giving them the opportunity to work in the right way and this is the only thing I can say.

“It's not just Chelsea, it's any club in the world, I can promise you. Italy, Spain, England, France, USA, Brazil, any club in the world … when, for any reason, the player and the club doesn't find any solution and you give the player all the tools to do training sessions and do everything. But if you are not involved in the squad, you are not involved in the squad.”

Per The Guardian, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) investigated claims Sterling was being made to train at 8pm, a time that is far from ideal for a father of four.

Sterling will hope to find a new club quickly, although it is unclear what kind of financial demands he will bring with him. Following the announcement of his exit, he wrote on Instagram: "All eyes on the future. God is great."

Midfielder speaks out on politics before World Cup

Goretzka open to summer move to England from Bayern

The Germany international Leon Goretzka has said Donald Trump's actions have left him feeling “not only German but also European”. The US president has recently threatened to take Greenland by force and called Europe “weak” and “decaying”.

Goretzka, who hopes to make the Germany squad for the World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico this summer, told Die Zeit: “Of course, I'm aware of the political debates. I still expect it to be a great tournament – it will promote football there, and show many people want an incredibly exciting game. Donald Trump makes us feel not only German but also European.”

The Bayern Munich midfielder is convinced Europe can show where the power lies on the pitch in June and July. “In the most important game in the world, we are still ahead of all other continents,” he said. “Far from being left behind, Europe will show everyone what it's made of on the pitch.”

Trump lashed out at Europe in December, threatening to stop supporting Ukraine and also saying: “If it keeps going the way it's going, Europe will not be … in my opinion … many of those countries will not be viable countries any longer. Their immigration policy is a disaster.” In January, he threatened to annex Greenland and said in Davos last week that he would not use force. “All the US is asking for is a place called Greenland,” he said. “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember.”

The 30-year-old Goretzka has previously spoken out on racism, diversity and the climate crisis, but has become more careful in his public statements in recent years. “When you speak out as a sportsperson you take a risk,” he said. “You have to be winning, otherwise these commitments count against you, are deliberately misunderstood or misquoted.”

Germany face Curaçao in Houston, Côte d'Ivoire in Toronto and Ecuador in New Jersey in the World Cup group stage. Goretzka is back in the team after the coach, Julian Nagelsmann, dropped him for Euro 2024 on home soil. “A discussion [with the coach] was necessary, it was the basis for further cooperation,” he said. “I don't need to mention how hard that missed opportunity hit me.”

The former Schalke player has six months on his Bayern contract and is considering a move abroad, having only ever played in Germany. “It would be exciting to go abroad during my career,” he said. “I'm in my comfort zone in Munich. Taking a step out of that would also be a step towards my personal development. Getting to know something new would enrich my life.”

The Premier League could be an option, he says: “There are a lot of people who think my style of football would be a very good fit for England. I will listen to everything and weigh it up carefully. I am looking forward to the talks.” Goretzka is not ruling out staying in Munich, having regained his place under Vincent Kompany.

Our soccer expert offers his Monaco vs Juventus predictions, ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash, at 3:00pm ET (1/28).

Monaco need a positive result to secure a place in the knockout playoffs. Hence, there is a lot riding on Tuesday night's encounter.

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change.

With three successive UCL wins and an impressive 3-0 Serie A win over defending champions Napoli on Sunday, Juventus are in great shape. Although the Scudetto may be out of reach, they are strong contenders for a top-four finish once again.

Juventus can play without pressure on the French Riviera this week. Their top-24 place is already assured, but a positive outcome could tip the scales further in their favour. If results go their way, a top-eight finish remains a possibility.

They've won their last two meetings against Monaco in the UCL. However, these matches were eight years ago and lack significant relevance. At a probability of just 46.51%, Spalletti's Old Lady are worth backing. Monaco could crack under the pressure of playoff qualification.

Juventus have scored first in eight of their last ten competitive matches. Monaco are winless in their last three games, and Juve are able to play risk-free football on Tuesday. That's why we're backing the Italians to break the deadlock here.

The betting markets give them a 57.14% chance of scoring first against the Monegasques. Monaco currently sit tenth in the French Ligue 1, averaging just 0.50 points per game from their last eight matches. This form suggests they're unlikely to start the game strongly.

The opposition has scored first in 60% of Monaco's home games in Ligue 1 this season. Juve have only failed to score in 14% of their UCL games in 25/26, which only strengthens our case further.

Monaco have conceded an average of two goals per game in this season's UCL league phase. Meanwhile, Juventus score two per game. I Bianconeri concede 1.43 goals per game, so there's every chance the Monegasques could get on the scoresheet.

Five of the last six competitive games involving Monaco have featured three or more goals. With Juventus aware that only a win will do to push for the top eight, we expect an open encounter. Monaco may be happy to settle for a draw, but if Juve score first – and early – they will be forced to open up too.

Almost three-fifths (57%) of Monaco's UCL games this season have featured four or more goals. Yet, the betting markets believe there is only a 57.14% chance of three goals being scored on Tuesday night. With Juventus likely to be the assertive force, this seems to be the value play from our trio of Monaco vs Juventus predictions.

Tuesday night's clash marks the eighth and final UCL league-phase game for Monaco and Juventus, with plenty at stake.

Monaco currently sit 21st in the table, just one point and three places above the cut-off for the knockout playoffs. The French side have a -6 goal difference, which could count against them if multiple teams finish the campaign on nine points. A draw could be enough for them, but a win would be a better way to seal the deal.

Scoring goals has been their biggest issue, with just eight scored in seven UCL matches this season. They've also kept a clean sheet in just 25% of their previous meetings with Juve. Their domestic form at home has been less than impressive too. They've lost their last two Ligue 1 home games by the same 3-1 scoreline.

Juventus are in 15thplace in the UCL league phase table, yet they could still clinch a top-eight finish. This would secure immediate qualification to the last 16 knockout stage.

They've lost just one of their opening seven league-phase matches. With qualification to the knockout playoffs already secure, they can approach this game with minimal pressure. The Italians have won their last three league-phase games on the bounce and are also in good domestic form. Juve have averaged 2.38 points per game in their last eight Serie A matches.

AS Monaco expected lineup: Kohn, Henrique, Ouattara, Kehrer, Faes, Zakaria, Camara, Golovin, Akliouche, Ilenikhena, Balogun

Juventus expected lineup: Di Gregorio, Kalulu, Kelly, Bremer, McKennie, Cambiaso, Thuram-Ulien, Locatelli, Conceicao, Yildiz, David

Three Aston Villa vs Salzburg predictions for their Europa League clash on Thursday night, including value on a goalscorer bet.

Our betting expert expects Aston Villa to make a play for top spot and win their final game, knocking Salzburg out of the competition.

Aston Villa have already qualified for the next stage of the Europa League, but there is still a chance for the hosts to top the league standings. After their devastating home loss against Everton in the league, it appeared that Villa were all but out of the Premier League race.

However, they were incredibly impressive at St James' Park last weekend, securing a 2-0 victory. Consequently, the Villains are only four points behind league leaders Arsenal and have a chance to win the title.

With the club already into the next round of this competition, Emery may rotate his team for the final matchday. It's still uncertain which team he will field, but the home side will surely aim to end the league phase strongly. Given the high stakes of the game, many fans are looking for the Best Football Betting Sites to find the most competitive odds.

Salzburg are hoping to join Villa in the knockout stage of the Europa League, but they're on the other end of the table. The Austrian side are 28th ahead of this round and must win this last fixture to have any chance of qualification.

Still, even with three points, Thomas Letsch's men must rely on other results to help them reach the top 24. Their victory against Basel last week should inspire some confidence ahead of this match, so they are expected to play without fear.

Aston Villa expected lineup: Bizot, Garcia, Mings, Lindelof, Digne, Onana, Bogarde, Guessand, Buendia, Bailey, Watkins

Salzburg expected lineup: Schlager, Trummer, Gadou, Schuster, Kratzig, Diabate, Bidstrup, Baidoo, Kitano, Alajbegovic, Vertessen

Having suffered a home league defeat to Everton, Villa have started to gain momentum again. This competition has been excellent for them, as they've won four consecutive matches and lost only one of their seven games in the league phase.

Furthermore, the hosts have won six consecutive European games at Villa Park, and they won't pass up the opportunity to extend it to seven. The visitors are in good form as well, having two games in a row ahead of this meeting.

In contrast to Villa, Salzburg have also had a full week to rest, but they've not been at their best in this competition. Die Roten Bullen lost five of their opening Europa League matches this term, and they've lost their last five consecutive away fixtures in Europe.

While these teams have never played against each other, Salzburg have some experience against English opposition. The Austrian team have never beaten such opponents in a major European competition across eight attempts, losing six of them.

The visitors have struggled to find the back of the net in this competition. They managed only eight goals across their seven Europa League fixtures. Away from home, Salzburg scored one goal across three matches, highlighting their lack of efficiency in the final third.

The travelling team failed to score in three of their seven games in this competition, so the hosts may keep a clean sheet. The Villains have conceded just four goals across their seven matches, with an average of 0.58 goals per game. For fans looking to back this solid defensive record, completing the 1xBet Registration process offers access to a wide range of markets for this fixture.

Emery's troops have already kept four clean sheets in this competition, and they're likely to register another in this match. It's worth noting that only one of the last five matches saw both teams score.

Emiliano Buendia has been in decent form recently. His previous six strikes for Aston Villa have served as the opening goal, including his most recent one at Newcastle last weekend.

He has recorded three goal involvements in his last four matches, including two goals. Buendia's overall season statistics are lower because Unai Emery has not consistently selected him as a starter. However, he is currently benefiting from a regular sequence of games.

With Emery expected to rotate his squad, he should rest Morgan Rogers, which would leave Buendia to play in the 10. This change could lead to him having a greater impact on the game, including the possibility of scoring.

Canada Soccer's long-running on-again, off-again courtship is finally coming to a close.

Multiple sources have confirmed that highly-touted attacking midfielder and dual-national Marcelo Flores, 22, is in the process of completing his FIFA one-time switch from Mexico to Canada. The Athletic reported in October that Flores was initially being courted by Canada, while TSN was the first to report he would complete his allegiance change.

After serving as a training player in Canada's November camp, it is likely Flores begins his tenure in an official capacity with a call into camp in March, the last one before send-off matches in the lead-up to the World Cup kicking off in June.

John Lobban, Canada's men's national-team communications manager, provided the following statement to The Athletic: “Decisions around international representation, including any change of association, are personal matters for players and are governed by FIFA's eligibility regulations. Until all required steps are completed and approved, Canada Soccer will not speculate, or provide confirmation, on individual player eligibility.”

Nevertheless, Flores is poised to become the highest-profile addition to the Canadian squad ahead of the World Cup, which the country is co-hosting in June and July along with the United States and Mexico. It's likely his is the final name outside the current player pool to be added to the mix, capping a dual-national recruiting run under manager Jesse Marsch that has yielded the likes of Niko Sigur, Promise David, Alfie Jones, Daniel Jebbison and Owen Goodman.

Flores comes with a bit more baggage than the rest, though. The dynamic attacking player was born in Canada but held Mexican eligibility through his father, Rubén, a former professional. The younger Flores came up through the Ipswich Town and Arsenal youth academies in England. In 2023, he moved from Arsenal to Tigres UANL in Liga MX, Mexican soccer's top division. Playing time has not come regularly for Flores since, but that didn't discourage Canada Soccer from re-opening a file once thought to be closed.

Flores was originally courted by Canada four years ago under then-manager John Herdman, who put on a full-court press to woo him and even name-dropped him after a 2-0 win over the U.S. in a January 2022 World Cup qualifier. “I'm sure you've got players like young Marcelo Flores (who) might be looking after this game and wondering whether he wants to play for Mexico or Canada,” Herdman said at the time.

Yet months later, Flores chose to represent Mexico in a move that left some in the Canadian soccer community burned and could still cause some consternation over his present-day choice. “Despite the ability to represent several countries, I have always been a part of the Mexican national team system,” Flores said in a May 2022 social media post. “It's where I feel most comfortable.”

Herdman later expressed frustration at being strung along – it's believed that Rubén was instrumental in his son's decision to choose Mexico – but Flores' nine minutes in a June 2022 Concacaf Nations League game against Suriname were his last in three appearances for El Tri. He no longer factors into Mexico's plans, which undoubtedly influenced his decision four years later, all while he remains eligible for Canada due to FIFA's regulations.

As for why Marsch and Canada Soccer brought Flores back into the fold, it reveals plenty about their World Cup ambitions and belief in the player.

On the field, the coaching staff values how different Flores is from the rest of the roster. Come the World Cup's group stage, Canada wants to be able to break down the likes of Switzerland and potentially Italy, the latter pending the UEFA playoffs in March, in different ways. Flores' combination of pace and technical qualities on the ball means he can move from a wide spot to a more central one with ease. That flexibility is valued.

The likelihood is that a resurgent Ismaël Koné is Canada's starting advanced midfielder when the cohosts begin World Cup group play on June 12 against one of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy, Northern Ireland and Wales in Toronto, his backup has felt like a question mark. Sigur could find himself at right back, and while Jonathan Osorio is important to Canada's midfield, it's more as an intelligent, deep-lying player who can kill off a game with his soccer IQ.

Enter Flores and that versatility. Yes, his preferred position is on the left and makes an already crowded spot now more akin to a clown car. Alphonso Davies, Ali Ahmed, Liam Millar, Jayden Nelson, Jacob Shaffelburg and now Flores could all be in contention for two or three spots on that side.

Through Canada's November camp, Flores looked comfortable and upbeat as a training player, and the staff found him to be positive and coachable. Marsch never pressed him. He showed Flores where he might fit within the team, and the player liked what he saw. There was a maturity in Flores' approach that might not have been present years earlier. Coaches saw a player who could be dropped into the national-team environment just before the World Cup and hit the ground running, who also has a top motor and an element of physicality. He could even be an option to start.

His club playing time might not suggest as such, but Flores did have a two-goal showing in a Liga MX Clausura start vs. San Luis earlier this month, and Canada's coaching staff finds his finishing abilities intriguing. It's no secret Canada struggled to score at times late in 2025.

Marsch's successful play to land Flores suggests a few more things as well.

Most importantly, the past is just that. The drama that initially surrounded Flores was before Marsch's time. The manager is not interested in years-old hurt feelings if it means bolstering his World Cup roster. Herdman valued and rewarded loyalty in his squad selections. Marsch values talent and development possibilities.

When Herdman brought a trusted but aging squad to the previous World Cup in 2022, his bench was limited and Canada lacked dynamic players who could break down the likes of Belgium and Croatia in the group stage. Marsch, conversely, wants a deep and varied bench. And so it should come as no surprise now that, from within Canada's setup, Flores is being looked at as a genuine possibility to make the World Cup.

Marsch's outlook on roster-building will inform part of that decision. Canada wants to play aggressive and pacy soccer against teams that like to have the ball. Marsch is going to put excruciating physical demands on his players to uphold his Red Bull-influenced style. That will begin with an intense training camp in the south of the U.S. in May to get his players acclimated to the heat they may encounter this summer.

Couple that with an unrelenting demand to play front-foot soccer, and you can begin to understand why Marsch isn't afraid to roll the dice on an untested younger player — potentially at the expense of an experienced and older one who may struggle with those demands and require added time off to recover between games.

Marsch has reason to believe he can accelerate Flores' development in a short amount of time. The coach has been adamant that players can be developed at the national-team level, not just at their clubs, and the ascent we've seen at different times with younger Canadians such as Ahmed and Shaffelburg suggests his belief is a strong one.

Fast-forwarding to March, the circumstances surrounding what should be Flores' first full Canada camp could not be more optimal for his development. There will be two games in the team's most familiar surroundings: Toronto. There will be minimal travel, compared to friendlies in Europe. There will be a multi-day camp before those friendlies against Iceland and Tunisia to get Flores up to speed on the team's tactical approach.

That's when Flores will likely officially wear a Canada jersey for the first time, and if he looks up to the task, then that lengthy courtship – which some may characterize as a gamble this late in the process – could wind up yielding the cohosts a genuine World Cup wild card.

Retirement can mean different things to different people – more time with family, the flexibility to pursue a new passion or simply a chance to breathe and take a rest.

For Christen Press, it means someplace on the other side of the globe.

“Japan,” she said assuredly. “I've had that feeling that Japan's calling me, the culture is calling me, and that there's something for me to learn over there.”

A three-week trip to Japan symbolizes what's next for the former USWNT and Angel City FC star who announced her retirement from professional soccer last fall. Press was honored on Jan. 24 before the USWNT took on Paraguay at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, Calif., just a short drive from her hometown in Palos Verdes Estates. She also recently discussed some of her career highlights (including a memorable interaction with Neymar) with World Cup winner and former teammate Meghan Klingenberg on this week's episode of the U.S. Soccer Podcast.

After spending 33 years of her life devoted to the sport, Press is embracing a newfound freedom. For the first time in her life, Press says, her schedule is her own, and she decides what comes first. That includes preparing for a trip that she's left partly unplanned so she can wind her way through an unknown country, experience a fine culture, and develop a trip organically to make it feel special and memorable.

“To retire in your 30s gives you this second half of life, a second chance to really decide, with time, intention and integrity what you want to do with your life,” she said. “I am looking forward to that.”

The nine years Press spent with the U.S. Women's National Team were filled with overwhelmingly joyful moments and unimaginable loss. After a storied career at Stanford University, where she remains the all-time leading goal scorer in program history, Press broke onto the international scene in 2013. She earned her first cap on Feb. 9 in an international friendly against Scotland. In that game, she scored twice, becoming one of just 25 players to record a goal in her debut, forecasting beautifully both the commitment to excellence and goal-scoring ability she'd become known for as a U.S. Women's National Team mainstay.

From there, Press would go on to be a part of several winning teams, including the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cups, and add her name to the record books as one of the all-time great goal scorers. She concluded her career with the U.S. Women's National Team with 155 caps and 64 goals, which ranks ninth in program history.





As a creative and quality finisher, there are plenty of Press goals to choose from for the highlight reel. Her golazo against England in the 2020 SheBelieves Cup produced “Christen Press! What have you done?!” from broadcaster Sebastian Salazar, one of the most electric calls in the history of U.S. women's soccer. Salazar repeated the call soon after to a similar degree when Press chipped in another incredible goal against Japan in the same tournament.

Though, Press' choice of a standout moment wasn't in a major tournament – it's from a friendly in Spain during the lead-up to the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. With the support of head coach Jill Ellis, Press was invited to the January trip to Europe, which, Press recalls, was not exactly common for a player who had missed a few of the previous camps.

At first, Press didn't want to go. Her mother, Stacy, had been diagnosed with stage IV glioblastoma and suffered a stroke that left her partially paralyzed. Press wanted to stay home and be near her family. But soccer meant a lot to them – Press and her two sisters played, and Stacy even coached them as youth players – so Stacy encouraged her daughter to go abroad with the team.

From a blurry stream on their iPad, Press' parents watched as their daughter scored what Press refers to as a “God goal,” because of the way it unfolded – the goal wasn't presented to her but had to be the way, she says. Press dribbled the ball from midfield on her own, and in a transcendent flash, found a new gear to sprint past the Spanish defense and slot home a left-footed shot. It was the only goal of the night as the USA won the game, 1-0. 

But Press' finish meant much more than a win – it was a goal that she and her family would deeply treasure for a different reason.

“Soccer can be very spiritual,” Press said. “Those out-of-body experiences that you have where you know the game means more than a game. It was the last goal that my mom got to see me score. She never saw us win that 2019 World Cup. She wasn't in the stands when I scored that header against England. That was the last goal that she saw me score.”

Sadly, soon after seeing her daughter score that goal against Spain, Stacy passed away. In a heartfelt tribute in Sports Illustrated written by the late Grant Wahl, Press's father, Cody, explains what it was like in the following months, grieving a devastating loss while watching Press play a pivotal role in helping the U.S. Women's National Team capture the FIFA 2019 Women's World Cup. The soccer world might know her best for the immaculate header she scored against England off service from fullback Kelley O'Hara in the semifinal – Stacy played a role in that goal too as Press paid tribute to her mom by extending her gaze and hands lovingly toward the sky – but that goal earlier in the year against Spain encapsulates a much more fuller picture of Press' whole journey.

“It's the moment that symbolizes, to me, all that my career was,” Press said. “It wasn't just me. It was my whole family, my whole community lifting me up in moments. That experience of going to that camp, being there and doing it for someone else, then losing that person really shows the power of what integrating football into a life really means.”

A post shared by Christen Press (@christenpress)

Press is part of a special group of Women's National Team players who have retired in the past several years including Megan Rapinoe, Becky Sauerbrunn, Alex Morgan and Klingenberg, among others.

These players, including Press, were on the forefront in the quest for equal pay, using their voices and positions to advocate for better compensation, which led to a settlement with U.S. Soccer in May 2022. The achievement of equal pay with the USMNT encouraged larger conversations regarding equity for female athletes. 

“I'm really, really proud of that,” Press said. “I feel like I was a part of a generation that pushed things forward, that prioritized our value and the value of future athletes.”

Reflecting on the beginnings of her own professional career when she played club soccer in Sweden and at Benedictine College outside of Chicago with the Chicago Red Stars, Press notes the amount of progress between then and now is “incomprehensible.” Even then, there weren't many opportunities for women to play soccer at a livable wage apart from making it through the pathway to the senior Women's National Team.

“The game's better, faster, more evolved,” she said. “The quality of life for athletes is sky high. The respect, the pay and the visibility is astronomically different.” 

Those types of conversations continue to this day, but it's clear that things have improved from where they were as recently as 10-20 years ago. More women have platforms, soccer players like current USWNT forward Trinity Rodman are signing multi-million-dollar deals, women's sports are more visible on television and breaking records for viewership.

People are also talking and learning more about how to treat female athletes. Press explained it's about the value of seeing women not as small versions of men, but as women who deserve their own considerations. This reimagining of culture and focus on the female athlete is on theme with leaders in the sport including current USWNT head coach Emma Hayes and U.S. Soccer investor and Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang.

“Women's sports is not a lesser version of men's,” Press said. “It's unique and it's different. Once we can start to look at what makes a woman's body, women's sports, and the women's sports community unique, and start to design and build systems and processes for that uniqueness, everybody's going to win.”

That thought is what will guide Press as she moves into the next stage of life. She plans to focus on her business RE, a global sports media brand that seeks to improve the world through the unifying power of sport. The platform is champion-led behind two of its founders: Press and her wife, two-time World Cup winner and four-time Olympian Tobin Heath, who last summer also announced her retirement from professional soccer. 

The pair founded the company in 2019. Their mission statement based on what they call “Gal Culture” and the idea of challenging the status quo to give women's sports a brighter spotlight.

“I really see it as a vessel where Tobin and I get to do whatever we want with it,” Press said. “We're doing our podcast, designing clothes, we've built a community. Those things are really meaningful to me. They keep me connected to the game in a new way.”

Press and Heath's award-winning podcast, the RE-CAP Show, is listed as the No. 1 most popular soccer podcast on Apple Podcasts and the No. 3 most popular sports podcast on Spotify. It provides a platform for important conversations to continue, and with Press and Heath serving as hosts, they can discuss these topics and feature guests who offer insight.

For someone as thoughtful, wise and devoted as Press is, it's clear that she has set up a platform that will allow her to use her voice, inspire excellence and build community for years to come. 

“I believe that we channel and vessel that energy from a larger group of people, and that's what allows us to be excellent,” she said. “I don't know what my next vessel will be exactly, but I do know that soccer has given me so many lessons on how to work together, how to achieve, how to love and how to lose, and those are all things that I want to take into the next chapter.”

Liverpool have been told to consider a stunning move to sign Harry Maguire from Manchester United this summer. The defender's current deal expires in the summer and United have yet to open talks over an extension, with Dietmar Hamann urging the Reds to weigh up what would be a sensational free transfer. 

Hamann has urged Liverpool to consider Maguire as they bid to strengthen their backline this summer. United have yet to open talks with the defender, who has recently impressed against both Manchester City and Arsenal under the management of interim boss Michael Carrick. As Hamann believes that Liverpool need greater depth in defence, he has told them to explore a potential swoop to bring Maguire to Anfield.

He told CasinoBeats: "You've got to give it to Harry Maguire because he got so much stick in the last few years and he always comes back. If he's available on a free then obviously have to think about it because I think what Liverpool need is more depth at the back.

"Joe Gomez has been around the squad for a long time but he's never really been a starter for the team. Connor Bradley is out now through injury. We'll have to see how it affects him when he comes back."

"I think Liverpool need depth in the right-back position too. Frimpong is not a right-back. I think he gets away with playing there sometimes but he's not a right-back. I think they need a couple of players at the back."

A deal to sign Maguire would not involve any actual negotiations with United, as they would surely wait for his contract to expire before engaging in talks, were they to do so at all. Hamann has also recommended two more conventional targets: Borussia Dortmund defender Nico Shlotterbeck and Tottenham Hotspur's Micky van de Ven.

He added: "Micky van de Ven is doing really well for Spurs and there's a player at Dortmund, Nico Schlotterbeck. He's in talks with the club on whether he's going to extend his contract.

"Schlotterbeck has really taken on a leading role at Dortmund in the last 18 months. He is probably our best centre-back in the national team. He'll certainly play at the World Cup for Germany.

"He'd be a player. He's got one year left on the contract. I'm sure that Liverpool inquired about him. He wouldn't be the worst choice. He's a left-footed player as well."

Liverpool have struggled this season to keep the goals out; they have conceded 32 in 21 Premier League games; last season, in its entirety, they conceded 41. The Reds are now having to target a top-four finish instead of a title challenge, as they sit sixth, two points behind Manchester United in fourth and 14 behind Arsenal at the summit. 

Ex-Reds defender Jamie Carragher has previously claimed that Slot will lose his job if they don't qualify for the Champions League.

He told Sky Sports: "If you don't qualify for the Champions League, having won the league the season before and spent as much as Liverpool, I don't think you've got a leg to stand on.

"The real worry I have for Liverpool in terms of qualifying for the Champions League is the three big things that stand out in the Premier League now are set-pieces, counter-attacking football and coming up against low blocks.

"Liverpool can't cope with any of them. What we're seeing is a team in the Premier League that's not suited to the Premier League.

"Once you start seeing what Manchester United and Chelsea have done in the last couple of weeks, you start seeing that Liverpool could actually finish outside the Champions League positions. I really fear for them. Once you start fearing Champions League qualification for next season, that's when I think we've got a completely different proposition when we're talking about the manager's job. That, for me, is completely different.

"If we're talking about not winning the league or challenging for the league, that is a collective responsibility, and Liverpool don't win the league every year. Not making the Champions League from [being] champions, spending £450m and having the highest wage bill in the Premier League, which is normally the biggest determining factor over where you finish in the league, I think you've got serious questions to ask."

Liverpool face Qarabag in the Champions League on Wednesday evening. They will then return to Premier League action in what could be an action-packed clash with Newcastle this weekend. Should they wish to push through any transfer moves in January, meanwhile, the window closes for Premier League clubs on Monday, February 2.

Atlanta government and business leaders want to present a welcoming environment for foreign dignitaries and international fans planning to descend upon the city this summer for the World Cup. 

But a pair of fatal shootings in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents has raised new concerns among host cities like Atlanta about potential violence or tensions that could arise when World Cup travelers arrive in droves.

Corinthians have named their side for their Copa das Campeãs opener, FIFA's Women's Club World Cup, against Gotham FC at the Gtech Community Stadium in London, with kick-off at 9.30am Brasília time.

According to Meu Timao, head coach Lucas Piccinato is without centre-backs Thaís Regina and Agustina, both in the medical department and not travelling. Dayana Rodríguez, Paola García and Gisela Robledo arrived on the eve of the match, so they start on the bench.

Piccinato has gone with experience, starting: Lelê, Gi Fernandes, Thais Ferreira, Letícia Teles, Tamires, Ana Vitória, Duda Sampaio, Andressa Alves, Jaqueline, Belén Aquino and Gabi Zanotti.

Gotham, led by Spanish coach Juan Carlos Amoros, line up with: Ann-Katrin Berger, Jeadyn Shaw, Bruninha, Lily Reale, Emily Sonnett, Jealin Howell, Savannah Mccaskill, Rose Lavaelle, Gabi Portilho, Midge Purce and Jess Carter.

The winners advance to Sunday's final on 1 February at the Emirates Stadium, with the third-place play-off on the same day. Arsenal and AS FAR contest the other semi-final for the remaining spot.

The “door is open” for clubs from the U.S. and Mexico to compete in the Copa Libertadores, the president of the competition's organiser CONMEBOL has said.

Alejandro Dominguez, the head of South American soccer's governing body, has left open the possibility for clubs from MLS and Liga MX — who are members of Concacaf, which governs North, Central America and the Caribbean — to enter the tournament, which is the premier club competition in South America.

“The door is open to them,” Dominguez told Brazilian media outlet Globo Esporte when asked about clubs from the two nations joining the Copa Libertadores.

His comments come after Jorge Mas, the managing owner of Inter Miami, said earlier this month that it was his “dream” for the club to participate in the competition.

“It's a dream, and obviously I've already had conversations with CONMEBOL to see about our participation,” Mas said.

“There are precedents, because in the past Mexican clubs have already competed in the Libertadores. I want to play in the Libertadores, I've already said that publicly.”

Mas said the MLS Cup winner and Liga MX champion were “perhaps deserving of a slot” in the CONMEBOL-run tournament.

Mexican clubs previously competed in the Copa Libertadores between 1998 and 2016, with Cruz Azul, Chivas de Guadalajara and Tigres all reaching the final.

Dominguez, 54, said that while CONMEBOL would be open to incorporating the clubs, that “it was an issue they must first discuss with Concacaf”.

“We are very respectful of the other confederations,” Dominguez added, but said it was an “honour that teams from other confederations view the Libertadores as a benchmark for international and world competition”.

For the 2026 Copa Libertadores, 47 teams from the 10 CONMEBOL member associations qualified for the tournament.

These includes the defending champions of the Copa Libertadores (Flamengo, of Brazil) and CONMEBOL's secondary club competition the Copa Sudamericana (Lanus, of Argentina) alongside an additional seven Brazilian clubs, a further six from Argentina and each of the remaining eight member associations having four berths each.

Of those 47 sides, 28 automatically will play in the group-stage of the tournament with a further four spots up for grabs from the three preliminary rounds.

Teams from the U.S. and Mexico do not compete in the Copa Libertadores, with their status as Concafaf member associations meaning they instead play in the Concacaf Champions Cup.

The Concacaf Champions Cup is comprised of 27 teams from 10 Concacaf member associations. For the 2026 edition, this includes nine clubs from the U.S.'s MLS (five MLS berths, alongside the winners of the MLS Cup and U.S. Open Cup, and an additional two berths from the Leagues Cup, determined by the highest-ranking sides who did not qualify through their league finish).

Mexico have six representatives in this year's tournament, determined by Liga MX finishes.

Canada has an additional three domestic spots (not including those sides who play in MLS), with three qualifiers through the Caribbean Cup (the 2026 qualifiers are from Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago and Dominica respectively) and six through the Central American Cup (two each from Costa Rica and Honduras, alongside one team from both Guatemala and Panama).

In 1998, the Mexican Football Federation (FMF) successfully lobbied CONMEBOL to allow two Liga MX teams per season to participate in the South American competition.

To begin, Liga MX teams were matched against two Venezuelan sides, traditionally the weakest Libertadores participants, in a pre-Libertadores playoff. That process later became the InterLiga tournament, which was an eight-team Liga MX qualifying competition that was staged in the U.S.

The top two teams qualified for the Copa Libertadores. Both methods were time consuming and would eventually clash with domestic league calendars, leading to the arrangement ending in 2016.

Mexican clubs continued playing in Concacaf tournaments throughout this period.

Any participation from clubs from non-CONMEBOL member associations would require authorisation from CONMEBOL, Concafaf and FIFA, world football's governing body.

In December 2023, Concacaf president Victor Montagliani claimed that FIFA rejected the prospect of the Copa Libertadores including North American teams.

Montagliani told Mexican broadcaster TUDN that FIFA had rejected a petition from FMF that sought to reintroduce Liga MX teams into the competition.

“The confederations are working together to create another competition, but regarding the Libertadores, we have a request from Mexico to play in it,” Montagliani said.

“We spoke with FIFA, and we sent a document back to the FMF that was denied; it was not authorised. Concacaf didn't authorise either because we have our own official competition (the Concacaf Champions Cup). It wasn't authorised because we have ours, which is the path to the Club World Cup.”

Last week, a Concacaf source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Athletic that the confederation's position remains unchanged. CONMEBOL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Copa Libertadores and the Concacaf Champions Cup are among the confederation-wide tournaments that feed into FIFA's Club World Cup. The tournaments provides the winners with a direct berth to the now expanded 32-team tournament.

For the 2025 Club World Cup, CONMEBOL was allocated six qualification spots: the winners of each tournament between 2021 and 2024, with additional teams determined by a club ranking of the four-year period leading up to the competition.

Only UEFA — the governing body of European football — had more slots in the competition, with 12 clubs represented.

Concacaf, alongside the AFC and CAF — the governing bodies of Asian and African football, respectively — were each awarded four spots, with the most recent four winners of their confederation tournaments qualifying.

Teams from Concacaf, AFC and CAF were each awarded a flat entry fee of $9.6million by FIFA. CONMEBOL sides were each awarded a $15.2m entrance fee. The 12 European clubs were given entrance fees between $12.8m and $38.2m in a “ranking based on sporting and commercial criteria”.

This variation followed concerns that the huge amounts on offer would further widen financial inequalities across the sport and warp domestic leagues.

In addition to this, each tournament victory earns participating clubs an additional $2million, with half that amount for a drawn match.

It is unlikely, however, that clubs from the U.S. or Mexico would be granted progress to the Club World Cup via a tournament in which they are not a confederation member.

South Melbourne, who last month won the second-division Australian Championship title, cannot qualify for FIFA tournaments via their participation in Oceania's OFC Professional League because Australia is now part of the AFC. Should they win the OFC Professional League, the competition's spot would go to its runners-up.

Six months after Chelsea won the newly-expanded men's Club World Cup, FIFA is expanding its footprint in the club game with the inaugural edition of the Women's Champions Cup, the first tournament of an ecosystem the organization hopes will revolve around a first-of-its-kind Women's Club World Cup.

While the first Women's Club World Cup is currently slated for the winter of 2028, FIFA will proceed with the smaller, annual Women's Champions Cup that acts as a counterpart to the men's Intercontinental Cup. The first-ever Women's Champions Cup kicks into high gear on Wednesday with two semifinals at the Brentford Community Stadium, home of Premier League side Brentford – Gotham FC's clash with Brazil's Corinthians and Arsenal's fixture against Morocco's AS FAR. The final, plus a third-place match, await on Sunday at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium for the last four teams standing.

The new FIFA tournament will serve as a first official measuring stick for how teams from different continents in the women's game will stack up against each other, at least partially satisfying the curiosity of many who have wondered how NWSL teams fare against Europe's top sides. A matchup between UEFA Women's Champions League winners Arsenal and Concacaf W Champions Cup victors Gotham is not a guarantee – each of them have to face off against fellow continental champions to earn a fixture against each other.

Here's what you need to know about the FIFA Women's Champions Cup semifinals.

All times U.S./Eastern

Wednesday, Jan. 28Gotham FC vs. Corinthians, 7:30 a.m. (DAZN, FIFA+)Arsenal vs. AS FAR, 1 p.m. (DAZN, FIFA+)

Arsenal, Gotham and Copa Libertadores winners Corinthians qualified directly for the semifinals, while CAF Women's Champions League victors AS FAR made it to London the hard way. The competition technically began in October with a first round match between AFC Women's Champions League Wuhan Jiangda and OFC Women's Champions League victors Auckland United. Wuhan 1-0 and booked a meeting with AS FAR in December, with the Moroccan team winning 2-1 in extra time.

Since head coach Juan Carlos Amoros joined Gotham FC ahead of the 2023 NWSL season, the team has gone from strength to strength. They are now two-time league champions and added the inaugural Concacaf W Champions Cup title last season, thrusting them into a first-ever showcase against global competition. They will target another trophy in London to add to their growing collection

"It would be a dream come true for us to be in this position two games away," Amoros said. "Something that is very special. It's been a process of four years it's taken us to get to this competition. We need to win the [NWSL] championship, go next year around North America to qualify for the semifinal, final. Last season, we were able to win in Mexico and now we're here. It will be the pinnacle, the top of the mountain [if we win] at this point. But, we also know that there is even more competitions that we want to keep winning."

They will be dealing with a disadvantage, though – Gotham are technically in preseason mode. The NWSL regular season will not start until March, forcing them to begin preseason earlier than their domestic opponents. They have been training in Spain since the start of the new year and traveled to London in the days leading up to Wednesday's semifinal, which will be their first match since winning the NWSL Championship the week before Thanksgiving.

Gotham will also be without Esther Gonzalez, an NWSL MVP nominee, while she is on parental leave but many of their heavy-hitters are available for selection. Rose Lavelle, who scored the game-winning goal in November's championship, will likely play a meaningful role while Jaedyn Shaw might steal the show. The 21-year-old hit the ground running after joining the team in a blockbuster trade in September and coming with three goal contributions in three games during their playoff run. The game against Corinthians offers a unique chance to show off her skills, especially as someone who had formative experiences with Santos' women's team as a teen.

"It really shaped me as a player to be honest, seeing the vision on the field, knowing how to combine in small spaces, getting out of them on the dribble and the pass: those are some of my strengths," she said. "Just being around Brazilian culture, football and futsal, is something I think really helped me build the passion for the game. It's really where I fell in love with it, I would definitely credit a lot of the way I play to that country."

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (Jan. 27, 2026) – It was a night of firsts for the U.S. Women's National Team as the group,	featuring the least capped starting lineup in 25 years, defeated Chile 5-0 in front of a sold-out crowd at Harder Stadium to close out January camp.

The USWNT played a pair of matches at Harder Stadium in 1991 to prepare for the first-ever FIFA Women's World Cup, which it would win in China PR, but those games against UC Santa Barbara and a team of West Coast All-Stars were exhibitions.

Back at Harder Stadium 34 years later in the first full USWNT international match on the Central Coast of California, three players – midfielder Croix Bethune, forward Jameese Joseph and defender Emily Sams – scored their first international goals, all in the first half, and three players – Sams along with debutantes Ayo Oke and Riley Jackson – recorded their first international assists. 

Tonight's match also featured a first-time captain in Sams after forward Trinity Rodman and midfielder Claire Hutton took up the captain's armband for the first time in their international careers on Saturday. The newly minted Angel City FC defender earned her ninth cap fresh off completing 100 percent of her passes in the previous match. She played a full 90 minutes and had a career night, recording two goal contributions and earning Woman of the Match honors. 

Head coach Emma Hayes vowed to rotate players following Saturday's 6-0 win over Paraguay at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, Calif., and she sent on an entirely new lineup to face Chile at Harder Stadium. After Saturday's starting XI averaged 9.6 caps, tonight's starters averaged even fewer – just 5.2 caps entering the match.

The lineup also featured the first caps for Jackson of the North Carolina Courage and Oke of Denver Summit FC, one of two NWSL expansion clubs scheduled to kick off their inaugural season in 2026. The pair became the 289th and 290th players to earn caps for the U.S. Women's National Team in the program's 41-year history and brought the total number of debutantes to five in January camp. Portland Thorns FC's Reilyn Turner, Seattle Reign midfielder Sally Menti and Seattle Reign forward Maddie Dahlien earned their first caps on Jan. 24 against Paraguay.

The action started quickly for the U.S. in the first minute with a shot from Joseph, who was eager to get on the scoresheet in her first international start. The forward received a weighted ball from forward Emma Sears and took a good first touch to set up an attempt from close range. Chile goalkeeper and California native Ryann Torrero dropped to make the stop and prevent a first-minute goal for the home side. 

After the fast start, the U.S. settled into possession and La Roja held a compact shape until the 18th minute when the U.S. broke through. Two players connected to record their first goal contributions as Oke, from the right wing, played a low ball on the spot for Croix Bethune. The midfielder kept her balance to slip a shot past Torrero. The first international goal for Bethune and first assist for Oke gave the U.S. a 1-0 lead. 

Eight minutes later, the USWNT doubled its lead. Again, the U.S. found success sending the ball centrally from the right wing. This time, it was forward Yazmeen Ryan, the most capped player in the lineup with 16, feeding a low pass to Joseph, who was posting up inside the box. Joseph made a lovely turn and fired a left-footed shot to score her first international goal in her first start.

The third goal of the night signified another first for a U.S. player. This time, it was Sams, redirecting a firm, low pass inside the box from Sears after the forward worked with Bethune to put the ball into a dangerous area following a recycled corner kick. The goal from Sams in the 33rd minute was the first internationally for tonight's captain. The U.S. went into the halftime break leading 3-0 with all three goals coming from first-time scorers. 

Just as the U.S. started the first half fast, the team started the second half fast – and this time, the team converted. The two contributors on the third goal of the night connected once again in reverse. Sams played a long ball over the top to Sears, who had a couple of shots clang off the left post in the first half. The Racing Louisville forward would not be denied again, and her emphatic finish from a tight angle into the upper right corner extended the lead just 27 seconds into the second half. 

Hayes made several substitutions in the second half, including the two captains from Saturday's win over Paraguay, Rodman and Hutton, and one of them scored the fifth goal of the night. The U.S. switched the attack through Jackson in the center of the pitch, and the debutante curled a pass for Rodman. The forward put the ball on her left foot, then fired a shot. As soon as the ball went into the left side netting, the superstar raced toward the sideline. Together with her head coach, Rodman danced to celebrate her goal, gleefully received by the crowd of 14,797 in attendance at Harder Stadium. 

The U.S. dominated the match from start to finish, holding 71 percent of the possession and taking 21 shots, 12 on goal. Chile never tested U.S. goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, who earned her seventh cap and start. The U.S. did not allow a single shot from Chile on the way to recording the team's fifth straight clean sheet. 

The victory concluded the two-match set for U.S. Women's National Team and now Hayes and her staff turn their attention to the first tournament competition of the year. Next up is the annual SheBelieves Cup, presented by Visa®, which will see the U.S. take on Argentina on Sunday, March 1 at GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn., Canada on March 4 at ScottsMiracle-Gro Field in Columbus, Ohio and Colombia on March 7 at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J.

USA – CROIX BETHUNE (AYO OKE), 18th minute: The U.S. worked the ball out of the back to Oke on the right flank. The defender threaded a ball to the feet of Bethune making a run in the middle of the pitch toward goal. With a touch, Bethune carried the ball into the box and kept her balance to draw Torrero off her line. Bethune calmly played a left-footed shot from the penalty spot that skipped past the goalkeeper and into the center of an open net. She then did a dance and struck a pose to celebrate her first international goal. USA 1, CHI 0

USA – JAMEESE JOSEPH (YAZMEEN RYAN), 26th minute: Out of the back, Sams played a pass to Ryan on the right wing. The forward played a pass to Joseph who had a defender on her back inside the 18-yard box. Joseph made a lovely turn to face goal, then fired a beautiful finish from just beyond the penalty spot with her left foot to open her international scoring account. USA 2, CHI 0

USA – EMILY SAMS (EMMA SEARS), 33rd minute: After recycling a corner kick on the left side of the pitch, Croix Bethune led Sears with a diagonal pass. The forward's strong, low cross traveled into a dangerous, congested area inside the six-yard box. Sams, who was still in the area from the corner kick, put her boot on the cross from close range. The shot left no doubt and flew into the back of the net. USA 3, CHI 0

USA – EMMA SEARS (EMILY SAMS), 46th minute: From her position at right back, Sams drove a ball over the top of Chile's backline down the right channel for Sears making a run in the U.S. attacking half. The forward turned on the jets, then took an aggressive first touch towards goal. From about seven yards, Sears firmly tucked her right-footed shot into the upper-right corner of the frame, just grazing the bottom of the crossbar, to record her sixth international goal and second in back-to-back matches. USA 4, CHI 0

USA – TRINITY RODMAN (RILEY JACKSON), 68th minute: Jackson switched the ball from the left side of the field to the right and sent an excellent, spinning ball for Rodman waiting just outside the right edge of the box. Rodman took one dribble with her right foot, cut back to her left foot, then delivered a fierce strike about eight yards from goal into the left side netting. USA 5, CHI 0

					The freshest news in Santa Barbara County				

UC Santa Barbara's Harder Stadium underwent a makeover and rolled out the red carpet for the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team for an international match for the first time ever on Tuesday night.



Local soccer fans in town and from up and down the Central Coast showed up and showed out for the international friendly against Chile, selling out the stadium with 14,797 attendees.



The USWNT gave its fans plenty to cheer about, cruising to a 5-0 victory over Chile, which marked the end of the first camp of 2026 for the USWNT.



“I have not been to Santa Barbara often, but it's a beautiful place,” U.S. standout Trinity Rodman said. “This stadium was cool. I like when it's intimate like that. You can hear almost every fan. Even during the game, I can hear more comments, which I think is fun at times.


“Obviously, when we scored, it's even louder, so I enjoyed that a lot and I liked playing here.”

It was a match full of firsts for the U.S., as midfielder Croix Bethune, forward Jameese Joseph and defender Emily Sams all scored the first goals of their international career in the opening half.



The U.S. boasted a starting lineup full of players making their first starts at the international level, as this year's squad is one of the youngest in the team's history.



“For me, it's consistency in what we're looking for. The way that we coach the players is that it doesn't matter who's got the crest on, you know what that is expected in that role,” U.S. head coach Emma Hayes said. “When you have players that don't play a lot of minutes, able to deliver a tactical performance like that, I think that's what gives me most joy.



“I think we always know the U.S. produced players that can win soccer games, maybe a certain way, but I feel like we have learned how to break opponents down in much different ways… That's the level that this program sets, and I feel like we're returning to a level that was here a while ago.”

The USWNT applied plenty of pressure in the early stages, including a shot on goal from Joseph in the opening minute of play.



The early pressure turned into a score in the 18th minute when defender Ayo Oke delivered a lead pass to Bethune, who collected herself and beat the Chile goalkeeper in a 1-on-1 for the 1-0 lead.



The U.S. doubled its lead eight minutes later when Yazmeen Ryan delivered a pinpoint pass to Joseph at the top of the box. Joseph turned and fired a goal into the back of the net to make it 2-0 in the 26th minute.



The offensive barrage continued in the 33rd minute, as Emma Sears received a pass inside the box and crossed it to captain Sams, who slid in and scored for a 3-0 advantage, which held into halftime.



The Santa Barbara crowd responded to the three-goal first half with a wave that wrapped around Harder Stadium several times before dying down.



Hayes mentioned the wave in her postgame press conference and was pleased with the energy levels both from her team and in the Santa Barbara crowd.

“I said to the players in the locker room, let's go out there and lift the roof, and then I came out and realized it didn't have a roof,” Hayes said. “But as [Rodman] reminded me, it doesn't need a roof to lift something. 



“I wanted the team to give a performance that would keep a crowd engaged, but also know that [the crowd] is going to bring the energy, so let's keep up with them.”



The U.S. didn't waste a moment continuing the momentum into the second half, as Sears streaked down the sideline and scored in the opening minute to extend the lead to 4-0.

In the 63rd minute, the Santa Barbara crowd rose to its feet as Rodman entered the game as a substitute.



Rodman rose to the occasion in the 68th minute, as she collected a pass from Riley Jackson, dribbled into the right side of the box and fired an impressive shot across the net and into the back left corner to make it a 5-0 lead. 



The 23-year-old immediately sprinted across the field to celebrate with a dance with Hayes before firing up an already-electrified crowd.



“I'm proud of myself. I told you guys I was gonna do it, and I did it,” Rodman said of dancing with her coach. “I'm just really happy and happy that Emma was confident enough to do it with me. 



“She didn't have a choice… I let her know for sure, like I'm coming up to you again, so it's on you if you want to ignore it or if you want to just feed into it and she did.”



That proved to be the final goal of the match, as the U.S. held on and secured the clean sheet to wrap up its first camp of the 2026 season. The U.S. also defeated Paraguay, 6-0, on Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park.



The next time the U.S. team will be in action will be for the SheBelieves Cup in Nashville, Tennessee, at the beginning of March.

“I think this has certainly opened up the year with what we've identified as the key themes to take us through to qualification,” Hayes said of the season-opening camp.



“I think this camp has given us the reference points to be able to say, these are the things we need to add to go to the next level, these are the things we are looking for, and for the players that come back in for SheBelieves, it will be really clear what that looks like.”

“I'm proud of myself. I told you guys I was gonna do it, and I did it,” Rodman said of dancing with her coach. “I'm just really happy and happy that Emma was confident enough to do it with me. 



“She didn't have a choice… I let her know for sure, like I'm coming up to you again, so it's on you if you want to ignore it or if you want to just feed into it and she did.”



That proved to be the final goal of the match, as the U.S. held on and secured the clean sheet to wrap up its first camp of the 2026 season. The U.S. also defeated Paraguay, 6-0, on Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park.



The next time the U.S. team will be in action will be for the SheBelieves Cup in Nashville, Tennessee, at the beginning of March.

“I think this has certainly opened up the year with what we've identified as the key themes to take us through to qualification,” Hayes said of the season-opening camp.



“I think this camp has given us the reference points to be able to say, these are the things we need to add to go to the next level, these are the things we are looking for, and for the players that come back in for SheBelieves, it will be really clear what that looks like.”


	

“For me, it's consistency in what we're looking for. The way that we coach the players is that it doesn't matter who's got the crest on, you know what that is expected in that role,” U.S. head coach Emma Hayes said. “When you have players that don't play a lot of minutes, able to deliver a tactical performance like that, I think that's what gives me most joy.



“I think we always know the U.S. produced players that can win soccer games, maybe a certain way, but I feel like we have learned how to break opponents down in much different ways… That's the level that this program sets, and I feel like we're returning to a level that was here a while ago.”

The USWNT applied plenty of pressure in the early stages, including a shot on goal from Joseph in the opening minute of play.



The early pressure turned into a score in the 18th minute when defender Ayo Oke delivered a lead pass to Bethune, who collected herself and beat the Chile goalkeeper in a 1-on-1 for the 1-0 lead.



The U.S. doubled its lead eight minutes later when Yazmeen Ryan delivered a pinpoint pass to Joseph at the top of the box. Joseph turned and fired a goal into the back of the net to make it 2-0 in the 26th minute.



The offensive barrage continued in the 33rd minute, as Emma Sears received a pass inside the box and crossed it to captain Sams, who slid in and scored for a 3-0 advantage, which held into halftime.



The Santa Barbara crowd responded to the three-goal first half with a wave that wrapped around Harder Stadium several times before dying down.



Hayes mentioned the wave in her postgame press conference and was pleased with the energy levels both from her team and in the Santa Barbara crowd.

“I said to the players in the locker room, let's go out there and lift the roof, and then I came out and realized it didn't have a roof,” Hayes said. “But as [Rodman] reminded me, it doesn't need a roof to lift something. 



“I wanted the team to give a performance that would keep a crowd engaged, but also know that [the crowd] is going to bring the energy, so let's keep up with them.”



The U.S. didn't waste a moment continuing the momentum into the second half, as Sears streaked down the sideline and scored in the opening minute to extend the lead to 4-0.

“I said to the players in the locker room, let's go out there and lift the roof, and then I came out and realized it didn't have a roof,” Hayes said. “But as [Rodman] reminded me, it doesn't need a roof to lift something. 



“I wanted the team to give a performance that would keep a crowd engaged, but also know that [the crowd] is going to bring the energy, so let's keep up with them.”



The U.S. didn't waste a moment continuing the momentum into the second half, as Sears streaked down the sideline and scored in the opening minute to extend the lead to 4-0.

In the 63rd minute, the Santa Barbara crowd rose to its feet as Rodman entered the game as a substitute.



Rodman rose to the occasion in the 68th minute, as she collected a pass from Riley Jackson, dribbled into the right side of the box and fired an impressive shot across the net and into the back left corner to make it a 5-0 lead. 



The 23-year-old immediately sprinted across the field to celebrate with a dance with Hayes before firing up an already-electrified crowd.



“I'm proud of myself. I told you guys I was gonna do it, and I did it,” Rodman said of dancing with her coach. “I'm just really happy and happy that Emma was confident enough to do it with me. 



“She didn't have a choice… I let her know for sure, like I'm coming up to you again, so it's on you if you want to ignore it or if you want to just feed into it and she did.”



That proved to be the final goal of the match, as the U.S. held on and secured the clean sheet to wrap up its first camp of the 2026 season. The U.S. also defeated Paraguay, 6-0, on Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park.



The next time the U.S. team will be in action will be for the SheBelieves Cup in Nashville, Tennessee, at the beginning of March.

“I think this has certainly opened up the year with what we've identified as the key themes to take us through to qualification,” Hayes said of the season-opening camp.

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (KEYT) Soccer fans and players of all ages filled Harder Stadium at UCSB on Tuesday night, but not to see the Gauchos play, they came to see the USWNT also known as U.S. Women's National Soccer Team play Chile. 

There are 17,000 seats in the stadium named after a football coach when UCSB had football was upgrades about a decade ago.

It is considered one of the best soccer venues and referred to as Soccer Heaven by some athletes.

Some local AYSO players and members of Central Coast Surf club soccer teams got to enter the stadium early and take photos on the field.

Cydney Justman of Girls Inc Santa Barbara brought dozens of girls to the game.

Many of the girls and young women said they couldn't wait to see a certain Olympic Gold Medalist with a famous last name.

"Trinity Rodman. Why? Because she's a really good soccer player and i just want to see her really bad"

Leh Gomen Rylee McGill Viviana Reyes and Hazel Mcgill from Central Coast Soccer Club came hours before the games started at 7 p.m.

Brooke, Carter and Ellie Rozhko dressed in team US colors.

Mila Mctiernan, Sierra Hope, Page Hall and Merrick Hope came from San Luis Obispo to watch and went in with the crowd that looked like a sea of fans.

Dennice Marin of Oxnard doesn't play but appreciated seeing women in the spotlight.

"Also excitingly she just signed the largest women's project ever she signed with Washington Spirit and we are going to watch her play tonight," said Sydney Baritone, who used to play club while at UCSB.

The girls also play for Central Coat Surf. They love to play and this is their first time seeing the pros in person rather than on TV.

The U.S. won 5-0 and Trinity Rodman scored one of those goals.

Sports Director Mike Klan has all the highlights.

LONDON -- New York to London might not be a particularly arduous journey for most, even via southern Spain, but Gotham FC's road to the British capital has been a long and winding one. The NWSL champions take the field at the Brentford Community Stadium Wednesday, not as holders of the title they won in such dramatic fashion back in November. Instead, it is the title before that, one won by a team that has predominantly broken apart, that set this club on a journey they hope will end with them crowned the first world champions of women's club football.

The then-NJ/NY Gotham FC side that beat OL Reign in the 2023 NWSL Championship game would face off against the best of CONCACAF the following year before raising the continent's first championship in Leon, Mexico, 18 months after they had qualified for the competition. That in turn earned them the right to travel across the Atlantic as North America's first representatives in the FIFA Women's Champions Cup, the annual intercontinental clash that, at least until the Women's Club World Cup begins in two years' time, will crown the sport's best club side.

No wonder that in such a long stretch, so few of those who began the journey are still there. Only three of the starting XI that Juan Carlos Amoros named for that 2023 final are still with the club as they arrive in London. When the head coach explains the long journey to Hounslow, it seems faintly remarkable anyone is still standing.

"It would be a dream come true for us to be in this position two games away," said Amoros. "Something that is very special.

"It's been a process of four years it's taken us to get to this competition. We need to win the [NWSL] championship, go next year around North America to qualify for the semifinal, final. Last season, we were able to win in Mexico and now we're here. 

"It will be the pinnacle, the top of the mountain [if we win] at this point. But, we also know that there is even more competitions that we want to keep winning."

The Women's Champions Cup too has come the long way round. In November, Wuhan Jiangda beat Auckland United on home soil before themselves losing to home favorites AS Far in Morocco last month. Now the final four -- representing North America, South America, Africa and Europe -- meet in London, the semifinals at Brentford's home on Wednesday before Arsenal's 60,000 capacity Emirates Stadium hosts the third place playoff and final on Sunday. Gotham's campaign begins against Corinthians, by far the dominant force in both Brazilian and South American football, the winners of six of the last nine iterations of the Copa Libertadores.

Despite the impressive record of their opponents, few are in any doubt as to who the strong favorites should be when the two sides take the field at 12:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. ET). After all, this is the best that the NWSL has to offer, at least according to the playoffs, if not the final standings in the league. Gotham would probably have to acknowledge that they are strong favorites for the semifinal, perhaps even for the competition as a whole.

"You always got to bet on yourself," joked Jaelin Howell. "We're our own favorites, put it that way," said defender Mandy Freeman, a veteran of that long road to CONCACAF glory and beyond. "We hope we are," added Jaedyn Shaw.

Whether they actually are, well, that is what makes the Champions Cup so intriguing. When these sorts of competitions take place in the men's game, there is an inherently limiting factor, the economic reality of the sport. In both the old and new formats of the men's Club World Cup, South American clubs certainly roused themselves to punch above their weight, but that was the point. When the continent's richest side, Flamengo, trail Real Madrid by the best part of $1 billion in revenue, there's not really much of a case against deciding the best men's club side in the Champions League.

In the women's game, the margins are finer, financially and perhaps on the field. Arsenal's Champions League triumph last summer made them Europe's richest club side with revenue Deloitte estimated at around $30 million. Transpose that over to the NWSL and the Gunners would certainly be one of the league's top earners, but, according to Forbes, they would not match Angel City and Kansas City Current.

The relative parity between NWSL and Europe's top clubs is reflected in player movement. Jenna Nighswonger and Crystal Dunn are among the former Gotham players who moved to Europe while Amoros' squad has been strengthened by the addition of Ann-Katrin Berger and Jess Carter to a group that also includes Spain international Esther.

That sense of meaningful stakes between the best of each continent offers a sense of importance to this competition that perhaps mitigates against the fears of jamming more games into an overwhelming schedule.

"When we played the CONCACAF Women's Cup, which was the first time as well, we showed the players some pictures of competitions from the past," said Amoros. "You could see, for example, Sweden, the first Euros [sic, the first European Championships were indeed won by the Swedes against England in a two-legged final where both nations hosted], where there were fewer fans, less recognition. The Champions League, all these competitions had to start somewhere. 

 "This is something that in the women's game also needed to happen. So I'm super happy that we as Gotham are going to be in this competition in the 2028 one [the Club World Cup} as well. Hopefully, we are again next year. I think it's truly important. And I think in the women's game, it's a slightly different, the global stage, if you want to call it. But I think in the men's, realistically, Europe is clearly the dominant.

"Every player in the world wants to come to Europe. While in the women's game, we could definitely say that the NWSL is at least at the same level. So I think that makes it even more interesting. Internationally, obviously, the U.S. at an international level has been the dominant country the last couple of decades. And I think it's really something different to the men's and we want to make it even better. So hopefully this tournament is the first of many."

Whether it will be the first of many won by an NWSL representative is another question. Gotham might find themselves at a disadvantage in a putative final against Arsenal. They have spent the last three weeks in a warm weather training camp in Sotogrande, Spain, but that is no match for the competitive gearing up the Gunners have had in the midst of a WSL season that saw them win 2-0 at champions Chelsea at the weekend.

Arsenal too pride themselves on their firsts: first in attendances, first in league titles won, the first English side to win the European Cup, and indeed the second. 

"We're proud to be in this competition," said Arsenal coach Renee Slegers. "We want to compete for trophies. This is a new trophy in women's football. And I think Arsenal have been trailblazers for long. We want to be part of that. We want to make history as well."

Of course, it is presumptive to think about the final already when an unfamiliar opponent lies ahead of Gotham. Corinthians are nothing if not used to winning and their squad includes a host of veterans including Tamires, winner of 148 Brazil caps, and captain Gabi Zanotti, the most successful player in the club's history and, at 40 years of age, nearly a year Marta's senior.

Gotham have never played a Brazilian opponent before but they can at least rely on intel from their teammate Gabi Portilho, who joined from the Brabas (roughly translated as 'the fierce girls') in December 2024. Brazil international Bruninha is also well aware of how her international teammates from Corinthians might test their U.S. opponents.

"It's nice for us to be able to see their style of play, the Brazilian players," said Shaw. "Seeing how they play and playing against them every day is super helpful. Them being in Brazil with those players and that team is really helpful, as well as scouting."

Gotham will also be able to deploy some Brazilian flair of their own in the form of Shaw, whose formative years involved several trips to Brazil where she played futsal with Santos' women's team.

"It really shaped me as a player to be honest, seeing the vision on the field, knowing how to combine in small spaces, getting out of them on the dribble and the pass: those are some of my strengths," she said. "Just being around Brazilian culture, football and futsal, is something I think really helped me build the passion for the game. It's really where I fell in love with it, I would definitely credit a lot of the way I play to that country."

Her footballing identity having been so strongly forged in Sao Paulo, Shaw is surely going to be even more eager to get one over on one of Santos' historic rivalries. Then again she is far from the only Gotham star with plenty to motivate themselves in the days ahead. It has taken a long time for Gotham to get this far. They aren't minded to slow down with the summit in sight.

I know myself, and I don't want to lash out on my team. They're good people. They don't deserve that, and I know I'm emotional. Coco Gauff

Gauff's idol, Serena Williams, fully backed her outlet of choice for releasing frustration. After Serena's husband Alexis Ohanian posted, “Media are gonna spin this private moment for a headline to get some clicks, but Coco did nothing wrong here,” the 23-time major winner soon joined the conversation.“Well said. @alexisohanian.

The Australian Open doubles draw is down to its final four pairs. With reigning champions Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend out, a new champion is guaranteed.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Vera Zvonareva and Ena Shibahara defeated Australian favorites Talia Gibson and Kimberly Birrell Wednesday evening, and now the doubles semifinals are set. 

Here's a closer look at the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz doubles semifinalists in Melbourne Park:

Seventh-seeded pair Aleksandra Krunić and Anna Danilina knocked off the top doubles pair in the world in Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend. With a 6-2, 3-6, 6-0 win, the Slovak-Kazakh pair won 70% of their first-service points to withstand the 2025 Australian Open doubles champions. 

In their two three-set matches in Melbourne so far, Krunić-Danilina have dominated when it mattered most with third-set bagels. 

The pair most recently defeated Siniakova-Townsend in the quarterfinals of Roland Garros last year. Krunić-Danilina eventually reached the final, but fell to Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini. Their next task is Gabriela Dabrowski and Luisa Stefani in the semifinals.

Dabrowski and Stefani outlasted Hsieh Su-wei and Jelena Ostapenko 6-1, 7-6 (5) in Margaret Court Arena on Wednesday. The duo has won all their matches in straight sets in Melbourne, marking a successful start for the rekindled doubles tandem. Hsieh Su-wei and Ostapenko had come in with plenty of momentum, with a title in Brisbane a few weeks ago.

Prior to 2026, Dabrowski-Stefani most recently played together in a few tournaments in 2023, including Roland Garros, Madrid and Stuttgart, among others. Both Stefani and Dabrowski were at the WTA Finals Riyadh in November 2025, playing alongside different partners. (Stefani finished as runner-up with Timea Babos.)

On Wednesday, the pair broke their opponents four times and landed 82% of their first serves, and won 43% of their opponents' first-service points.

Elise Mertens and Zhang Shuai will face Zvonareva and Shibahara after defeating Wu Fang-Hsien and Eri Hozumi 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 to advance to the semifinals.

Zhang and Mertens played together just once in 2025, at the Miami Open, in addition to a couple times in 2024. Both are top 15 players in the doubles rankings, with Mertens at No. 6 and Zhang at No. 15. In their quarterfinal win, they had five aces to their opponents' one and finished with four pivotal breaks to get the edge. 

Zvonareva and Shibahara advanced to the semifinals with a 6-4, 6-7 (3), 7-5 win over Gibson and Birrell.

Zvonareva, 41, returned to tennis after a long layoff at the end of last year, and reached the final with Shibahara in Canberra earlier this month.

The Australian Open doubles draw is down to its final four pairs. With reigning champions Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend out, a new champion is guaranteed.

Elena Rybakina defeated Iga Swiatek to reach the Australian Open semifinals, and she'll play Jessica Pegula for a spot in the final. We break down what to watch for in Melbourne's second semifinal.

Elena Rybakina and Jessica Pegula both handled higher-seeded players in straight sets to advance to Thursday's WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz semifinals at the Australian Open.

Rybakina was a 7-5, 6-1 winner over No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek, ending her hopes (for the moment) of achieving the career Grand Slam. Rybakina finished with a flourish, winning eight of the last nine games.

Pegula took down No. 4 seed Amanda Anisimova 6-2, 7-6 (1) to advance to her second straight major semifinal.

No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, seeking her third Australian Open title and her fourth straight final, will meet No. 12 Elina Svitolina in the first semifinal (7:30 p.m., local).

The key to Pegula's victory? Complete command in the critical category of second serves. Pegula won 16 of her 25 second-serve points (.640), while Anisimova hit seven double faults -- all in the winnable second set.

"I've always been someone that doesn't really panic -- I don't really get too emotional,” Pegula told reporters. "I don't really get too upset about things, so I think that's just kind of where the stability comes from. I'm very persistent as far as always wanting to get better, always wanting to work on stuff, always feeling like I can do things that maybe people thought I couldn't, and kind of improve in those areas."

Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, says that maturity and quickly adapting to little challenges are necessary to win seven matches in a fortnight.

"You can play indoor, you can play outdoor, sun, it can be [a] night match," she explained. "So all these conditions [are] a bit tricky. I think probably now I'm more calm and going deeper in tournament."

How in form are these four WTA Tour semifinalists? None of them have dropped a set; it's only the fifth time that's happened at a major in 30 years.

We break down these two stellar matches, with thoughts from writers Greg Garber and Brad Kallet:

Head-to-head: 3-3. Rybakina won the last one -- in a three-setter in Riyadh, last fall -- but they've never met at a Grand Slam.

What's at stake: A whole lot for these two players, for different reasons. This is Pegula's second straight major semifinal, and she's looking to make her second final in three semifinal tries. She's the only woman in the Open era to advance to her first three Grand Slam semifinals after her 30th birthday.

Rybakina is trying to get back on the Grand Slam title board for the first time in three-and-a-half years. She's also looking to equal her best result in Melbourne, when she lost to Sabalenka in the 2023 final. Rybakina's followed up her title at the WTA Finals with a strong start in 2026, winning seven of eight matches.

Greg Garber: It's not common knowledge, but since Wimbledon last year, Rybakina has won more matches (35) than any other woman. The current run is 18 of 19, losing only to Karolina Muchova earlier this month in Brisbane. Perhaps more relevant, Rybakina has claimed an impressive eight consecutive Top 10 wins. And, as you know, Brad, Pegula is a Top 10 player.

"I think last season, the last couple of tournaments I played I gained some confidence throughout tough matches," Rybakina said. "Of course, this is something I tried to carry to this year, this season. I'm trying to stay aggressive whenever I get the chance to step in, maybe risk a little bit."

Rybakina likes these warm conditions Down Under. She hammered 11 aces against Swiatek and converted four of seven break points. Rybakina leads all women in Melbourne with 35 aces. "The most important for me," she said, "[is] to be focused on my serve, since it's a big advantage if it works." If it's working, don't fix it. Rybakina in three sets.

Brad Kallet: Pegula tends to slip under the radar, doesn't she, Greg? Everyone knows how good she is, but we often take her consistency for granted. Take this year in Melbourne: Much of the talk was about Coco Gauff as the top-ranked American, Anisimova as the very likely first-time Grand Slam champion, Madison Keys as the defending champion. Even Iva Jovic generated more buzz, with her run to the quarters.

But Pegula, as solid and dependable as they come, is the last American standing. She'll have her work cut out for her in Rybakina, who is playing as well as anyone on tour, but the 31-year-old knows how to handle the power players. Just look at her quarterfinal match against Anisimova as proof. If she can neutralize Rybakina, change direction, create unforced errors and maintain her dominance on second serve, she has a great shot. We haven't had a down-to-the-wire three-setter in a bit, Greg, but I agree that we'll get one tonight. Pegula gets it done and reaches her second Slam final.

Ben Shelton may have been stopped at a major for the fourth time by Jannik Sinner, but the American left Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday with plenty to be encouraged by after another deep Grand Slam run.

The eighth seed dropped just one set en route to his fifth major quarter-final before running into the Italian once again, with Sinner extending his dominance in the rivalry to a 9-1 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“I think my level is better, and I'm getting better and better and becoming a lot less limited,” Shelton said when analysing his progress. “I think this game takes time, and the results don't always come when you want them. I'm getting to the point now where I'm getting stopped by the toughest challenge in the game for the most part, and I do think that I'm close to bringing it all together.

“I think it's just going to take that one time where I do it to kind of get me over the hump. It's always been that way for me. Certainly not discouraged from a performance like this, but I want to see myself get out in front and see what I can do from there in a match rather than falling behind just because I know how I feel when I get out in front at slams. I feel like I'm untouchable. I guarantee the other guys at the top feel the exact same.

“It's a matter of time and work just trying to put all the pieces together, because I'm not complete yet, but I feel myself becoming more complete.”

Shelton reached his first major quarter-final at the Australian Open in 2023. The 23-year-old has since won three tour-level titles, including his maiden ATP Masters 1000 crown in Toronto, and cracked the Top 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings. At Slams, Shelton has often delivered, highlighted by semi-finals at the US Open (2023) and Australian Open (2025). It is under those conditions, he admits, that his competitive instincts are strongest.
“I'm an addict. I've become more and more addicted to this game and figuring things out, chasing the guys who are ahead of me,” Shelton said. “It's feeling the pressure that you feel on the court at a Grand Slam, there's no better feeling… That's what drives me every day, and I just feel like the drive getting stronger and stronger each year.”

Shelton caused two-time defending champion Sinner problems at times with his destructive first serve and bruising forehands, yet was unable to capitalise in the key moments in his 3-6, 4-6, 4-6 loss.
“I think I had two second-serve looks on break points today, and I think I missed both of them, or maybe one of them I hit weak and he spread me quickly,” Shelton said reflecting on the match.
“I think that with other guys, I can get away with putting in the court and either being at neutral or having to scramble a little bit at the first ball and then getting back to neutral or getting on offense. I was doing a really good job of that. But with a guy who has the plus-one ability that he has off of both sides, I needed to be a lot better and have more purpose with my second-serve return, which I thought that he had against me. He was able to put me in uncomfortable positions and get to offense a good amount of times on my second serve and make me think about which serves I was using.”

Shelton reached his first major quarter-final at the Australian Open in 2023. The 23-year-old has since won three tour-level titles, including his maiden ATP Masters 1000 crown in Toronto, and cracked the Top 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

At Slams, Shelton has often delivered, highlighted by semi-finals at the US Open (2023) and Australian Open (2025). It is under those conditions, he admits, that his competitive instincts are strongest.

“I'm an addict. I've become more and more addicted to this game and figuring things out, chasing the guys who are ahead of me,” Shelton said. “It's feeling the pressure that you feel on the court at a Grand Slam, there's no better feeling… That's what drives me every day, and I just feel like the drive getting stronger and stronger each year.”



Shelton caused two-time defending champion Sinner problems at times with his destructive first serve and bruising forehands, yet was unable to capitalise in the key moments in his 3-6, 4-6, 4-6 loss.

“I think I had two second-serve looks on break points today, and I think I missed both of them, or maybe one of them I hit weak and he spread me quickly,” Shelton said reflecting on the match.

“I think that with other guys, I can get away with putting in the court and either being at neutral or having to scramble a little bit at the first ball and then getting back to neutral or getting on offense. I was doing a really good job of that. But with a guy who has the plus-one ability that he has off of both sides, I needed to be a lot better and have more purpose with my second-serve return, which I thought that he had against me.

When Lorenzo Musetti walked to the net on Tuesday night at the Australian Open, the scoreboard told a story that tennis almost never sees.

Two sets to love up against Novak Djokovic, the Italian was forced to retire in their quarter-final, joining one of the sport's most painful and unusual footnotes: players who have led by two sets at a Grand Slam and never finished the match.

Remarkably, this is not the first time Musetti has found himself on the wrong side of this rare statistic and against the same opponent. At Roland Garros in 2021, Musetti stunned the tennis world by taking the opening two sets from Djokovic in the fourth round. Physical struggles followed, Djokovic surged back, and Musetti eventually retired in the fifth set. Five years later, on a different surface, history repeated itself.

Across the entire Open Era (since 1968), there have been only a handful of instances where a player has retired from a major match despite holding a two-set advantage. Grigor Dimitrov was the most recent example before Musetti at last year's Wimbledon, where he retired due to a pectoral injury when leading Jannik Sinner 6-3, 7-5, 2-2.

 Lorenzo Musetti's hopes of ending his Grand Slam drought against Novak Djokovic were dashed in cruel fashion on Wednesday afternoon in Melbourne. The Italian was forced to retire while leading 6-4, 6-3, 1-3 in the pair's Australian Open quarter-final clash. 

 Stepping onto Rod Laver Arena having lost all three previous meetings with Djokovic at the majors, Musetti had produced a superb all-around quarter-final display to open a two-set lead, but he appeared to injure his upper right leg in the third game of the third set. Although the Italian tried to continue after receiving treatment from the physio at 1-2, he was ultimately forced to stop after two hours and eight minutes of play. 

 “I don't know what to say except I feel really sorry for him and he was a far better player,” said Djokovic in his on-court interview. “I was on my way home tonight. These kinds of things happen in sport. It happened to me a few times, but being in the quarters of a Grand Slam, two sets to love up, and being in full control, it's so unfortunate. I don't know what else I can say and I really wish him a speedy recovery. He should have been a winner today, no doubt.” 



 By stepping on court Wednesday, Djokovic became just the third man (after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer) to compete in 1,400 tour-level matches. After Musetti retired, the Serbian also consequently passed Federer to claim sole ownership of the record for the most Australian Open singles match wins (103). Yet the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings will know he will have to produce a markedly improved performance if he wants to overcome two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner or Ben Shelton in the final four.

 Prior to his injury, the World No. 5 Musetti had rarely looked back after overturning an early 0-2 deficit in the opening set. He broke Djokovic's serve five times across the first two sets, according to Infosys Stats, while the Serbian — who was playing his first match since Saturday after advancing through the fourth round via walkover against Jakub Mensik — struggled to find any rhythm with his aggressive game plan from the baseline. 

 “The strategy worked very well for the first couple of games, and then it changed completely,” said Djokovic, who now holds a 10-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead over Musetti. “Four winners in the first two games, and no unforced errors. Then in the rest of the match I had another four winners and probably 40 errors. But that's what Lorenzo does to you. 

 “He makes you play. When you think the point is finished, it's not. Obviously, a bit more wind today, swirly conditions, and when you attack him you don't know what to expect… What can I say. I tried my best. Yes, I have a blister here and there, but nothing really majorly bothered me. I just wasn't feeling the ball today in the first couple of sets, but that's also due to his quality and his variety of game. I'm just extremely lucky to get through this one today.” 

Djokovic is chasing a record-extending 11th Australian Open crown and 25th major overall. The 38-year-old is the second-oldest men's singles semi-finalist at the Australian Open in the Open Era, younger only than Ken Rosewall in 1976 and 1977. The former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has advanced to the semi-finals of the past five majors he has played but has not won any of those last-four matches.

Musetti would have climbed to No. 3 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings if he had reached his third major semi-final. The 23-year-old Italian is the first player in the Open Era to retire in a major quarter-final after winning the first two sets.

 Lorenzo Musetti admitted he was struggling for words after being forced to retire while two sets up in his Australian Open quarter-final against Novak Djokovic. 

 The No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings produced a sublime performance for the best part of two hours on Wednesday to move to the brink of a semi-final spot in Melbourne, but his efforts were undermined by an upper right leg injury. Struggling to move freely, Musetti retired when 1-3 down in the third set and later revealed it had not been a sudden outbreak of pain. 

 “I felt it at the beginning of the second set,” said Musetti in his post-match press conference. “I felt there was something strange in my right leg. I continued to play, because I was playing really, really, really well, but I was feeling that the pain was increasing, and the problem was not going away. 

 “At the end, when I took the medical timeout, to stay three minutes, I sat, and when I started to play again, I felt even more and the level of the pain was getting higher and higher. So not much to say about it.”

 Musetti was in a prime position to claim his first win against Djokovic at a major in four attempts, and just his second triumph in 11 Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings overall between the two. The 23-year-old, who was competing in his maiden Australian Open quarter-final, acknowledged that the timing of the injury was particularly cruel. 

 “Definitely, yes,” said Musetti, when asked whether it was the toughest injury-related situation of his career. “Honestly, I never imagined the feeling of leading two sets to zero against Novak and playing like that. Having the lead in the match like that and being forced to retire is something that, of course, I could never imagine. Of course, it's really painful.”

 While he attempted to play on even after having treatment from the tournament physio at 1-2 in the second set, Musetti revealed any hopes that he could finish the match were unrealistic. 

 “It was a little bit too high, so it was impossible to tape it,” said the two-time ATP Tour champion. “I feel personally that I know my body, and I feel personally that I'm kind of secure that this is a tear, unfortunately.”

 Novak Djokovic added another milestone to his illustrious career simply by stepping on court Wednesday for his Australian Open quarter-final against Lorenzo Musetti. 

 The former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic became just the third man to play 1,400 tour-level matches. Following his win via retirement in the milestone-breaking meeting with Musetti, Djokovic holds a 1167-233 career record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

 The 38-year-old Djokovic joins his fellow ATP No. 1 Club members Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer as the only men to hit 1,400 tour-level outings. Djokovic holds the best winning percentage (83.4%) of the three, followed by Federer (82%) and Connors (81.8%). 




 Only two men aside from Connors, Federer and Djokovic have even contested more than 1,300 tour-level matches. They are Rafael Nadal and Ivan Lendl, who are also former World No. 1s. 

 Djokovic's win percentage is the best of all 29 members of the ATP No. 1 Club. His closest rival in that category is Nadal, who retired in 2024 with a 1080-228 record in tour-level matches, equivalent to an 82.6% success rate.

Novak Djokovic has advanced to the semifinals of the Australian Open for the 13th time in his career after his opponent, Lorenzo Musetti, retired in the third set of their quarterfinal match on Wednesday due to injury.The Italian had won the first two sets, 6-4, 6-3, but began struggling with what appeared to be a leg injury early in the third set. While serving at 1-3, 15-40, he was forced to stop and approached the net for the handshake.“I don't know what to say except that I feel really sorry for him. He was the far better player. I was on my way home tonight," Djokovic, a 10-time champion at the Australian Open, said in his on-court interview.“I don't know what to say, these kind of things happen in sport, and it happened to me a few times, but being in the quarters of a Grand Slam and two sets to love up, and being in full control, I mean it's so unfortunate. I don't know what else I can say. I really wish him a speedy recovery.“He should have been a winner today, no doubt.”

Musetti had lost the pair's last six meetings in a row, and early on it looked like more of that was on its way as Djokovic broke him in his opening service game for a 2-0 lead, but the Italian stormed back with four games in a row of his own—not only getting the break back, but going up a break of serve—and eventually clinching the first set after 54 minutes.Then, after trading breaks in the first two games of the second set, Musetti broke for 2-1, and after five straight holds, broke again for a two-set lead.Musetti was thoroughly in control, hitting a combined total of 25 winners to 17 unforced errors across the first two sets, while Djokovic had 19 to 31.But Djokovic got off to a quick start in the third set, going up 3-1, and while serving at 15-40 in the next game, Musetti's injury was just too much.Djokovic had been struggling with blisters during the match, but gave full credit to Musetti for outplaying him during the first two sets.“I had like four winners in the first two games and no unforced errors, and then the rest of the match I had another four winners and probably 40 errors,” he joked. “That's what Lorenzo does to you. He makes you play, and when you think the point is finished, it's not. Obviously a little bit more wind today, swirly conditions, and when you attack him, you don't know what to expect, whether it's going to be a crosscourt passing shot, or short slice, or he's going to go full flat in your body or just a looping ball to my weakest shot, which is my overhead, which I think we've seen today again.“What can I say. I tried my best, really. I can't complain. Yes, blister here and there, but nothing majorly bothered me. I just wasn't feeling the ball today in the first couple of sets, which is also due to his quality and his variety in the game. I'm just extremely lucky to get through this one today.”

It's not the way he would have wanted it to happen, but Djokovic's retirement victory over Musetti did give him yet another record—the most career match wins in Australian Open history, for a man or a woman.It was his 103rd match win at the event, surpassing the previous record of 102, which belonged to Roger Federer. Serena Williams is next with 92.Djokovic is now through to the semifinals in Melbourne for the 13th time in his career, where he'll play either Jannik Sinner or Ben Shelton.

So I've been waiting for the time where I could kind of break through.”Pegula needed one hour and 35 minutes to close out the victory, capitalizing on an error-strewn performance from Anisimova. She struck 20 winners to Anisimova's 18 and kept her unforced errors to 21—almost half of Anisimova's 44.The second set proved more competitive as Anisimova flashed her trademark power, but she struggled to sustain the level. Pegula remained patient and composed, pulling away in a dominant tiebreak to seal the win.

“She doesn't make many mistakes,” Anisimova said afterward. “So if your game is off, like today, then obviously it makes it a bit more difficult… She just plays such consistent tennis, it's not easy, but then again, you have to make at least two or three balls in the court…“That's how I expected her to play, so it wasn't surprising. I think if anything, I was just more surprised by my own game.”Into her third career Grand Slam semifinal—and her first away from U.S. soil—Pegula will next face No. 5 seed Elena Rybakina.Pegula and Rybakina have split their six previous meetings evenly, with Rybakina winning their most recent clash at the WTA Finals in Riyadh.

On her fourth try, Jessica Pegula advanced to her first semifinal in Melbourne on Wednesday with a straight-sets victory over compatriot Amanda Anisimova, the third American she's beaten at the event.  A meeting with Elena Rybakina awaits.

The last time Jessica Pegula faced a compatriot in the Australian Open quarterfinals, she fell in three sets to eventual finalist Jennifer Brady in 2021.

Five years later, it was Pegula who reigned victorious in an all-American affair, outlasting No. 4 seed Amanda Anisimova 6-2, 7-6 (1) in 1 hour and 35 minutes on Wednesday to reach her first Australian Open semifinal, where she'll face Elena Rybakina.

“It's awesome,” Pegula said in her on-court interview. “I've been able to go deeper at the US Open the last couple years, but here was the first Slam that I really broke through at. And I was a three, and then this year, four-time quarterfinalist.

“I was like, ‘It's got to be coming, you know. The next round, I've got to get to the semi.' Because I feel like I play some really good tennis here and I like the conditions. And I've always felt like, even matches I've lost here, that I've played well. So I've been waiting for the time where I could kind of break through.”

It's the third time Pegula has advanced to a Grand Slam semifinal, and her first time at a Major other than the US Open. She did it by continuing her dominance against fellow Americans.

The win marked her eighth straight victory over an American at a Grand Slam. She also became the first American woman to defeat three compatriots in a single Australian Open since Gigi Fernández accomplished the feat in 1993. Pegula beat McCartney Kessler in the second round, defending champion Madison Keys in the fourth round and Anisimova in the quarters.

She also improved to 4-0 against Anisimova at the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz level.

Here's how she got it done:

Keeping it clean: Both Pegula and Anisimova reached the quarterfinals without dropping a set. But while that suggested both were in top form, Anisimova's path had been far shakier than the scorelines indicated.

The World No. 4 entered the match averaging 28 unforced errors across the first four rounds, and the trend continued. She finished with 44 unforced errors, including seven double faults in the second set alone, to just 18 winners.

Pegula, meanwhile, kept it clean. She hit 21 unforced errors to 20 winners, and aside from a costly double fault while serving for the match at 6-5 in the second set, she kept her margins tight throughout.

Serving superiority: Overall, the 31-year-old out-served her opponent. While Anisimova landed a slightly higher percentage of first serves (61% to 60%), Pegula dominated nearly every other category. 

She struck more aces (six to two), committed fewer double faults (two to seven) and won a higher percentage of first-serve points (70% to 58%). The biggest difference came on second serve, where Pegula won an impressive 64% (16 of 25) of those points compared to 39% (11 of 28) for Anisimova.

Pegula punished Anisimova's second serve, routinely stepping in and attacking. It was part of a concerted effort; one she executed from start to finish.

Aggressive returning: Thanks in large part to winning more than 60% of points on Anisimova's second serve, Pegula generated 11 break points, including seven in the second set alone. She converted four, two in each set.

While the first set was straightforward, the second set was anything but. After Anisimova earned her first break of the match for a 5-3 lead, giving herself a chance to serve out the set, Pegula immediately broke back. She held in the next game, then broke again for a 6-5 with the help of a forehand winner that set up her second break point.

“I felt like I was winning a lot of the points,” Pegula said. “I felt like I could win the rallies and I felt like I could put pressure on her serve. So (after I was broken), I just told myself to, ‘Gear right back up. You've got to win this tiebreak unless you want to go to a third set.' And I really didn't want to. So luckily, yeah, I was able to kind of flip that switch.

“When she's down, she really plays with nothing to lose and that's really dangerous. So I'm happy I was just able to flip that in the tiebreak.”

Pegula grabbed the first mini-break at 3-1, then took another point off Anisimova's serve for a 4-1 lead as frustration began to set in for the two-time Grand Slam finalist. Pegula capitalized, reeling off seven straight points to close out the match and book a semifinal date with Rybakina.

What's next: “She has a massive serve, big groundies, cool as a cucumber, you get nothing out of her,” Pegula said of Rybakina. “And she's been playing some great tennis, honestly since the end of last year. But I'm going to do my best to hopefully crack the code on her for the next round and we'll see how it goes.”

Pegula and Rybakina have split their six career meetings. Pegula won their first matchup in Miami in 2022, but Rybakina claimed their most recent encounter, rallying from a set down in the semis of the WTA Finals a few months ago.

A win would send Pegula to her first Australian Open final, while for Rybakina, a second appearance in the championship match is on the line.

On her fourth try, Jessica Pegula advanced to her first semifinal in Melbourne on Wednesday with a straight-sets victory over compatriot Amanda Anisimova, the third American she's beaten at the event.  A meeting with Elena Rybakina awaits.

Elena Rybakina advanced to the Australian Open semifinals after defeating Iga Swiatek in straight sets and will face No. 6 seed Jessica Pegula. Rybakina dominated with her powerful serve and aggressive play, securing her 18th win in her last 19 matches, and an eighth straight Top 10 win.

For the first time since reaching the 2023 final, Elena Rybakina will play in the semifinals of the Australian Open after upsetting No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek in Wednesday's quarterfinals 7-5, 6-1. 

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Fifth seed Rybakina pulled away in the 1 hour and 35-minute match by winning eight of the last nine games, and leveled her all-time record against Swiatek to 6-6 in the process. After she was broken in the first game of the match, the 2025 ace leader on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz rounded into form on serve in stunning fashion -- despite only landing 49% of her first serves in the match. She dug out of a 0-40 deficit at 1-1 in the first set, and only lost 12 points in eight subsequent service games. 

Eleven of her 26 winners were aces, and she hit just 19 unforced errors -- but 14 of those miscues came in the first set, where nine of 12 games went to deuce. Swiatek, by contrast, struggled for the same consistency. She hit just 10 winners, and her error count ballooned to 25 by the match's end.

"I'm really pleased with the win," Rybakina said in her on-court interview. "We know each other pretty well, and I was just trying to stay aggressive. In the first set, the first serve wasn't working for both of us, so we were trying to step in on the second serve and put pressure on each other. In the second set, I just started to play more free, serve better, and I'm really happy with the win."

Rybakina earned her 18th victory in her last 19 matches, dating back to last October, and her eighth consecutive win over a Top 10 player. The 2022 Wimbledon champion will face No. 6 seed Jessica Pegula, who was the winner of the all-American quarterfinal against No. 4 seed Amanda Anisimova 6-2, 7-6(1) in the hopes of reaching her third career Grand Slam singles final.

The Kazakh told reporters after her victory that her late-season 2025 surge, capped by an undefeated title run at the WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF, is still putting wind in her sails in Melbourne.

"I think last season the last couple of tournaments I played I gained some confidence throughout tough matches," she said. "Of course, this is something I tried to carry to this year, this season. Still, a lot of things to improve, to work on, but the most important that I'm trying to stay aggressive whenever I get the chance to step in, maybe risk a little bit.

"Like even today, a couple of shots were very close to the line, on the line, so I'm glad it was going my way, but definitely the most important for my game to stay aggressive."

Swiatek, meanwhile, told reporters that she struggled to keep up with the "high intensity" match after a first set that could've gone either way.

"In first set I think it was a difference of a couple points," she said. "She also, I thought, gave me some chances on her serve, and sometimes I used them. Sometimes it was, like, 30-All and, for example, I missed one return. You know, I wanted to be aggressive on the second serve, so sometimes, yeah, will make mistakes. But if you want to break, you need to make it in in the moment like that.

"Then in the second set I thought, I don't know, that the pace from her got a little bit even higher, and she was more precise, and maybe I dropped the intensity at the beginning especially."

"I know what I need to improve, and it's kind of the same stuff that I had in my mind before the tournament as well. So there's no breakthrough lesson," she continued. "I'm just going to keep doing my job, and hopefully the next tournament I'll get some stuff, you know, settled in terms of what I wanted to do with my game."

Approved on tour but barred at Slams, the health tracker controversy exposes the sport's complicated rulebook.ByStephanie LivaudaisPublished Jan 28, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 28, 2026

WHOOP is firing back as controversy continues at the Australian Open, after world No. 1s Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka were asked to remove their wearable fitness trackers before competing in Melbourne.The drama erupted when chair umpire Marija Cicak instructed Alcaraz to take off the device—which he had been discreetly wearing under a wristband—before his fourth-round match against Tommy Paul. Alcaraz complied, but his visibly confused and frustrated reaction sparked widespread debate online and left many fans at home scratching their heads.“Ridiculous. Whoop is approved by the International Tennis Federation for in-match wear and poses no safety risk,” Will Ahmed, founder and CEO of WHOOP, wrote on social media. “Let the athletes measure their bodies.

With the international spotlight intensifying and social media buzzing, WHOOP leaned into the moment, releasing a video featuring top ambassadors across sports—from Cristiano Ronaldo and Rory McIlroy to Sha'Carri Richardson and Sabalenka—wearing the signature band on their way to victory, juxtaposed with footage of Alcaraz being asked to remove his.In the comments, fans rallied behind the players. “To be forced to take off my Whoop and miss logging my strain for even one day… I would be absolutely devastated,” one user wrote. “We stand with you Carlos.”So what caused the confusion?Wearables like WHOOP have been approved for in-match use for years on the ATP and WTA Tours and are classified as approved devices under ITF rules.

According to the ITF, all current WHOOP models (3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and MG) are approved as Player Analysis Technology (PAT) for use during matches, provided haptic feedback is disabled and players can only access their data during periods when coaching is permitted. However, the ITF ultimately leaves the final decision to each of the T7 events, which can choose to allow or prohibit the device.Tennis Australia confirmed there are “ongoing discussions” with WHOOP about the issue. In the meantime, organizers pointed players to data available through its technology partner, Bolt6, which also manages electronic line calling at the tournament.“Wearables are currently not permitted at Grand Slams. The Australian Open is involved in ongoing discussions on how this situation could change,” organizers said in a statement.“Some wearables provide athletes with an indication of internal load (measures like heart rate), which can give them a 360-degree view of the work they're doing and how their bodies respond.“In terms of other data provided to athletes and their teams at the AO, players can monitor key external load measures such as distance covered, changes of direction, high acceleration events and speed/spin of shots via Bolt6.”

At the heart of the debate is the distinction between tennis-specific external load metrics and the deeper, personalized internal data captured through 24/7 health tracking—and whether having access to that information during a match could provide a competitive advantage for some players.For many athletes, however, those insights have long become standard tools. WHOOP became an official WTA partner in 2021, was approved for ATP use in 2024 and by the ITF in 2025.The data is also central to how teams manage training loads and recovery—particularly at an Australian Open played in punishing heat. On multiple days, extreme temperatures triggered the tournament's Heat Rule, suspending matches and underscoring the physical toll on players.Read More: “Your body goes into shock”: Jim Courier weighs in as AO heat rule sparks debate“There is certain data what we would like to track a little bit on court,” two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner explained. “It's not for the live thing.

EXCLUSIVE: Legendary's live-action feature adaptation of Gundam looks to have found a home as sources tell Deadline that Netflix is on board to distribute the pic. Sydney Sweeney and Noah Centineo are on board to star with Sweet Tooth director Jim Mickle helming.


	Netflix and Legendary could not be reached for comment.

	The project has been co-developed between Legendary and franchise owner Bandai Namco Filmworks, from Mickle's own script. Mickle also will produce with his partner Linda Moran through their production company Nightshade.


	The plot is under wraps, but the film will mark the first live-action entry into the Gundam world.

	











	One of the most revered anime, Gundam pioneered the sci-fi subgenre known as mecha, IP that centers on giant fighting robots. Gundam is set in the Universal Century, a future where humanity has colonized space. When a rebellion erupts between Earth and its colonies, the ensuing conflict is fought by pilots in massive mechanized contraptions known as mobile suits. The long-running multimedia franchise launched with series the Mobile Suit Gundam in 1979. Since then, the internationally renowned Yoshiyuki Tomino-created endeavor has spanned 83 animated series and movies, in addition to a lucrative merchandising arm that generates $600 million annually. 


	Legendary Entertainment announced its development of a Gundam film with Netflix in the spring of 2021, with Jordan Vogt-Roberts attached to direct the pic following his work with the studio on its hit Monsterverse installment Kong: Skull Island. However, the streamer and Vogt-Roberts no longer are involved.

LOL — that Kim Novak movie ain't happening.

It's a live action anime adaptation, those have always been trash. The only real exceptions are one piece and Alita but Noah centineo doesn't inspire confidence

As Tump is a fan of her, Im sure he'll do a screening for her as he did for Melania. Congrats I guess..

of course she is. Gah.

yes she is Big in Japan, and talented perfect for this sort of film

Well there goes any excitement I had for it

	With a chant of “ICE Out Now!” Bruce Springsteen wasted no time condemning Donald Trump and the killings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents in Minnesota.


	In classic form from the the card-carrying anti-MAGA rock legend and a little audio addition from actual protests, the 4:35-minute “Streets of Minneapolis” calls out “King Trump and his private army from the DHS.” Listen to the track and read the lyrics below.


	“I wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released it to you today in response to the state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis,” Springsteen said on social media Wednesday morning with his “Streets of Minneapolis” song – which you can hear here: 

	











	The Boss added in his posting: “It's dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good. Stay free, Bruce Springsteen.”

	Having decried the former Apprentice host's return to power repeatedly over the past year on and off-stage, Springsteen's words and music today join a chorus of big name outrage against ICE tactics in the northern state and throughout the nation. In the hours and days after 37-year-old ICU Nurse Pretti was killed on January 24 due to multiple ICE gunshots for trying to help a woman federal agents were shoving at a Minneapolis intersection, Kamala Harris, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Joe Biden have all lamented that “violence and terror have no place in the United States of America, especially when it's our own government targeting American citizens,” as the 46th POTUS wrote online on January 27.

	











	With a canon full of topical songs like 2001's “American Skin (41 Shots),” 2012's “We Take Care of Our Own” and his 2025 digital release The Land of Hope and Dreams EP, the openly progressively political Springsteen has never turned around a new song in such quick order as he did this week.

	A hint of what was coming may have been in the offering back on January 17 when the Oscar and Woody Guthrie Prize winner showed up at Red Bank, New Jersey's Light of Day Winterfest and dedicated his song “The Promised Land” to Renee Good, who was fatally shot in the face in her car by an ICE agent on January 7. At the show in his home state, Springsteen told the crowd: “If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed mass federal troops invading an American city using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president.”


	Trump back in May 2025 called the stadium-packing Springsteen a “dried-out prune of a rocker” and later, as the 79-year-old Trump often does, threatened some sort of federal probe of the performer.


	As of yet, as the backlash to the chaos of the administration's cruel immigration policy and the killings in Minnesota grows, there has been no response from Trump to the 76-year-old Springsteen's new song. Give it time.

	In the meantime, here's what Bruce Springsteen said in the scathing lyrics from “Streets of Minneapolis.”


	Through the winter's ice and coldDown Nicollet AvenueA city aflame fought fire and ice‘Neath an occupier's bootsKing Trump's private army from the DHSGuns belted to their coatsCame to Minneapolis to enforce the lawOr so their story goesAgainst smoke and rubber bulletsBy the dawn's early lightCitizens stood for justiceTheir voices ringing through the nightAnd there were bloody footprintsWhere mercy should have stoodAnd two dead left to die on snow-filled streetsAlex Pretti and Renee Good


	Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voiceSinging through the bloody mistWe'll take our stand for this landAnd the stranger in our midstHere in our home they killed and roamedIn the winter of '26We'll remember the names of those who diedOn the streets of Minneapolis


	Trump's federal thugs beat up onHis face and his chestThen we heard the gunshotsAnd Alex Pretti lay in the snow, deadTheir claim was self defense, sirJust don't believe your eyesIt's our blood and bonesAnd these whistles and phonesAgainst Miller and Noem's dirty lies


	Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voiceCrying through the bloody mistWe'll remember the names of those who diedOn the streets of MinneapolisNow they say they're here to uphold the lawBut they trample on our rightsIf your skin is black or brown my friendYou can be questioned or deported on sight


	In chants of ICE out nowOur city's heart and soul persistsThrough broken glass and bloody tearsOn the streets of Minneapolis


	Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voiceSinging through the bloody mistHere in our home they killed and roamedIn the winter of '26We'll take our stand for this landAnd the stranger in our midstWe'll remember the names of those who diedOn the streets of MinneapolisWe'll remember the names of those who diedOn the streets of Minneapolis

Bruce Springsteen has released a protest song denouncing President Donald J. Trump and the “private army” of his Department of Homeland Security, in the wake of ICE's killings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis. Listen to “Streets of Minneapolis” below.

Springsteen shared the following statement:

I wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released it to you today in response to the state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis. It's dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.

Stay free, Bruce Springsteen

The rallying full-band song memorializes Pretti and Good in verses that pull no punches on the crimes of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Trump's federal thugs beat up on his face and his chest,” Springsteen sings. “Then we heard the gunshots, and Alex Pretti lay in the snow, dead.”

A stirring refrain closes the song:

Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voiceSinging through the bloody mistHere in our home they killed and roamedIn the winter of '26We'll take our stand for this landAnd the stranger in our midst

Earlier this month, Springsteen dedicated a rendition of “The Promised Land” to Good during an impromptu appearance at a New Jersey festival, telling the crowd: “If you believe in democracy, in liberty; if you believe that truth still matters, and that it's worth speaking out, and it's worth fighting for; if you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it; if you stand against heavily armed, masked, federal troops invading American cities, and using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens; if you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest; then send a message to this president. And as the mayor of that city has said, ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”

Another impassioned speech in protest of Trump's “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,” given last year at a show in Manchester, England, was captured on a live EP released a week later.

EXCLUSIVE: Will Poulter and Odessa Young are set to join Adam Driver and Regina Hall in Netflix‘s upcoming hostage thriller series Rabbit, Rabbit, from creator-showrunner Peter Craig, director Philip Barantini and MRC.


	The series follows escaped convict J-Will (Driver), who after being cornered by law enforcement at a truck stop takes hostages in an effort to bargain for his freedom. But the standoff soon escalates into an unmanageable social experiment with his captives, as well as an emotional poker match with a veteran FBI Crisis Negotiator (Hall) trained in “tactical empathy.”

Marc Anthony's eighth baby is on the way!

The singer announced Wednesday that his wife, Nadia Ferreira, is pregnant with their second child.

“Happy 3rd anniversary!!” the Grammy winner, 57, and his partner, 26, captioned a joint Instagram upload. “What a great gift life gives us. God is great ✨.”

“Marquito is going to be a big brother,” they concluded, using their toddler Marco's nickname.

The 2-year-old made an appearance in the social media upload, pressing his hand against his mom's baby bump.

The little one was born on Father's Day in June 2023, five months after Anthony and Ferreira walked down the aisle in Miami.

“God's timing is always perfect,” the new mom gushed via Instagram at the time. “Happy Father's Day ♥️.”

Marco joined the actor's big brood, which includes six other children from past relationships with Debbie Rosado, Dayanara Torres and Jennifer Lopez.

Anthony shares daughter Arianna and son Chase with Rosado, as well as sons Cristian and Ryan with Torres.

Additionally, he and Lopez, 56, are the parents of 17-year-old twins Emme and Maximilian.

Anthony and Ferreira started dating in early 2022, making their romance Instagram-official that March and getting engaged two months later.

The duo's January 2023 wedding was a star-studded affair, with David Beckham among the A-list names on the guest list.

Anthony, notably, performed at David's eldest son Brooklyn Beckham's Florida wedding to Nicola Peltz the previous year — and he has been roped into the famous family's recent drama.

When Brooklyn, 26, called out his parents for “controlling” behavior in a scathing Instagram statement last week, he blasted his mom, Victoria Beckham, for an “inappropriate” dance at his nuptials spearheaded by Anthony.

The songwriter referred to Victoria, 51, as the “most beautiful woman in the room” during the “humiliating” moment, according to DJ Fat Tony.

He allegedly instructed Brooklyn to put his hands on his mother's hips.

Anthony has yet to comment on the rampant headlines regarding the viral wedding stunt.

[Editor's Note: This article contains spoilers for “The Housemaid.”]

One of the reasons director Paul Feig‘s adaptation of Freida McFadden's bestselling thriller “The Housemaid” has been cleaning up at the box office is that it's a movie that not only rewards but demands repeat viewings. Rebecca Sonnenshine's twisty script, like the book, reboots in the middle of the story to reveal that the man we thought was the perfect husband (Brandon Sklenar) is in fact an abusive sociopath — meaning that everything that happens in the first half plays completely differently the second time around.

 










That created unusual challenges for production designer Elizabeth Jones and set decorator Paige Mitchell, who had to create a location — the “Winchester” house in which most of the story takes place — that would seem inviting and luxurious on first viewing but sinister and threatening in retrospect. “The overall approach was this idea of, ‘What if Nancy Meyers did a horror film?'” Jones told IndieWire. “Quiet luxury was our baseline, but then how do we take that to another level and make it more interesting?”

For Mitchell, the key was subtly introducing clues into the environment that hinted at the darkness lurking beneath the surface. “When you initially come in, the rooms are white and minimalistic, but as the movie goes on weirder objects come into play,” the set decorator told IndieWire. Jones added that the use of color was intentionally reserved for private areas like the deranged husband's home screening room. “We tried to limit color in the more public-facing spaces, but as you get further into the house, we use deeper reds.”

One of Jones and Mitchell's first conversations was about how the house could reveal the personalities of its inhabitants, something Mitchell does subtly throughout the film with props like a Maria Pergay lamp in the main couple's bedroom. “At first it appears to be just a normal, beautiful silver lamp, but if you look closer, it's made from this antler that gives it an ominous quality,” Mitchell said. The key to several of the furnishings and accessories was to make them seem like things only a wealthy person would own — but a wealthy person with something just a bit off.

“On first viewing, everything is nice and cohesive,” Jones said, “but when you look close, there's something nasty about all of it.” That idea informed the selection of art for the house, which Jones said was chosen largely to express the husband's true views about women. “We had a lot of Easter eggs. Anyplace where we could portray violence against women, we were trying to do that — we talked a lot about the idea of the male gaze.”

 










“We wanted to show how [Sklenar's character] doesn't really see women as people, but as something for his pleasure,” Mitchell said. For a lengthy scene between Sklenar and Sydney Sweeney in the home screening room, Mitchell selected a piece depicting a Playboy bunny as a bride. “I was trying to signify how he sees the bride as an object and something for him to control and have power over.”

Because most of the movie took place in the Winchester house, Jones knew finding the right location was imperative — and it wasn't easy. “We looked at 75 to 100 homes,” Jones said, adding that she wanted a house like the ones she had read about in books like “Jane Eyre” and “Rebecca,” novels where the central home was a character. The filmmakers ultimately landed on a house they found in an old Zillow listing that not only had many of the characteristics they were looking for but some additional features that informed changes in the script.

“In the original story, Andrew was supposed to be pushed off of a balcony,” Jones said. “Then we saw this elegant spiral staircase, and the producer said, ‘You could throw him down that staircase.'” Feig loved the idea, and after some tests with a dummy, reworked the finale to create the audience-pleasing death scene that now serves as the movie's climax. Feig's “more is more” approach was one of the things Jones and Mitchell found most pleasurable about working on the movie.

 










“He really let us go to town,” Jones said. “There were very few times when he would say, ‘Ladies, rein it in.'” Mitchell wondered at times — as when the art department suggested snake wallpaper in a bathroom — if Feig would think they had gone too far. “He always said ‘No, no, no, keep going,'” Mitchell said. “It really allowed us to push things and get out of that world of same old prop house rentals, which I feel like can really flatten the world of the movie visually. When there's room to play, it's a great opportunity.”

AGC Studios has boarded psychological thriller Sweat in a deal that will see it finance, co-produce and handle international sales on the production, based on Swedish Polish director Magnus von Horn's Cannes-selected film of the same name.


Ana de Armas has signed to star as rising fitness influencer Emma Kent who dreams of matching the success of her idol, social media superstar Kat Highbrook.


	Her carefully curated world begins to collapse when an encounter with Kat goes horribly wrong, and she is forced into a dangerous arrangement with Trent, an obsessive fan. His unhinged devotion pushes her to choose how far she's willing to go for fame.

	Guy Stodel is producing under the Rosto Inc. banner, alongside Blakeson via his Crimple Beck production company, and AGC Chairman and CEO Ford.

WME Independent, CAA Media Finance and AGC are co-repping U.S. rights.  Additional casting is underway.


	Von Horn's original film was selected for the 2020 edition of Cannes Film Festival which was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It enjoyed a buzzy international career nonetheless with Mubi snapping up rights for the U.S. Latin America, India and Turkey.

	











	Cuban-born, Blonde Oscar-nominated actress Ana de Armas is a coming off a high-profile 2025 which saw her hit the big screen in John Wick spin-off Ballerina and Ron Howard's Eden.


	De Armas is repped by WME, Kuranda Management, Bailey Brand Management, Wolf Kasteler Public Relations and Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks; Blakeson is repped by WME, David Higham Associates and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher.  


	The deal was negotiated by Christopher Tricarico of Tricarico Chavez LLP for ROSTO Inc. and by Anant Tamirisa on behalf of AGC.

Just raise your glasses high! “Vanderpump Rules” Season 12 newbie, Angelica Jensen, exclusively sat down with EntertainmentNOW to discuss everything that happened so far on season 12.

Of course, she couldn't help but acknowledge the OG crew, telling us, “The last cast from the previous seasons have been so iconic, and so we had what felt like humongous shoes to fill.”

She added, “I think we all came into this with open hearts, and it's a time capsule moment. A lot of us were going through so many different things, so the dynamic is so … we just bring out so much in each other. It really was a crazy time in all of our lives.” 

Angelica was introduced to the “Vanderpump Rules” cast in episode 3 of season 12, and she made quite the entrance with an endearing fall during the photo shoot.

“I think my entrance made it a bit more easy for me. I was really lucky to have that. It was very much a mistake. People already had friendships, alliances: Audrey [Lingle] and the cousins, Venus [Binkley] and Natalie [Maguire], Kim [Suarez]and Marcus [Johnson],” Angelica said.

What caused the trip was her heels over a tripod, with Angelica adding, “Lisa was so nice. So was everyone else.”

Although viewers saw her bonding with Natalie from the start, Angelica revealed she had a deeper friendship with Kim. 

“My strongest connection in the group was actually Kim. Natalie and I, we had our moments, but I think she just had a lot going on,” she said, referring to the bartender's up and down relationship with Demy Selem and Marcus. “I think that I actually gravitated a lot towards Kim.” 

Fans see a bit of a love triangle in “Vanderpump Rules” season 12 when Natalie and Shayne begin a flirtation, but nothing came of it. Then, Angelica set her eyes on the model/actor after her brief romance with Jason Cohen fell flat. 

What viewers don't see on the show, however, is that Angelica got the okay from Natalie to pursue her interest with Shayne. 

“When we were at The Abbey, I, of course, told Jason I just want to be friends. And I actually went to Natalie right after that, and I asked her, ‘How do you feel if I start talking to Shayne?'” Angelica exclusively explained to EntertainmentNOW.

She continued, “And then when Audrey and I were having matchas, I asked Audrey, ‘I don't really like Jason. There's someone else I have my eye on.'”

“The girlies were getting together. It wasn't as spontaneous as it looks,” Angelica clarified. “I asked Natalie, ‘Hey, I know you guys were talking before. It didn't work out. Can I make a move?” According to Angelica, Natalie told her, “Yeah, I'm over that.

As for whether she and Shayne are still seeing each other, Angelica teased, “I'd say we're all still very close, but you'll have to watch to really find out, because a lot does happen.”

Angelica outing Jason's penis pump was a big deal mid-season, and while she has no regrets talking about it, she does feel bad that it led to a fallout with Audrey.

“I felt like we had this natural bond when we hung out. That's when she presented it to me as a joke,” she told us. 

Angelica admitted to taking the joke too far at the time because she felt targeted by Jason and Chris [Hahn], but when she spilled the beans about the penis pump, she had just come from an X-ray session after getting thrown on the mat by Jason during their Jiu-Jitsu date, and was basically trauma dumping on Lisa Vanderpump.

“At the end of the day, I never had malicious intent,” she said, expressing how badly she feels about her rift with Audrey. “I think we're still healing and trying to move forward,” Angelica shared, adding that fans will see more of that rift played out at the reunion.

Angelica was in a bit of a messy situation with her ex-boyfriend at the start of “Vanderpump Rules” season 12, but as she explained to EntertainmentNOW, it was more of a transition phase.

“I never depended on my ex. I may or may not have been able to move out, but when I was looking for places, I was getting approved for places more expensive than the situation I was currently in with my ex, because we lived together out of love. My next goal was to be married and have kids with this partner, and unfortunately, we just fell out of love, and I tried so hard to keep that relationship together,” she told us.

Circumstances surrounding the rent and lease forced Angelica to stay with her ex for another month, but as she says now, “I'm an independent girlie!”

Angelica shared that she did watch the original “Vanderpump Rules” show, but refrained from doing so until after she filmed her season so that she wouldn't be influenced by the former cast. “I really wanted to live my own experience,” she told us.

When asked who her favorite OG cast member was, Angelica immediately named one person: Stassi Schroeder. “She was the underdog in the beginning, too. Nobody believed her with Jax [Taylor]. Nobody had her side with the whole pregnancy scare, and she really had to fight to get that respect.”

“Look at where she is now. She's an incredible woman, and she's doing her thing, and I totally look up to her,” Angelica gushed.

Quinton Aaron, best known for starring opposite Sandra Bullock in “The Blind Side,” remains in critical condition after being placed on life support. 

TMZ reported on 25th January that the 41-year-old actor collapsed last week while climbing the stairs at his apartment and was rushed to the hospital, where he is being treated for a severe blood infection. As friends and loved ones continue to rally around the actor, Bullock is quietly offering her support.

Friends now say his condition is more serious than reported. “He currently is in dire straits, and it is touch and go for survival, but family and friends are keeping an overall positive outlook,” a source told the Daily Mail.

Bullock, who won an Academy Award for her performance in “The Blind Side,” is said to be aware of her former co-star's condition. 

“Though they haven't stayed in touch [since the movie], Sandra is aware that he is in rough shape and she is monitoring the situation and obviously hoping for the best,” the source said.

In the 2009 film, Aaron portrayed NFL player Michael Oher, a homeless teenager taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Bullock. 

The performance marked a career milestone for Bullock and brought her Academy Award recognition.

A family friend told The Daily Mail that Aaron and Bullock “do check in with each other every once in a while,” describing Bullock as “absolutely incredible.”

The source added that Aaron is undergoing extensive testing and receiving round-the-clock medical care. “He is still a long way away from recovery,” the insider told The Daily Mail.

As per the Daily Mail Report, those close to Aaron, his condition remains uncertain as doctors continue to assess the full scope of his health issues.

“He is going through many tests, getting the best care one can get, but it is scary because the outlook isn't the best right now,” the source said.

The insider added that Aaron's long-term health challenges are contributing to the concern.

The source said his ongoing “battle with his weight,” including a dramatic 200-pound weight loss last year, “has been a lifelong situation and has always been something to monitor.”

“If he survives, there will be a renewed focus on his overall health after so many years have taken their toll,” the source said, noting that the next several days remain critical.

Bullock has not publicly appeared or commented on the issue.

For the first few days of this year's Sundance, we heard near-constant patter about how in-demand the latest Olivia Wilde film was among distributors. The film premiered on Saturday night, and Deadline reported on Monday that A24, Netflix, Searchlight, Focus Features, Black Bear and Neon were among the distributors in the mix with bids quickly exceeding distribution rights to the film. The bidding war was still raging as of yesterday afternoon when, per Deadline, Warner Bros. “new contemporary film label” tossed its hat in the ring. However, this morning, A24 has emerged victorious, and will distribute The Invite after an eight-figure bid, according to The Hollywood Reporter. That trade suggests that the deal is unlikely to be surpassed at this year's festival.

It's not hard to imagine why the project would attract so much attention, given the names attached to it. Starring and directed by Wilde, The Invite comes from a script written by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack and also stars Seth Rogen, Ed Norton, Penelope Cruz. The sexual rom-com is a remake of the Spanish language film Sentimental, and sees Rogen and Wilde play a married couple on the rocks who host a dinner party with a communicative and passionate couple portrayed by Norton and Cruz. 

Describing the premiere as “the best night of my life,” Wilde told Deadline that “What this project taught me was it's actually OK to have non-negotiables going into something… this time I was like, ‘Guys, what if we just do it the way we've always wanted to do it?' And it was so rewarding that it made me think, that's what I want to do. It's impossible. It'll never happen again. But I'm really happy.” The Invite is Wilde's third directorial effort, after 2019's Booksmart and 2023's Don't Worry Darling.

"Despite rampant misinformation... the reality is that this is an era full of more success stories ... than at any point in history," says Spotify's global head of music.

Senior Writer


	Spotify's global head of music, Charlie Hellman, released a letter to users on Wednesday (Jan. 28), highlighting the platform's contributions to the music industry ahead of its famous Best New Artist Grammy party in Los Angeles. “Spotify paid out more than $11 billion to the music industry, the largest annual payment to music from any retailer in history,” he writes, noting that indie artists and labels accounted for over half of those royalties.


	Hellman notes that “there are now more artists generating over $100k/year from Spotify alone than were getting stocked on record store shelves at the height of the CD era,” but he says that “rampant misinformation” about streaming has led the public to distrust how successful and lucrative these services have been for musicians.


	The letter highlights that Spotify pays two-thirds of its music revenue back to the industry and that given recent price hikes and gains in new subscribers the “music payouts have grown as well.” 


	Today, Spotify accounts for roughly 30% of recorded music revenue, and its payouts are growing at a rate that greatly outpaces other music revenue streams. While Spotify payments surged by 10%, other sources grew by 4%. 


	Hellman's letter comes after a few years of expansion for Spotify. In the last two years, the service moved to include audiobooks in its premium tiers, added music videos in an increasing number of markets, added DJ-like features to playlists, and even hinted at plans to build generative AI models “with the consent of the music industry.” 


	Still, some in the music business, particularly the National Music Publishers' Association, are upset with Spotify, given that the platform used its addition of audiobooks in 2024 as an opportunity to reclassify its premium tiers as “bundles,” a special discounted type of subscription tier, and, in turn, to significantly reduce expected payments to songwriters and publishers by nine figures in its first year. Though many music firms have since struck direct deals with Spotify, including the NMPA itself, to improve remuneration, the NMPA's president and CEO David Israelite recently told Bloomberg that despite its deal with Spotify: “it doesn't change the fact” that it is “at war” over bundling.


	Hellman's letter goes on to point out the company's focuses for 2026, which include increasing videos on the service, fighting deepfakes and streaming fraud, producing more live shows, and leaning into human editorial more than ever. “As AI makes all kinds of content more abundant, human connection has become more valuable, not less,” says Hellman.


Read Hellman's letter, in full, below:


I'm Charlie, and I lead Spotify's music team. As we look at 2026, I want to start with where 2025 landed. 


I'm proud to share that, last year alone, Spotify paid out more than $11 billion to the music industry, the largest annual payment to music from any retailer in history. Once again, independent artists and labels accounted for half of all royalties. 


Big, industry-wide numbers can feel abstract, but that growth is showing up in tangible ways. For example, there are now more artists generating over $100k/year from Spotify alone than were getting stocked on record store shelves at the height of the CD era. That's the real shift and extraordinary progress that these numbers represent. Despite rampant misinformation about how streaming is working today, the reality is that this is an era full of more success stories and promise than at any point in history. 


Today, Spotify accounts for roughly 30% of recorded music revenue. Last year, our payouts grew by more than 10%, while other industry income sources grew by closer to 4%, making Spotify the primary driver of industry revenue growth in 2025.


At the end of the day, growth is driven by fans. More than 750 million people around the world are now paying every month for music streaming, across all streaming services. As that audience has grown, we've also raised prices. Since Spotify pays out two-thirds of all music revenue to the industry – almost 70% of what we take in – as Spotify revenues grow, music payouts have grown as well. 


What about the other third — the money Spotify keeps? That's been our fuel to reinvest directly into the platform in ways that drive more people to pay for music streaming and continue to grow revenues for music. By doing all we can to innovate on behalf of the music industry, we've been able to deliver an unrivaled listening experience, helping connect artists with listeners who are most likely to care about their music. 


One of the reasons we celebrate the Best New Artist nominees each year is because they represent something powerful: artists who've broken through and found their audience. But the path to that moment is steep. With over 100,000 new songs released daily, competing against the entire history of recorded music, emerging artists face an unprecedented challenge in building the early fanbase every successful career needs. We're working across multiple fronts to increase the opportunities available, and ensure more artists have real pathways to success. That's why this year our number one priority is to help more new music and new artists cut through the noise and form real connections with fans. Here's what we're building:


As AI makes all kinds of content more abundant, human connection has become more valuable, not less. Helping fans better understand who artists are and what inspires them establishes real connections that turn casual listeners into long-term fans. To support that, we're bringing more context into the listening experience, whether that's information about the artist, the story behind a song, or moments that show how the music actually comes together. With the upcoming launch of SongDNA, for example, fans can explore the collaborations behind a song—like Addison Rae's breakout work with Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd—and follow those connections deeper into the music. Before long, you're finding your way into new catalogs, like Kloser's work with Ed Sheeran or Anderfjärd's work with Alec Benjamin.


Video also plays a big role in storytelling, and we've only scratched the surface. Especially now, authenticity matters more than production value. A live performance, a stripped-down version, a rehearsal, or a moment from the studio — those make the connection real. For KATSEYE, early behind-the-scenes Clips on their Countdown Page fueled anticipation by bringing fans into the journey leading up to the release of BEAUTIFUL CHAOS. 


Artist Identity & Trust


Storytelling helps fans understand who's behind the music, and ensures authentic creativity stands out from anonymous filler. But that's not enough on its own. Protecting artists' identities is a top priority, and we're building new solutions to prevent impersonation, scams, and mismatched content. 


AI is being exploited by bad actors to flood streaming services with low-quality slop to game the system and attempt to divert royalties away from authentic artists. So we're going to introduce changes to the systems for artist verification, song credits, and protecting artist identity. It's critical to ensuring listeners and rightsholders can trust who made the music they're hearing.


When artists start to connect with fans on Spotify, sustaining that attention becomes the next challenge. The tools artists already use in Spotify for Artists are built for exactly that, and in 2026 we're sharpening them in ways that serve new releases especially. 


Every developing artist is looking to break out. And being added to a hand-selected editorial playlist can mark a turning point for an artist, growing exposure and streams to new heights. For Leon Thomas, pitching songs through Spotify for Artists led to editorial placements on RADAR and RNB X, introducing his music to listeners in more than 180 countries. 


Even more important than the numbers they drive, these playlists reflect human expert opinion. In a world of highly individualized listening through algorithms, editorial curation gives artists and fans a common cultural reference point.


In 2026, you'll see us create new programs where editorial can unlock more sustained support for emerging artists that help turn early recognition into ongoing momentum. And we'll bring more of the human voice behind that curation into the listening experience. We've already started experimenting with this by bringing our music editors forward through video and storytelling, where they share why a song resonated and what stood out about an artist. For artists, that means more opportunities for their music and story to come to life for listeners.


Live Shows


We believe that as fans go deeper into an artist's world on Spotify, that connection shouldn't live only online. Showing up to support an artist in person has always been one of the strongest forms of fandom, and one of the most important income streams for artists.


Spotify helps ensure rooms are not only filled, but filled with true fans. By understanding how listeners connect with your music, we help artists reach the fans who care most, and are most likely to buy tickets.


To date, Spotify has helped artists generate more than $1 billion in ticket sales by connecting fans with live shows through our ticketing partners. In 2026, we're building on that strength with new features that will help more artists turn listening into tangible support from their fans.


You've built communities, taken risks, and kept going even when the path felt uncertain. It's our job to make sure Spotify works as hard as you do, and keeps growing in ways that better support artists who are serious about building a career. Unprecedented competition alongside unprecedented opportunity defines today's music industry. Our focus is ensuring that growth creates clear, reliable paths for artists to reach fans, and sustain careers.


That's the standard we're holding ourselves in 2026.


There's a lot of work ahead and I'm excited about what we can build together this year.

[Editor's note: The A.V. Club will return to recap the show on March 4.]    

Shrinking began as somewhat of a workplace comedy in 2023, exploring how a group of overtly close colleagues who happen to be therapists come to depend on each other after a tragedy and form a discerning friend group. It has since morphed into a straightforward, often saccharine hangout dramedy. Characters pop in and out of each other's homes and offices at all times, they eat breakfast before heading to their jobs, go on midday hikes (because, you know, L.A.), and generally don't have boundaries in a mostly endearing way. It appears to be outside the realm of logic, but when the cast is this charming, does it matter? Like he accomplished with Scrubs, Cougar Town, and Ted Lasso, series co-creator Bill Lawrence thrives in this mix of humor and heart. Shrinking encapsulates his strengths, even if this show veers more toward the dramatic side. 

I'm not shy to admit that I'm a weeper when it comes to watching emotional moments. So Harrison Ford‘s monologue in Shrinking‘s season-two finale, when Paul expresses gratitude to his pals for sticking by him during his health issues, got me. (And yes, I do think Ford should've won some awards for his beautiful performance.) So by the end of this season-three premiere, it's a one-two punch because Paul gets married—hell yeah!—and then quickly realizes how bad his Parkinson's symptoms have gotten. Once again, Shrinking delivers a good mix of goofy humor and waterworks in a way that progresses the plot. As with any opener, “My Bad” catches us up to what the gang has been up to since Thanksgiving—including the fact that Gaby (Jessica Williams) and Derrick #2 (Damon Wayans Jr.) are on the “I love you” stage already—and sets up forthcoming storylines, like Liz's (Christa Miller) unfiltered involvement as a nanny to help Brian (Michael Urie) and Charlie (Devin Kawaoka) prep for their baby's arrival.  

The most crucial parts of the episode stem from Paul, whom I'll get to shortly, and the reveal that Alice (Lukita Maxwell) might be heading off to Connecticut for school, much to Jimmy's (co-creator Jason Segel) distress. The thought of leaving him and the rest of her Pasadena community scares the crap out of her, even though she's excited at first, showing off her athletic skills and knowing that Wesleyan's coach is watching from the stands (along with Jimmy, Paul, Gaby, Liz, and everyone else, who aggressively cheer her on). Still, it's only when the coach comes to meet her at home and tells her she's in that Alice realizes she isn't ready to go. Thank goodness for Sean (Luke Tennie), who finds out the truth and urges her to live her life instead of letting fear hold her back. It's a little weird that her therapist dad's former patient is giving her such solid advice, but honestly, this feels par for the course for a show like Shrinking. 

Sean's salient counsel actually sums up where I think season three might be heading thematically. In many ways, grief is naturally baked into the premise, considering Shrinking opened with Jimmy despondent over his wife's death a few months ago, while everyone rallied around him for support. A lot of the debut run was about how everybody struggled to pick up the pieces. (To the show's credit, the writing was breezy even if the characters were in mourning.) Season two, according to what Lawrence told The A.V. Club in 2024, was about forgiveness. That's why Louis (co-creator Brett Goldstein) entered the picture. Louis was the drunk driver responsible for killing Jimmy's wife, and much of the sophomore run was about Jimmy, Alice, Brian, Gaby, et al. reconciling with how the accident affected Louis and shattered his own life, with Jimmy eventually forgiving the guy, mostly so that he can start to heal himself. 

It feels like the pitch for the third season was “moving on.” Alice has to evolve instead of being the one her dad continually keeps leaning on, and that can happen only if she prioritizes herself and her education. I'm glad Sean not only convinced her to call the coach again so she can go to Wesleyan but also that he made Jimmy realize why he has to let her go. Meanwhile, Brian and Charlie are moving on by focusing on their expanding family. Then there's Gaby, who seems stuck in her work, realizing she isn't helping people the way she intended to. She seeks a purpose, and I'm excited to see where she finds it as the season progresses. Gaby does have one goal in “My Bad,” though, and that is to ensure Paul gets married and that Julie (Wendie Malick) gets a lovely wedding. 

So what if they decide to tie the knot only to avoid filling a barrage of legal forms? (Paul wants to get his affairs in order because of his health.) Gaby is determined to give her pals a memorable day, roping in everyone to help out. There are more than a few hiccups, including the fact that a grumpy Paul doesn't care to celebrate much and doesn't realize that Julie seems excited about the prospect of wearing a white dress rather than having to go to court to sign the document. He didn't even call his daughter to tell her he was engaged! But it's okay, Meg (Lily Rabe) shows up anyway, and Paul and Julie happily walk down the aisle, with Jimmy giving yet another moving speech about finding love and hope in unexpected ways. Cue those tears I was talking about. At least they're happy ones (for now). 

At the very end of “My Bad,” Paul spots a stranger sitting in Liz's kitchen. Except, he's not a stranger. It's Jerry (Michael J. Fox), the man he briefly met in his doctor's waiting room at the start of the episode. The two had hit it off quickly, bonding over how each of them is dealing with having Parkinson's. So what the hell is Jerry doing at the wedding, you ask? As it turns out, Jerry is a figment of Paul's imagination and a sign that his health really is taking a turn. But like he said in that season-two finale, at least he's got his community to help him through it.

	On top of The Favourite, Poor Things, Kinds of Kindness and Bugonia, Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos are adding yet another project to their award-winning lineup of collaborations: the duo's first-ever Super Bowl ad. And while website building platform Squarespace replaces the oft-twisted tropes of the pair's past projects, fans can still count on the bold, provocative and darkly funny nature they've come to expect from the partnership.


	Titled Unavailable, Squarespace's forthcoming commercial marks the platform's 12th Super Bowl appearance, and will air between the first and second quarter of Super Bowl LX. While the game-day spot is 30 seconds long, Squarespace exclusively shared a 15-second teaser with The Hollywood Reporter, seen below.

Unavailable‘s set was built by production designer James Price (Poor Things, Bugonia, The Iron Claw), and the music is the work of Lanthimos' team and composer Jerskin Fendrix, with sound design by Wave Studios founder Johnnie Burn (The Zone of Interest). The campaign was shot in London on black and white film.


	In addition to Unavailable, Lanthimos directed the 2026 Super Bowl ad for food delivery app Grubhub (THR received the exclusive first look here). These projects mark the Greek director's first two Super Bowl ads, while Unavailable marks Stone's first and only.

	











	As part of the campaign rollout, Squarespace is releasing a series of movie posters, creating a visual narrative that mirrors the suspense and intensity of the teaser. While the rest of the spot — namely the reason for Stone's tears — is being kept under wraps at the moment, the story will continue to unfold in the lead-up to the Big Game on Feb. 8.

Donald Trump said he feels “terrible” about the recent deaths of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, but he feels worse about Good because her parents are “tremendous Trump people.”


	The president appeared for a sit-down interview on The Will Cain Show on Fox News on Tuesday night. Will Cain quickly brought up the events in Minneapolis, where an ICE takeover of the city has resulted in federal agents shooting and killing two U.S. citizens. “We're going to de-escalate a little bit,” Trump acknowledged while simultaneously saying the polling numbers in Minnesota are “doing better than they've done in many years.”


	“The entire country is talking about what happened this past week in Minnesota,” Cain said, adding that everyone has seen the video of Pretti's murder and has an opinion. “I'm curious what you thought when you first saw that video,” he added. 


	“I think the whole thing is terrible,” Trump replied. “I don't like the fact that he was carrying a gun… It's pretty unusual. But nobody knows when they saw the gun, how they saw the gun, everything else. Bottom line, it was terrible.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	He continued, referencing Good's death. “Both of them were terrible. The other was terrible too. And I'm not sure about his parents, but I know her parents were big Trump fans. Makes me feel bad anyway. But I guess you could say even worse, they were tremendous Trump people, Trump fans. The daughter was, I don't know if you could say radicalized. Maybe radicalized. I don't know. But you hate to see that.”

	











	Trump previously addressed Good's death during a press conference at the White House, during which he also mentioned her parents being Trump fans. 


	“They're gonna make mistakes sometimes,” he said of ICE. “ICE is gonna be too rough with somebody. You know, they're dealing with rough people. They're gonna make a mistake sometimes. It can happen. We feel terrible. I felt horribly when I was told that the young woman had the tragedy. But when I learned her father is a — I hope he still is, but I don't know — was a tremendous Trump fan. He was all for Trump. Loved Trump.”

	He added, “And, you know, it's terrible. It's so sad. It just happens.” 


	Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot in the head by a masked ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month. The tragedy occurred one day after thousands of federal agents were deployed to Minnesota for a 30-day immigration enforcement “surge.” The agent has since been identified as Jonathan Ross. In the aftermath of the shooting, Trump administration officials claimed that Good was a “domestic terrorist” who had attempted to harm agents with her vehicle.


	Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot and killed on Saturday in Minneapolis by a group of immigration agents. The killing was captured on video by multiple bystanders. In the footage, Pretti can be seen filming officers with his cell phone, and is pepper sprayed after attempting to assist a woman who was shoved to the ground by immigration agents. About half a dozen agents are seen wrestling Pretti to the ground, striking him in the head. Two agents then shoot at him a total of 10 times in the span of a few seconds, appearing to continue to fire even after he collapses.

	The Department of Homeland Security and administration officials moved quickly to present Pretti — even before he had been positively identified — as a would-be domestic terrorist. Following massive public backlash, including from Republicans, the government has slowly shifted the narrative to blame Pretti for carrying a gun to a protest. 


	Yesterday, Trump sent Border Czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to meet with Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. According to Walz's office, the officials “agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals.” Homan wrote on X, “While we don't agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point, and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead.”

Giancarlo Esposito, Will Price, Tatiana Maslany and Steve Buscemi also get wrapped in the titular city's enveloping presence in writer-director Noah Segan's latest.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	Rarely does an opening song choice so precisely define the mood of a film like LCD Soundsystem's exquisitely tortured anthem “New York, I Love You but You're Bringing Me Down” over the opening frames of writer-director Noah Segan's quiet knockout, The Only Living Pickpocket in New York. James Murphy's melancholy vocals capture the unlivable but unleavable push-pull of the city, wistfully looking back at its grubby past while lamenting the shiny soullessness and skyrocketing exclusivity of its present.


	Those sentiments seem to come directly from John Turturro as Harry Lehman, a nimble-fingered thief with a watchful gaze, always scoping a potential score on the streets or subways.

The Bottom Line

	
	Contemplative, cool-headed and transfixing.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (Premieres)Cast: John Turturro, Giancarlo Esposito, Will Price, Tatiana Maslany, Steve Buscemi, Lori Tan Chinn, Kelvin Han Yee, Karina Arroyave, John Gallagher Jr., Victoria Moroles, Jack Mulhern, Michael Hsu Rosen, Aida Turturro, Mark CayneDirector-screenwriter: Noah Segan

								1 hour 28 minutes			






	The song also suggests the movie's pervasive subtextual nostalgia for the analog past — felt by the small-time career criminal, but no less by an old-school detective being shoved aside to make way for the clever kids in the cyber unit, by a crusty pawn shop owner fencing stolen goods or a steely crime matriarch, taking care of business and adapting to the times, but not shy about admitting she misses the bad old days.


	Turturro is unshowy but magnificent in his best film role in years, an honorable hustler who still carries himself with dignity despite a lifetime of regrets and a world gradually leaving him behind. At least until he unwittingly targets the wrong mark and has to think and act fast to protect the people he cares about and secure his own sorrowful redemption.


	Harry could be described as a counterpart on the other side of the law from John Stone, the wearily disheveled attorney played by Turturro in HBO's riveting limited series, The Night Of — even if Harry has a greater appreciation for good tailoring. What makes Segan's movie so intoxicating, however, is not just the depth of its inside-and-out central character study but the granular textures of the world Harry inhabits and the incisively drawn secondary characters played by a deep bench of very fine and impeccably cast actors.

	











	Segan has clearly been paying attention during his long association with Rian Johnson, who first cast him in Brick and has found roles for him in pretty much everything since. He moved into directing with a segment of the 2019 horror anthology, Scare Package, following in 2022 with his first solo feature, the Shudder vampire flick Blood Relatives. Segan's latest is a complete swerve into more nuanced genre territory and more complex storytelling, not to mention a singularly great New York movie. The hypnotic, patiently held closing shot alone will strike a chord with natives, transplants and ex-residents alike.


	The opening scene is a model of narrative economy. A well-heeled businessman (John Gallagher Jr.) applies a spritz of cologne, slips on his chunky Philippe Patek watch and exits his upscale apartment building, heading for the subway when no cabs materialize. All we see is a quick shot of peak-hour strap-hangers packed in tight, with Harry close behind the guy. Cut to the end of a lunch meeting, when the businessman reaches for his wallet and finds it gone.


	Harry obviously has been at this game since he was a young man, when more people carried thick wads of cash. Still, he scrapes by, offloading resaleable items through his old friend Ben (an endearingly spiky Steve Buscemi) and laughing off the suggestion of tech-savvy young scammer Eve (Victoria Moroles) that he should shift to online theft.


	While he's not exactly Robin Hood, Harry is an oddly principled man considering how he makes his living. He believes in circulating his stolen dough where it matters — whether it's a healthcare worker at the facility that looks after his nonverbal, disabled wife Rosie (Karina Arroyave) during the day; or a neighbor in their Bronx apartment building who looks in on her when she's at home and Harry steps out to ply his trade.

	











	Turturro gives Harry a sad-eyed appearance offset by a frequently jokey manner. But it's the thoughtfulness and resourcefulness of a man whose cerebral cogs are constantly turning that defines him.


	One of the most poignant aspects of his performance is the way his face is transformed by love and devotion when he's with Rosie — gently brushing her hair; carrying her up multiple flights of stairs and then returning for her wheelchair when the elevator is out of order; cheerfully nattering away in one-sided conversations; or spinning “Native New Yorker” on vinyl and goofily dancing around the room serenading her.


	Things go wrong for Harry when he unwittingly steals from the swaggering young scion of a crime family, Dylan (punchy live-wire Will Price), lifting a gym bag from the kid's car that contains a luxury watch, guns and a USB card loaded with a fortune in cryptocurrency. Harry has no idea what it is and nor does Ben, whose dinosaur desktop is about 500 upgrades short of the capability necessary to read the thing. Ben sends him to another fence in Chinatown (Kelvin Han Yee), who takes the USB and a few other items off Harry's hands.


	Dylan and his posse are well-connected, so it takes them relatively little time to track down Harry using CCTV footage. Threatening to harm Rosie if he doesn't deliver, Dylan gives Harry just a few hours to retrieve the USB and return it to him.


	Watching The Only Living Pickpocket in New York, you are reminded of how rarely we now get to see movies fully shot on locations in the city and how there really is no substitute for the real thing.

	











	Cinematographer Sam Levy, whose long string of credits includes Frances Ha, Lady Bird and His Three Daughters, captures the bodegas, the subway trains and platforms, the tenements, storefronts and bustling street life with crispness but also a slightly rough-hewn, unvarnished quality, heightening the kinship with gritty New York movies of the ‘70s.


	Harry's against-the-clock quest to ensure Rosie's safety takes him back to Chinatown and from there to Brooklyn. Segan's tight plotting amplifies the necessity for anyone in Harry's profession of being able to come up with solutions on the fly. One such instance is an amusing bit of improvisation in which he gets backup by greasing the palm of a panhandler played by Aida Turturro.


	There's also a very moving interlude during which Harry, claiming to be “in the neighborhood,” goes to Queens to see his estranged daughter Kelly, beautifully played by Tatiana Maslany as a knot of wounded anger. It's that strong scene, and Harry's contrition, that plant the idea of him preparing to make his exit. The encounter with Kelly — which reverberates in a lovely moment later on — is made even more touching by the heavily embellished account of it he shares with Rosie.


	The ways in which Harry's detective buddy Warren (Giancarlo Esposito in fine form), Ben, Eve and Billy (Mark Cayne), a young pickpocket who gets tips from the old-timer, all factor into the closing developments demonstrate that Segan has a real gift for intricate plotting, not to mention a deft hand at creating a satisfying ending rich in emotional shading.

	











	The final scenes also involve a drive across the river with an extended cameo from a major-name star, whose character and Harry — in a duologue loaded with revealing insights — seem to develop an understanding, despite circumstances that could hardly be more unfavorable.


	This is a remarkably layered and rewarding story, especially for a movie running less than 90 minutes; editor Hilda Rasula keeps the pace steady and the transitions fluid. A big assist comes from Gary Lionelli's full-bodied score, with jazzy retro funk riffs that add excitement to the early scenes and more bluesy, somber sounds in the later action.


	Even before the Cole Porter standard “I Happen to Like New York” comes in over the closing shot, it's clear this is a movie very close to born-and-bred New Yorker Segan's heart. It's an adoring tip of the hat to the city and to the vast canon of New York movies. And it's a gift to the wonderful Turturro, another native son, who imbues his role with a lifetime of personal history, underplaying everything with the most delicate restraint.

“Fixer to Fabulous” fans are in for a treat, as an old favorite returns to the show for the January 27 episode. Check out Jenny Marrs‘ reaction to seeing Joe Looney back on the HGTV show.

On January 27, the HGTV Instagram account shared a clip from the episode airing that evening.

“Look who's back! Catch Joe on an all new #FixerToFab tonight at 8|7c,” the caption noted.

In the video, Jenny and her husband Dave look over plans when Looney enters, clapping his hands to get their attention. The text “construction team retiree” appears under his name, for those viewers unfamiliar with Looney.

Jenny is clearly surprised by his entrance, as she lets out a scream and runs to hug him.

“Joe is a longtime member of our construction crew who retired a few years ago,” Jenny explains.

“And I just miss seeing him every day,” she adds. “So it's such a treat to have him here.”

Jenny tells him his arrival is a good time to take a lunch break.

Fans have missed seeing Looney, who retired during season 5 of the show.

They flooded the comments section with excitement over his return, with messages including, “Welcome Home Joe” and “Mr. JOE!!! So good to see him.❤️”

Jenny commented, “MR JOE!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️”

“Mr. JOOOOOOOOE I JUST LOVE HIIIIIIM!!” one fan commented.

Another fan wrote, “Love Joe and miss seeing him on the show!”

“We all love Joe. Everyone should have a Joe in their lives,” one person noted.

Others shared, “Good to see his sweet face again,” “Awww I miss seeing him,” and “Such a good man and good worker! I'll bet you all miss him so much!”

“Aw I love Joe, I cried when he retired 😢,” one fan shared.

On July 16, 2025, Jenny teased the season 7 episode on Instagram. 

“We're working on a Habitat for Humanity house this season! This is a dream project for us and we are so, so excited to share this one with you all!” she wrote in the caption.

Jenny continued, “We love the way the mission of @habitatnwa aligns so well with our heart's desire for ‘Fixer to Fabulous': ‘Seeking to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity of Northwest Arkansas brings people together to build homes, communities, and hope.'🤍”

The HGTV star added, “(Anyone spot the surprise guest at today's demo? He surprised us all and I may have jumped and squealed! My favorite demo buddy!!!!)”

The updated "Jump" gets a sneak preview ahead of its official release in the coming months.

	You might as well jump! That's what an all-star lineup reminds us on the eve of the FIFA World Cup 2026, as Van Halen's 1984 classic “Jump” gets a makeover.

	The soccer campaign kicks off with “Bubbling Up,” the first of three new Coca-Cola films created for the World Cup, which runs from June 11 to July 19 across three host countries: Canada, Mexico and the United States.


	The updated “Jump” gets a sneak preview ahead of its official release in the coming months, according to a joint statement from FIFA and The Coca-Cola Company. Those synth stabs are impossible to miss.


	The inclusion of Steve Vai in the project is something of a masterstroke. Not only does Vai stand at the very top of the ladder of great electric guitarists, as did late Van Halen guitarist, keyboardist and co-founder Eddie Van Halen, who passed in October 2020, aged 65. Vai went on to record and tour with VH singer David Lee Roth, who pursued a solo career following the release of 1984, the parent album of “Jump.”


	The most successful song in the Van Halen canon, “Jump” was the moment when the band belated embraced the synthesizer, a weapon in so many artists' arsenal in the first half of the ‘80s. For old school VH fans, it was a shocking sonic shift away from their traditional hard rock and blues-leaning sounds. Today, it still has bounce and somehow exists in a time rift, both fresh and vintage.

	











	It's the band's only No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, a position it locked down for five weeks. In the United Kingdom, “Jump” leapt to No. 7, and is one of the band's two top 10 appearances.


	The FIFA World Cup 2026 will be the biggest yet. The tournament expands​ this time to 48 teams, an increase of 16 teams compared with the previous seven editions.


	“Football is more than a game; it's a shared passion with a tapestry of emotions that unites billions,” comments Arnab Roy, president, Coca-Cola Global Category.


	“At Coca-Cola, we believe in the power of shared experiences. Our creative vision for this campaign is to harness the incredible energy of the FIFA World Cup and the rollercoaster of emotions that only this tournament can deliver, transforming them into real, tangible connections.”


	Through “innovative experiences and compelling content,” Roy continues, “we're bringing fans closer than ever before, whether they're cheering in digital spaces, local bars, or at-home watch parties.”

Of the 90-plus films and episodic series premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in 2026, only about a dozen are arriving at the festival with distribution in hand. Many will be looking for homes, but if this year is anything like last year, it may take some time for those sales to close. We'll be tracking all of them as they come in.

Section: PremieresDistributor: A24Directors: Olivia WildeDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: This was a true, old-fashioned, late night bidding war between multiple interested buyers that ended up being a 72-hour, marathon competition. IndieWire hears that Neon, Black Bear, Netflix, Searchlight, and Focus Features — and even Warner Bros. at the 11th hour — were all in the mix for what was Olivia Wilde's third feature as a director. We're also hearing that the final bidding got into the 8-figure range. Others may have bid more, but Wilde was determined to get a theatrical deal. And it's fitting too, because this was one of the starrier movies at the festival with Wilde, Seth Rogen, Edward Norton, and Penélope Cruz all leading the ensemble cast. “The Invite” quite simply is about the dinner party from hell when a couple whose marriage is on the brink have dinner with another couple that's polyamorous, but the crowds that saw it say there's a lot more layers to this one than just that. Will McCormack and Rashida Jones wrote the screenplay based on a 2019 Spanish film called “Sentimental.” UTA Independent Film Group and FilmNation co-repped the sale, and the film hails from Megan Ellison and Annapurna, who also previously produced Wilde's debut film “Booksmart.”

Section: MidnightDistributor: NeonDirector: Adrian ChiarellaDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: A queer, coming-of-age horror movie? “Leviticus” is about two teenage boys who have to fight off a violent entity capable of taking the form of the other. The film plays on the real-life horrors of conversion therapy and stars Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen, Jeremy Blewitt, Ewen Leslie, Davida McKenzie, Nicholas Hope, Zahra Newman, and Mia Wasikowska. The film's unique genre premise from writer/director Adrian Chiarella, his feature debut, was good enough for Neon to jump on worldwide rights in a seven-figure deal, as well as the first sale of the festival, an otherwise slow affair thus far, though one that has sparked an early bidding war for at least one other title. “Leviticus” will be released later this year and is actually Neon's second deal for a horror movie out of the festival, as the distributor also over the weekend joined the next film from “It Ends” director Alex Ullom.

Jackée Harry recently revealed she underwent a deep plane facelift, showing off her incredible results. The “Sister, Sister” star dished on which celebrities were her inspiration to go under the knife.

During her Tuesday, January 27, appearance on Tamron Hall, Harry opened up about her decision to undergo a deep plane facelift.

“Ricki Lake was here on our show. She talked about going under the knife and her surgery,” Hall began, as a photo of the former talk show host appeared on screen. “And then Kris Jenner had her deep plane [facelift].”

“That was it! Those are my two role models,” Harry responded. “I saw her, and I said, ‘I want that Ricki Lake special!'”

She continued, “And Kris Jenner—I adore Kris Jenner. Talk about confident, but she runs an empire. I really like her, the way she dresses and everything. I've been over there, they're nice. They're nice people.”

The sitcom actress went on to say that she consulted with people in her personal life for advice when it came to making her decision. 

“People I work with, I don't want to out them,” she began. “They told me what to expect, but you can see a contrast. Some people will look great [around their forehead]…hands are a giveaway, of course.”

In addition to her deep plane facelift, Harry had three other procedures, including new receiving veneers. She's also previously had Botox, but admitted “it doesn't last,” and liposuction, which she said was painful.

“It could be addictive. I don't want to talk about anything bad,” she said, before admitting that she probably wouldn't “feel this way” if she was not a famous actress. “I'd be a good old New Yorker. Let me tell you. If I was here, I'd still be very successful. I'd be a teacher somewhere. I don't know. I always felt I'd be on the right track.”

The former “227” star opened up about her reaction post-surgery in an interview with Entertainment Tonight on Thursday, January 22.

“I see me. It was instant,” she said. “I was like, ‘Oh, I'mma be cute.' “They call it snatched. Nuh huh. I'm yanked.”

While she's thrilled with her youthful results, Harry told Hall she's still healing. 

“Baby, I'm va va voom. I'm on va va,” she said on Tuesday. “Baba. I ain't voom. I ain't vooming yet.”

After months of fighting stage three breast cancer, undergoing two different types of chemotherapy infusions, Hallmark star Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe was understandably choked up as she rang the bell at her cancer center, marking the end of her chemo treatments on January 27, 2026. 

In an Instagram Story Lowe shared, a kindness army of Hallmark staffers filed into her cancer center, all carrying presents for the nurses who cared for her. The “Signed, Sealed, Delivered” star and rom-com director also revealed that Hallmark generously purchased a new victory bell for the center after she informed Hallmark Media EVP and Communications Chief Annie Howell that the existing one had broken. 

Lowe, who first shared her diagnosis with fans on October 10, 2025, shared a video after her final chemo infusion, calling the Hallmark team “incredible” for coming to cheer her on. She also celebrated being the first person at her cancer center to ring the new bell, thrilled that it will now give patients “something to look forward to.” She also told fans that the Hallmark team had made everything “brighter in my life through this.” 

A photo Lowe shared of the shiny gold bell revealed that the wall plaque it's attached to says, “Ring this bell, three times well, to celebrate this day. This course is run, my treatment done, and I am on my way.” 

Beneath those inspiring words, it also says, “This bell is dedicated with hope and love on behalf of Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe and Hallmark Media. January 2026.” 

After ringing the bell, as seen in another video she shared in her Stories, Lowe got choked up as she looked around at everyone applauding and exclaimed, “We did it! We did it.” 

“Also, I know it's all new nurses here,” Lowe added, “but thank you guys for all being here. I can't tell you how important your work is, especially at a time like this when people are so desperately in need of help. And you guys are here, helping every one of us.” 

Lowe said she hadn't planned to make a speech, but noted that “it only happens hopefully once, hopefully I don't have to come back again. So if you're a patient in here, I love you, and I see you, and I can't wait for you to ring this damn boujie bell! Sponsored by Hallmark, the best company in the world. I hope if you're watching a movie tonight, you're watching a Hallmark movie.” 

Fans flooded Lowe's post, celebrating her reaching the first important milestone in her cancer fight. One person wrote, “So happy for you, crying , you are wonderful & blessed to work for such a beautiful caring company! Awesome job Hallmark!”

Another commented, “You're beautiful, Crystal. You shine! Thanks for sharing your story, your voice.”

Someone else chimed in, “Soooo happy…finally the last one!!! And with a special bell to ring! Love and hugs and prayers beautiful woman.”

Lowe vulnerably admitted before her last infusion that she was nervous to get too excited about it being her last chemo treatment, given the fear of recurrence — a reality that many patients with advanced or certain types of breast cancer must face. 

Lowe will now have several weeks to rest and recover from the side effects of chemo before undergoing a double mastectomy on February 19, she shared in a previous post. She'll have expanders placed in her chest to slowly stretch her skin, and then undergo another reconstruction surgery when she receives implants. Lowe has also previously shared that she'll undergo radiation following surgery.  

Crystal I am so happy for you. You and your attitude are the best. Good luck with your surgery in February.

Among its debuts are first-ever top 10s on the Billboard 200 & Top Album Sales.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



Madison Beer's new studio album, Locket, makes a top 10 debut across five Billboard album charts (dated Jan. 31). She achieves career-first top 10s on the Billboard 200 (No. 10), Indie Store Album Sales (No. 2), Top Current Album Sales (No. 4) and Top Album Sales (No. 4), while also scoring her second top 10 on Vinyl Albums (No. 3).


	In the tracking week ending Jan. 22, Locket earned 43,000 equivalent album units (Beer's best week by units earned) in the United States according to Luminate. Of that sum, album sales comprise 24,000 (her biggest sales week ever) with 15,000 of that in vinyl purchases (her best week on vinyl); streaming-equivalent album units comprise 18,000 (equaling 18.89 million on-demand official streams of the set's tracks — her best streaming week ever); and track-equivalent album units comprise a negligible sum.

	











Locket is among the six albums that either debut or reenter the top 10 of the Top Album Sales chart, where ENHYPEN notches its fourth No. 1 with the arrival of THE SIN : VANISH. Bad Bunny's former No. 1 DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS reenters at No. 2 after a new Amazon-exclusive vinyl variant was released, A$AP Rocky's Don't Be Dumb debuts at No. 3 and Stray Kids' chart-topping DO IT falls 2-5. DxS' DxS 1 st Mini Album ‘Serenade' starts at No. 6, the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack slips 6-7, Olivia Dean's The Art of Loving falls 5-8, The Protomen's Act III: This City Made Us launches at No. 9 and KATSEYE's Beautiful Chaos is a non-mover at No. 10.

The Oscar-winning ‘Frankenstein' filmmaker sang nearly a full concert with a mariachi band inside a Park Avenue home filled with guests like The Daniels, Elijah Wood, producers Jonathan Wang and Janet Yang.

Guillermo del Toro delivered a surprise performance at Sundance Monday night, wowing an intimate crowd hosted by Netflix in honor of the festival's retrospective screening of his feature directorial debut Cronos.


	And what a show it was. The Oscar-winning filmmaker has a brief history of breaking out into song at film festivals. In 2022, he joined Gael Garcia Bernal on on a Cannes Film Festival stage but this was much more intimate and extended. Del Toro was backed by a four man mariachi band and didn't just belt out a few tunes — he delivered nearly a full concert with at least seven songs, even coming back for an encore as the crowd enthusiastically chanted, “Uno mas!”

	Attendees included the Oscar winning filmmaker team behind Everything Everywhere All At Once The Daniels and producer Jonathan Wang (in Park City for the world premiere of The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist), producers Janet Yang and Jamie Patricof, Netflix's Oscar nominated The Perfect Neighbor filmmaker Geeta Gandbhir, actor Elijah Wood, Hollywood and festival insiders and select media. Aside from the music and festival gossip, the main course and hot commodity at the dinner gathering was a menu provided by Michelin-starred Holbox out of L.A.

	Currently on the awards season rounds for his epic Frankenstein for the streamer, the filmmaker is on a break from the flurry of black-tie events to make a special Sundance appearance in honor of a special screening of his debut, Cronos, which premiered at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival. Frankenstein snagged nine Oscar nominations including best picture, best adapted screenplay for del Toro, best supporting actor for Jacob Elordi, makeup and hairstyling, original music, sound, production design and costume design.

	











	Tuesday's showing at the Ray Theater — one of the Park City Legacy Program events designed to highlight special moments from years past to mark the final Sundance in Utah before it moves to Boulder, Colorado — will also feature an extended Q&A with del Toro. The film will be presented in newly restored 4K from Janus Films.


	Written and directed by del Toro, Cronos stars Ron Perlman, Federico Luppi, Tamara Shanath, Margarita Isabel and Claudio Brook. It tells the story of an alchemist who creates a device that can give its user eternal life. Four centuries later, the alchemist, now a ghostly white, is killed by debris from a falling building. Enter an unsuspecting antique dealer who comes across the device, only to discover it can restore his youth, even if immortality comes with gruesome consequences.


	The Park City Legacy program, scheduled for the fest's second half on Jan. 27-30, encompasses screenings of past festival favorites and standout titles spanning a variety of genres. It is poised to be a nostalgia bonanza with talent (directors and select cast) from each title making the trek to Park City for the showings.


	The program spotlights special anniversaries and will feature brand-new digital restorations of Little Miss Sunshine from Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, House Party from Reginald Hudlin, Half Nelson from Ryan Fleck, American Dream from Barbara Kopple and Mysterious Skin from Gregg Araki, as well as a recent restoration of Saw from James Wan. The series will also feature an archival screening of the late Lynn Shelton's Humpday.

	











	The Park City Legacy program includes special talks as part of the Beyond Film series, which offers artist and filmmaker conversations on cinema, legacy, culture and more. A number of those events will be held at Main Street's iconic Egyptian Theatre, one of the first Sundance venues. Next year, it will celebrate a milestone 100 years as “the jewel of Main Street.”

	Rosé is heading into the 68th Grammy Awards with three nominations for her inescapable collab with Bruno Mars, “Apt.” The song is nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year — making her the first K-pop artist to garner a nod for one of the Big Four categories as a solo act.


	As the big day approaches, Rosé sat down with Alex Cooper of Call Her Daddy for a special episode titled “Alex Cooper Presents: A Grammy's Special,” which arrives tomorrow. They discuss her remarkable career while visiting a cafe in Seoul, enjoying a traditional Pocha lunch, a karaoke stall, a lounge in Tokyo, and Rosé's recording studio-turned-podcast set.


	In an exclusive Rolling Stone clip from the upcoming CHD episode with the Blackpink star, Cooper asks the question that's on every fan's mind: “Do you think you would ever tour solo?”


	After acknowledging that it's been a “big subject” and both she and her fans are itching for her to be on tour, Rosé says that she wants to be able to present crowds with a “solid world” first but didn't want to “feel rushed.” The singer explains that her first solo album, Rosie, was a “learning curve” and she needed time to “really learn about” the LP.

	“I feel like to create a whole world onstage, I need more time to build on that with extra songs as well, because right now we have, what 12?” she continues. “And I don't feel ready to create a whole body of work for everyone yet.”

	Still, Rosé hints that “it's slowly gonna kind of come closer once I feel like my second album or more music comes out.” Addressing fans, she adds, “I just want everyone to be patient because I feel like once I do start, I feel like I'd love it so much that I would want to do it for so long. So I don't want to ruin that experience.”


	This year's Grammy Awards will be hosted by Trevor Noah and held on Sunday, Feb. 1, broadcasting live on CBS and Paramount+ from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Rolling Stone has predicted that Rosé and Bruno Mars' “APT.,” a track based on a Korean drinking game, will take home Record of the Year, calling it a “collaboration that was impossible to forget.”

The host, appearing on 'Late Night With Seth Meyers,' admitted he wasn't "thrilled" about the end of the long-running program.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	As the official final air date for The Late Show was revealed Tuesday, Stephen Colbert admits that the end of the show “feels real now.” 


	During the host's Tuesday night appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers, where it was revealed that May 21 will be the final show, Colbert elaborated on his feelings about the series' impending conclusion. 




	“It feels real now,” he told Seth Meyers of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert ending. “It did not feel — I mean, I know it was real, but now, there's four months left.”

	Colbert also noted that while “the shows are fun to do” as host, he is not looking forward to parting ways with the people working on the show behind-the-scenes.

	











	“What I really love is the people I do it with. And we've been putting together this, I mean, there are people I've been working with … my shoemaker, Tom Purcell, I've known since 1988. And so, we've all been together forever,” he added. “So, listen, you can do comedy a lot of different places. There's no place like the Ed Sullivan Theater, no offense. But it's really the people, and that's really what I'm going to miss more than anything.


	“And we'll do something else together, but it feels real now. I'm not thrilled with it,” Colbert added. 


	Meyers responded, “I feel like neither of us ever take it for granted, but I do think it's that weird thing that it's just built into your life when you have a show like this that you just get to see people every day that are funny and help you process through, oftentimes, the things that we're talking about, which can be difficult.”

	











	Colbert announced the Late Show was ending back in July 2025, where he further extended praise to the team who work on the show: “I do want to say that the folks at CBS have been great partners. I'm so grateful to the Tiffany Network for giving me this chair and this beautiful theater to call home. And of course, I'm grateful to you, the audience who have joined us. … And I am extraordinarily, deeply grateful to the 200 people who work here.”


	At the time, CBS said the cancellation was “purely a financial decision.” 


	“The Late Show With Stephen Colbert will end its historic run in May 2026 at the end of the broadcast season,” George Cheeks, at the time a Paramount co-CEO, said in a statement alongside other senior leadership. “We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire The Late Show franchise at that time. We are proud that Stephen called CBS home. He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television.”

The K-pop superstar is set to appear on Alex Cooper's podcast.


													By
												

	Anna Chan



	Everything's coming up rosy for ROSÉ! Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy announced on Tuesday (Jan. 27) that the BLACKPINK singer is set to appear in a special episode of the podcast airing the next day, and Billboard has exclusive clip from the interview.


	In a clip from the chat debuting on Billboard, Cooper asks ROSÉ how it feels to receive three 2026 Grammy nominations. (The singer is up for record of the year, song of the year and best pop/duo performance, all for her Bruno Mars collab “APT.”; the nods make her the first K-pop singer to nab nominations in the general field categories.)

	











	“That's a big question!” the pop star laughed in response. She then went on to compare learning about her nods to a massive career moment involving BLACKPINK.


	“It feels like, I thought of this when you asked me about getting selected from YG at that open audition to fly to Korea … and it made me think, I think it's the same feeling as this nomination,” ROSÉ shared, recalling how she was selected to be part of the global pop group that would go on to earn a Billboard 200 No. 1 album and 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits to date, since the quartet — which also includes JENNIE, LISA and JISOO — debuted in 2016. “I remember when that happened, it was like, I never thought that would happen. I never thought I would ever fly to Korea and live in that city — ever!”

	











	The “On the Ground” singer reflected on how, growing in New Zealand and Australia, she had always dreamed about one day living in Asia and how much fun and different it would be to follow her big dreams. 


	“This Grammy nomination, it feels like, ‘Oh my gosh! I never thought that would be possible! Like, yes, BLACKPINK … and we're getting so much love and I'm so grateful for that, and it's so exciting, but that I didn't think would be a possibility, but I feel like quite similar,”  she gushed. “So it's like the second chapter of my life, like, ‘Oh my gosh!'”


	The special episode of Call Her Daddy, titled “Alex Cooper Presents: A Grammy's Special,” will show Cooper sitting down with ROSÉ in various locations in Asia, including a cafe in Seoul, the singer's recording studio, a karaoke stall, a lounge in Tokyo and more. The episode arrives Wednesday (Jan. 28) at 5 a.m. ET.

Poseidon is the Greek God who looms largest in the life of his demigod son, Perseus “Percy” Jackson (Walker Scobell). But it's Helios and Apollo that the film crew of “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” has to contend with the most. 

Season 2 of the Disney+ series follows Percy and his friends/frienemies from Camp Half Blood on a quest for the Golden Fleece (yes, that one), but the show shoots in and around Vancouver — and the key to successfully integrating the live action and VFX elements, grounding the actions of Gods and mortals, is the right kind of light.

“I always say, as the DP, if this is going to be on stage, it has to be under a heavy, cloudy sky because it's gotta be soft light. And I know I can create soft light realistically on set. If there's sun, it's gotta be sunrise or sunset. The sun has to be coming through at a really low angle and really warm. But if you want this scene to be under a sun at 10 a.m., no, we can't pull that off on stage,” series cinematographer Jules O'Loughlin told IndieWire. 

 










“Percy Jackson and the Olympians” does both, making use of massive stage spaces but also spending a lot of Season 2 outdoors. If an environment takes place outside with a sunny or at least a clear feel, they shoot it outside. It doesn't always work out, as with the daughter of Athena Annabeth's (Leah Jeffries) tense encounter with the Sirens (yes, those ones) in Season 2. “It poured with rain, and we had screens over the top of the set keeping the rain off the actors, and you've only got six or seven hours of daylight, and you've gotta go fast,” O'Loughlin said. “But if there's a chance that there could be sun, we want to shoot outside.” 

Even in one of the most complex scenes of the season, the Episode 2 chariot race (obviously, a camp for the children of Greek Gods has a chariot course), O'Loughlin and his team had to account for variable conditions across shooting days to achieve a normalized look. “With the weather during the chariot race, we had cloud, pouring rain, we had full sun. It's not just the horses going around, but it's the sequence that takes place in the stadium as well. We had a complete mix, and so my job in that situation is to try and match as much as possible using massive black solids held up by machines to create negative fill and to create shape on the faces, and also to cover the set from rain.” 

 










Controlling the weather was the least of it. “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” built a custom process rig with two chariot cockpits — one that could move north-south and one that could move east-to-west — where the actors could safely stand; then the shot could have real horse-drawn chariots being driven behind them, and a truck pulling the rig at some speed in front. O'Loughlin obviously studied the 1925 and 1959 versions of “Ben-Hur” closely while planning the race. But he also took technical cues from Ridley Scott's “Gladiator” to visually convey the chariot-driving with real intensity without killing 100 horses (allegedly).“For me, it was about working out the reduced shutter — shooting at 19 and 20 frames and playing it back at 24 just to give it extra speed,” O'Loughlin said. “Then being able to speed it up and also doing long lens [shots] from outside the course, with the vehicle flying around the outside. So, fence posts and spectators and flags are flying through the foreground, with the chariot behind.”   

But the main focus of the chariot race, and of all television really, is what's happening on the actors' faces. One of the most important things that O'Loughlin has done on all three seasons of “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” (the Season 3 shoot is scheduled to wrap in March 2026) is the work he's done behind the camera with the show's young cast.    

“I really took it on board to try and help them learn about what the camera is doing and what the camera is actually seeing,” O'Loughlin said. “I'll say, ‘Listen, this is a 75mm [lens]. If you throw a look just past camera here or there, it'll be much more powerful. If your look is too wide, your audience is not going to connect with you as much as if you throw the look here.'” 

 










The cast responded to O'Loughlin and then some. Dior Goodjohn, who plays the brash daughter of Ares Clarisse, was the first member of the “Percy Jackson” cast who asked to shadow O'Loughlin on one of her days off, and now all the core members of the Quest for the Golden Fleece and their nemesis Luke (Charlie Bushnell) have done so. 

“Dior turned up with a notebook and a pen and asked me a million questions and then followed me around everywhere on set,” O'Loughlin said. “For me, it's the most rewarding thing to be able to talk about my craft to people who are really interested, right? And also to help them as actors. Over the seasons, they're growing in leaps and bounds.” 

So, what is a cinematographer's advice to young actors to use the tools of cinematography to their advantage? 

“I say to them, ‘Listen, this season has been released. Watch it and enjoy it, but then go back and watch your performance in a physical way. Watch the light and the lens and the camera placement, how where you are in relation to the camera changes your performance and what it does for you. Learn that about yourself [and learn] what works for you,'” O'Loughlin said. “At the end of the day, it is a dance between actor and camera and lights and all the other aspects.” 

Season 2 of “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” is streaming on Disney+.

Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) have detected a ring-shaped molecule with 13 atoms, including sulfur, in deep space for the first time.

The team behind the discovery of 2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-thione (C₆H₆S) said finding such a complex molecule in interstellar space “closes a critical gap” between previous detections of simpler molecules and the complex building blocks of organic life, which have been discovered in comets and meteorites.

They also suggest the discovery represents a “major step forward” toward explaining the origin of life on Earth and the potential for extraterrestrial life beyond Earth.

“This is the first unambiguous detection of a complex, ring-shaped sulfur-containing molecule in interstellar space—and a crucial step toward understanding the chemical link between space and the building blocks of life,” explained Mitsunori Araki, scientist at MPE and lead author of the study detailing the discovery.

While scientists have yet to find definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life, astronomers have previously detected organic compounds in deep space. Often described by researchers as the “building blocks of life,” the discovery of these organic compounds has hinted that life's ingredients were carried to Earth aboard comets and meteors.

Still, the organic molecules observed in earlier studies were simpler, with only a handful of atoms. When these observations detect sulfur-containing compounds in interstellar space, they typically involve six or fewer molecules. Because sulfur is a key life ingredient, the lack of complex molecules in space left a gap in knowledge about the chemistry of life on Earth and how those molecules may affect the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

“Large, complex sulfur-containing molecules were expected, particularly due to sulfur's essential role in proteins and enzymes, yet these larger molecules had remained elusive,” the MPE researchers explained. “This gap between interstellar chemistry and the organic inventory found in comets and meteorites had been a central mystery in astrochemistry.”

According to the press release announcing the discovery, the MPE team spotted it in the molecular cloud G+0.693–0.027. This location places the molecule near the center of the Milky Way, about 27,000 light-years from Earth.

After comparing the chemical structure of the detected molecule with known values, the team determined it was a stable six-membered ring and a total of 13 atoms. Further analysis revealed that the newly discovered C₆H₆S is “structurally related” to molecules previously identified in an extraterrestrial sample.

To add veracity to the discovery, the MPE researchers synthesized the molecule in the lab. According to the release, this process involved the application of a 1,000-volt electrical discharge to the “evil-smelling liquid thiophenol” (C₆H₅SH).

Next, the team analyzed the resulting C₆H₆S sample with a spectrometer and detected a “radio fingerprint” with more than 7 significant digits. When they compared this fingerprint with data collected by the Yebes 40m and IRAM 30m radio telescopes in Spain, they found a chemical similarity, suggesting the new sulfur-containing molecule discovery could be a missing link in origin-of-life and extraterrestrial life studies.

When discussing the potential implications of their discovery, the MPE team said their findings suggest more complex sulfur-bearing molecules are still out there waiting to be found. They also believe their finding supports the idea that the fundamental ingredients of life may have formed in interstellar space “long before Earth came into existence.”

“Our results show that a 13-atom molecule structurally similar to those in comets already exists in a young, starless molecular cloud,”  explained Valerio Lattanzi, a scientist at MPE. “This proves that the chemical groundwork for life begins long before stars form,”

Stanford University's Dr Gary Nolan has lifted the lid on extraordinary research into unidentified aerial phenomena, revealing claims that CIA personnel suffered bizarre injuries described as 'their brains looked fried.'

The revelations suggest that government scientists are investigating events that might involve unknown energy effects, raising questions about potential threats both on Earth and beyond.

Dr Nolan, a leading expert in immunology and cellular biology, recounted an unsettling moment when CIA representatives approached him with medical scans. According to Nolan, MRIs and X-rays revealed brain damage in intelligence officers that could not easily be explained. 'Areas of their brains had just been dried,' he said, speculating that the injuries may have been caused by an energy weapon or an unknown electromagnetic effect.

The Stanford scientist has spent decades developing techniques to analyse cellular and tissue samples in minute detail, allowing him to study anomalies from potential UAP exposure. He stressed that these were not isolated incidents but a pattern that merited scientific investigation, highlighting the urgency of understanding unknown phenomena that may interact with humans in unusual ways.

Dr Nolan is also known for examining materials that might originate from non-human sources. In one instance, he analysed a small, desiccated corpse with a triangular head and large eyes. Experts in paediatric bone disorders and DNA analysis could not identify a known syndrome, and portions of its DNA appeared unclassifiable. While the organism was initially thought to be centuries old, further analysis suggested it was only a few decades old.

His work demonstrates the rigour applied to investigating anomalous materials, combining advanced lab techniques with meticulous cross-disciplinary consultation. Nolan's team uses high-parameter mass cytometry and computational models to understand biological patterns, providing a scientific framework for distinguishing unusual injuries or materials from conventional explanations.

Despite presenting medical data and potential evidence, Dr Nolan described significant resistance from CIA officials. 'Oh, that's impossible. We don't have anything like that,' he recalled them saying, highlighting the agency's reluctance to acknowledge phenomena outside conventional understanding.

The research raises broader questions about the CIA's UAP investigations, including claims that energy effects were capable of disabling weapons systems or interfering with military hardware. Nolan suggested these incidents could indicate technology or intelligence far beyond current human capability, whether terrestrial or otherwise.

Dr Nolan emphasised a disciplined scientific methodology in examining UAP-related injuries and materials. His laboratory at Stanford can sterilise and analyse blood samples, profile tissues at single-cell resolution, and track immune responses using advanced cytometry techniques. This approach allows him to build comprehensive models of human reactions to anomalous events, bridging data across disciplines such as immunology, genetics, and biophysics.

His work balances curiosity with caution. While he does not jump to conclusions about extraterrestrial involvement, he acknowledges that non-human intelligence or advanced physics might explain certain incidents. By focusing on data and reproducible analysis, Nolan illustrates that studying UAPs and unusual injuries is not science fiction but a legitimate scientific endeavour with national security implications.

In summary, Dr Gary Nolan's revelations expose a hidden dimension of CIA research into UAP phenomena, showing that personnel may have suffered severe neurological effects and that potential alien material is under serious investigation. His scientific approach underscores the need to study these events rigorously, blending biology, physics, and intelligence insights to confront one of the most mysterious challenges facing modern science and security.

The path to the first New York solo show for Elda Cerrato (1930–2023), now on view at Galerie Lelong, was a long and winding one. Born in Italy to Jewish parents, Cerrato was a child when her family fled fascism in Europe for South America. Authoritarianism continued to shape her life in adulthood, as Cerrato and her husband and son were forced to leave Argentina to escape persecution at the hands of the country's military junta in 1973.

“She was teaching at the School of Architecture at the University of Buenos Aires, which was said to have a lot of leftist people. Her best friend was disappeared at that time,” Mary Sabbatino, vice president and partner of Galerie Lelong New York, said at a preview of the exhibition.

Living at various points during her career in São Paulo, Caracas, and Buenos Aires, Cerrato was widely celebrated in Latin America. Over 60 years, she had 30 solo shows, including at the Museo de Bellas Artes de Caracas and the Museo de las Américas in San Juan, and 150 group shows, largely in Argentina and Venezuela. The Argentine government honored Cerrato with the Premio Nacional a la Trayectoria Artística, or National Award for Artistic Career, in 2019.

The past few years have seen Cerrato featured in the 2024 Venice Biennale and, in 2023, the Bienal de São Paulo and Shanghai Biennale, plus the last major solo show before her death, at the Museo Moderno in Buenos Aires in 2021. But Sabbatino hopes to lift the artist out of obscurity in the U.S., an effort that started last fall with a solo presentation at New York's Independent 20th Century art fair, and builds on her inclusion in “Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960–1985,” the Hammer Museum's critically acclaimed show for 2017's “Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA.”

The paintings in the new show represent two distinct bodies of work. There are Cerrato's “cosmovision” canvases from the 1960s, which are more abstract, biomorphic compositions done in oil paint, with organic-looking shapes and patterns. These were representations of the universe's underlying invisible energetic forces.

Then there are the acrylic paintings from the mid-to-late '70s, which often incorporate maps of Latin America. Overlaid on top is more representational imagery based on photographs, in crisply rendered circular or rectangular insets. These can feature landscapes, or crowds of people, farm laborers, and other slightly cryptic imagery. The most overtly political one shows the outline of a young boy's body lying across the nation of Brazil, which Sabbatino said Cerrato painted in response to the murder of a 12-year-old accused of stealing a bicycle.

Cerrato made the earlier works after a stint living in Venezuela, where she and her husband, composer Luis Zubillaga (1928–1995), traveled at the invitation of the Gurdjieff Foundation, which looks to follow the teachings of the Armenian mystic and philosopher George Gurdjieff (ca.1866–1877 – 1949). He believed that humans live their lives as if hypnotized, but can awaken to a higher state to achieve their true purposes—a path of spiritual growth he called the Fourth Way.

“Elda was very involved with consciousness, the idea of a divine which is not religious, but informs all of our interactions,” Sabbatino said. “She was a big believer in systems and diagrams, and having diagrams from consciousness. And so you see the systems in the work.”

Before taking up the paintbrush, Cerrato studied biochemistry, and an interest in science permeated her work as an artist—but melded with spirituality. When she and her husband were teaching at the National University of Tucumán, in a remote region of Argentina, the faculty believed that they were seeing an alien presence.

“There were scientists, mathematicians, and every night, apparently, they had sightings of UFOs,” Cerrato's son, the filmmaker Luciano Zubillaga, told me. “I was too little, so I cannot actually say they were UFOs, but these were very rational people, and everybody witnessed it.”

As a child, Zubillaga always knew there was something different about his mom compared to his friends' mothers. “She was a feminist,” he told me, noting that Cerrato also drew inspiration from the female body. “There is a painting that more explicitly looks like a UFO. And it's ambiguous. It's either a UFO or a vagina!”

When Sabbatino encountered Cerrato at the São Paulo Bienal, the work made a huge impression. But at the time, the estate had made a preliminary deal with a different gallery, and Sabbatino didn't want to interfere. But when she learned that representation had fallen through, she pounced.

“I went to Argentina to do my seduction,” she joked. (The hardest part, she said, wasn't convincing Zubillaga, but actually getting the works through Argentine customs.)

In life, Cerrato decided not to pursue a career in New York. In the 1980s, she met with Leo Castelli (1907–1999), the famed dealer. He told her to give it a year in the city, but home, at that time, was Caracas, and Cerrato felt she had to return.

Zubillaga believes his mother would be happy with how her New York moment finally came together in the end: “I think she would take it as natural!”

"It's a whole new show for me," said Kristian Ventura when asked about his experience filming School Spirits Season 3 during an interview with Collider at Sundance 2026. It's a sentiment that succinctly encapsulates watching the Paramount+ show's newest season, one that flips the narrative on its head, reverse-engineers the stakes, and rises to the challenge of a hellish tone. Of the season's eight episodes, the first three were provided for review, and they were enough to appreciate that School Spirits is heading in a bold, new direction. The foundation of the previous seasons remains, including that teenage angst and coming-of-age sweetness, but it takes on a darker form, one that works admirably thus far.

School Spirits Season 2 left us on the jaw-dropping cliffhanger of Maddie (Peyton List) returning to her physical body and Simon (Ventura) getting trapped in a red scar. The third season picks up right there, with Maddie navigating the repercussions of her disappearance in her home life and at school, while Simon takes up Maddie's mantle in the afterlife. It's the first overt role reversal of the season, but there are many more surprises to come, redefining everything we thought we knew about Split River High and its mysterious limbo.

The first two seasons of School Spirits were a comforting brand of ghostly, but the third season wafts into the territory of ghoulish, or almost demonic. On both the living and dead sides of the story, the series ups the ante with a slew of villains and creepy entities, leaning into the seeds of horror that were budding in the background of the first seasons. Many of the introduced ideas tread on familiar ground, including an ultra-strict authority figure summoned from the nightmares of every high school student, a classic Carrie bloodbath scene, or suspicions of malicious counterparts to our kind ghosts. But that's not to say the show doesn't incorporate these ideas seamlessly into the story; nothing feels forced, and its darker trajectory is cohesive.

Also, what better way to plunge into darkness than to introduce a horror icon to the cast? School Spirits previously teased the addition of Jennifer Tilly, who doesn't quite have a major role in the first three episodes of the season, but her brief on-screen appearances already demand our attention. Her character may begin as an archetype, but disturbing undercurrents to her behavior and demeanor are hopefully setting up the "seriously unhinged" revelation Tilly hints at during the same Sundance interview. She plays a huge role in crafting the dread-laden atmosphere that hangs over the school and is vital for the show's tonal shift, so it was a pretty effective casting choice.

The cast join us for an exclusive Q&A about the shows all-new dynamics, character journeys, and what fans can expect this season.

Alongside its promising, cumulative darkness are the light-hearted coming-of-age components that make School Spirits the teenage romp that it is, though even these take on a more serious tone. More so than previously, grief, loss, and anxiety during adolescence become bigger themes in the show, where the supporting cast's backstories and identities are fleshed out in moving sequences, particularly Yuri (Cihang Ma) and Rhonda (Sarah Yarkin). While occasionally it can be emotionally overwhelming, there is usually a reprieve through dark humor or the utterly ridiculous, but fitting subplot two of the characters find themselves in — infiltrating a group of teenage mean girls is apparently just as daunting as escaping the afterlife.

In many shows with expansive world-building, there is usually a make-or-break point where adding another layer atop an already complex system can either make it far too convoluted or stronger. It seems that School Spirits is reaching that point with its supernatural system, as the first three episodes set up numerous moving parts to its afterlife. So far, the writing and direction are confident enough that the added elements aren't disrupting the story's flow or its immersive nature. Precise and clear storytelling makes the suspense in the atmosphere possible, and if previous seasons are anything to go by, there should be a decent payoff, though it's too soon to tell.

Not only do the paranormal rules expand, but so does the setting. In Season 2, Xavier's (Spencer MacPherson) near-death accident granted him the ability to communicate with the dead in the hospital, including Maddie's father. As expected, that plays a huge role in Season 3, and the hospital becomes a staple set in the show, contributing to its pursuit of darker (and ironically enough, funnier) material. There are also a couple of new sets in the afterlife that are impressively creepy, truly signaling the series' tonal shift. Thus far, School Spirits is juggling its new rules, locations, and characters with a strong and clear direction, while still balancing these with the emotional texture that resides at the heart of the show.

Now that Maddie and Simon's roles are essentially flipped in Season 3, School Spirits introduces a whole new set of relationships and stakes through the ensemble cast's performances and chemistry. Maddie's interactions with her living friends are filtered through the strangeness of her disappearance and the unresolved issues they had before their communication was abruptly cut off. In Season 2, List's performance was divided between her roles as Maddie and Janet-Maddie, but here, her attention is wholly directed at the bizarre and grueling circumstances Maddie's reappearance has led to. Some of her strongest performances in the show are in these episodes, carried out with an unexpected grit that her character benefits from.

Meanwhile, Simon is meeting all the ghosts face-to-face for the first time, and this results in some memorable interactions. Naturally, the dynamics between the ghosts change with this addition, especially after a disappointingly anticlimactic decision at the beginning of the season. While the narrative choice makes sense in the long-run, the execution harms the stakes of the show. Despite that, Simon's new situation and relationships offer a new set of stakes that lean more into the realm of horror than supernatural drama, making for a gripping viewing experience.

In the first three episodes, School Spirits Season 3 is clearly gearing up for some kind of supernatural chaos, and its approach thus far has been effective. For a series that prioritized teenage stories through a supernatural lens, it's a bold move to strike out into more overt horror, but it's working in the show's favor. If the series continues down this path, Season 3 could potentially become the strongest and scariest installment yet.

School Spirits Season 3 premieres on January 28, only on Paramount+.

School Spirits Season 3 cleverly develops its mystery while flipping the script entirely.

Jim Beaver found a silver lining.

Supernatural reached major milestones last year with the 20th anniversary of the pilot as well as the fifth anniversary of the divisive series finale. One of the only elements of that finale (available streaming now with a Peacock subscription and Amazon Prime subscription) that wasn't terribly divisive among fans was that Jim Beaver appeared one last time as Bobby in the afterlife. Bobby was a pivotal figure in Sam and Dean's lives before and after his death, and Beaver has opened up about his reaction to his character's demise as well as the one silver lining.

While not a series regular from start to finish, Jim Beaver was one of the few Supernatural actors to appear in at least one episode of all fifteen seasons. That's especially impressive given that Bobby was killed in Season 7. The actor, who went on to work with Supernatural creator Eric Kripke on The Boys, spoke with TV Insider about Bobby's swan song among the living:

I learned I would die from the showrunners Bob Singer (my character is named after him) and Sera Gamble, who said, ‘We're going to kill you, but you're coming back as a ghost.' I ended up doing more seasons after I was dead. Still, I was disappointed that instead of doing half of a season's episodes, I'd be lucky to do one or two.

I can't blame Jim Beaver for being disappointed, especially since Bobby was killed in one of the less popular seasons by one of the least impressive big bads of the series. True to their word, Bob Singer and Sera Gamble brought his character back as a ghost just months after his death in the Season 7 midseason finale, and the actor also went on to portray a version of Bobby from an alternate world.

Beaver would eventually be credited in 19 episodes after OG Bobby's death. He went on to share what he appreciates about how his character's demise was handled:

But my death episode, ‘Death's Door,' was one of the best episodes of television I've ever been associated with.

“Death's Door” broke the usual format of Supernatural by delving into a series of flashbacks as Bobby's mind slowly died, with Steven Williams reprising his role as the late Rufus for Bobby's final bow. To the show's credit, keeping Bobby dead does make his passing in “Death's Door” pack a lot more of a punch than other deaths.

I've lost count of how many times Dean was killed before Jensen Ackles performed the final demise, and Misha Collins had several options to choose from when he selected his favorite Castiel death… and that was when there were still several seasons left before the one that actually stuck! Deaths were harder to take seriously by the end of the series, and Bobby's stands as one of the most emotional because it did stick. (Though it should be noted that he did experience one resurrection after being killed the first time in Season 5.)

Jim Beaver was able to reprise his role one last time, although not in Supernatural. Bobby turned up in the series finale of The Winchesters, the short-lived spinoff executive produced by Jensen Ackles. Short of a revival like the ones pitched by Ackles and Jared Padalecki, it's possible that The Winchesters was the last time that Bobby Singer appeared on the small screen.

The mystery of unidentified flying objects has long fascinated the public, sparking endless debates, documentaries and late-night speculation. Yet Joe Rogan believes the phenomenon is on the brink of collapse. Rogan delivered a blunt warning to UFO enthusiasts: unless aliens make a clear appearance, the fascination with unidentified flying objects may vanish.

Speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience with comedian Tom Segura, the podcaster expressed disbelief that UFO news is not dominating headlines. For him, the lack of mainstream coverage signals a dangerous decline in public interest, one that could extinguish the UFO craze altogether.

Rogan's frustration stems from a growing mistrust in mainstream media. He argues that even when intriguing UFO sightings surface, the stories rarely receive the prominence they deserve. This disconnect, he believes, risks killing the UFO phenomenon altogether. The media's cautious or dismissive approach, Rogan explained, undermines public engagement and leaves people craving proof. 'The moment aliens show up, everyone will care. Until then, this is dying,' he warned.

Segura chimed in, agreeing that audiences crave tangible evidence. The conversation painted a picture of a public ready to embrace extraordinary revelations, but left waiting for confirmation. Rogan suggested that without concrete sightings or government disclosure, the UFO craze is susceptible to fading into the background, eclipsed by celebrity gossip and political drama.

For Rogan, the solution is simple: aliens must appear in a way that is verifiable. He stressed that speculation and unverified reports no longer satisfy the public, particularly in an era of digital misinformation. 'People are losing trust in everything,' Rogan said. 'If UFOs are real and we want people to care, they need to show themselves. Otherwise, all the hype dies.'

He framed this as a turning point for the UFO conversation, suggesting the next decade could see either a dramatic resurgence in interest or a complete collapse of the narrative. In Rogan's view, the stakes are high: without evidence, the mystery of UFOs risks becoming just another forgotten curiosity.

The podcaster also tied the fading UFO fascination to wider societal trends. As trust in media wanes, people are increasingly sceptical of official reports and scientific pronouncements. This skepticism makes it harder for UFO stories to gain traction. Rogan warned that even when compelling evidence emerges, a divided public may struggle to take it seriously.

The podcast discussion highlighted the delicate balance between curiosity, proof, and credibility. Rogan argued that the media must either embrace extraordinary stories responsibly or risk losing the public's attention entirely. In his words, 'Without trust, even the most incredible revelation is just noise.'

Ultimately, Rogan's message is clear: speculation alone cannot sustain the UFO frenzy. The world wants proof, not rumours. The podcaster's blunt assessment underscores the high stakes for UFO researchers and enthusiasts alike. As he told Segura, 'If aliens show up, everyone will pay attention. Until then, this is dying.'

For those captivated by the unknown, Rogan's warning is a wake-up call. The UFO craze may survive only if evidence emerges that the public can see and believe. Until then, the buzz risks disappearing, lost in the shuffle of daily news and eroding trust in the sources meant to inform us.

ByDani Di Placido,

Senior Contributor.

A meme sparked by an odd conspiracy theory involving the Leviathan, sea beast of biblical legend, has risen on social media.

The bizarre theory inspired a wave of posts which repeat the phrase, “the Leviathan is waking up near Virginia.”

One unexpected fallout of the monster storm that hit the U.S. was the resulting commentary on Facebook and Threads, with conspiratorial users claiming that the winter weather had been artificially engineered to hide the Leviathan. 

Apparently, the gargantuan sea monster has been awakened from a long slumber.

The world is a magical place for some social media users, and Leviathan-enthusiasts saw what they believed to be the creature in a weather map, the post pointing to a shape that resembles a great sea serpent.

The last few years has seen fantastical conspiracy theories spread through the internet, cross-pollinating with strands of mythology, theology, digital folklore and ironic memes, resulting in increasingly unreal narratives.

This isn't even the first time that Facebook users have spotted the Leviathan on Google Earth, but the theory appears to have been given a dramatic boost by the arrival of the ice storm.

The Leviathan isn't the only icy meme to have been inspired by the winter weather, but it's surely the strangest.

The Leviathan is a fearsome sea monster referenced in the Hebrew Bible. 

An archetypal sea monster, the Leviathan is said to be like a dragon, a serpent or a multi-headed Lovecraftian entity—any version will do, and in this case, theorists have settled on the sea serpent variant.

Like Godzilla and Kong, the Leviathan has an enormous, land-dwelling counterpart known as the Behemoth (perhaps it will be the next titan to awaken). 

While conspiracy theorists have chosen to take the Leviathan literally, the monster is commonly interpreted as a metaphor, representative of chaos and sin.

Outside of the conspiratorial circle, screenshots were shared in disbelief across social media, sparking mockery and memes.

On X, many commentators took a liking to the idea of a kaiju approaching U.S. shores, and expressed their support for the sea beast. 

Others couldn't help but nitpick the “plot holes” in the theory.

One user even posted their favorite depiction of the Leviathan, which has taken many weird and wonderful forms over the centuries.

The biblical story is about divine order defeating primordial chaos, as the Leviathan is destroyed by God, echoing similar legends across history, such as Thor slaying the World Serpent.

Perhaps the conspiracy theory could be interpreted as a metaphor, the beast representing the chaos unleashed by the monstrous storm. 

Admittedly, that isn't nearly as much fun as the Leviathan waking up near Virginia.

“Stuck in Saṃsāra” on view Feb. 6-March 22, opening reception Feb. 6, 6-9 p.m.
“Stuck in Saṃsāra” presents 10 Asian American & Pacific Island artists from around the U.S. (Christian Bañez, Martin Castro, Jon Chao, Anne Chen, Eriko Hattori, Marius Keo Marjolin, Brent Nakamoto, Anthony Park Kascak, Sara Tang and Song Watkins Park) working in painting, drawing, printmaking, ceramics, sculpture and video.



In Buddhism, saṃsāra describes the world's endless cycle of repeated birth, life and death. Curator Brent Nakamoto was inspired by the Buddhist “Parable of the Burning House” to artistically examine the saṃsāra concept. “Central to the exhibition,” he says, “is the image of fire in its many forms. Fire is destruction and death, but it's also energy, purification, rebirth, life itself. Flames destroy but they also bloom.”

“Lewis Hine Pictures America” on view Feb. 21-May 17
Lewis Wickes Hine (1874-1940) was a pioneering American documentary photographer whose art drew attention to the country's Progressive Era social reform movements. Starting in the 1890s, he produced riveting photos of immigrants, farmers and factory workers — including some powerful portraits of steelworkers in Pittsburgh and the neighborhoods where they lived. Hine refined the technique of what he called “photo-interpretation” to transform black-and-white images of everyday working Americans into eloquent and empathetic fine art.



This is a ticketed exhibit,with tickets on sale at the Frick's website. All the way into May, when the show closes, the Frick will host a dozen film screenings, workshops and lectures related to the social themes that Hine's photography shed light on.

“Stuck in Saṃsāra” on view Feb. 6-March 22, opening reception Feb. 6, 6-9 p.m.
“Stuck in Saṃsāra” presents 10 Asian American & Pacific Island artists from around the U.S. (Christian Bañez, Martin Castro, Jon Chao, Anne Chen, Eriko Hattori, Marius Keo Marjolin, Brent Nakamoto, Anthony Park Kascak, Sara Tang and Song Watkins Park) working in painting, drawing, printmaking, ceramics, sculpture and video.



In Buddhism, saṃsāra describes the world's endless cycle of repeated birth, life and death. Curator Brent Nakamoto was inspired by the Buddhist “Parable of the Burning House” to artistically examine the saṃsāra concept. “Central to the exhibition,” he says, “is the image of fire in its many forms. Fire is destruction and death, but it's also energy, purification, rebirth, life itself. Flames destroy but they also bloom.”

“Lewis Hine Pictures America” on view Feb. 21-May 17
Lewis Wickes Hine (1874-1940) was a pioneering American documentary photographer whose art drew attention to the country's Progressive Era social reform movements. Starting in the 1890s, he produced riveting photos of immigrants, farmers and factory workers — including some powerful portraits of steelworkers in Pittsburgh and the neighborhoods where they lived. Hine refined the technique of what he called “photo-interpretation” to transform black-and-white images of everyday working Americans into eloquent and empathetic fine art.



This is a ticketed exhibit,with tickets on sale at the Frick's website. All the way into May, when the show closes, the Frick will host a dozen film screenings, workshops and lectures related to the social themes that Hine's photography shed light on.

“Gabe Felice Solo Show” on view Feb. 6-28, opening reception Feb. 6, 6-9 p.m.
Self-dubbed “psychic/visual artist” Gabe Felice began to draw while learning to write the alphabet. “My father was an encyclopedia salesman,” he says, “so I had access to a broad variety of images and concepts from A to Z which definitely impacted my style. I drew as a way to decode and communicate the hidden information I was receiving and seeing within my environment.” His current primary medium is acrylic on wood, and he works without preliminary sketches or visual references, preferring to create by following “internal instructions … a subtle voice guiding me toward new techniques or a particular color.”

“Gabe Felice Solo Show” on view Feb. 6-28, opening reception Feb. 6, 6-9 p.m.
Self-dubbed “psychic/visual artist” Gabe Felice began to draw while learning to write the alphabet. “My father was an encyclopedia salesman,” he says, “so I had access to a broad variety of images and concepts from A to Z which definitely impacted my style. I drew as a way to decode and communicate the hidden information I was receiving and seeing within my environment.” His current primary medium is acrylic on wood, and he works without preliminary sketches or visual references, preferring to create by following “internal instructions … a subtle voice guiding me toward new techniques or a particular color.”

“Stuck in Saṃsāra” on view Feb. 6-March 22, opening reception Feb. 6, 6-9 p.m.
“Stuck in Saṃsāra” presents 10 Asian American & Pacific Island artists from around the U.S. (Christian Bañez, Martin Castro, Jon Chao, Anne Chen, Eriko Hattori, Marius Keo Marjolin, Brent Nakamoto, Anthony Park Kascak, Sara Tang and Song Watkins Park) working in painting, drawing, printmaking, ceramics, sculpture and video.



In Buddhism, saṃsāra describes the world's endless cycle of repeated birth, life and death. Curator Brent Nakamoto was inspired by the Buddhist “Parable of the Burning House” to artistically examine the saṃsāra concept. “Central to the exhibition,” he says, “is the image of fire in its many forms. Fire is destruction and death, but it's also energy, purification, rebirth, life itself. Flames destroy but they also bloom.”

“Lewis Hine Pictures America” on view Feb. 21-May 17
Lewis Wickes Hine (1874-1940) was a pioneering American documentary photographer whose art drew attention to the country's Progressive Era social reform movements. Starting in the 1890s, he produced riveting photos of immigrants, farmers and factory workers — including some powerful portraits of steelworkers in Pittsburgh and the neighborhoods where they lived. Hine refined the technique of what he called “photo-interpretation” to transform black-and-white images of everyday working Americans into eloquent and empathetic fine art.



This is a ticketed exhibit,with tickets on sale at the Frick's website. All the way into May, when the show closes, the Frick will host a dozen film screenings, workshops and lectures related to the social themes that Hine's photography shed light on.

“Stuck in Saṃsāra” presents 10 Asian American & Pacific Island artists from around the U.S. (Christian Bañez, Martin Castro, Jon Chao, Anne Chen, Eriko Hattori, Marius Keo Marjolin, Brent Nakamoto, Anthony Park Kascak, Sara Tang and Song Watkins Park) working in painting, drawing, printmaking, ceramics, sculpture and video.



In Buddhism, saṃsāra describes the world's endless cycle of repeated birth, life and death. Curator Brent Nakamoto was inspired by the Buddhist “Parable of the Burning House” to artistically examine the saṃsāra concept. “Central to the exhibition,” he says, “is the image of fire in its many forms. Fire is destruction and death, but it's also energy, purification, rebirth, life itself. Flames destroy but they also bloom.”

“Lewis Hine Pictures America” on view Feb. 21-May 17
Lewis Wickes Hine (1874-1940) was a pioneering American documentary photographer whose art drew attention to the country's Progressive Era social reform movements. Starting in the 1890s, he produced riveting photos of immigrants, farmers and factory workers — including some powerful portraits of steelworkers in Pittsburgh and the neighborhoods where they lived. Hine refined the technique of what he called “photo-interpretation” to transform black-and-white images of everyday working Americans into eloquent and empathetic fine art.



This is a ticketed exhibit,with tickets on sale at the Frick's website. All the way into May, when the show closes, the Frick will host a dozen film screenings, workshops and lectures related to the social themes that Hine's photography shed light on.

Pittsburgh Glass Center celebrates its 25th anniversary with a special exhibit featuring 100 local glass artists and their custom-made work. “Gathered Locally” includes Sandra Bacchi, Chris Clarke, Lisa Demagall, Margot Dermody, Percy Echols II, Matt Eskuche, Jason Forck, Elizabeth Fortunato, Jaime Guerrero, Leslie Kaplan, Rocky Kindelberger, Zach Layhew, Heather McElwee, Michael Magiafico, Gillian Preston, Chris Ross, Rebecca Smith and more.



One of the world's most respected glass art institutions, the center was founded by artists Kathleen Mulcahy and the late Ron Desmett and has blossomed into a destination for artists, students and visitors from around the world while helping to transform a Pittsburgh neighborhood and revive a historic regional craft.



“PGC was built on the belief that glass art should be accessible, collaborative and inspiring,” says Executive Director Heather McElwee. In addition to its regular exhibits, the center has educated nearly 75,000 people in glassmaking through classes, free demonstrations, exhibitions, school partnerships, artist residencies and community events including the popular monthly HOT Jam demonstrations.

“Gabe Felice Solo Show” on view Feb. 6-28, opening reception Feb. 6, 6-9 p.m.
Self-dubbed “psychic/visual artist” Gabe Felice began to draw while learning to write the alphabet. “My father was an encyclopedia salesman,” he says, “so I had access to a broad variety of images and concepts from A to Z which definitely impacted my style. I drew as a way to decode and communicate the hidden information I was receiving and seeing within my environment.” His current primary medium is acrylic on wood, and he works without preliminary sketches or visual references, preferring to create by following “internal instructions … a subtle voice guiding me toward new techniques or a particular color.”

“Lewis Hine Pictures America” on view Feb. 21-May 17
Lewis Wickes Hine (1874-1940) was a pioneering American documentary photographer whose art drew attention to the country's Progressive Era social reform movements. Starting in the 1890s, he produced riveting photos of immigrants, farmers and factory workers — including some powerful portraits of steelworkers in Pittsburgh and the neighborhoods where they lived. Hine refined the technique of what he called “photo-interpretation” to transform black-and-white images of everyday working Americans into eloquent and empathetic fine art.



This is a ticketed exhibit,with tickets on sale at the Frick's website. All the way into May, when the show closes, the Frick will host a dozen film screenings, workshops and lectures related to the social themes that Hine's photography shed light on.

“Gabe Felice Solo Show” on view Feb. 6-28, opening reception Feb. 6, 6-9 p.m.
Self-dubbed “psychic/visual artist” Gabe Felice began to draw while learning to write the alphabet. “My father was an encyclopedia salesman,” he says, “so I had access to a broad variety of images and concepts from A to Z which definitely impacted my style. I drew as a way to decode and communicate the hidden information I was receiving and seeing within my environment.” His current primary medium is acrylic on wood, and he works without preliminary sketches or visual references, preferring to create by following “internal instructions … a subtle voice guiding me toward new techniques or a particular color.”

“Gathered Locally – 25 years of Glass Art at Pittsburgh Glass Center” on view Feb. 6-April 12, opening reception Feb. 6, 6-9 p.m.
Pittsburgh Glass Center celebrates its 25th anniversary with a special exhibit featuring 100 local glass artists and their custom-made work. “Gathered Locally” includes Sandra Bacchi, Chris Clarke, Lisa Demagall, Margot Dermody, Percy Echols II, Matt Eskuche, Jason Forck, Elizabeth Fortunato, Jaime Guerrero, Leslie Kaplan, Rocky Kindelberger, Zach Layhew, Heather McElwee, Michael Magiafico, Gillian Preston, Chris Ross, Rebecca Smith and more.



One of the world's most respected glass art institutions, the center was founded by artists Kathleen Mulcahy and the late Ron Desmett and has blossomed into a destination for artists, students and visitors from around the world while helping to transform a Pittsburgh neighborhood and revive a historic regional craft.



“PGC was built on the belief that glass art should be accessible, collaborative and inspiring,” says Executive Director Heather McElwee. In addition to its regular exhibits, the center has educated nearly 75,000 people in glassmaking through classes, free demonstrations, exhibitions, school partnerships, artist residencies and community events including the popular monthly HOT Jam demonstrations.

“Gabe Felice Solo Show” on view Feb. 6-28, opening reception Feb. 6, 6-9 p.m.
Self-dubbed “psychic/visual artist” Gabe Felice began to draw while learning to write the alphabet. “My father was an encyclopedia salesman,” he says, “so I had access to a broad variety of images and concepts from A to Z which definitely impacted my style. I drew as a way to decode and communicate the hidden information I was receiving and seeing within my environment.” His current primary medium is acrylic on wood, and he works without preliminary sketches or visual references, preferring to create by following “internal instructions … a subtle voice guiding me toward new techniques or a particular color.”

“Gabe Felice Solo Show” on view Feb. 6-28, opening reception Feb. 6, 6-9 p.m.
Self-dubbed “psychic/visual artist” Gabe Felice began to draw while learning to write the alphabet. “My father was an encyclopedia salesman,” he says, “so I had access to a broad variety of images and concepts from A to Z which definitely impacted my style. I drew as a way to decode and communicate the hidden information I was receiving and seeing within my environment.” His current primary medium is acrylic on wood, and he works without preliminary sketches or visual references, preferring to create by following “internal instructions … a subtle voice guiding me toward new techniques or a particular color.”
