                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doctors may soon be able to tell just how sick a heart failure patient really is by using a routine MRI scan, thanks to new research from the University of East Anglia. This helps doctors understand how severe the condition is. But the invasive procedure is far from pleasant and carries risks, especially for older, frail or unwell patients. In collaboration with researchers at the University of Leeds and Newcastle University, the team developed a way to estimate this crucial measurement of blood oxygen using a standard cardiac MRI. Now, they hope their findings could potentially spare thousands from undergoing the risky tube procedure in future. Doctors often need detailed information about a patient's circulation to decide on the best treatment. We wanted to develop a safe, non-invasive alternative which could allow far more patients to be properly assessed - and allow repeat monitoring without the risks of a catheter test. Our breakthrough could be a game changer for assessing advanced heart failure. It could allow us to measure risk more safely and more often, especially for patients who are too frail or high-risk for an invasive catheter procedure." Prof Garg said: "Blood with different oxygen levels behaves slightly differently in a magnetic field. They then analysed 628 people with newly diagnosed heart failure, following them for around three years. Those with healthier oxygen readings on MRI were significantly less likely to die or end up in hospital due to their condition. Crucially, this MRI-based measure stayed accurate even after accounting for age, other illnesses and overall heart function. Until now, getting that number has usually meant a tube test. Our study shows it can be estimated non-invasively from a standard heart MRI." Co-author Dr Gareth Matthews, from the University of East Anglia, said: "Because this can be done as part of a standard cardiac MRI, it needs no extra hardware and no contrast dye, and adds only seconds to the scan. 'Development and validation of a non-invasive model of mixed venous oxygen saturation in heart failure' is published in the journal JACC Advances.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tiny zebrafish is helping researchers rapidly determine whether a newborn's genetic mutation is likely to cause spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), one of the leading causes of infant mortality worldwide. The world-first research, led by Dr. Jean Giacomotto from Griffith University's Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, has featured on the front cover of EMBO Molecular Medicine this month (January). SMA is a genetic disorder which causes progressive loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and loss of basic motor functions. Without treatment, SMA is typically fatal, and while highly effective therapies now exist, they can exceed US$2 million per child per year and must be initiated before symptoms appear such as when a baby is able to sit but lacks sufficient neck strength to hold their head steady. If treatment starts after the emergence of these symptoms, the child will have already experienced irreversible degenerative damage, leading to life-long problems and possibly death within the first years of life. When a baby carries a mutation which has never been seen before, known as a 'variant of uncertain significance or VUS', clinicians face an impossible dilemma – start treatment immediately, risk unnecessary intervention, or wait and risk irreversible nerve damage." Dr. Jean Giacomotto from Griffith University's Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics To solve this, Dr. Giacomotto and his team developed a rapid zebrafish-based functional assay which could determine the pathogenicity of a novel SMN1 mutation within days, potentially informing urgent clinical decisions worldwide. "Within a clinically meaningful timeframe, we were able to functionally test each baby's exact mutation and show it was not harmful," Dr. Giacomotto said. "This research provides the clearest demonstration to date that zebrafish can play a decisive role in clinical variant interpretation, particularly in newborns flagged through expanding genomic screening programs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 135 million American adults are either living with or at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D), elevating the need for more evidence-based dietary guidance to help this growing population achieve optimal health and reduce risks for T2D and its complications. Recently published findings from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrate that eating 6-7 ounces of beef per day does not impact risk factors for T2D, as well as other cardiometabolic health markers, in adults with prediabetes. The study, "Effects of Diets Containing Beef Compared with Poultry on Pancreatic β -Cell Function and Other Cardiometabolic Health Indicators in Males and Females with Prediabetes: A Randomized, Crossover Trial," was published in Current Developments in Nutrition. Results from this gold standard RCT build on existing scientific evidence that shows eating beef as part of a healthy dietary pattern supports heart health and does not adversely impact measures of blood sugar regulation or inflammation. When beef is consumed as part of a healthy dietary pattern, it helps fill essential nutritional gaps and does not adversely impact the cardiometabolic risk profile compared to poultry." Kevin C Maki, PhD, Adjunct Professor in the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington, and senior author of the article This RCT with a crossover design included 24 adults (17 males and 7 females; ages 18-74 years) with overweight or obesity and prediabetes, who were otherwise generally healthy. The participants each completed two 28-day dietary intervention periods, separated by a 28-day washout period. Participants consumed two entrées per day, each containing 3.0-3.5 ounces of cooked beef or poultry, in the form of fajitas, stew, burgers, burritos, or stir fry, as part of their habitual dietary pattern. "The study findings suggest that regular beef intake does not adversely affect metabolic or inflammatory risk factors compared with poultry in an at-risk prediabetic population," noted Indika Edirisinghe, PhD, Professor of Food Science and Nutrition, Illinois Institute of Technology. "Although the study duration was relatively short (one month), this time frame is generally considered sufficient to detect measurable metabolic outcomes." Guzman, E., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bottom line: A four-biomarker blood panel of aminopeptidase N (ANPEP), polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), CA19-9, and thrombospondin-2 (THBS2) enhanced the detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) compared to measuring CA19-9 levels alone. Journal in which the study was published: Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). Most cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed at late stages. "Pancreatic cancer usually doesn't present with symptoms until it's too late for surgery, when the cancer has already metastasized to other parts of the body," said Zaret. "Our goal was to look for biomarkers in the blood that appear in early-stage PDAC patients, to catch the disease early," he explained. CA19-9 is a protein that is released into the blood by both cancer cells and normal pancreatic cells, and elevated levels of CA19-9 in the blood can be a sign of pancreatic cancer or other diseases. THBS2 is a protein that is expressed in PDAC tumor tissue, and when screened for in blood alongside CA19-9 using a bioassay, enables the test to better discriminate between PDAC and healthy patients, according to previous work from Zaret and colleagues. However, Zaret noted that these biomarkers are insufficient for routine early detection. "CA19-9 is widely used to monitor diagnosed pancreatic cancer but isn't recommended as a standalone screening test-benign conditions can elevate it in some people, while others may have low levels, even if they have pancreatic cancer. THBS2 is investigational and can complement CA19-9, but its prediagnostic performance has been mixed," he said. The cohorts included patients with confirmed pancreatic cancer, healthy individuals, and patients with benign pancreatic disease, which enabled the researchers to evaluate the ability of candidate biomarkers to differentiate between pancreatic cancer and benign conditions that could mimic cancer. By comparing protein levels across the plasma samples, the researchers identified two proteins, ANPEP and PIGR, that showed elevated levels in samples from patients with early-stage PDAC, compared with samples from patients without cancer. Zaret and colleagues then developed a panel that measured the blood levels of four biomarkers: the newly identified ANPEP and PIGR, along with the previously known biomarkers CA19-9 and THBS2. The AUC is a measure of the test's ability to distinguish between two groups, with 1.0 being a perfect score. The panel was also able to distinguish cancer from benign pancreatic conditions with an AUC 0.87 for early‑stage PDAC and 0.91 for all stages in the Mayo cohort. Authors' comments: If confirmed in larger, prospective studies, the four-biomarker blood panel could improve the ability to identify which individuals with a high risk for pancreatic cancer would benefit from follow-up imaging, explained Zaret, adding that this could allow clinicians to detect more pancreatic cancers at an earlier, more treatable stage. "With the addition of ANPEP and PIGR, the panel helps to overcome known limitations associated with CA19-9 and THBS2 testing-such as patients who genetically underexpress CA19-9 or tumors that present as different molecular subtypes-and could therefore reduce the number of missed cancer cases while keeping false positives low," he said. Study limitations: One limitation of this study is that the cohorts did not include individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer, such as those with a family history, germline BRCA mutations, or new-onset diabetes, introducing a bias in test performance, noted Zaret.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alzheimer Europe has today launched the "The Prevalence of Dementia in Europe 2025" report, which provides updated prevalence figures for the number of people living with dementia both for Europe as a whole, as well as the countries within. Alzheimer Europe adopted the same methodology, seeking out community-based studies published since the Dementia in Europe Yearbook 2019, from which new prevalence rates across 5-year age bands were derived. These updated prevalence rates were then applied to population projections for 2025 and 2050 taken from the UN World Population Prospects (UN WPP) data 2024. The report also estimates that by 2050 there will be 14,335,788 people with dementia in EU27 countries and 19,905,856 people with dementia in EU and non-EU countries combined. To understand whether there had been any significant change in the estimated number of people with dementia, between 2019 and 2025, Alzheimer Europe used its estimates for EU27 countries, as a point of comparison. However, among men, consistently higher prevalence rates were observed in each of the 70+ age bands, but in particular for the 70-74 band. The picture for women was generally more mixed. The projected increase in overall numbers reinforces the call that Alzheimer Europe and its member associations have been making for many years: EU and national decision-makers must take action to ensure that society supports people with the condition, their families and carers to live well as well as possible. From a policy perspective, health and social care systems must have the necessary capacity and infrastructure to provide high-quality care and support to individuals living with dementia, from diagnosis through to end-of-life care. Furthermore, research agendas must, as a matter of priority, give dementia the status it deserves, prioritising basic research to better understand the condition, clinical studies to develop diagnostics and treatments, and demographic research looking at the populations affected, allowing for improved system responses. Alzheimer Europe's message for decision-makers at an EU and national level is clear: The number of people living with dementia will continue to grow over the coming decades. A failure to act now, to invest sufficiently in health, care and social protection systems, provide adequate support for research and implement strong preventative interventions, will exacerbate the challenges ahead. "The scale of the challenge posed by dementia across Europe is substantial and it is our sincere hope that our updated figures provide the impetus for decision-makers, both at the European and national levels, to prioritise dementia and ensure it is addressed across the domains of health, research, disability policy and support for informal carers. In particular, policy-makers must work to improve care services, make investments in health infrastructure for diagnosis and treatment, as well as help for family, carers and supporters of people with dementia. Our Helsinki Manifesto sets out a blueprint of actions, at the EU and national level, to improve the lives of people with dementia, their carers and families. We reiterate the key calls from our Helsinki Manifesto: There is a clear need for a coordinated European Action Plan on Dementia and a dedicated research mission, each with ringfenced funding to ensure their proper implementation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Because treatment of the whole prostate can lead to long-term side effects in patients with prostate cancer, interest in minimally invasive, focal treatment options has been growing for certain patients. A clinical trial published in BJU International generated promising results for a type of focal therapy, which directly targets the cancer and spares the remainder of the unaffected prostate gland. The ProFocal Laser Therapy for Prostate Tissue Ablation (PFLT-PC) trial is the first pivotal trial of ProFocal®, a novel, cooled laser focal therapy device for prostate cancer treatment. In the 100-participant trial, 84% of patients had no clinically significant prostate cancer on their 3-month post-treatment biopsy. The treatment provided similar cancer-related outcomes to those that have been reported for other focal therapy devices, but with an improved safety profile and low rates of incontinence. This new technology is very promising with excellent cancer control while preserving patients' quality of life. Jonathan Kam, MD, corresponding author of Nepean Hospital, Australia Kam, J., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sapio Sciences, the science-aware™ AI lab informatics platform, today announced the results of new research examining scientists' sentiment around electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) and AI tools in modern laboratory environments. The study reveals widespread frustration with existing lab software, leading to repeated experiments, inefficient data use, and a growing reliance on unauthorized shadow AI. Despite the significant investments made in digital lab technology, ELNs often fail to support effective scientific work. Only 62 % of scientists say their ELN allows them to work efficiently, and just 5 % report being able to analyze experimental results without specialist support. Nearly two-thirds of scientists, 65 %, say they have had to repeat experiments because prior results were difficult to find or reuse, driving avoidable costs and delays across lab teams. The survey highlights several ways today's ELNs are falling short: Mike Hampton, chief commercial officer at Sapio Sciences, said: Most ELNs were designed as tools that focused on documenting experiments, not actively supporting scientists or guiding next steps. Today, scientists are working with increasingly complex data and are expected to move from results to decisions faster than ever, yet many ELNs still function like glorified filing cabinets.” “When scientists can't analyze data or easily build on previous experiments without additional support, frustration turns into real cost. Unnecessary experiment duplication wastes reagents, instrument time, and specialist labor. Almost half of scientists surveyed, 45 %, say they use public generative AI tools through personal accounts to support their work, despite the security, IP, and compliance risks associated with shadow AI. They're doing it because existing lab tools can't help them analyze results or determine next steps efficiently. When AI capability isn't available in governed environments, people will find it elsewhere, even when they do understand the risks.” When asked what they want from the next generation of ELNs, scientists consistently emphasized interaction, guidance, and interpretation rather than documenting experiments alone. Almost all respondents, 96 %, say future ELNs must help interpret data, not simply capture it. Scientists also want built-in, field-specific AI capabilities, with demand varying by discipline: Rob Brown, head of the scientific office at Sapio Sciences, said: “Our research clearly shows that second-generation ELNs have reached the limits of what scientists expect from them. As we shape the next generation of lab software at Sapio, the focus is on AI-enabled scientific analysis and design methods that keep scientists in control while actively supporting workflows, analysis and next-step decisions.” The findings suggest scientists are not looking to relinquish control but to work with AI tools that actively support reasoning and interpretation within governed lab environments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major new study has found that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which applies magnetic energy to the brain, can be a cost-effective treatment option for the NHS in treating moderate and severe forms of depression that have not responded to other treatments. The economic analysis, which is published in BMJ Mental Health, compared TMS to usual care in specialist mental health services, and found that TMS reduces depressive symptoms, eases pressures on informal carers and on NHS resources, and helps people get back to work. TMS represents an investment in care that recovers its costs over time, primarily from savings to the wider health service and from fewer workdays being lost because of long-term depression. The study was led by senior health economist Edward Cox from the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit at the University of Nottingham and Professor Richard Morriss from the Institute of Mental Health, National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, and the NIHR HealthTech Research Centre in Mental Health (MindTech). Antidepressants and therapy delivered as first or second-line treatments help two thirds of people with depression, but the remaining third have treatment resistant depression (TRD). The person is conscious and has at least 20 sessions over a four-to-six-week period. Although TMS was invented in the UK, the equipment produced by UK industry, and has been proven effective and implementable within mental health care services, it is only available in one in seven NHS Trusts. In this new study, experts set out to assess the cost-effectiveness of two forms of TMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (rTMS) and intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), compared to usual care for TRD. Susan Varley, a patient who has received a course of TMS therapy, said: "As a previously high functioning nurse, I suffered severe depression and had to be admitted to hospital because of the severity of my depression. I tried all sorts of different treatments for my depression. I then travelled to receive a course of TMS and it has transformed my life. I am back working as a nurse, lost four stone in weight and I am enjoying life again with family and friends. Our economic analysis was informed via feedback from TMS experts across six mental health care services, and from the experiences of 442 participants suffering with difficult-to-treat forms of depression enrolled within two clinical trials. The study found that a proportion of patients receiving TMS therapies can expect to achieve faster and more sustained improvements in depressive symptoms compared to usual care, and that these gains represent a cost-effective allocation of scarce NHS resources. It's important to recognize that the cost-effectiveness of TMS is dependent specifically on how it is going to be delivered in wider practice. Our study findings demonstrate that services that can achieve a streamlined high throughput model of care can expect to deliver a highly cost-effective treatment. Our findings should provide much needed evidence for policymakers to rationalise and establish cost-effective models for implementing TMS within the NHS." NICE typically considers medical interventions to be cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for a treatment [the expected cost to the health service per unit of benefit] falls within or below a threshold of £20,000–£30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. From a broader societal perspective both rTMS and iTBS improved health, reduced informal care hours and were cost-saving compared with TAU. The study findings were sensitive to service delivery, but provided there is a high throughput of patients receiving TMS and currently recommended protocols for TMS are followed, then this research suggests that TMS is a cost-effective alternative to usual care. Professor Richard Morriss, Research Theme Lead for Mental Health and Technology at the NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, and the School of Medicine at the University, said: "Our view is that TMS should be considered as a cost-effective alternative for treating moderate to severe depression after the second course of treatment has failed. "Compared to usual care, our study shows that TMS is cost-effective below the lowest NICE threshold for cost-effectiveness for health costs and cost saving if health, informal care and work productivity are included. With this in mind, we feel that it is time for the NHS to seriously consider implementing TMS in NHS services across the UK."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A neural circuit hidden in an understudied region of the brain plays a critical role in turning temporary pain into pain that can last months or years, according to new University of Colorado Boulder research. Our paper used a variety of state-of-the art methods to define the specific brain circuit crucial for deciding for pain to become chronic and telling the spinal cord to carry out this instruction. If this crucial decision maker is silenced, chronic pain does not occur. If it is already ongoing, chronic pain melts away." The study comes amid what first author Jayson Ball calls a "gold rush of neuroscience." With new tools enabling them to genetically manipulate precise populations of brain cells, neuroscientists are now able to identify, with unprecedented granularity, potential targets for new therapies. Such therapies, including infusions or brain-machine interfaces, could someday provide safer and more effective alternatives to opioids. "This study adds an important leaf to the tree of knowledge about chronic pain," said Ball, who earned his doctorate in Watkins' lab in May and now works for Neuralink, a California-based startup that develops brain-machine interfaces for human health. About one in four adults have chronic pain, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and nearly one in 10 people say chronic pain interferes with their daily life and work. Those with nerve-related pain often suffer from a condition called allodynia, an extreme sensitivity in which even light touch hurts. Chronic pain is more like a false alarm, in which pain signals persist in the brain for weeks, months or years after the initial tissue injury has healed. "Why, and how, pain fails to resolve, leaving you in chronic pain, is a major question that is still in search of answers," said Watkins. But for a long time, the only way to manipulate the CGIC was to remove it-an impractical approach for human treatments. The team then used cutting-edge "chemogenetic" tools to switch on or off genes inside specific populations of neurons. The researchers discovered that while the CGIC plays a minimal role in processing acute pain, it plays a vital role in making pain persist. "We found that activating this pathway excites the part of the spinal cord that relays touch and pain to the brain, causing touch to now be perceived as pain as well," said Ball. When the team turned off cells within this pathway immediately after injury, the rat's pain from injury was short-lived. In animals already experiencing chronic allodynia, disabling this pathway made the pain cease. "Our research presents a clear case that specific brain pathways can be directly targeted to modulate sensory pain," said Ball. It's still unclear what prompts the CGIC to start sending chronic pain signals. And more research is necessary before these lessons learned could be applied to help humans. But Ball imagines a not-too-distant future in which medical professionals treat pain with injections or infusions that target specific brain cells without the systemic side effects and dependency risk that come with opioids. He also believes brain-machine interfaces, either implanted in or attached to the skull, could play a similar role in treating severe chronic pain. "Now that we have access to tools that allow you to manipulate the brain, not based just on a general region but on specific sub-populations of cells, the quest for new treatments is moving much faster," he said. Targeted protein degradation presents a promising strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, focusing on innovative approaches for gram-negative bacteria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sleeping without pillows may help lower high internal eye pressure, build-up of which causes optic nerve damage and glaucoma-the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide–in people with the condition, suggests preliminary research, published online in the British Journal of Ophthalmology. Internal eye pressure, formally known as intraocular pressure, or IOP for short, fluctuates in response to changes in body posture, and the transition from an upright to a supine position during sleep represents the primary contributor to its increase at night, note the researchers. To explore this further, they looked at the effect on IOP of sleeping with 2 regular sized pillows, providing a head elevation of 20–35°, in 144 adults with glaucoma (84 aged up to 44; 41 aged 45 to 59; and 19 aged 60 and above). Seventy participants had normal tension glaucoma; 9 had high blood pressure in the eye, and 65 had primary open angle glaucoma, the most common and slowly progressive form of the condition-often due to clogged up aqueous humor drainage. When supine, their heads were subsequently raised to an elevation of between 20° and 35° by two normal sized pillows, and their IOP measured 10 minutes later. They then reverted to sleeping on their backs until the next measurement. Four sets of complete measurements were obtained for each participant with and without pillows. In all, 96 (67%) participants had a demonstrable increase in IOP when transitioning from a supine to an elevated position, with an average increase of around 1.61 mm Hg. Internal eye pressure was significantly higher in the elevated position (17.42 mm Hg vs 16.62 mm Hg), with greater fluctuations over the 24 hour period. At the same time ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), which measures the pressure available to push blood through the eye's tiny vessels, was significantly reduced when 2 pillows were used: 54.57 mm Hg vs 58.71 when supine. Reduced OPP is an indicator of a reduction in blood flow bringing oxygen and nutrients to the eye. When the results were stratified further, they showed that young adults were much more likely to have significantly greater IOP than older adults as were those with primary open angle glaucoma. Postural jugular vein blood flow was assessed in 20 healthy volunteers both with and without pillows. "Traditional strategies of nocturnal IOP management are primarily limited to increasing the types and frequency of IOP-lowering medications or supplementary laser therapy," explain the researchers. "Given the well-documented influence of postural changes on IOP, positional modification emerges as a plausible strategy warranting further investigation." This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. Further research is needed to validate these preliminary findings, they emphasise, but they nevertheless conclude that the findings "may be linked to jugular venous compression induced by neck flexion, which could potentially compromise venous return and aqueous humour outflow. "Patients with glaucoma may therefore benefit from avoiding sleeping postures that induce jugular venous compression to mitigate postural IOP elevation. Such behavioral adjustments represent a simple yet potentially effective adjunctive strategy for optimising long-term IOP management in clinical practice." Targeted protein degradation presents a promising strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, focusing on innovative approaches for gram-negative bacteria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A newly approved National Cancer Institute-funded clinical trial aims to improve survival for head and neck cancer patients whose disease returns after radiation therapy – a setback that affects up to 40% of patients and is often associated with poor outcomes. This Phase II trial will examine whether giving chemotherapy, or chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, before surgery can improve survival compared with surgery alone. It can mean losing the voice box, removing much of the tongue, or risking serious complications in the neck, and despite all that, outcomes are still not where we want them to be. We hope this trial identifies a treatment that will help patients live longer without the cancer returning." Patients deemed surgical candidates will be randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) before surgery; the same chemotherapies plus the immunotherapy drug cemiplimab before surgery; or surgery alone. The drug targets cancers that are positive for PDL1, a protein marker indicating the tumor may be vulnerable to immunotherapy. Most head and neck cancers are PDL1-positive, Henson said. Patients with especially high-risk cancer may receive radiation therapy following surgery. "We have worked to standardize the technical details of this trial. It has been gratifying to contribute the institutional knowledge of our radiation oncology department," said Newpower, who is the lead proton physicist for OU Health Stephenson Cancer Center. Targeted protein degradation presents a promising strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, focusing on innovative approaches for gram-negative bacteria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gene-editing tools like CRISPR have unlocked new treatments for previously uncurable diseases. The UBC team, together with researchers from the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité in Germany, has developed the first gene therapy capable of correcting faulty genes when applied directly to human skin. Outlined today in a paper published in Cell Stem Cell, the breakthrough could lead to new treatments for a wide range of genetic skin conditions, from rare inherited diseases to more common disorders like eczema. With this work, we show that it is possible to correct disease-causing mutations in human skin using a topical treatment that is safe, scalable and easy-to-use. Importantly, the approach corrects the root cause of disease, and our data suggests that a one-time treatment might even be enough to provide a lasting and durable cure." Affecting approximately one in 100,000 people, ARCI causes lifelong complications including extremely dry and scaly skin, chronic inflammation and a high risk of infections. There is currently no cure or effective treatment, and patients must manage their symptoms for life. "For many patients, this condition is not only physically painful, but also deeply stigmatizing and isolating," said Dr. Hedtrich. By testing the treatment in models made from living human skin, the team showed it can restore up to 30 per cent of normal skin function-a level that previous research suggests could be clinically meaningful for returning skin function to normal. While ARCI affects relatively few people, the researchers say the treatment strategy could be adapted to many other genetic skin diseases, including epidermolysis bullosa-a severe skin blistering condition often called 'butterfly skin'-and potentially more common conditions such as eczema or psoriasis. "The approach we developed is a platform technology," said Dr. Hedtrich. "It can be readily adapted to treat almost any skin disease." Despite major advances in gene editing, applying the technology to skin diseases has remained a long-standing challenge. To overcome this, the team developed a novel delivery method that uses lipid nanoparticle technology, or LNPs. These microscopic "bubbles of fat," pioneered by UBC professor Dr. Pieter Cullis and brought to global prominence through mRNA vaccines, are able to carry gene-editing technology into cells. "This is a highly targeted, localized approach," said Dr. Hedtrich. "The treatment stays in the skin and we saw no evidence of off-target effects, which is a critical safety milestone." The study was conducted in close collaboration with Vancouver-based biotech company NanoVation Therapeutics, a UBC spin-off focused on developing LNP-based genetic medicines. "Our goal now is to take this from the lab into first-in-human clinical trials," said Dr. Hedtrich. "We hope this work will ultimately lead to a safe, effective treatment that can transform the lives of patients who currently have no real therapeutic options."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Older women who have a history of both depression and anxiety had a 78% higher risk of developing long COVID after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, report University of California San Diego researchers in the Jan. 27, 2026 online edition of the journal Menopause. When these conditions occur together, they usually indicate more severe mental illness." Wael Al-Delaimy, MD, PhD, senior author, professor at the Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science, UC San Diego "In this study, we measured the health of women over 20 years by analyzing data from the Women's Health Initiative. We found that older women with a combined history of both depression and anxiety, before the COVID-19 pandemic, were at the highest risk of long COVID complications." Long COVID is a chronic condition in which people experience persistent symptoms that last three months or more after the initial infection. People experiencing mental health illnesses are vulnerable to other diseases and may have trouble following public health guidelines. "We hope that by characterizing these mental health risk factors public health officials and policymakers can target preventative measures to those with the greatest need," said co-author William Bruno, MD, MPH, associate physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the UC San Diego School of Medicine. In addition, the community should stay vigilant and care for people who may be dealing with loneliness, isolation or existing mental illness should another pandemic or other isolating event occur, said Al-Delaimy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Purdue University team led by Kyle Cottrell has discovered a new therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer. Kyle Cottrell, assistant professor of biochemistry, Purdue University The laboratory research spotlights double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA)-binding proteins. "Generally, people are taught in high school biology that RNA is single-stranded. Human cells contain many double-stranded segments of RNA, as do viruses. "We have proteins that can recognize those double-stranded RNAs," Cottrell said. When cells detect that they've been infected with a virus, "they activate various pathways to stop the viral infection." But these dsRNA-sensing pathways present a problem when they are activated in the absence of a viral infection. "They have to be kept at bay most of the time. We don't have a great understanding of how that works." RNA is a molecule that plays key roles in cellular and viral processes, including protein formation. DsRNA-binding proteins and dsRNAs in human cells attract keen biomedical scientific interest because of their many connections to autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders, Cottrell said. They have even been implicated in the aging process. "As you age, your cells lose the ability to block some of these sensing pathways. They start activating dsRNA sensing pathways and cause inflammation." The process creates a cellular state that has helped some new cancer immunotherapies to work better, Cottrell said. This work and studies published this year by two other groups show that PACT suppresses another protein called RNA-activated protein kinase, or PKR. Previously conflicting findings led to a controversy over PACT's role in PKR regulation. "Our evidence goes to the side that it's been a suppressor, not an activator," Cottrell said, which more firmly established that as PACT's role in triple-negative breast cancer. The RNA paper builds on previous work from Cottrell's group regarding two other proteins that act much like PACT. "They are suppressors of double-stranded RNA sensing. Their job is to block activation of double-stranded RNA sensors like PKR," Cottrell said. The team identified both PACT's role in triple-negative breast cancer and the proteins that play similar roles because they all might serve as viable therapeutic targets. Some cell lines depend on PACT while others don't. Or we can mimic that by changing something in the cells. "Triple-negative breast cancer in particular seems to be quite sensitive to depletion of PACT, so it might be one of the better cancers to target for it. But there are definitely opportunities in other cancer types," Cottrell noted. The disease could especially benefit from target-specific therapies to replace chemotherapies that broadly hit all dividing cells, healthy and diseased alike. "You get terrible side effects with those." Therapeutic targets for cancer and many other diseases are often enzymes - proteins that speed up chemical reactions. We found that PACT is a dimer. Cottrell plans to probe the unknown details of how dimerized PACT inhibits PKR. "We're working toward that now," he said. "But beyond that, there are basic science questions on how the cell prevents activation of PKR or other double-stranded RNA sensors." This work is part of Purdue's One Health initiative, which brings together research on human, animal and plant health, and was supported by the Ralph W. and Grace M. Showalter Research Trust Award, the National Institutes of Health, the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research, and the Department of Biochemistry in Purdue's College of Agriculture. PACT suppresses PKR activation through dsRNA binding and dimerization, and is a therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer. Targeted protein degradation presents a promising strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, focusing on innovative approaches for gram-negative bacteria.
