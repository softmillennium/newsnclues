(2026)Cite this article One of the most remarkable properties associated with Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) is superfluidity, in which the system exhibits zero viscosity and flows without dissipation. The superfluid phase has been observed in wide-ranging bosonic systems spanning naturally occurring quantum fluids, such as liquid helium, to engineered platforms such as bilayer excitons and cold atom systems1,2,3,4. Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid—termed a supersolid5,6,7,8. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained unknown9,10,11. Here we report observation of a superfluid-to-insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magnetoexcitons. Mapping the transport behaviour of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid on increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low-temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase.

(a) Counterflow conductance (GCF, black trace) and parallel flow conductance (GPF, red trace) as a function of Δν measured at T = 0.3. (b) Counterflow conductance as a function of Δν measured at T = 0.3 K and 1.5 K. The Δν-regime of the exciton superfluid (ES) and exciton insulator (EI) are marked by red and blue shaded background, respectively. The superfluid corresponds to a large counterflow conductance, whereas it is insulating in parallel flow measurement. On the other hand, the exciton insulator displays zero conductance in both parallel flow and counterflow measurements. However, the insulator undergoes a reentrant transition into a superfluid phase with increasing temperature. (c) Counterflow and parallel flow conductance, GCF and GPF (black and red traces), as a function of temperature measured at Δν = −0.57, where the low temperature ground state is an exciton insulator. (d) Counterflow and parallel flow conductance, GCF and GPF (black and red traces), as a function of temperature measured at Δν = −0.44, where the low temperature ground state is an exciton superfluid. All measurements are performed in a Corbino-shaped sample (C1) at ∣νtotal∣ = 1 and B = 29 T. (e) GCF and GPF as a function of Δν near the low-temperature transition induced by Δν. A peak in GPF, marked by the vertical arrow, is observed near the transition. (f) GPF as a function of T measured at Δν = −0.57.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several hundred million light-years after the Big Bang, clouds made of hydrogen and helium cooled enough to begin collapsing under their own gravity. During this time, conditions may have allowed a rare type of star to form. Known as dark stars, such objects could grow to enormous sizes and may naturally evolve into the seeds that later become supermassive black holes. These observations have challenged long standing theories about how the first stars and galaxies formed. These galaxies are extremely bright, very compact, and contain little to no dust. Before JWST, no simulations or theoretical models predicted that galaxies with these properties should exist so early in cosmic history. Their discovery has forced astronomers to reconsider how quickly stars and galaxies could have formed. JWST data have also intensified an ongoing mystery involving supermassive black holes. Some of the earliest observed galaxies appear to host black holes that are far larger than expected for their age. Explaining how the seeds of these larger-than-expected supermassive black holes (SMBHs) formed so quickly remains a major challenge. In addition, JWST has revealed a new category of compact objects known as "little red dots" (LRDs). These dust-free sources date back to cosmic dawn and are unusual because they emit little to no X-ray radiation, something astronomers did not anticipate based on existing models. Taken together, the blue monster galaxies, early overmassive black holes, and little red dots point to serious gaps in pre-JWST theories of early galaxy and black hole formation. The findings suggest that widely accepted models need substantial updates to account for what JWST is now seeing. The authors describe in detail how dark stars could account for the properties of blue monster galaxies, little red dots, and early galaxies hosting massive black holes. Dark stars are among the most intriguing theoretical objects in modern astrophysics. If confirmed, they could offer a way to directly probe the properties of dark matter particles. This would complement ongoing efforts to detect dark matter in laboratory experiments on Earth, whether through direct detection or particle production, and could help connect cosmic observations with fundamental physics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This lifeform's extraordinary biology could hold the key to anti-aging breakthroughs. Homo sapiens have remarkable regenerative abilities—wounds heal, bone fractures “thread” back together, and some organs can even regrow from devastating injury—but none of these biological bonafides compares to the healing power of the humble starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis). Because of this ability to seemingly defy the aging process, these animals have figured prominently in anti-aging research. Now, in a study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers from the University of Vienna have possibly identified small, multi-potent cells in scarlet sea anemones that basically allow cnidarians to continually drink from the proverbial fountain of youth. In humans, stems cells allow limited regeneration of certain cells in our body (which is why they're central to the exploration of anti-aging therapies), however, other animals display much greater, whole-body regenerative abilities compared to us humans. Because it can reproduce asexually (though it can multiply sexually as well) and can be raised easily in laboratory conditions, N. vectensis has quickly become the go-to species for studying the immortal abilities of cnidarians more broadly (a concept known as a “model organism”). While scientists have known that the scarlet sea anemone shows little to no signs of aging, they haven't been able to identify stem cells that drive this unending youth mainly due to their extremely small size. University of Vienna's Ulrich Technau, the senior author of this new study, and his team used a new method called “single cell genomics” in the hunt for these missing stem cells. The scientists were able to discern the stem cell lineage of certain cells developed based on transcriptome profiles, which are a collection of mRNA transcripts. “By combining single-cell gene expression analyses and transgenesis,” University of Vienna's Andreas Denner, the first author of the study, said in a press statement. When the team mutated the nanos2 gene using CRISPR gene scissors, they discovered that this protein was necessary for forming germ cells as well as somatic cells and likely appeared in nature around  600 million years ago.

At a press conference in London last week, the researchers unveiled a suite of instruments specifically designed to look at oxygen production, either on the sea floor or in laboratory experiments that reproduce deep-sea conditions, including 400 atmospheres of pressure. Speaking at the event, team leader Andrew Sweetman, a sea-floor ecologist at the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban, UK, described two probes — each with different capabilities — designed to land on the sea floor to take measurements and samples. “We will be taking landers that are specifically built to look at dark-oxygen production,” he says. The landers that made the original discovery could not measure pH because they were not designed to detect or study oxygen production, says Sweetman. The original study found dark oxygen in a region containing polymetallic nodules, ancient nuggets of valuable metals such as manganese and cobalt that form on ocean floors over millions of years. Perhaps they work separately, perhaps they work in tandem,” said team member Jeff Marlow, a geobiologist at Boston University in Massachusetts, at the press conference. “We will build microscale maps of microbes, minerals and metabolic activity in nodules,” he added. Researchers will re-visit the Clarion–Clipperton Zone and deploy landers that have been designed to investigate dark oxygen.Credit: Scottish Association for Marine Science Chemist Franz Geiger at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, says he will conduct pressure-chamber experiments on polymetallic nodules retrieved from the sea floor to investigate the rocks' electrochemistry and examine their surfaces using special transmission electron microscopes that work in liquid cells.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The surprising ways diet can shape your body scent Beneath fancy perfumes and deodorants, our food choices may be quietly shaping our natural scent in unexpected ways By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Sushmita Pathak & Alex Sugiura In late 2024 Nicola Coughlan, the actor famous for her work on Derry Girls and Bridgerton, was asked about her work with Ncuti Gatwa, who played the 15th Doctor on Doctor Who. How someone smells, whether it's good or bad, can leave a long-lasting impression. That's why we pour so much money into scented bath washes, deodorants and perfumes. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. But under all of those products remains our natural scent. And while factors such as illness and how often we bathe can affect that smell, so can food, according to a number of studies. Thank you so much for joining us today. So obviously, caveat here is that this is a very new field, and so we're only starting to collect data. We don't have that much data that we can really draw really, really good lines about, like, “Smelling sweet is because you've eaten sweet stuff,” or “Smelling sour is because you've eaten sour stuff.” And in general it's not really that straightforward of a process, right, 'cause the food goes through our body and gets digested inside our gut. And then either we're smelling because our breath smells a certain way because of the volatile chemicals coming back up from our gut, or because they've gone through our bloodstream and we're sweating them out, right? So obviously, we all love to eat garlic; it makes things super tasty. But then our breath doesn't smell exactly as delicious afterwards. And so researchers—it's one of the reasons researchers targeted it, right? They're like, “Oh, it's the most annoying of the smells when you're, when you're smelling it on somebody's breath. Let's see what happens to body odor after garlic,” right? And so the researchers actually had about 40 men wear some armpit pads—like, yeah, like, absorbent pads under their armpits—collecting their sweat for about 12 hours. Then they had [about] 80 women rate the scent from those pads, which is kind of gross if you think about it too much. Pierre-Louis: Yeah, how do you sign up for that study? I did not sign up for this. And then the women basically had to rate the men's smell, right, according to, like, subjective ratings that—of how they felt, whether they were pleasant and attractive or masculine and intense. And the findings suggested that the men with a little bit of garlic consumption weren't making these women react in any particular way, but those eating a lot of garlic were perceived as very sexy, so their rankings for sexiness went up. They were like, “We had to do this three times 'cause we didn't think the data made sense,” right? You would expect garlic to smell nasty under an armpit as well. So they were also confused and surprised, and they thought it was quite funny to have this data. And they've actually thought long and hard about it, and their theory right now is that, you know, maybe—because garlic is, is a good food for your health, right? It has a lot of antimicrobial properties that improve people's health. Maybe that's what's making someone smell subconsciously more sexy. It's because, you know, we've evolved to select romantic partners or sexual partners that are healthy because of the way that evolution works and how our bodies are wired to think about, like, “Oh, we need to procreate.” So maybe that's what's going on? This evolutionary lens is how the scientists have been trying to explain it. Pierre-Louis: So the solution is: eat a garlic-heavy diet, but really make sure to brush your teeth. But the garlic research did sort of fall in line with the broader research that suggested eating a lot of fruits and veggies tends to make us smell better, at least from a sweat perspective. It can be, depending on how gassy you are as a human, it could be hit or miss with your GI track and your breath. But when it comes to sweat in particular it does seem that, like, lots of fruit, lots of veg are pretty good for us. Quaglia: Yeah, so while maybe our pee smells a little weird after we have asparagus or we can get a little gassy after some, some veggies, similar studies where they had kind of people wear sweat pads and stuff—I think this one was done in Australia—found that the men who were eating more fruits and vegetables were kind of smelling better. And again, researchers kind of justify that by saying, “Okay, well, it's probably because, you know, veggies, fruits, they're healthy for our diet, they make our bodies healthy and strong, and so that's maybe what our body scent is then subconsciously communicating.” But again, these are really small studies with small samples, so we don't have, like, loads of data. Pierre-Louis: Are there foods that—or things that we consume that may make us less appealing, like, smell less great? Quaglia: Although there isn't a lot of data and we're just starting to see emerging trends, researchers have started to see a little bit of patterns on stuff that are making us smell a little bit less pleasant. So for instance, [some of] that same team that put the absorbent pads for garlic [Laughs], they also looked into whether meat makes us more attractive. They had men who were either eating a lot of meat or a nonmeat diet for two weeks, and then they had, again, women rate their scents for pleasantness, attractiveness, masculinity and intensity. And again, the researchers kind of had to rack their brains about this 'cause they were like, “Oh, but what—I mean, we, evolutionarily, we've always eaten meat. Why would that make us smell less pleasant?” This was not what they were expecting to find because meat is considered kind of, like, an important part of the human diet. But the researchers also did know, you know, early humans were eating meat, sure, but they were eating, like, a lot less meat than what we're eating today, and they weren't eating the super ultraprocessed meat that we eat now. They were eating different types of meat. Although alcohol might make us feel relaxed and in a better mood, it does seem to be one of those that doesn't smell that good. Pierre-Louis: I feel like, with alcohol in particular, we kind of know that intuitively. But the meat was a little bit surprising, especially now, in an era where there are so many people pushing, like, meat-only diets. Quaglia: These are very small studies, so I don't know if we can really make huge, sweeping statements, but for sure there seems to be a little bit of a subtle shift, so depending on how much you care about how you smell [Laughs], that could be something to take into consideration. I think an important caveat to point out here is so much of this is also culturally mediated. Things that somebody growing up in a certain type of culture might not find attractive in scent, somebody from another culture might. So we need to take into consideration all of that and kind of see that there's obviously, like, subjective preferences; there's cultural preferences. If you've grown up eating rice and curry your whole life, you're obviously going to have a different predisposition towards that scent, compared to somebody who's never eaten rice and curry before, right? So there's a lot of cultural mediation here that we need to think about, and there's a lot of context. That's why it's been quite hard to set up these experiments, right, aside from the icky parts of, like, how do we collect men's sweat under their armpits? So I think this is a super fascinating area of study, for sure. Pierre-Louis: But we also kind of know that scent is important intuitively. Like, everyone talks about, like, how a newborn baby smells or, you know, wearing your partner's old hoodie because it still smells like them when they're away from you. So we kind of know, like, yes, it's culturally mediated, but there does seem to be a there there in the sense of, like, the way a person smells can really factor into whether you're attracted to them or you're repelled by them. Quaglia: For sure, and what's super fascinating here is that each one of us has a unique scent profile, right, like a fingerprint. There's a growing body of research here that shows that everything from our personality type, like, whether you're an extrovert or whether you're an introvert, to our mood and our health really affects the way we smell, you know? So diet is just, like, one of the small bits and pieces that goes on top of that, right? That's also why it's hard to say, “Okay, I'm gonna make decisions about how I smell from now on just based on my diet,” because [Laughs] there's a lot of other things at play, for sure. Pierre-Louis: Nope, sorry, what I've heard is, I'm going to live on a broccoli- and carrot-only diet from here on out—with apples: broccoli, carrot and apples.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common malignancy with limited durable responses to first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based therapies. Emerging evidence implicates the gut microbiome in modulating ICI efficacy. In the investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2a TACITO trial, we evaluated whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from complete ICI responders enhances clinical outcomes in treatment-naive patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) receiving pembrolizumab + axitinib. The primary endpoint was the rate of patients free from disease progression at 12 months after randomization (12-month progression-free survival (PFS)). Secondary endpoints were median PFS and median overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), safety and microbiome changes, after randomization. Although the primary endpoint was not met (70% versus 41% for d-FMT versus p-FMT, respectively, P = 0.053), the secondary endpoint of median PFS was significantly longer with d-FMT (24.0 months in the d-FMT arm versus 9.0 months in the p-FMT arm; hazard ratio = 0.50, P = 0.035). The ORR was 52% of patients in the d-FMT arm and 32% of patients receiving placebo. Microbiome analysis confirmed donor strain engraftment and increased α-diversity and larger microbiome shifts (β-diversity) compared with baseline composition in the d-FMT treatment group. Acquisition or loss of specific strains, but not total engraftment, was associated with the primary endpoint. Our findings support the safety and potential efficacy of selected donor FMT to enhance ICI-based treatment in mRCC, which deserves further investigations. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs) have changed the management of different cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The combination of pembrolizumab (a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor monoclonal antibody) with axitinib (a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor) has significantly improved overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC)1, and it is currently used as first-line therapy in this population. However, most patients experience disease progression within 16 months, with limited therapeutic options thereafter. A growing body of evidence suggests that the composition of the gut microbiome may affect the efficacy of ICIs in several epithelial tumors, including RCC2. First, the use of antibiotics, which are known to disrupt the gut microbiome3, has been associated with worse clinical response to ICIs in different types of cancer4, including RCC5. Also, several microbial taxa and/or ecological communities have been associated with response to ICIs in different epithelial cancers2, and the transfer of gut microbiome from humans to mice was proven to influence the response to ICIs in cancer mouse models6. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) provided clinical benefit in ICI-refractory7,8,9 or treatment-naive10 patients with advanced solid tumors, mostly melanoma, without serious adverse events (SAEs). However, thus far, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy of FMT in mRCC. Our phase 2a placebo-controlled RCT aims to evaluate whether FMT from patients with mRCC with complete response to ICIs was effective in improving response to combined first-line therapy with pembrolizumab and axitinib in patients with mRCC. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated phase 2a RCT, we enrolled patients with metastatic, histologically confirmed RCC who were eligible to receive pembrolizumab and axitinib as first-line therapy. We excluded patients unable to undergo FMT, with a history of concomitant gastrointestinal or autoimmune disorders, with prior exposure to systemic immunomodulators or with ongoing or recent (<4 weeks prior to enrollment) antibiotic use. Full eligibility criteria are described in Methods. The primary endpoint was the rate of patients free from disease progression at 12 months after randomization (12-month PFS). Secondary endpoints were median PFS and median overall survival, ORR, safety and microbiome changes, after randomization. After a baseline visit, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive donor FMT (d-FMT) or placebo FMT (p-FMT) three times in 6 months, unless disease progression occurred. Both groups underwent the first procedure by colonoscopy, followed by capsulized FMT after 12 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. Due to the potential delay in treatments depending on donor feces availability, we reevaluated patients 2–5 days before the first treatment to collect a stool sample closer to treatments and check their eligibility based on the following predefined withdrawal criteria: actual provision of the first treatment more than 8 weeks from the start of ICI therapy and actual changes in the eligibility criteria evaluated at the time of enrollment. The FAS included all patients who had received at least one treatment. The per-protocol population included all patients who had received treatments without significant delay (≤2 weeks). Thirty-eight patients (17/23 in the d-FMT arm and 21/22 in the p-FMT arm, overall 84%) received further treatments, until they were eligible, within or no later than 2 weeks after the planned schedule and were included in the per-protocol population. In the d-FMT arm, three patients received the second FMT with a delay of 16 weeks each. Moreover, one patient received the second treatment with a 7-week delay and the third treatment with a delay of 26 weeks, and, for another patient, the second treatment was delayed by 4 weeks and the third treatment by 8 weeks. Reasons for delay were the unavailability of FMT capsules and/or the unavailability of patients to attend procedures timely. One patient in the p-FMT arm received the second treatment with a 8-week delay because of their inability to travel. Disease progression was the most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation. One patient in the d-FMT arm did not receive the third FMT, despite being free from disease progression, because of logistic reasons, as initially FMT capsules were unavailable (with a delay also in the second treatment), and then the patient was not able to reach our center. Thirteen months after randomization, the patient experienced disease progression and was then not eligible to receive treatments anymore. Most participants were male (73%), and the median age at the time of treatment initiation was 62 years (range, 41–79 years). According to the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk model, 69% of participants had intermediate-prognosis and poor-prognosis disease. Concerning the tumor histology, most patients had clear cell RCC (n = 40, 89%), whereas a slight minority had papillary (n = 4, 9%) and chromophobe (n = 1, 2%) RCC. We identified five patients with long-term complete response to ICI as candidate donors. Two of these individuals—one 57-year-old man and one 52-year-old woman with RCC, both experiencing complete response after nivolumab + ipilimumab and nivolumab alone, respectively—passed the screening process (Methods) and were eligible to donate. At the data cutoff on 6 February 2025 (2 months after the last study visit), the median follow-up time was 32 months (interquartile range (IQR), 22–37 months). Overall, 31 of 45 patients (69%) in the FAS population experienced disease progression. As hypothesized for the primary efficacy outcome, the proportion of patients without progression or death 12 months after randomization was higher in the d-FMT arm than in the p-FMT arm (d-FMT: 16/23 patients, 70%; p-FMT: 9/22 patients, 41%; P = 0.053). After adjusting for established prognostic factors in mRCC—that is, IMDC criteria and presence of liver metastases—findings were similar to those arising from the unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.23–0.99, P = 0.048). Median overall survival was longer in the d-FMT arm than in the p-FMT arm (41.0 months versus 28.3 months, hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.13–0.99, P = 0.167). The two-sided Breslow test was applied to assess statistical significance. Seventeen of 45 patients (38%) died by the data cutoff, specifically six of 23 patients in the d-FMT arm (26%) and 11 of 22 patients in the p-FMT arm (50%). Median overall survival was longer in the d-FMT arm (41.0 months) than in the p-FMT arm (28.3 months) although not significantly (hazard ratio = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.13–0.99), P = 0.167; Fig. Five patients (23%) in the p-FMT arm and 12 patients (52%) in the d-FMT arm experienced a partial response. Overall, 49 patients (all randomized patients except one patient who withdrew his consent) were included in the safety analysis (Extended Data Table 1). Generally, experimental treatments were well tolerated. Adverse events strictly related to the experimental procedures occurred rarely. One patient experienced grade 2 diarrhea after colonoscopic p-FMT, but this symptom was self-limited and disappeared in few days. Only one patient in the p-FMT arm experienced a grade 3 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) (oral mucositis) during the intake of frozen capsules, which led to the discontinuation of their ingestion. No deaths related to experimental treatments were reported. No transmission of any infectious agent after d-FMT was observed. Among adverse events of special interest (which included gastrointestinal adverse events), the most common of all grades were diarrhea (d-FMT: 52% versus p-FMT: 44%) and aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) increase (d-FMT: 20% versus p-FMT: 28%), and the most common high-grade (grade 3 and grade 4) events were again diarrhea (d-FMT: 12% versus p-FMT: 4%) and AST/ALT increase (d-FMT: 12% versus p-FMT: 8%), all non-significantly different. We collected stool samples throughout the study from the 45 patients in the FAS population (n = 246 samples, collected at baseline and, respectively, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks and 52 weeks after the first treatment in both study arms) and the two donors (n = 9 samples, with collection of all donor stool aliquots administered to the patients). Samples were metagenomically sequenced at high depth and profiled with the computational tools in the bioBakery suite11 (Methods). As a first step, taxonomic profiles obtained via MetaPhlAn 4 (ref. As expected, given the randomized study design, the overall baseline microbiome compositions (Extended Data Fig. 1) did not differ between treatment groups in terms of Shannon α-diversity (P = 0.15; Fig. Donors had similar diversity levels to patients (Fig. 3a), but their microbiomes stood out as outliers in terms of composition (Fig. 3b), which was likely linked to the most abundant species in donors being Bifidobacterium adolescentis (SGB17244) (average 12.5%), whereas this was only the 30th most abundant species in patients (average 0.7% relative abundance). We also noticed that the donor providing 98% of the stool aliquots administered to the d-FMT group lacked metagenomically detectable Akkermansia muciniphila (SGB9226), a 50% prevalence species at the patientʼs baseline, having, instead, the rarer (9% prevalence in patients) related clade recently proposed for reclassification as Akkermansia massiliensis (SGB9228)13,14. Candidatus Cibionibacter quicibialis (SGB15286) (average 9.2% relative abundance), Ruminoccocus bromii (SGB4285) (5.2%) and Bifidobacterium longum (SGB17248) (4.7%) also composed relevant fractions of the donors' microbiome (Extended Data Fig. a, Shannon diversity (left) and species richness (right) box plots comparing arms at baseline. The two-sided Mann–Whitney test was applied to assess statistical significance. Donor diversity levels in their first provided aliquot are included for reference. b, Principal coordinate analyses (PCoAs) on Bray–Curtis dissimilarities comparing microbiome compositions between arms at baseline.

We next evaluated whether these broad microbiome changes were associated with the primary efficacy outcome. We focused on the week 1 and week 4 follow-ups as the only timepoints allowing for statistical comparisons—that is, the ones with five or more individuals in each group (PFS > 12 months versus PFS > 12 months) of the d-FMT arm. In both arms, the number of acquired species and the species-level compositional shift after baseline were not associated with the primary outcome (Extended Data Fig. Notably, the percentage of baseline species lost at follow-up was higher among individuals with PFS > 12 months in the d-FMT arm (week 1 median 28% versus 20%, P = 0.056; week 4 median 24.3% versus 18.2%, P = 0.078; Fig. 3g) but not in the p-FMT arm (week 1 median 19% versus 18%, P = 1; week 4 median 12.9% versus 15.5%, P = 0.64; Fig. This effect of donor FMT in depleting baseline species might be linked to a rewiring of the recipient microbiome that favors immunotherapy clinical response. Only a small proportion of donor strains were already present in patients at baseline, possibly as a consequence of previous direct or indirect contact between individuals or, more likely, of the presence of shared clonal strains in the local population, and, as expected, this fraction did not differ significantly between arms (median DoSER: d-FMT 2.2% versus p-FMT 2.2%, P = 0.73; Fig. The DoSER in patients receiving d-FMT was consistently higher than in the p-FMT arm throughout the whole study period (P < 0.001 across all timepoints starting from week 1 follow-up; Fig. Specifically, the p-FMT DoSER remained as low as the baseline one (one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test P > 0.22 across all timepoints versus baseline, with medians ranging between 1.1% and 2.2%). As expected, individuals in the d-FMT arm showed very high DoSER (median at week 1 follow-up: 18.1%; Fig. 4a) already after the first treatment, confirming a microbiologically successful FMT. High engraftment rates were sustained throughout the study with the aid of the additional treatments (week 4: 14.6%; week 12: 13.9%; week 24: 20.5%; week 36: 24.0; week 52: 17.4%), with a positive correlation observed between strain abundances in the donor aliquots and strain engraftment frequency (Extended Data Fig. The two-sided Mann–Whitney test was applied to assess statistical significance. b, Box plots with the donor strain replacement rate (Methods) with respect to the baseline comparing each arm at each follow-up sample collection.

The effect of d-FMT was also recapitulated by the strain replacement rate with respect to the baseline (Methods), which increased over time in both arms, because of expected longitudinal changes in the gut microbiome (P = 0.002 and P = 0.004 across the longitudinal comparison week 1 versus week 52 follow-ups for the d-FMT arm and the p-FMT arm, respectively) but was significantly higher in the d-FMT arm (P < 0.003 across all cross-sectional comparisons between arms; Fig. We next evaluated whether the DoSER was associated with PFS at the 12-month follow-up after randomization. We found that patients in the d-FMT arm who experienced PFS > 12 months showed similar engraftment rates to patients with PFS < 12 months both at week 1 (median DoSER: 12.0% versus 20.0%, respectively, P = 0.15; Fig. 4c) and at week 4 (median DoSER: 14.5% versus 14.8%, respectively, P = 0.53; Fig. These findings suggest that, despite the clear clinical benefit of d-FMT, the absolute number of donor strains engrafting in patients does not appear to be relevant in influencing it. We then set out to test whether the engraftment success or failure of particular strains was linked with outcomes. This was done by evaluating the fraction of individuals acquiring the donor strain of each species in each group (progression free versus disease progression at the 12-month follow up after randomization) at week 1 (Fig. The acquisition of the Blautia wexlerae (SGB4837) strain from the donor at week 1 was positively associated with 12-month PFS (percentage of recipients acquiring strain with versus without PFS > 12 months: 50% versus 0%, P = 0.047; Fig. On the other hand, acquisition of the donor strain of a yet-to-be-described species (SGB14845) of the family Oscillospiraceae (percentage of recipients acquiring strain with versus without PFS > 12 months: 7% versus 71%, P = 0.006; Fig. Besides assessing acquisition of donor strains, we also evaluated at week 1 (Fig. The loss of the Ruminococcus bromii (SGB4290) baseline strain at the week 1 follow-up was associated with a shortened PFS (percentage of recipients acquiring strain with or without PFS > 12 months: 7% versus 57%, P = 0.025; Fig. All patients in the d-FMT arm who experienced disease progression before 12 months did not lose the baseline strain of those two species, whereas, respectively, 36% and 43% of the patients who had a PFS longer than 12 months did so, although these associations were not significant (P = 0.12 and P = 0.06, respectively; Fig. Median PFS was significantly improved in the d-FMT arm (26.9 months, 95% CI: 7.5–not evaluable) versus the p-FMT arm (8.7 months, 95% CI: 2.8–15.4 months) (hazard ratio = 0.43, 90% CI: 0.20–0.92, P = 0.028; Extended Data Fig. The proportion of patients without progression or death 12 months after randomization was significantly higher in the d-FMT arm than in the p-FMT arm (d-FMT: 12/17, 71%; p-FMT: 8/21, 38%, P = 0.046). Sixteen of 38 patients (42%) died by the data cutoff: five of 17 (29%) in the d-FMT arm and 11 of 21 (52%) in the p-FMT arm. Median overall survival was not significantly longer in the d-FMT arm (41 months) versus the p-FMT arm (28.3 months) (hazard ratio = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.13–0.99), P = 0.146; Extended Data Fig. Complete response was observed in two patients (9%) in the p-FMT arm versus none of the patients in the d-FMT arm. Five patients (24%) in the p-FMT arm and 10 patients (59%) in the d-FMT arm experienced a partial response. Two patients (12%) in the d-FMT arm and seven patients (33%) in the p-FMT arm had progressive disease. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population at data cutoff, 33 of 50 patients (67%) experienced disease progression (d-FMT arm: 16/25, 64%; p-FMT arm: 17/25, 68%). Sixteen patients in the d-FMT arm and 10 patients in the p-FMT arm achieved 12-month PFS (d-FMT 64% versus p-FMT 48%, P = 0.20). Five patients (20%) in the p-FMT arm and 13 patients (52%) in the d-FMT arm experienced partial response. As a post hoc analysis, we evaluated efficacy outcomes in patients with intermediate-prognosis or poor-prognosis disease based on IMDC classification, who typically benefit from pembrolizumab + axitinib combination more than those with favorable-prognosis disease1. In this subpopulation, differences between the two treatment groups became larger in all evaluated efficacy outcomes. The 12-month PFS was achieved by 10 of 16 patients (63%) in the d-FMT arm and by four of 15 patients (27%) in the p-FMT arm (P = 0.045). To our knowledge, the TACITO trial is the first RCT to investigate the effect of targeted FMT in patients with mRCC undergoing first-line combination therapy with pembrolizumab + axitinib as well as the first study to evaluate PFS and overall survival as clinical endpoints, with several intriguing findings. First, donor FMT was superior to placebo in significantly improving the median PFS, with a considerable difference in its duration (24.0 months in the d-FMT arm versus 9.0 months in the p-FMT arm; hazard ratio = 0.50, P = 0.035). This difference may suggest that stronger effects of donor FMT might be appreciated in a longer run than 1 year, both for clinical reasons (because the main cancer therapy in the control arm remains active, effects of FMT on PFS are expected to be more impactful after its median value) and for microbiological reasons (the donor microbiome may exert its effect over 12 months, especially in those patients who received all treatments). Finally, we observed a 52% response in the d-FMT arm compared with 32% in the p-FMT arm. The post hoc analysis of patients with intermediate or poor prognosis based on IMDC criteria showed stronger results of d-FMT compared with p-FMT. These results suggest that patients with intermediate or good prognosis at baseline might benefit more from donor FMT as an add-on to cancer immunotherapy. Further studies on this specific subgroup are warranted. Notably, as already observed in studies coming from our center and other groups15,16,17,18,19,20,21, donor FMT is safe, with no FMT-related SAEs reported in the study period. These clinical results were associated with interesting microbiological findings. First, we observed a significant increase in both α-diversity and β-diversity in the d-FMT arm compared with the p-FMT arm after treatments (secondary outcomes of our study). These findings, together with the finding that the DoSER was consistently higher in patients receiving donor FMT than in the p-FMT group throughout the whole study period, confirm that the donor FMT was microbiologically successful in our study. After assessing the microbiological validity of our intervention, we investigated potential associations between posttreatment microbiome changes and clinical results. Neither α-diversity and β-diversity nor the DoSER was associated with 12-month PFS, suggesting that qualitative rather than quantitative dynamics of donor FMT might be relevant in determining clinical outcomes. Then, we found that immediate post-FMT (week 1 follow-up) acquisition of the B. wexlerae donor strain was significantly associated with 12-month PFS. B. wexlerae is a beneficial anarerobic bacterium, which produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), already associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with rectal cancer22. This finding may have several explanations. A. massiliensis is a novel species defined from the recent proposed reclassification of A. muciniphila. Previous studies found an association between the abundance of A. muciniphila and response to ICIs24,25,26, but deeper analyses support this association only for A. muciniphila sensu stricto rather than for A. massiliensis (SGB9228)27. Notably, an overabundance of A. muciniphila was previously associated with resistance to ICIs and was highlighted as an indirect sign of dysbiosis (as observed in patients with a history of antibiotic exposure)24,27. Moreover, direct experimental evidence shows that Akkermansia strains can be hardly replaced by other external Akkermansia strains, due to their high genomic similarity28. Therefore, patients with adequate baseline abundance of A. muciniphila could have not been colonized by A. massiliensis, and the combination of these beneficial strains and of the donor strains could have contributed to the clinical success of the d-FMT. Overall, these results support further investigations. Moreover, we observed that the d-FMT group experienced over time not only a significantly higher acquisition of new species but also a significantly higher loss of baseline species compared with the p-FMT group. We also found a borderline significant association between the proportion of species immediately lost after treatment (week 1 follow-up) and the 12-month PFS in the d-FMT group but not in the p-FMT group. We found that the loss of an E. coli strain (SGB10068) in recipients was associated with PFS > 12 months, whereas the inverse association was found for an R. bromii strain (SGB4290). These results might be explained by the well-known inflammatory features of several E. coli strains29 and by the ability of R. bromii to hydrolize resistant starch and to support, consequently, the growth of beneficial SCFA-producing bacteria30. Although the detected loss can also be the effect of falling below the level of detection as a consequence of relative abundance increase of other species, this finding suggests an effect of donor FMT in displacing, or at least depleting, originally present patient species besides the more expected enrichment with donor microbiome components. Also here, further investigations on the taxonomy and functional potential of these microbes are advocated. Notably, we did not use antibiotic preconditioning, as this trial was started before our discovery of its association with microbiome engraftment31 and the publication of relevant studies7,8. Although we did not observe any association between quantitative engraftment and clinical response, we acknowledge that the engraftment rate immediately after donor FMT was 18%, which is much lower than that observed in patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (where FMT is mostly successful), who usually undergo an antibiotic preconditioning before FMT and have a history of previous antibiotic therapies. In addition, it remains unclear whether healthy donor FMT or patient donor FMT (as used here) is the best approach. The sample size was relatively small, with only 45 patients evaluated for the primary endpoint. Some baseline characteristics could not be completely well balanced due to the reduced sample size. Finally, most stool aliquots were provided by a single donor, whose microbiome was rich in Bifidobacteria, A. massiliensis (associated with PFS < 12 months if acquired) and R. bromii (the loss of which in patients was associated with negative response). We also identified other donors, but they were not willing to donate for logistical reasons. Although there are advantages to relying on a single donor, the lack of immediate stool availability led to delays in treatment for nine patients. Although the effects of this protocol deviation are unclear, findings from the per-protocol sensitivity analysis suggest that timely provision of donor FMT might be associated with improved clinical outcomes. The recruitment of stool donors is a critical step for an academic FMT center32, and the difficulties in its consistent fulfillment is one of the factors that limit the testing of FMT worldwide33. The investigation of further approaches to microbiome modulation, such as microbiome consortia/live biotherapeutic products, could overcome the issue of stool shortage and is also supported by the promising results coming from already available studies34,35,36. The TACITO trial was an investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a clinical trial that aimed to evaluate whether donor FMT from complete ICI responders is effective in improving response to combined first-line therapy with pembrolizumab and axitinib in patients with mRCC. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on the Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice guidelines as well as in compliance with local and institutional regulations. The study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB)/local ethics committee (ID: 2664) and was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration identifier: NCT04758507, registration date: 11 February 2021). All enrolled patients gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. This study was conducted by following CONSORT guidelines37, and a CONSORT checklist is provided in Supplementary Table 1. Patients were enrolled in the Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli IRCCS, a tertiary care center and academic hospital in Rome, Italy, and were either screened from our oncology outpatient clinic or referred to our center from seven other Italian hospitals, all referral centers for RCC. The inclusion criteria were as follows: histologically confirmed RCC; metastatic disease; radiological assessment within 8 weeks before enrollment; patient eligible for therapy with ICIs for mRCC or started within 8 weeks; ability to provide written informed consent; and ability to be compliant with the scheduled procedures. We excluded patients for the following reasons: major comorbidities; concomitant gastrointestinal or autoimmune disorders or HIV, HBV or HCV infection; continuative corticosteroid therapy; previous treatment with systemic immunosuppressants or immunomodulatory drugs; and antibiotic therapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Predefined withdrawal criteria before the start of treatments (checked at the pretreatment evaluation visit, described below) were as follows: voluntary withdrawal of the patient; absence of the planned eligibility criteria at the pretreatment evaluation visit; and actual provision of the first treatment (FMT or placebo) later than 8 weeks from the start of ICI therapy. We predefined this criterion as a late provision of the first treatment that could affect the efficacy of FMT. The delay of further treatments was not considered a criterion to withdraw patients from the study as the donor microbiome can engraft the recipient gut up to 6 months, based on available evidence38. Patients who experienced a disease progression during the study procedures were discontinued from further treatments. Moreover, patients who withdrew their consent to participate in the study at any time were discontinued from the trial. The last enrolled patient received his first treatment on 16 December 2023 and had his last follow-up visit on 5 December 2024. Three of the 25 patients randomized in the p-FMT arm did not receive the first treatment for the following reasons: one patient withdrew consent before the scheduled procedure; one patient had no metastatic disease at internal reevaluation of the baseline computed tomography scan; and one patient was not treated within 8 weeks from the start of cancer therapy, because of his logistical unavailability to reach our center. This set was used for sensitivity analyses and included all randomized patients, regardless of study treatment. This set was used for efficacy analyses (primary and secondary efficacy outcomes) and included all randomized patients who received at least the first treatment (regardless of completion status). This set was used for sensitivity analyses and included all randomized patients who received all assigned treatments for which they were eligible (so, unless disease progression, consent withrawal or other conditions for study discontinuation occurred) within the planned schedule (regardless of their number), without delays. This set includes all randomized patients, regardless of study treatment. Only the TRAEs and the adverse events of special interest, which included gastrontestinal toxicities, have been collected prospectively. Incidence of treatment interruption or discontinuation related to the axitinib and/or pembrolizumab as well as the incidence of grade 3–5 adverse events in each treatment arm have been collected retrospectively. Moreover, we conducted a post hoc analysis by excluding patients with favorable-prognosis disease based on the IMDC score. The primary efficacy endpoint was 12-month PFS, defined as the number of participants free from tumor progression, as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solids Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, 12 months after randomization39, in the FAS population. Secondary efficacy endpoints were median PFS, median overall survival and ORR in the FAS population, safety and microbiome changes after treatments. Safety was evaluated in the per-protocol and FAS populations. PFS and ORR were determined using RECIST version 1.1, as assessed by local investigators. PFS was defined as the time from randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Overall survival was evaluated from the date of randomization to death from any cause or the last contact. ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a partial or complete response. Safety was assessed as the incidence, nature and severity of TRAEs, recorded and classified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Microbiome changes after treatments were defined as the number of participants with significant increase in α-diversity (assessed by Shannon index) and β-diversity (assessed by Bray–Curtis dissimilarity) of their gut microbiota after treatments, compared with baseline. Screening, baseline and pretreatment assessments were all conducted in combination by physicians from the Gastroenterology Unit and from the Oncology Unit. The baseline assessment included the collection of patient medical history, including the following data: age, gender, date of cancer diagnosis, nephrectomy status and date, histology, Fuhrman grade, diagnosis of metastatic disease and site of metastases, Karnofsky scale, IMDC score, complete blood count and starting date of cancer therapy. Moreover, all patients underwent a full clinical examination. At the end of the baseline visit, enrolled patients were randomized to study treatments. The pretreatment assessment occurred within 2–5 days before the first scheduled experimental procedure (FMT or placebo). Here, investigators reviewed the eligibility criteria to check their actual validity as well as the time distance between the start of ICI therapy and the first treatment (to be no longer than 8 weeks). Stool donors were selected within the historical cohort of our Oncology Unit among patients with advanced RCC who had experienced a complete response to PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab or nivolumab). Once identified, available patients from this cohort were screened according to protocols recommended by international guidelines, based on a multilevel framework32,40,41. First, donor candidates underwent a specific questionnaire aimed at addressing the following: known history or lifestyle-related risk factors for potentially communicable diseases (for example, drug addiction or promiscuous sexual behavior); recent (<6 months) use of specific drugs (for example, antibiotics); a family history of gastrointestinal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease; systemic diseases; and the use of drugs that could be excreted in feces with potential risk for the recipients. Subsequently, selected patients underwent blood and stool examinations to exclude potentially transmittable diseases. Candidates who passed these two steps were qualified as eligible for donating and repeated this screening procedure every 2 months32,40,41. At the time of each donation, the chosen patients underwent a further questionnaire to screen for any recent acute digestive disease, newly contracted infectious diseases or other potentially harmful situations (for example, risky sexual contacts) and a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 (after March 2020)32,40,41. Moreover, each stool donation provided by qualified donors underwent direct stool testing, which included a culture assay for detection of multidrug-resistant bacteria, a rapid molecular assay for common intestinal pathogens (Seegene, RT–PCR Allplex Gastrointestinal Panel Assay) and a stool molecular assay for SARS-CoV2 (since March 2020)32,40,41. Selected donors were also asked to provide stool samples for microbiome analysis every 6 months. Five patients with long-term complete response to ICI were identified as candidate donors. Three donors did not pass the screening process (two for chronic use of proton pump inhibitors and another one for history of previous colorectal surgery for diverticulitis), whereas two of them were eligible to donate. Donor 1 was a 57-year-old man who underwent radical nephrectomy and retrocaval lymph node resection for a clear cell RCC at original pT3a pN1 M0 disease stage. After 4 months, for disease recurrence with more than 60 bilateral pulmonary metastases (the largest of 14 mm in size), he started first-line systemic therapy with nivolumab + ipilimumab, achieving a complete response that is still lasting after 6 years of therapy (that is, May 2025). He provided the vast majority (n = 56/57, 98%) of stool aliquots. The other donor who passed the screening process (donor 2) was a 52-year-old woman who developed lung and pancreatic metastases 2 years after nephrectomy for a clear cell RCC (pT2, grade 2) and received third-line therapy with nivolumab after disease progression to sunitinib for 3 years and everolimus for subsequent 3 years. Nivolumab led to a complete disease response, and, as of today (that is, May 2025, 9 years after), she is still under therapy with no evidence of target lesions. For each donation, feces was collected by the donor in the morning and rapidly transported to our hospital in a refrigerated bag (within 4 hours from defecation). After the completion of the questionnaire already described, stool donations were brought to the FMT laboratory of our center (Microbiology Unit) for direct stool testing. Immediately after this step, they were manufactured as fecal aliquots for colonoscopic FMT and/or as FMT capsules, based on specific needs related to planned treatments, following recommendations by international guidelines32,40,41. All manufactured aliquots or capsules were quarantined for 24–48 hours while waiting for results of the direct stool testing, and positive donations were then discarded. Also, stool donations less than 60 g were considered insufficient to prepare a stool aliquot or a capsule set and were discarded42. All procedures were performed within a biological safety cabinet (Biosafety Level 2). Using specific strainer bags (Seward), the fecal material was first diluted with nearly 200 ml of sterile saline (0.9%) for fecal aliquots and nearly 100 ml of sterile saline for FMT capsules, and glycerol (Monico S.p.A.) was added up to a final concentration of 10% to cryopreserve bacteria at −80 °C. Then, this suspension was homogenized automatically through a Stomacher 400 homogenizer (Seward), which allowed a simultaneous filtration of the solution. The homogenization program chosen was 260 rev min−1 for 1 minute43. Further filtration and purification of the fecal suspension were performed using sterile gauzes and a funnel. The deriving solution was blended and, after the supernatant was strained, transferred into a sterile flask. For the manufacturing of colonoscopic FMT aliquots, the fecal suspension was divided, in ready-to-use aliquots of at least 60 g and nearly 200 ml, as previously described43, and aliquots were frozen at −80 °C up to 6 months. Eligible aliquots were thawed in a warm (37 °C) water bath on the day of fecal infusion. For the manufacturing of FMT capsules, the fecal suspension was poured into a sterile container ready for capsule production. Specifically, size 1 capsules were filled with 0.420 ml of fecal suspension and, then, encapsulated with size 00 capsules (Farmalabor), with nearly 150 capsules for each stool donation44,45. Capsules were quickly stored at −80 °C, in plastic boxes, for up to 6 months. Each suspension bottle or capsule box was labeled with a unique barcode of the corresponding donor, and with the date of collection/manipulation, to assure its complete traceability, as recommended by international guidelines40,41. The personnel involved in the manufacturing of FMT were not involved in any part of the clinical trial and had no contact with patients. All colonoscopy procedures were performed in the morning, under sedation. Before colonoscopy, patients in both groups underwent bowel cleansing with 4 l of Macrogol (SELG ESSE) the day before the procedure. All procedures were performed by two expert endoscopists (G.I. using pediatric colonoscopes and carbon dioxide insufflation. After the procedures, patients were monitored in the recovery room of our endoscopy center for nearly 3 hours. Patients were requested to fast for at least 6 hours after the procedure and were allowed to have a light meal thereafter. Patients were scheduled to receive capsulized FMT, respectively, 12 weeks (±2) and 24 weeks (±2) after the first treatment. Delay in receiving the scheduled treatments longer than 2 weeks was considered a protocol deviation. Patients received a styrofoam box, filled with dry ice and 10 capsule containers. Patients were instructed to put capsule containers at −20 °C (the home freezer) and to take five capsules three times a day (at least 1 hour after a meal) for 10 days, for a total of 150 capsules. Originally, we planned to give 120 capsules for each treatment cycle, but we slightly increased the number of capsules as FMT capsules needed to be filled with a slightly lower quantity of fecal material to avoid them becoming damp and then potentially identifiable by the participants. Patients were asked to report the capsule assumption and to bring back capsule containers after the end of therapy, to monitor the assumption of capsules. Follow-up visits were performed in combination by physicians from the Gastroenterology Unit and from the Oncology Unit. Dates and status of disease progression, as well as date and type of best response, were recorded. Unscheduled follow-up visits were offered if requested by the patients. Samples were collected during the pretreatment visits and at the planned follow-up visits by using a stool collector with a DNA/RNA Shield buffer (Zymo Research), brought directly by patients to our center in a refrigerated box within 6 hours from collection and then stored at −80 °C for up to 36 months before being shipped in dry ice to the next-generation sequencing facility of the Department of Cellular, Computational and Integrative Biology of the University of Trento (Trento, Italy) for DNA extraction and sequencing. Metagenomic sequencing libraries were prepared with the Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with a target depth of 7.5 Gbp for patient samples (n = 247) and 15 Gbp for donor samples (n = 9). Metagenomes underwent quality control with our previously validated preprocessing pipeline (available at https://github.com/SegataLab/preprocessing). This consisted of removal of low-quality reads (Q < 20 or Q > 2 ambiguous bases or <75 bp) with TrimGalore (version 0.6.6) and removal of reads mapping against the human genome (hg19) or the Illumina spike-in phiX 174 as identified with Bowtie 2 (version 2.3.4.3). Remaining reads were sorted and split to create standard forward, reverse and unpaired quality-controlled FASTQ files for each metagenome. After this quality control, one metagenome with <3 Gbp was discarded, with the vast majority of the remaining ones (98.8%) having >7.5 Gbp (approximately 50 million reads). These were then used as input in MetaPhlAn 4 (version 4.1)11,12 using the marker genes database vJun23_202307 to generate taxonomic profiles at species-level genome bin (SGB) resolution for each sample. DoSER was defined as the number of strains (that is, specific genomic variants within species that can be profiled at the single-nucleotide level from metagenomes) of the donor that are present in each recipient's sample after the FMT. In the case of d-FMT samples of individuals who had experienced donations from multiple aliquots, the pool of strains present in any of the received aliquots is considered in this estimation. For example, a DoSER of 50% in a sample means that half of the strains that are detectable in the administered donor's fecal samples were also observed in that specific post-FMT recipient sample. As the fraction of a patient's microbiome strain pool is also present in a different patient's microbiome, the DoSER inference can be applied to any pair of samples, including samples from unrelated individuals not linked by FMT. The DoSER on unrelated individuals (for example, the baseline of the d-FMT group) is used here to assess the baseline strain sharing in a target population (as some strains might be clonally spreading in a population, and there can be direct or indirect social interactions within populations leading to strain transmission46); it can be applied also in the case of p-FMT patients to verify the absence of a donor's effects in this arm. To detect engraftment of donor strains, we rely on our strain-sharing inference method previously reported31 plus recent improvements to the pipeline46,47. In brief, this consists of building strain-level phylogenies for all SGBs detected in the aforementioned taxonomic profiles using StrainPhlAn 4 (version 4.1)11,12. Those phylogenetic trees depict the relationship between conspecific strains detected in each sample of our cohort, with their phylogenetic distance being able to provide information on whether the same strain is observed in two samples. To reliably identify those strain-sharing events, we define SGB-specific strain boundaries. This is done by augmenting the phylogenetic trees with strains from publicly available longitudinal metagenomic datasets (n = 16 datasets including 4,322 stool metagenomes from 1,334 healthy individuals48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64) and by leveraging previous observations that, in close longitudinal samples (<6 months apart) of the same individual both having a given SGB, the same strain of that SGB will likely be observed, whereas, in unrelated (for example, from different cohorts/populations) samples having the same SGB, different strains of that SGB will likely be observed. That considered, the SGB-specific strain boundary (or strain-sharing threshold) is defined as the threshold that best separates pairwise phylogenetic distance distributions from longitudinal samples from those of unrelated samples, following criteria defined previously46. After this step, a strain-sharing matrix indicating how many strains are shared between each pair of samples in our cohort is generated. The strain replacement rate was defined as the number of different strains profiled in longitudinal samples of the same individual over the common SGBs typed at strain level in both samples. An online random number generator software (https://www.sealedenvelope.com) was used to provide random permuted blocks with a block size of four and an equal allocation ratio; the sequence was hidden until the interventions were assigned. Blocked randomization of patients was performed by an external individual not involved in the study. To mask treatments to recipients, both infusate bottles and syringes were covered with dark-colored paper before the infusion, and the patients were sedated. Placebo capsules were made of cellulose and were identical in appearance to the FMT capsules, to ensure the blinding of patients and study staff. Moreover, both placebo suspension bottles and placebo capsule boxes were labeled with similar barcodes as FMT ones. Physicians who evaluated patients at follow-up (clinical outcome assessors) were blinded to administered treatments, as were authors involved in outcome analysis. The 1-year PFS rate for SOC has been reported to be nearly 60%. The alternative hypothesis is that FMT can improve the 1-year PFS rate from 60% to 80% when associated with SOC. A total of 50 patients is required to enter this two-treatment, parallel-design study. The probability is 80% that the study detects a treatment difference at a one-sided 5.0% significance level, if the true hazard ratio is 0.436. The total number of events is expected to be 36. Data were summarized as median and range when referred to quantitative variables and as absolute counts and percentages if related to categorical items and reported according to the randomized arm. Survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method and compared with the Breslow test. We chose this test as it gives more relevance to initial events. In our study, early disease progression would be more important than late disease progression, as the patient who experiences progression is not allowed to receive further FMTs, which are expected to strengthen the donor effect. Therefore, early events would be more important than late events in reducing the global efficacy of the donor FMT. Median survival times were reported with their 95% CIs. A Cox proportional hazard model was implemented after checking the proportionality assumptions, and the hazard ratio with its 90% CI was presented. Differences between proportions were assessed with the chi-square test. A non-parametric approach was followed to analyze microbiome features based on Wilcoxon signed-rank or Mann–Whitney test when applied to quantitative variables either paired or unpaired, respectively, and Fisherʼs exact test for categorical items. This test was applied on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrices to evaluate compositional microbiome differences between arms at baseline.

The initial donated aliquot of each donor are also shown. Species shown are the ones present at > 0.1% relative abundance in at least 30% of samples. Species richness changes compared to baseline for the d-FMT arm (top panel) and p-FMT arm (bottom panel) at each follow-up sample collection (week-1, week-4, week-12, week-24, week-36, week-52). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to assess statistical significance. a) Boxplots with the number of species acquired as compared to baseline at week-1 (left panel) or week-4 (right panel) for each arm comparing patients with or without PFS > 12 months. The Mann-Whitney test was applied to assess statistical significance. b) Boxplots with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity to baseline at week-1 (left panel) or week-4 (right panel) for each arm comparing patients with or without PFS > 12 months. The Mann-Whitney test was applied to assess statistical significance. Scatterplots show the association between the mean relative abundance (log scale) of gut microbiome species in donor samples (x-axis) and their strain-level engraftment frequency (y-axis) across patients in the d-FMT arm at six post-treatment follow-ups (week-1, week-4, week-12, week-24, week-36, and week-52). Engraftment frequency was calculated as the proportion of recipients in whom a given donor strain successfully engrafted. Donor species abundances are calculated as the mean relative abundances across all donor aliquots administered to recipients up to a given timepoint. Only patients receiving donations from the main donor in the trial are included in this analysis. Statistical significance was evaluated with the Spearman's rank correlation test, with trendline and 95% confidence intervals also shown. a) Barplots with the percentage of patients in the d-FMT arm at week-4 follow-up acquiring the donor strain of each donor species according to presence (blue) or absence (orange) of PFS > 12 months. Only species differing by at least 25% between groups are depicted. A Fisher's exact test was applied to assess statistical significance. b) Barplots with the percentage of patients in the d-FMT arm at week-4 follow-up acquiring the donor strain of each donor species according to presence (blue) or absence (orange) of PFS > 12 months. Species are ordered by the prevalence difference between groups (no - yes), with only species differing by at least 25% between groups are depicted. A Fisher's exact test was applied to assess statistical significance. Across all panels statistical significance is represented as *: p < 0.05. In the PP population, seven of 17 patients in the d-FMT arm (41%) and 17 of 21 subjects in the p-FMT arm (81%) experienced a disease progression. Median OS was nonsignificantly longer in the d-FMT arm (41 months) than in the p-FMT arm (28.3 months) although not significantly (41 months in the d-FMT arm vs 28.3 months in the p-FMT arm, HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.99, p = 0.146). In the ITT population, median PFS was longer in the d-FMT arm (23.2 months, 95% CI: 7.4-39.1 months) than in the p-FMT arm (9.2 months, 95% CI: 0-20.5 months), although nonsignificantly (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.33-1.35, p = 0.18; b) Median OS. Median OS was nonsignificantly longer in the d-FMT arm (40.9 months, 95% CI: 39.2-42.7) than in the p-FMT arm (28.2 months, 95% CI: 20.1-36.5) (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.20-1.30, p = 0.146).

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) improve outcomes in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) but are hindered by immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Modulation of the gut microbiome may enhance efficacy and mitigate toxicity, yet the safety and mechanisms of healthy donor fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mRCC remain unexplored. Secondary endpoints included clinical response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1), gut microbiome and immune correlates and patient-reported quality of life. The safety endpoint was met with 50% (10/20) of patients experiencing grade 3 irAEs and no serious FMT-related toxicities or grade 4 or 5 irAEs. Among evaluable patients, the objective response rate was 50% (9/18), including two complete responses (11%, 2/18). Notably, most treatment responders did not develop any grade 3 or higher irAEs. Conversely, patients experiencing grade 3 irAEs exhibited expansion of Segatella copri, particularly with ipilimumab/nivolumab, and elevated levels of donor-derived microbial enzymes previously linked to pro-inflammatory activity. Resilience to toxicity correlated with the maintenance of protective metabolites and increased levels of immune regulatory cells, whereas the presence of grade 3 irAEs and S. copri enrichment was associated with high immune dysregulation. These findings demonstrate the safety and potential for functional microbiome engraftment to optimize response and minimize toxicity in ICI-treated mRCC. ICIs have transformed the management of mRCC, yielding durable responses and improved survival in a subset of patients1. However, most patients ultimately succumb to mRCC within 5 years2, and many experience a range of irAEs, including life-threatening toxicities that may require treatment interruption, discontinuation or immunosuppressive therapy, potentially compromising outcomes3,4. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for strategies that can both mitigate treatment-limiting toxicity and augment ICI efficacy. The composition and functional capacity of gut microbiota are recognized as critical determinants of antitumor immunity, particularly in the context of ICI therapy, through the production of immunomodulatory metabolites and direct interaction with host immune cells5,6,7,8,9,10. The microbiome also appears to influence the risk of irAEs, suggesting a role for microbiota-targeted strategies in toxicity management and efficacy11,12,13. Recent studies have provided proof of concept for microbiome modulation as a therapeutic adjunct in melanoma14,15 and mRCC16. FMT from healthy donors demonstrated efficacy in resolving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-induced diarrhea and restoring immune homeostasis in patients experiencing severe irAEs17,18,19. Moreover, the use of live biotherapeutic products, such as CBM588, has shown promise in enhancing clinical outcomes in mRCC20. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of microbiome-based interventions in reducing treatment-related toxicity and improving outcomes in mRCC. However, the safety and clinical activity of healthy donor FMT in mRCC remain unexplored, and its mechanism of action is unclear. In this phase 1, single-center trial, we report the safety, preliminary efficacy and exploratory translational analyses of combining LND101—a healthy donor-derived encapsulated FMT product—with ICI-based regimens in previously untreated mRCC. Through an integrated analysis of clinical, microbiome, metabolomics and immune profiling data, this study elucidates key microbial and host determinants of toxicity and response, providing a foundation for rational development of next-generation microbiome-augmented, immune-based combination therapies. PERFORM is an open-label, single-center, phase 1 trial evaluating the safety, feasibility and preliminary activity of LND101—an encapsulated healthy donor FMT product—administered prior to and during ICI-based therapy in previously untreated mRCC. Between 13 February 2020 and 28 November 2023, 20 patients were enrolled in the PERFORM trial (Fig. Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmed advanced or mRCC classified as intermediate-risk or poor-risk disease by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria21 with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and adequate organ function. Key exclusions included prior systemic therapy for advanced disease, recent antibiotic use, active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppression, chronic gastrointestinal disorders, active infection or contraindications to FMT. a, Flow diagram indicating the number of patients screened, enrolled and who received the study treatment. c, Spider plot showing the response as the change in size of target lesions from baseline. Radiographic responses were determined according to RECIST v1.1. Patients with a CR are shown in dark blue; patients with a PR are shown in light blue; patients with SD ≥6 months are shown in yellow; and patients with PD or SD <6 months are shown in red. d, Swimmer plot showing the time on treatment for patients with measurable disease (n = 18) with a best response of CR, PR, SD and PD.

The primary endpoint was safety, defined as the incidence and severity of irAEs based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). Secondary endpoints included the incidence of grade 3 or higher irAEs, objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), longitudinal effects of FMT on gut microbiome composition, circulating metabolites, cytokines, immune cell subsets and health-related quality of life assessed by EuroQol health questionnaire instruments (EQ-5D-5L). Tumor tissue analyses and long-term clinical outcomes beyond the current data cutoff prespecified in the trial protocol were not included in this report. At data cutoff (30 May 2025), median follow-up was 21.9 months (range, 5.6−53.3), and five patients (25%) remained on systemic therapy. Median time on treatment from first FMT was 13.4 months (range, 0.3−53.2). Nineteen patients (95%) had clear cell histology, and one (5%) had unclassified RCC, histologic grade 4, with nuclear pleomorphism and multinuclear giant cells showing rhabdoid and sarcomatoid differentiation; and 12 patients (60%) had stage IV disease at presentation (Table 1). Two patients received antibiotics during the course of the trial (patient 4, prophylactically with steroids after cycle 1; patient 13, after cycle 3 of ipilimumab/nivolumab). Seven rigorously screened healthy donors (median age, 35 years) provided stool22,23 (Supplementary Table 1). Each patient received one full dose and two half-doses of oral encapsulated FMT (LND101) from a single donor. A polyethylene glycol-based bowel preparation was administered before the first FMT only. Biological samples (blood and stool) were collected from patients at prespecified timepoints (Extended Data Fig. The only FMT-related toxicity was a grade 1 gastrointestinal event in one patient (5%) (Table 2). Fifteen patients (75%) completed all three planned FMT doses. Five patients did not complete all three planned FMT doses: three (patients 2, 4 and 9) due to immune-related colitis, one (patient 16) because the FMT donor tested positive for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and one (patient 20) due to immune-related arthritis. None of these events was attributed to FMT-related toxicity. Except for the Shiga toxin finding, dosing was withheld out of caution for ICI-related toxicities rather than FMT. Any-grade irAEs occurred in 17 patients (85%), mostly within 3 months of ICI initiation (Table 2). Radiographic assessments were performed every 12 weeks using RECIST v1.1 (ref. Two patients (3 and 15) had no measurable disease at baseline and were excluded from response or PFS analyses but remained in safety monitoring (primary endpoint), overall survival analysis and exploratory translational assessments. Thus, efficacy analyses were conducted in the per-protocol population (n = 18). Among 18 evaluable patients, nine (50%) achieved an objective response, including two complete responses (CRs) (11%), and six (33%) had primary progressive disease (PD) as best response. Twelve patients (67%) achieved clinical benefit, defined as CR, partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) ≥6 months (Fig. To assess donor influence on efficacy, we stratified patients by donor and averaged their best overall response (Extended Data Fig. Clinical response was observed in recipients of FMT from five of the seven donors (Fig. Of the two patients with non-measurable disease, patient 3 discontinued ipilimumab/nivolumab after 8 months due to toxicity and remains progression free at 54 months. Patient 15 completed pembrolizumab and continues axitinib without progression at 32 months. Only one of nine responders (11%) experienced grade 3 irAEs. By contrast, eight of the nine non-responders (89%) developed grade 3 irAEs, including six with grade 3 colitis. A two-sided χ2 test with Yates' correction confirmed a significant association between response and toxicity (χ2 = 8.00, P = 0.005), with responders showing fewer grade 3 irAEs (Fig. After a median follow-up of 21.9 months, median PFS was 11.15 months in the per-protocol population (n = 18), and median overall survival was 36 months in the ITT population (n = 20) (Extended Data Fig. At baseline, most patients reported no limitations in mobility, self-care or daily activities, and 40% reported mild anxiety/depression. Median baseline Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was 73. Over the first four cycles, quality of life remained stable, with no evidence of FMT-related decline (median VAS change +2) (Extended Data Table 1a). Patients who developed grade 3 irAEs had persistently lower global health scores and more functional impairments compared to those without, consistent with the burden of toxicity rather than FMT (Extended Data Table 1b). Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal samples from patients at five timepoints and their respective FMT donors (Methods and Extended Data Fig. At baseline and after FMT, there were no significant differences in α-diversity between patients and donors (Extended Data Fig. Baseline diversity also did not differ between patients who developed grade 3 irAEs and those who did not. Prior to the fourth immunotherapy dose (week 10), patients without grade 3 irAEs exhibited significantly higher gut microbial diversity by the Shannon (Fig. This suggests that more even and diverse microbial communities after FMT are associated with less severe toxicity. Responders similarly showed significantly higher α-diversity than non-responders at 10 weeks after FMT (Fig. a–h, Species-level Shannon diversity of donor samples (n = 20) at the time of donation and longitudinal patient samples (n = 93) from 20 patients with and without grade 3 irAEs (a) and 18 responder (R) and non-responder (NR) patients (b). One-way ANOVA was used to compare diversity across clinical subgroups at each timepoint, followed by Tukey's HSD test for pair-wise comparisons. Adjusted P < 0.05 values for multiple testing are shown. Statistically significant within-group comparisons from baseline to later timepoints, as well as between groups at T4 and T5, are shown. P values were calculated using the paired t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (based on Shapiro−Wilk test) with FDR correction for within-group comparisons and between-group comparisons. Variability of strain engraftment rate (the number of engrafted strains after FMT divided by the number of strains that could engraft from the donor) over time between patients with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) grade 3 irAEs (e) and between R (n = 9) and NR(n = 9) patients (f).

PCoA representing Bray−Curtis β-diversity of baseline (g) and 10 weeks after FMT samples in patients with and without grade 3 irAEs (h). Two-sided P values were calculated using the PERMANOVA test. Points outside this range are shown as outliers. Normalized Bray−Curtis dissimilarity of the overall cohort did not show a significant shift of microbiome after FMT in patients (Extended Data Fig. However, patients with grade 3 irAEs displayed a transient moderate donor-like shift 1 week after FMT that was not sustained, with progressive divergence over time despite two subsequent half-doses (Fig. By contrast, those without grade 3 irAEs exhibited a modest but consistent reduction in dissimilarity, becoming significantly more donor-like by week 10 (Fig. Similar to patients with grade 3 irAEs, non-responders demonstrated a transient reduction in dissimilarity 1 week after FMT that was not maintained over time. By contrast, responders exhibited a progressive and sustained reduction in dissimilarity, culminating in significantly greater donor−recipient similarity at week 10 after FMT (Fig. These results were validated by the Jaccard index, a complementary beta (β) diversity metric based on the shared presence or absence of microbial taxa (Extended Data Fig. Strain engraftment of the overall cohort revealed a significant engraftment of donor strains in recipients (Extended Data Fig. The subset analysis showed that both patient groups (with and without grade 3 irAEs) demonstrated acquisition of donor strains over time (Fig. As most patients without grade 3 irAEs were also classified as responders, we compared strain-level engraftment by response status. Consistent with the toxicity analysis, both groups showed evidence of donor strain acquisition; however, responders exhibited significantly higher engraftment 7 weeks after FMT compared to non-responders (Fig. Analysis of β-diversity profiles at baseline and 10 weeks after FMT revealed substantial overlap at baseline, with no clear compositional separation between patients who later developed grade 3 irAEs and those who did not (Fig. However, by 10 weeks after FMT, we observed a divergence in microbial community structure between the two groups (Fig. 2h), suggesting that the engrafted microbiome evolved differently in patients depending on the levels of toxicity experienced. To identify microbial species driving this divergence, we performed β-diversity ordination with fitted vectors for influential taxa. This analysis demonstrated that taxa such as Segatella copri, Prevotella sp. Marseille-P4119 and Parabacteroides massiliensis were most influential in patients with grade 3 irAEs, whereas Alistipes finegoldii and Barnesiella intestinihominis contributed to the community shift in patients without grade 3 irAEs (Fig. a, Microbial influencers of β-diversity shift in patients with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) grade 3 irAEs 10 weeks after FMT.

Axi, axitinib; Ipi, ipilimumab; Lenva, lenvatinib; Nivo, nivolumab; Pembro, pembrolizumab. Analysis of the differential abundance among patients with or without grade 3 irAEs after FMT revealed that patients with grade 3 irAEs exhibited marked enrichment of S. copri at 10 weeks after FMT. By contrast, patients without severe irAEs demonstrated increased abundance of several short-chain fatty acid-producing taxa with known anti-inflammatory properties, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium siraeum and Oscillospiraceae bacterium (Fig. To determine whether functional engraftment paralleled taxonomic shifts, we profiled longitudinal donor−patient dissimilarity using Enzyme Commission (EC) annotations and Aitchison distance. However, subset analysis revealed that patients without grade 3 irAEs progressively acquired a donor-like functional profile. By contrast, those with grade 3 irAEs showed increasing divergence from their donors over time, indicating failed functional engraftment. The divergence between the two groups reached statistical significance at week 7 after FMT (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), supporting a link between global functional engraftment and protection from irAEs. Stratification by clinical subgroup further revealed that non-responders with grade 3 irAEs (NR-G3 irAEs) exhibited increasing functional dissimilarity from their donors. By contrast, responders without grade 3 irAEs (R-No-G3 irAEs) showed a durable shift toward donor-like EC profiles (Extended Data Fig. Although patients without grade 3 irAEs acquired higher overall compositional similarity with their donors (Fig. 2c), both groups exhibited donor−strain engraftment over time (Fig. To identify specific functional traits transferred from donors and their relationship to toxicity, we performed targeted metagenomic analysis using Multivariate Association with Linear Model, version 3 (MaAsLin3)28, applying stringent significance and effect size thresholds to identify EC activities that (1) were differentially abundant in donors associated with each toxicity group and (2) retained this pattern in corresponding patients 10 weeks after FMT. Several key enzymes—including branched-chain amino acid transaminase (EC 2.6.1.42; amino acid and nitrogen metabolism), arginine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.19; β-polyamine and arginine catabolism) and uridine diphosphate-N-acetylmuramate:L-alanine ligase (EC 6.3.2.8; peptidoglycan biosynthesis and cell wall assembly)—were significantly higher in donors whose microbiota were transplanted into patients who subsequently developed grade 3 irAEs, compared to donors for patients without severe toxicity (Extended Data Fig. These donor-specific functional signatures were faithfully engrafted in the respective recipients, indicating robust transfer of relevant microbial pathways that may influence clinical outcomes, even with incomplete taxonomic engraftment. Conversely, patients receiving FMT from donors with low abundance of these pro-inflammatory or stress-adaptive enzymes maintained lower levels after FMT and did not develop grade 3 irAEs. Taxonomic profiling identified S. copri as the predominant taxon enriched in three FMT donors (1, 5 and 11) (Extended Data Fig. Supervised β-diversity analysis based on S. copri presence showed distinct clustering for these donors relative to others (Extended Data Fig. Patients harboring S. copri at baseline who received FMT from S. copri-high donors exhibited marked enrichment of this species over time (Extended Data Fig. S. copri enrichment correlated with grade 3 irAEs (Fig. 3a,b); however, given its baseline prevalence in patients, we performed strain-level tracking to clarify its engraftment dynamics. Metagenomics profiling showed that patients with S. copri exceeding 10 counts per million (CPM) at 10 weeks after FMT were more likely to develop grade 3 irAEs, regardless of donor or recipient origin (Fig. Notably, at the strain level, our analysis revealed that the majority of S. copri detected at 10 weeks after FMT originated from donors 1 and 5 (Fig. Two patients (15 and 18) with high S. copri did not develop grade 3 irAEs—one donor-derived, one self-enriched—prompting assessment of treatment effects. Analysis revealed that only patients receiving ipilimumab developed grade 3 irAEs, particularly colitis, in the context of high S. copri abundance higher than 10 CPM, irrespective of S. copri source (Fig. To validate the role of ipilimumab, we analyzed data from our MIMic trial29, in which donors 1 and 5 participated. Among melanoma recipients of FMT + anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), S. copri levels did not differ by toxicity, and some patients without irAEs had high abundance (Extended Data Fig. Because most responders in the PERFORM trial did not develop grade 3 irAEs, we examined S. copri and therapeutic response. Among patients with S. copri >10 CPM receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab, only one responded (Fig. 3f), suggesting that S. copri enrichment under dual ICI associates with resistance in mRCC. To contextualize these findings, we compared S. copri−response associations across three melanoma FMT trials14,15,29. Notably, patients in the Baruch et al.14 and Davar et al.15 studies, which used patient donors, exhibited higher median post-FMT levels of S. copri compared to those in the MIMic trial that used healthy donors (Extended Data Fig. Accordingly, we analyzed the MIMic cohort separately, which showed no difference in S. copri levels among responders and non-responders after FMT (Extended Data Fig. By contrast, in the Baruch et al. and Davar et al. trials, non-responders had significantly higher S. copri levels after FMT (Extended Data Fig. To determine the effect of FMT on systemic immune and inflammatory pathways as a secondary endpoint, we profiled plasma metabolites of patients at all five timepoints, using targeted liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (LC−MS/MS). In patients without grade 3 irAEs, targeted plasma metabolomic profiling revealed preservation or increases in a range of metabolites previously associated with immune function30,31,32 (Fig. At 10 weeks after FMT, these patients maintained significantly higher circulating levels of cortisol, stearoylcarnitine, L-histidine, L-cysteine, inosine triphosphate (ITP), pyruvic acid, isocitric acid and citraconic acid (Fig. By contrast, patients with grade 3 irAEs showed significantly decreased plasma levels of these metabolites over time. Stearoylcarnitine and ITP were also enriched in responders 10 weeks after FMT, similar to patients without grade 3 irAEs (Fig. Moreover, high levels of plasma metabolites such as vitamin A, isocitric acid and stearoylcarnitine after FMT correlated with response, improved PFS and no grade 3 irAEs (Fig. a, Heatmap of plasma metabolites showing statistically significant difference (P < 0.05, FDR 0.29−0.49) between patients with (n = 9) and without (n = 9) grade 3 irAEs at T5 but not at baseline (T1). b, Plasma intensity distributions of four representative metabolites from a with significant differences among toxicity groups at T5; each point represents one patient. c, Heatmap of metabolites significantly different (P < 0.05, FDR 0.42−0.57) at T5 but not at T1 between responders (R) (n = 8) and non-responders (R) (n = 8). d, Kaplan−Meier plot showing PFS according to vitamin A intensity in plasma at T5. f, Heatmap of metabolites differing significantly (P < 0.05, FDR 0.83−0.98) at T5 (but not at T1) between patients with high S. copri (n = 8) versus low S. copri (n = 5) abundance. Statistical analysis was conducted using two-sided unpaired t-tests with Benjamini−Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. Analysis of the plasma metabolomic profile of patients with high and low S. copri levels who received ipilimumab/nivolumab revealed distinct metabolic signatures (Fig. Patients with S. copri CPM > 10 exhibited increased levels of indoxyl sulfate and 3-aminoisobutanoic acid and decreased levels of ceramide (d18:1/16:0) and sphingosine-1-phosphate, compared to patients with S. copri CPM < 10. These differences highlight a shift toward a more pro-inflammatory and metabolically dysregulated plasma profile in the S. copri-high group (Fig. We performed immune profiling of patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by flow cytometry and quantified plasma cytokines and chemokines to assess systemic immune effects of FMT and immune-based therapy as a secondary endpoint. Unsupervised t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis of CD3+ T cells identified two subpopulations (TC1 and TC2) enriched in patients with grade 3 irAEs. TC1, comprising memory CD8+CD45RO+CD45RA−CD38+HLA-DR+ICOS+/− cells, was significantly elevated at 10 weeks after FMT compared to patients without grade 3 irAEs (Extended Data Fig. Similarly, TC2 (memory CD4+CD45RO+CD45RA−CD38+HLA-DR+ICOS−) increased only in patients with grade 3 irAEs (Extended Data Fig. Supervised analysis showed that CD38+ expression on regulatory T (Treg) cells, linked to immunosuppressive activity, rose longitudinally in patients without grade 3 irAEs but was transient in those with toxicity (Extended Data Fig. Patients with grade 3 irAEs also exhibited reduced circulating immunoregulatory CD56++CD16− natural killer (NK) cells alongside diminished DNAM1 expression, a marker of NK cell function and cytokine production capacity, at 10 weeks after FMT (Extended Data Fig. By contrast, patients without grade 3 irAEs showed increased monocyte subpopulation M2 at 10 weeks after FMT, representing non-classical monocytes (CD14−CD16++CSF1RLowCD163−CD40+DNAM1−HLA-DRLowCD33−) (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h and Supplementary Table 3), whereas those with grade 3 irAEs displayed higher CD163 expression on intermediate monocytes (Extended Data Fig. Similar to patients with grade 3 irAEs, the TC1 subpopulation was moderately elevated in non-responders versus responders and lacked CD38+ Treg expansion (Extended Data Fig. Additionally, DNAM1 expression on CD56++CD16− NK cells decreased in non-responders 10 weeks after FMT (Extended Data Fig. Immune profiling by S. copri status in patients receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab revealed distinct immune signatures: the TC1 subpopulation expanded in the S. copri-high patients, paralleling grade 3 irAEs and non-responders (Extended Data Fig. S. copri-low patients also showed increasing conventional memory cells (CD4+CD45RO+CD45RA−, CD8+CD45RO+CD45RA−) and declining naive T cells (CD4+CD45RA+CD45RO− and CD8+CD45RA+CD45RO−) (Extended Data Fig. In S. copri-low patients, DNAM1 expression on all monocyte subsets declined moderately, whereas CD163 and CD33 increased on intermediate monocytes in S. copri-high patients (Extended Data Fig. Additionally, S. copri-high patients showed decreased CD56++CD16− NK cells, unlike the S. copri-low group (Extended Data Fig. Overall, S. copri-high patients mirrored the immune phenotype of grade 3 irAEs, with elevated CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ memory cells, upregulated immunosuppressive monocyte markers and loss of regulatory NK cells. At 10 weeks after FMT, patients with grade 3 irAEs exhibited elevated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a driver of neutrophil-mediated inflammation, along with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) and reduced CCL22, a Treg-recruiting chemokine. By contrast, patients without grade 3 irAEs had higher levels of tissue repair and immunoregulatory factors, including EGF and CCL22 (Extended Data Fig. Similarly, responders showed elevated EGF and CCL22, as well as increased interleukin-7 (IL-7) and CCL4, whereas interleukin-27 (IL-27) was elevated in non-responders (Extended Data Fig. Finally, S. copri-high patients demonstrated increased IL-10 and IFNα2 at 10 weeks after FMT compared to baseline, a change not observed in S. copri-low patients (Extended Data Fig. This phase 1 study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of combining healthy donor-derived encapsulated FMT (LND101) with ICI-based therapy in mRCC. FMT did not increase the incidence or severity of irAEs, and the overall toxicity profile aligned with expectations for each standard regimen, supporting that LND101 can be safely integrated into ICI therapy. Patient-reported outcomes further confirmed that encapsulated FMT did not impair quality of life. Most patients achieved clinical benefit despite intermediate-risk or poor-risk disease, and most responders remained free from severe toxicity—a novel observation in mRCC35,36 suggesting that healthy donor FMT may enhance efficacy while mitigating irAEs. These positive effects require not only the successful engraftment of a diverse array of microbial taxa but also the transfer and maintenance of key anti-inflammatory microbial functions. Patients with higher α-diversity and greater functional engraftment—particularly of short-chain fatty acid-producing and anti-inflammatory taxa—were largely protected from severe irAEs and more likely to respond to treatment. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the development of grade 3 irAEs itself contributes to reduced diversity, for example, through inflammation. Conversely, expansion of the pro-inflammatory taxon S. copri characterized patients with grade 3 irAEs. A threshold abundance higher than 10 CPM at 10 weeks after FMT predicted severe toxicity in patients receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab, regardless of whether S. copri originated from donor or recipient microbiota, highlighting the clinical relevance of both donor screening and post-FMT monitoring of this taxon in patients. By contrast, F. prausnitzii, a butyrate-producing commensal with anti-inflammatory properties, was enriched in patients without severe toxicity. Preclinical work shows that F. prausnitzii supplementation mitigates ICI-induced colitis while maintaining antitumor activity37. In addition, live biotherapeutic formulations of F. prausnitzii (for example, EXL01; Exeliom Biosciences) are under clinical development as adjuvants to ICI therapy38. Our findings suggest that F. prausnitzii may represent both a biomarker of resilience to toxicity and a therapeutic strategy for mitigating irAEs. Our findings support a model wherein engraftment of a diverse, functionally balanced microbiome confers resilience against immune-mediated toxicity and enhances response, whereas the overrepresentation of pro-inflammatory species such as S. copri—particularly at critical abundance thresholds—predisposes to dysregulated immunity, increased irAEs and diminished therapeutic benefit. These insights underscore the importance of both taxonomic and functional criteria in the rational selection of FMT donors and the design of future microbiome-based interventions (Extended Data Fig. Preservation of gut microbial diversity—particularly higher α-diversity after FMT—was associated with both favorable clinical response and reduced toxicity. Patients without grade 3 irAEs demonstrated more durable donor microbiome engraftment compared to those who developed toxicity. Notably, patients without grade 3 irAEs also exhibited greater functional engraftment, as evidenced by the acquisition of beneficial metabolic pathways from donor microbiota. Targeted analysis of enzyme activities revealed that donors associated with toxicity-free outcomes harbored lower levels of microbial enzymes that promote bacterial stress tolerance and the production of immunostimulatory microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), including peptidoglycan fragments and lipopolysaccharides39,40. By contrast, enrichment of these pro-inflammatory metabolic pathways in donors linked to grade 3 irAEs may contribute to heightened mucosal immune activation and increased susceptibility to irAEs after FMT. The nature and extent of functional engraftment, rather than taxonomic engraftment alone, emerged as a key determinant of clinical outcomes, underscoring the need to consider microbial metabolic capacity in donor selection and the design of FMT products. Our study also provides new mechanistic insights into the role of S. copri in modulating toxicity and resistance to combination immunotherapy. High levels of S. copri in donor or recipient microbiomes strongly associated with grade 3 irAEs in patients receiving ipilimumab/nivolumab. Strain-level tracking revealed that S. copri enrichment in recipients was primarily derived from donors, further supporting the causative role of this taxon in adverse outcomes. Although S. copri is frequently present at baseline, our data suggest that its expansion under the selective pressure of FMT and dual ICI therapy drives a dysregulated immune environment predisposing to resistance and toxicity. Consistent with this, in our prior FMT trial using healthy donors and single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy, S. copri abundance was not associated with increased toxicity or resistance; however, increased S. copri after FMT was observed in patients with melanoma in the refractory setting who received FMT from patient donors and remained resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy, underscoring the context-specific effects of this taxon in ICI therapy. Metabolomic profiling highlighted protective metabolic adaptations in patients without severe toxicity who maintained or had increased plasma levels of metabolites central to immune regulation, cellular stress response and energy production—including cortisol, L-histidine, L-cysteine, stearoylcarnitine and pyruvic acid—whereas patients with grade 3 irAEs showed significant depletion. These findings highlight a distinctive metabolic profile in patients protected from severe toxicity, supporting the hypothesis that maintenance of specific metabolic pathways underlies resilience to immune-mediated injury and favorable outcomes with FMT and ICI therapy. We previously reported increased L-histidine levels in responder patients with melanoma after FMT29. In the PERFORM trial, most responders also avoided grade 3 irAEs, suggesting a potential protective role for L-histidine after FMT in patients with cancer. We also observed a post-treatment decrease in plasma homocysteine among patients without grade 3 or higher irAEs and treatment responders. Homocysteine is a pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory metabolite of one-carbon/sulfur amino acid metabolism, and elevated levels have been linked to endothelial dysfunction and increased cytokine production41,42. Gut microbiota disturbances (dysbiosis) can impair B vitamin (folate/B12) and sulfur amino acid metabolism, thereby driving hyperhomocysteinemia, increased intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation43. By restoring microbial−host metabolic homeostasis via healthy donor FMT, our findings suggest that lowering homocysteine may reflect a reduced inflammatory milieu that corresponds with both fewer severe irAEs and improved tumor response. Immune profiling revealed systemic differences associated with grade 3 irAEs. Elevated CD38+ and HLA-DR+ memory T cells—previously linked to severe irAEs in melanoma44,45—were also increased in patients with grade 3 irAEs and in those with high S. copri levels 10 weeks after FMT, represented by TC1 and TC2 subpopulations. The TC1 subpopulation was likewise enriched in non-responders, consistent with reports that dysfunctional CD38+CD8+ cells confer resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy46. Notably, although TC1 cells also rose longitudinally in patients without grade 3 irAEs, this group uniquely displayed a sustained increase in CD38+ Treg cells, which may protect against excessive inflammation—an effect absent in patients who developed irAEs. This pattern mirrors melanoma cohorts, where CD38+HLA-DR+ memory T cell expansion alongside Treg loss has been associated with irAEs during ICI therapy45. Consistently, CD38+ Treg cells were enriched in responders after FMT, aligning with evidence that systemic Treg expansion associates with improved ICI responses in melanoma48. Beyond divergent T cell responses, systemic changes were also evident in monocytes and NK cells. Sustained DNAM1 expression on monocytes in patients with high S. copri may facilitate extravasation into inflamed tissues and contribute to irAEs, whereas enrichment of immunosuppressive markers (CD163 and CD33) on intermediate monocytes and elevated IL-10 in patients with grade 3 irAEs or high S. copri suggest a compensatory response to tissue damage and immune activation49. By contrast, non-classical monocytes (M2 subpopulation) were elevated in patients without grade 3 irAEs, potentially protecting against gastrointestinal toxicities alongside CD38+ Treg cells. These non-classical monocytes have been linked to tissue repair and inflammation resolution in inflammatory bowel diease50. Additionally, higher EGF and sphingosine-1-phosphate in patients without grade 3 irAES or low S. copri may suppress immune-related colitis by promoting epithelial regeneration, barrier integrity and anti-inflammatory macrophages51. Together, these findings suggest that distinct monocyte trajectories are associated with the development of irAEs after FMT. Patients with grade 3 irAEs and high S. copri levels and non-responders exhibited a marked loss of circulating immunoregulatory NK cells (CD56++CD16−) with reduced DNAM1 expression, indicating altered NK maturation and function. This depletion may be driven by elevated NK-activating cytokines such as IFNα2, observed in S. copri-high patients, and could promote both resistance and irAEs, including TH1-mediated colitis34. Overall, patients with grade 3 irAEs and high S. copri levels at 10 weeks after FMT displayed an expansion of CD38+HLA-DR+ICOS+/− CD8+ memory T cells, accompanied by a loss of immunoregulatory CD56++CD16− NK cells, and exhibited a shift in the immunosuppressive state of monocytes. Together, this imbalance may create an immune milieu unable to restrain excessive activation, predisposing S. copri-high patients to irAEs and reduced therapeutic response. Larger datasets are required to validate these findings. Findings from the FMT-LUMINATE trial (NCT04951583) further implicate S. copri in irAEs: patients with melanoma receiving FMT from S. copri-high donors developed irAEs, whereas pembrolizumab-treated patients with lung cancer receiving FMT from the same donor did not52. The trial also showed that LND101 can eliminate potentially harmful bacteria in responders. In summary, our integrated multiomics analysis demonstrates, to our knowledge for the first time, that successful and durable functional engraftment of a diverse, anti-inflammatory microbiome is associated with improved clinical response and reduced toxicity in patients with mRCC receiving FMT and ICI-based therapy. The use of healthy donors allows scalable FMT programs for clinical trials, and encapsulated FMT offers a more patient-friendly alternative to traditional endoscopic delivery (Extended Data Fig. Together, our results underscore the importance of functional donor screening and targeted modulation of the microbiome in optimizing the safety and efficacy of next-generation immune-based therapies. However, our study was not powered to define the ideal donor microbiome composition to enhance immunotherapy efficacy without additional toxicities, and the small sample size is the primary limitation of our study. Validation in larger, multicenter trials is necessary to refine donor selection, clarify microbiome−immunity mechanisms and confirm these exploratory findings. The PERFORM trial (NCT04163289) is an open-label, single-center, phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of LND101—a healthy donor-derived microbiome transplantation product—in combination with doublet immunotherapy or immunotherapy plus targeted therapy in patients with mRCC. The study was conducted at the London Health Sciences Centre after approval by the Western University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board, in accordance with applicable national and international regulatory guidelines. Administrative oversight was provided by the Clinical Research Unit at the Verspeeten Family Cancer Centre, which also established a data safety monitoring committee (DSMC) to provide independent oversight to ensure participant safety and protocol adherence. All 20 enrolled participants were adults with mRCC. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with institutional research ethics board approval and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Participants did not receive financial compensation for enrollment or participation in the study. Sex was recorded for all participants based on self-report at enrollment. Gender identity was not separately collected, consistent with institutional clinical trial standards during the study period. Sex was not used as an inclusion or exclusion criterion, and the study was not powered to evaluate sex-based differences in safety, clinical outcomes, microbiome engraftment or immune correlates. The unequal distribution of males and females (16 males and four females) further limited the feasibility of such analyses. However, sex distribution is reported transparently, and future larger studies will be required to assess potential sex-related differences. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed advanced (not amenable to curative surgery or radiation) or metastatic RCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IV), classified as favorable, intermediate-risk or poor-risk disease according to IMDC criteria, which consider time from diagnosis to treatment <1 year, hemoglobin below the lower limit of normal, corrected calcium >10 mg dl−1, elevated neutrophil or platelet counts and Karnofsky performance status <80%. Additional requirements were investigator-assessed evaluable disease, ability to ingest oral capsules, provision of written informed consent, acknowledgment of potential non-infectious risks of FMT and recovery to baseline or ≤grade 1 toxicity (per CTCAE v5.0) from prior treatments unless adverse events were clinically insignificant. Adequate organ and marrow function was required, defined by absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mm3 without growth factor support, white blood cell count ≥2,000/mm3, platelets ≥100,000/mm3 without transfusion, hemoglobin ≥9 g dl−1 without transfusion, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤3× the upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤1.5× ULN (≤3× ULN in patients with Gilbert syndrome) and serum creatinine ≤1.5× ULN or creatinine clearance ≥40 ml min−1 calculated by the Cockcroft−Gault equation. Patients were excluded if they had received prior systemic therapy for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic RCC, including investigational agents, or if they had received radiation therapy for bone metastases within 2 weeks or any other radiotherapy within 4 weeks of study entry. Exclusions also applied to patients with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior radiotherapy, those who were pregnant or breastfeeding or those planning to conceive during the study or within 120 days after the last immunotherapy dose. Additional exclusions included known immunodeficiency (for example, HIV infection or prior transplantation), systemic corticosteroid use >10 mg of prednisone equivalent daily or other immunosuppressive therapy (with allowances for adrenal replacement, short-term prophylaxis or inhaled/topical formulations) and systemic antibiotic use within 2 weeks of the first FMT. Patients with chronic intestinal disease (including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption or colonic tumors) or absolute contraindications to FMT (such as toxic megacolon or severe dietary allergies including shellfish, nuts or seafood) were not eligible. Use of concurrent systemic or local antineoplastic therapy was prohibited, although concurrent bisphosphonate or denosumab for bone metastases was permitted. Other exclusions included active central nervous system metastases or leptomeningeal disease unless stable (≥4 weeks after radiotherapy or ≥8 weeks after major surgery), active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids or immunosuppressants (except vitiligo, type 1 diabetes or resolved childhood asthma/atopy), history of non-infectious pneumonitis requiring steroids or current pneumonitis, serious uncontrolled comorbidities (for example, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, ischemia, arrhythmia, bleeding disorders, severe pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disorders or active systemic infection, including hepatitis B or C) and active infection requiring systemic therapy. Patients who had received live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of treatment initiation were excluded, although inactivated injectable influenza vaccines were permitted while intranasal live attenuated vaccines were prohibited. Additional exclusions included psychiatric or substance use disorders likely to interfere with study compliance and concurrent use of probiotic-containing food products during immunotherapy. Given the novelty of the approach and the fact that this was the first study of encapsulated healthy donor FMT in combination with ICI-based regimens in mRCC, no formal statistical calculation could be applied to determine sample size. Instead, the rationale was safety-driven: a cohort of 20 patients was considered adequate to detect an unforeseen safety signal yet small enough to avoid and limit unnecessary exposure should the intervention prove unsafe or detrimental. Thus, 20 patients were determined to provide an appropriate balance between patient safety and the ability to generate meaningful preliminary safety data to inform the design of future randomized studies. The trial was overseen by an institutional DSMC composed of five members, including at least two independent oncologists not involved in the conduct of the study. The DSMC reviewed safety data at 6-month intervals. As an additional safety precaution, the first three patients were monitored for 3 months to assess for any new adverse event or those that occurred at a higher grade than those previously reported in clinical trials, according to the National Cancer Institute's CTCAE v5.0. This phase 1 study was not statistically powered to evaluate efficacy. Feces collection and encapsulation were conducted under the supervision of the Division of Infectious Diseases at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, Canada. Each set of capsules (one full dose and two half-doses) contains material from a single donor only. Patients were required to consume 36−40 capsules for the initial full dose, followed by two half-doses of 20−25 capsules each, under supervision and within 2 hours of capsule defrosting, followed by a 30-minute period of observation. Public-facing campaigns (hospital press releases, advertisements, flyers and social media) were launched to recruit healthy individuals who were interested in being stool donors. Interested individuals were prescreened using a self-administered email screening questionnaire (age, location, occupation and basic health). Individuals who self-reported eligibility on the questionnaire were subsequently contacted over the phone by study coordinators to review eligibility (questionnaire and inclusion and exclusion criteria). Final eligibility was confirmed after a comprehensive physician assessment. A healthy donor who has a body mass index of 18.5−30 kg m−2 and who satisfies the following criteria was selected for donation22,53. Donors were excluded for any underlying metabolic disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, insulin resistance or atherosclerosis. Positive stool test or nasal swab results for any multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE/CPE), SARS-CoV-2 or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)). Any of the following symptoms 14 days before any stool collection: fever, cough, loss of taste, anosmia, fatigue/malaise, myalgia, sore throat, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, chest pain, rash, conjunctivitis or headache. Any symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 or known SARS-CoV-2 infection within the last 3 months. New rash or spots indicative of monkeypox (Mpox). Any symptoms suggestive of the Mpox virus or may have been recently infected or exposed to the Mpox virus within the last 3 months. Donors were also excluded if they were men who have sex with men or women with a male partner who has sex with men. A history of any gastrointestinal or liver disorders or cancers, including, but not limited to, gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), microscopic colitis, motility disorders (including gastroparesis and irritable bowel syndrome) or diverticular disease. Previous surgery to the intestine, liver or gallbladder (except remote appendectomy). Use within the last 3 months of any antibiotics. Recent travel to a developing country (within the last 3 months). Any positive laboratory results for a transmissible pathogen. Alcohol intake with a cutoff value of <10 g per day in women and <20 g per day in men. Rectal swab for chlamydia, gonorrhea, MRSA and Mpox. FMT capsules (LND-101) were prepared according to an established protocol as described in a Canadian study29. In brief, donor stool was processed aerobically under biosafety level 2 conditions. The material was then encapsulated, flash frozen at −55 °C on dry ice and stored at −80 °C for up to 2 months before use. Capsules were thawed at room temperature approximately 30 minutes prior to ingestion. Donations of 80−100 g (for a full dose) and 50−60 g (for a half-dose) were processed individually without pooling by mixing in 0.9% normal saline and glycerol and were filtered using a stomacher bag. The filtrate was centrifuged, and the final sediment was mixed to incorporate residual liquid, allowing it to be pipetted into capsules. Finally, the capsules were flash frozen at −55 °C on dry ice and stored at −80 °C for up to 2 months until 30 minutes prior to ingestion. One donation of 80−100 g produced approximately 40 capsules (full dose), and 50−60 g produced 20−25 capsules (half-dose). Frozen capsules were shipped on dry ice to the London Health Sciences Centre, where patients received their follow-up half-doses after the first full FMT treatment at St. Joseph's Hospital, London. Capsule temperatures were continuously monitored using an EL-GFX-TC Thermocouple Data Logger to ensure stability during shipment. Upon arrival, capsules were stored at −80 °C and used for FMT within 2 months of manufacturing. The capsules are triple-encapsulated with hard gelatin shells to delay dissolution and protect against gastric acid, ensuring release in the distal small intestine and colon. SARS-CoV-2 testing was conducted according to our previously published protocol22. In brief, donors received a questionnaire before each stool sample dropoff, which included COVID-19 symptoms, positive COVID-19 tests, any infectious symptoms, including Mpox, and recent travel outside Canada. If the donors passed the questionnaire, they were allowed to drop off their stool samples. During each visit, donors were also required to provide a nasal swab for COVID-19 testing (polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT−PCR)), and a portion of the stool sample was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 RT−PCR and MDROs. Patients underwent a standard bowel preparation with 250−4,000 ml of polyethylene glycol with electrolytes (PEG3350) solution (as tolerated) the evening before the first FMT administration with LND101. In brief, after an early light supper the evening prior to the first full-dose FMT, patients underwent a standard polyethylene glycol electrolyte bowel preparation identical to that used for colonoscopy (up to 4 l, consumed in 200-ml aliquots every 15 minutes until clear watery stools were achieved). Water or clear liquids were permitted until 2 hours before capsule ingestion, which occurred the following morning over approximately 30 minutes under supervision. Patients received LND101 orally on a defined schedule, initiated prior to standard immunotherapy (for example, nivolumab/ipilimumab) or immunotherapy combined with a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted agent (for example, lenvatinib and axitinib). Two half-doses (20−25 capsules, equivalent to 50−60 g of feces) were administered at weeks 3 and 6 without bowel preparation. The specific systemic therapy was selected by the treating physician in accordance with Canadian guidelines. Patients received either dual ICIs or anti-PD-1 therapy combined with a VEGF inhibitor. Publicly funded regimens followed standard protocols: nivolumab (3 mg kg−1 every 3 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg kg−1 every 3 weeks) up to four cycles, followed by maintenance nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks or 480 mg every 4 weeks) or a combination of pembrolizumab with a VEGF-targeted agent (for example, lenvatinib and axitinib). To allow microbiota engraftment, the first immunotherapy dose was given at least 7 days after the initial FMT (Fig. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, completion of therapy or death, at the physician's discretion. Radiographic assessments were performed every 12 weeks for the first 2 years and then at least annually for up to 5 years or more often if clinically indicated. Imaging modalities included computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, with efforts made to use the same modality throughout follow-up. CR was defined as the disappearance of all targeted lesions; PR as ≥30% reduction in the sum of target lesion diameters from baseline; PD as a ≥20% increase in target lesion size or the appearance of new lesions; and SD as the absence of CR, PR or PD for ≥3 months. ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR, and clinical benefit was defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR or SD lasting ≥6 months. For correlative analyses, patients achieving CR or PR were categorized as responders, and those with SD or PD were classified as non-responders. Clinical data, including demographics, imaging results and adverse events, were prospectively collected at each visit and entered into a secure REDCap electronic database (version 12.4.17; Vanderbilt University, 2022). Access was restricted to authorized clinical research staff and the principal investigator. Each participant was assigned a unique study ID with the master linking log securely to preserve confidentiality. Biological samples, including stool and blood, were collected at five predefined timepoints: (1) at baseline (prior to any intervention), (2) 1 week after the first full-dose FMT and just before initiating systemic therapy, (3) 4 weeks after the first FMT and prior to the second immunotherapy dose, (4) 7 weeks after the first FMT and prior to the third immunotherapy dose and (5) approximately 10 weeks after the first FMT and prior to the fourth immunotherapy dose. At each timepoint, clinical assessments were performed alongside routine laboratory evaluations, including renal and liver function tests, complete blood count, electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase. Organ function was documented at baseline and monitored throughout follow-up. Participants were free to withdraw consent at any time without affecting their clinical care. Samples collected prior to withdrawal were retained for analysis. Adverse events were graded using CTCAE v5.0 (ref. Toxicities occurring after the first FMT but before initiation of immunotherapy-based combination were attributed to FMT. Adverse events occurring within 90 days of starting immunotherapy were considered related to the combination of FMT and immunotherapy-based combination, whereas those occurring beyond 90 days were attributed to immunotherapy-based combination alone. All adverse events were managed in accordance with standard clinical practice guidelines. Immunotherapy and/or VEGF-TKI were temporarily held or permanently discontinued in cases of severe toxicity, at the discretion of the treating oncologist. All events were reviewed by the trial principal investigator to ensure standardized attribution and grading. The Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Side Effect Toolkit was used to guide dose modifications. The primary endpoint of the PERFORM trial was safety and tolerability of LND101 when administered in combination with immunotherapy-based regimens. Safety was assessed by the incidence and severity of irAEs graded according to CTCAE v5.0 (ref. Attribution categories were unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable or definite. irAEs were defined as those with attribution of possible/probable/definite. For the primary analysis, we report irAEs of any grade using a uniform threshold of ≥possible. In a prespecified sensitivity analysis, to reduce potential noise from non-specific low-grade events, we restricted grade 1−2 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) to probable/definite while retaining possible/probable/definite for grade 3 or higher. The combination was considered safe if irAEs did not occur more frequently or with greater severity than expected from the relevant product monograph of each backbone regimen. Given that patients received different standard regimens (for example, nivolumab/ipilimumab, pembrolizumab/axitinib and pembrolizumab/lenvatinib), the incidence and spectrum of observed irAEs were interpreted relative to the established toxicity profile of each respective regimen. This framework enabled assessment of whether the addition of LND101 introduced excess or unexpected immune-related toxicity beyond the known safety spectrum. As prespecified in the protocol, all safety analyses were restricted to irAEs, which represent the most clinically relevant toxicities in the context of microbiome−immunity interactions. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of grade 3 or higher irAEs occurring from treatment initiation to 120 days after the last immunotherapy dose; clinical response assessment by RECIST v1.1 (ref. 24); longitudinal changes in gut microbiome composition from fecal samples; immune activation markers (for example, circulating cytokines and immune cell subsets); and health-related quality of life, assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. In accordance with the trial protocol, adverse events focused on immune-related events, which represent the most clinically relevant toxicities in the context of microbiome−immune interactions. This prespecified focus also guided downstream translational analyses for the exploratory endpoints, ensuring alignment between clinical and mechanistic endpoints. By focusing on irAEs, the study was able to interrogate mechanistic links between the microbiome and immune-related toxicity without confounding from regimen-specific non-immune adverse events. Safety analyses were conducted in the ITT population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of LND101 in combination with immunotherapy-based therapy (n = 20). Overall survival and correlative analyses for toxicity (microbiome, immune and metabolomic) were also performed in the ITT population. Efficacy analyses and correlative analyses based on clinical response were conducted in the per-protocol population, defined as all patients with measurable disease at baseline according to investigator assessment (n = 18). The ORR was calculated as the proportion of patients achieving CR or PR per RECIST v1.1. PFS was analyzed in the per-protocol population (n = 18). Kaplan−Meier methods were used to estimate PFS and overall survival, with medians and 95% confidence intervals reported. Patient-reported quality of life was analyzed in all patients with available EQ-5D-5L assessments. Baseline distributions across the five domains and global VAS scores were summarized descriptively. Longitudinal changes from baseline were evaluated through median score differences and distribution shifts across cycles, with particular attention to cycle 4 to align with early clinical response and safety assessment windows. Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed stratified by the occurrence of grade 3 or higher irAEs. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics, safety events and correlative endpoints. No formal hypothesis testing or adjustment for multiple comparisons was planned, consistent with the exploratory nature of this phase 1 study. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA LP Tagmentation kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were dual-indexed and sequenced as paired-end 300-bp reads on the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platform. In total, 3,914.1 Gb of raw sequencing data were generated, corresponding to an average of approximately 57.3 million paired-end reads per sample (150-bp average read length) across 113 samples prior to quality control and preprocessing. Initial preprocessing involved trimming sequencing primers, removing reads shorter than 75 bp and discarding low-quality reads (quality score < Q20) using Trimmomatic version 0.39 (ref. Reads containing two or more ambiguous nucleotides were also filtered out. Contaminant sequences were removed by aligning reads to the human reference genome (hg19) and the phiX174 control genome using Bowtie 2 version 2.5.4 (ref. 56) with the very-sensitive-local preset to conservatively exclude host genome reads. After preprocessing, an average of 55.8 million paired-end reads per sample remained and were retained for downstream analyses. Taxonomic composition was profiled from shotgun metagenomic data to the species level using MetaPhlAn version 4.1.1 (ref. This profiling identified a total of 1,494 microbial species and 1,591 species-level genome bins (SGBs). The unclassified_estimation parameter was set to ensure accurate estimation of unclassified. Bowtie 2 alignment and SAM output files were retained for downstream analyses. Relative abundance tables were merged using MetaPhlAn's merge_metaphlan_tables.py utility and normalized to CPM for subsequent statistical analysis. Functional profiling was conducted using the HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN) version 3.9 (ref. For nucleotide alignment, the ChocoPhlAn database (mpa_vJun23) consistent with MetaPhlAn was used, and UniRef90 served as the protein database. The HUMAnN pipeline was executed with DIAMOND version 2.1.8 (ref. These tables were merged using the humann_join_tables utility. All tables were CPM normalized for downstream statistical analysis. After functional profiling, all resulting tables were transferred from the HPC cloud environment to a local workstation for subsequent analysis in R version 4.5.0. A unified list structure was constructed in R, incorporating all relevant data layers, including metadata, species-level abundance, ECs, gene families, pathway abundance, pathway coverage, genus-level profiles and SGBs. Sample identifiers were standardized across all tables to ensure consistency, allowing for accurate linkage between metadata and metagenomic data. MetaPhlAn annotates features hierarchically from Kingdom to SGB, and filtering was performed to isolate the species and SGB levels for downstream analysis. The dplyr R package version 1.1.4 and tidyr R package version 1.3.1 were used for data manipulation, and the ggplot2 version 3.5.2 package was used for all visualizations. α-Diversity was calculated at the species level using Shannon and inverse Simpson indices via the vegan R package (version 2.7-1)60. Shannon index accounts for both richness (number of species) and evenness (distribution of abundances), making it sensitive to rare species. By contrast, the inverse Simpson index emphasizes dominant species and provides a measure of how evenly distributed the microbial community is. Together, these indices offer complementary views of within-sample diversity. To assess whether α-diversity differed between clinical subgroups, we performed one-way ANOVA separately at each timepoint, using the diversity metric as the outcome and clinical subgroup as the predictor. To correct for multiple comparisons and identify specific differences between group pairs, Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc test was applied after each ANOVA. This allowed for pair-wise comparisons while controlling the family-wise error rate and minimizing type I error. Timepoints with fewer than two group levels were excluded from testing. Statistically significant pair-wise comparisons (adjusted P < 0.05) were annotated in visualizations. β-Diversity was first assessed at the species level using Bray−Curtis dissimilarity, which captures differences in community composition by accounting for shared species and their relative abundances. This measure emphasizes differences in dominant taxa, making it particularly useful for identifying compositional shifts in microbial abundance profiles. To visualize these compositional changes over time, Bray−Curtis dissimilarity matrices were subjected to principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Group-level differences were statistically assessed using PERMANOVA (adonis2 function, vegan package, 999 permutations) at baseline (timepoint 1) and 10 weeks after FMT (timepoint 5) to determine whether microbial communities diverged based on clinical subgroups. We further examined which microbial species were most strongly associated with the observed ordination axes using environmental vector fitting (envfit function, vegan). This analysis identified species whose relative abundance patterns aligned significantly with the PCoA structure. The significance of each species was tested through 999 permutations, and only those with P < 0.05 were retained. From these, the top 12 species with the highest vector magnitude (calculated from their contributions to PCoA axes 1 and 2) were selected and plotted as arrows to highlight their directional influence on community variation. To quantify the similarity between each patient's microbiome and their respective donor's profile over time, two additional dissimilarity measures along with Bray−Curtis—Jaccard and Aitchison distances—were calculated. Jaccard dissimilarity, used on species-level data, is based on presence/absence and evaluates overlap in community membership, regardless of abundance. This allowed us to track whether patients were acquiring donor-like species, even in small amounts. Aitchison distance, used on EC profiles, applies a centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation, making it more appropriate for compositional functional data. It enabled us to assess convergence or divergence in functional potential between patients and their donors over time. These values were normalized by each patient's baseline (pre-FMT) distance to generate fold changes. This normalization allowed for patient-specific tracking of relative shifts in similarity to the donor. Two types of statistical comparisons were conducted on the fold change data: (1) within-group comparisons across timepoints, to assess whether each clinical group showed a significant shift in donor similarity over time, and (2) between-group comparisons at timepoints 4 and 5 only, to assess the similarity of samples to the donor at 7 weeks and 10 weeks after FMT. To control for multiple testing in the within-group comparisons, P values were adjusted using the Benjamini−Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method in each test. Differential abundance analysis of species was conducted using the lefser function from the lefser package (version 1.18.0)61. Patients were grouped based on grade 3 toxicity status for this analysis. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) first applies a non-parametric Kruskal−Wallis test to identify features with significantly different abundances between the two groups. It then uses linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to estimate the effect size of each discriminatory feature. A heatmap was generated using the pheatmap R package (version 1.0.13) for species with LDA > 2 to visualize their abundance patterns across all timepoints and both clinical groups, highlighting the longitudinal dynamics of discriminatory taxa. Features with LDA > 2 were retained for downstream analysis. Therefore, no additional statistical testing was applied to features selected based on this LDA threshold. Differential analysis of EC numbers was performed using MaAsLin3 (ref. It supports multivariable modeling, normalizes and transforms input data and applies FDR correction to control for multiple testing. For each feature, MaAsLin3 reports effect sizes, P values and FDR-adjusted q values, enabling robust identification of differentially abundant features. In this analysis, two covariates were included: toxicity status (whether the recipient developed grade 3 toxicity) and timepoint, with donor samples assigned to T0. Donor samples were grouped according to the toxicity status of their respective recipients, thereby assessing whether features in the donor microbiota were associated with future toxicity outcomes in patients. This combined selection approach was implemented to ensure that the identified enzyme features were both significantly different at baseline between donors (based on recipient outcome) and retained in recipients at 10 weeks after FMT (timepoint 5), suggesting potential functional persistence. Candidate enzyme features were selected based on a joint P < 0.05, a joint q < 0.1 and an absolute model coefficient > 0.1, indicating both statistical significance and a meaningful effect size. Only enzymes that passed these thresholds at both the donor (T0) and patient (T5) timepoints were retained as candidate features. Species were ranked by their total cumulative abundance (CPM) across all collected trial samples. Taxa names were cleaned by removing prefixes and truncating them to species-level labels. Separate compositional visualizations were created for donors and patients. For donors, the mean CPM values of each top taxon were calculated across all donations of a donor and displayed per donor. For patients, the same top taxa were profiled over time (T1 to T5). The patient's label was modified to reflect their experience of grade 3 toxicity. Strain profiling was performed using StrainPhlAn version 4.0 (ref. To improve the sensitivity and resolution of strain-level engraftment detection, we incorporated publicly available metagenomic samples from three previously published FMT trials: Baruch et al.14, Davar et al.15 and Routy et al. (MIMIC study)29. Including these datasets enhanced marker selection quality and increased the phylogenetic signal for strain tracking across samples. Marker filtering parameters were set to include rare but valid SGBs by setting the minimum percentage thresholds on per-sample marker coverage to 0, the minimum number of samples sharing a marker to 20 and requiring that each marker be present in at least 10% of the samples (–sample_with_n_markers_perc 0, –sample_with_n_markers 20, –marker_in_n_samples_perc 10). Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for each SGB using marker gene alignments, and normalized pair-wise phylogenetic distances were calculated. To define same-strain pairs, SGB-specific thresholds were optimized using Youden's index, which maximizes the separation between longitudinal (same-host) and unrelated (inter-host) sample pairs. Strain engraftment was inferred when the post-FMT recipient shared a strain with their donor for a given SGB and this strain was absent in the recipient's pre-FMT sample. This approach allowed high-resolution detection of donor-derived strain persistence after FMT. Two types of statistical comparisons were conducted on the strain engraftment rate data: (1) within-group comparisons, to assess whether each clinical group showed significant changes in engraftment relative to baseline, and (2) between-group comparisons at timepoints 2, 3, 4 and 5, to evaluate differences in engraftment rates based on clinical outcomes. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied for each comparison. This ensured that P values were adjusted independently for each analysis context. Taxonomic profiling was performed using MetaPhlAn version 4.1.1 with the mpa_vJune23 database. S. copri abundance (CPM) was extracted from each trial's merged abundance table and averaged per patient at the pre-FMT and post-FMT timepoints, if multiple samples were collected. Significant differences in S. copri levels were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with P values adjusted using the Benjamini−Hochberg FDR method. Blood samples were collected in EDTA anticoagulant vacutainers. For PBMC isolation, blood was diluted with PBS, and PBMCs were isolated using Lymphoprep density gradient medium (STEMCELL Technologies, 07861) in SepMate tubes (STEMCELL Technologies, 85460). Blood was layered on Lymphoprep medium and centrifuged at 1,200g for 15 minutes at room temperature with brake. PBMCs were collected, and red blood cells were removed using ACK lysing buffer and washed. PBMCs were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells per milliliter in freezing medium (RPMI 1640 + 12.5% human serum albumin + 10% DMSO). Samples were frozen in a Mr. Frosty container for 24−48 hours at −80 °C and stored at −150 °C for long-term storage. Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. One million cells were then stained with Zombie Aqua for 20 minutes at room temperature. Fc receptors were blocked with TruStain FcX for 10 minutes at room temperature, followed by labeling with a cocktail of extracellular antibodies (Supplementary Table 4) in the presence of Brilliant Stain buffer and Monocyte Blocker for 20 minutes on ice. Cells were subsequently fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and resuspended in staining buffer (5% heat-inactivated FBS in PBS) for acquisition. For FOXP3 intracellular staining, cells were fixed with the eBioscience Foxp3 / Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set for 50 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized, and Fc receptors were blocked again with TruStain FcX for 10 minutes at room temperature. Anti-FOXP3 staining was performed in permeabilization buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by fixation with 2%. Data were acquired on a BD FACSymphony A1 cytometer, followed by analysis using FlowJo version 10.6.2 and GraphPad Prism 9 software. Data were first normalized using CytoNorm to remove batch effects, followed by supervised gating analysis using fluorescence-minus-one controls (Supplementary Figs. Using DownSample, each population was downsampled to 10,000 events for T cells and monocytes. Sample populations were concatenated, and unsupervised dimensionality reduction was conducted using t-SNE, followed by clustering analysis using FlowSOM and ClusterExplorer. Statistical analysis was conducted using a two-sided unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test for comparisons at T5 or a two-sided Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test with Benjamini−Hochberg correction for multiple within-group comparisons The multiplex assay was performed using a Luminex xMAP technology platform, allowing simultaneous quantification of 48 human cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Each specimen on each panel was run in singlet on the Luminex xMAP technology, and data were analyzed by Eve Technologies using standard curve interpolation. Statistical analysis was conducted using a two-sided unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test for comparisons at T5 or a two-sided Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test with Benjamini−Hochberg correction for multiple within-group comparisons Metabolomic analysis of patient plasma was conducted according to a previously published targeted metabolomics method63. In brief, 20 μl of plasma was added to 80 μl of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade methanol, and 5 μl of diluted internal standard (diluted 1:1 with HPLC-grade methanol; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, MSK-A2-1.2) was added to each sample, which was then vortexed, incubated for 30 minutes at −80 °C to precipitate proteins and then centrifuged at 15,000g to clarify. Then, 10 μl of supernatant was diluted in 990 μl of buffer containing 95% acetonitrile and 5% 20 mM ammonium carbonate (pH 9.8). Quality control samples were prepared by pooling 10 μl of each sample. All samples, including quality control samples, were then analyzed by hydrophilic interaction or reversed-phase liquid chromatography and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with a SCIEX QTRAP 5500 triple quadrupole linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometer. Data were captured using Analyst version 1.6.2 software (SCIEX); peak integration was performed using Skyline version 24.1. An in-house R script was used for data normalization against pooled quality control samples and removal of metabolites with low signal or high quality control variance (version 4.4.2, http://www.r-project.org, accessed on 15 July 2021). Survival plots were generated using the R package survminer (version 0.5)64. Across successive protocol amendments for the PERFORM trial, updates primarily focused on expanding eligibility criteria, clarifying safety endpoints and broadening translational objectives. The protocol title and scope were revised to include patients treated with either doublet immunotherapy or anti-PD-1 plus VEGFR-TKI combinations, reflecting evolving standards of care in mRCC. Therefore, corresponding modifications were made throughout the Background, Inclusion Criteria and Treatment Plan sections to incorporate regimens such as pembrolizumab/axitinib, pembrolizumab/lenvatinib and nivolumab/cabozantinib. The primary endpoint remained safety—irAEs assessed by CTCAE v5.0—and secondary endpoints included clinical response (RECIST v1.1), gut microbiome, immune correlates and patient-reported quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). Methodological refinements included mandating stool sample 3 for longitudinal microbiome analysis and adding new collaborators for biospecimen analyses to enable multiomic integration (metagenomics, metabolomics, immune profiling and tumor epigenomics). Administrative corrections included reference formatting, version control and inclusion of new institutional contact information. Overall, these amendments maintained the original study intent—evaluating safety, tolerability and mechanistic correlates of healthy donor encapsulated FMT combined with standard ICI-based regimens—while broadening translational depth and improving operational clarity to support future multisite expansion.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved outcomes for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma, yet over half of patients exhibit primary resistance. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may overcome resistance to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. The clinical activity and safety of FMT plus anti-PD-1 in NSCLC or anti-PD-1 plus anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) therapy in melanoma have not been evaluated. Here we report results from FMT-LUMINate, a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 trial assessing healthy donor FMT plus anti-PD-1 in NSCLC (n = 20) or anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 (dual ICI) in melanoma (n = 20), in the first-line setting. Eligible patients received a single FMT via oral capsules prior to ICI initiation. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) in NSCLC. Secondary endpoints included ORR in melanoma, safety and donor−host microbiome similarity. FMT was deemed safe in both cohorts by an independent data and safety monitoring committee, with no grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) in NSCLC and 13 (65%) patients experiencing grade 3 or higher AEs in melanoma. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed that responders developed a distinct post-FMT gut microbiome composition, independent of acquired donor−recipient similarity or strain-level engraftment. Responders exhibited significantly greater loss of baseline bacterial species compared to non-responders, with frequent depletion of Enterocloster citroniae, E. lavalensis and Clostridium innocuum. This finding was reproduced across three published FMT oncology trials. We recolonized antibiotic-treated, tumor-bearing mice with post-FMT stool from two responder patients, and reintroduction of the specific bacterial species that were lost after FMT abrogated the antitumor effect of ICI. Taken together, these findings confirm the clinical activity of FMT in combination with ICI and suggest that the elimination of deleterious taxa is required for FMT-mediated therapeutic benefit. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved therapeutic outcomes for patients with NSCLC1 and cutaneous melanoma (herein referred to as melanoma)2. Patients with NSCLC and tumor proportion score (TPS) PD-L1 ≥ 50%, in the absence of a first-line actionable oncogenic alteration, are treated with single-agent anti-PD-1 such as pembrolizumab, with an expected objective response rate (ORR) of 39−45%1,3,4. In patients with melanoma, dual therapy with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) in combination with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) is among the most commonly used frontline regimens, yielding an ORR of 50−58% and durable improvements in overall survival (OS) compared to single-agent ipilimumab2. Despite improvements in OS, approximately half of patients will not respond to these regimens5, highlighting an urgent need to improve the efficacy of ICI. Over the past decade, the gut microbiota has emerged as one of the hallmarks of cancer and as a key determinant of response to ICI6,7,8,9,10,11,12. First, preclinical studies demonstrated that FMT from non-responder (NR) patients induced resistance to anti-CTLA-4 (ref. 6,8,9,10) therapy in murine models, and response to ICI was restored after FMT from responder (R) patients13. Gut microbiota sequencing of stool samples from clinical cohorts of patients with solid tumors has demonstrated that enrichment of potentially deleterious bacteria, including Enterocloster and Clostridium spp., were associated with resistance to ICI14,15. This dysbiosis can be further compounded by iatrogenic insults such as antibiotics16,17,18,19, now validated as an independent negative prognostic factor across multiple oncology settings. Subsequently, two phase 1 clinical trials demonstrated the first proof of concept that FMT from patients with response to anti-PD-1 could overcome primary or acquired resistance to ICI20,21,22. Soon thereafter, the phase 1 MIMIC trial demonstrated the potential of healthy donor FMT to decrease primary resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with melanoma23,24. However, the clinical activity of FMT in combination with ICI in patients with NSCLC remains unknown. Moreover, the mechanism by which FMT enhances the activity of ICI in humans remains poorly understood. We also describe how the loss of deleterious bacteria prevalent at baseline—but no longer detected after FMT—may modulate the therapeutic effects of FMT when combined with ICI. A total of 59 patients were screened for eligibility between 18 November 2021 and 6 March 2024 (Fig. 1a), of whom 20 were enrolled in the NSCLC cohort and 20 were enrolled in the melanoma cohort. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) at 1 year, OSat 1 year, disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response in the NSCLC and cutaneous melanoma cohorts, ORR in the cutaneous melanoma cohort, safety of FMT with ICI and acquired donor−host similarity as measured by the Bray−Curtis dissimilarity index25. Endpoints in the uveal melanoma cohort were exploratory and, therefore, are reported separately (see ‘Outcomes and sample size' in the Methods). b–c, Waterfall plot showing the best objective response, with PD-L1 tumor expression shown for each patient on the horizontal axis (b) and swimmer plot showing the time-on-treatment after FMT in combination with pembrolizumab in n = 20 patients with NSCLC (c). d–e, Waterfall plot showing the best objective response (d) and swimmer plot showing the time-on-treatment after FMT in combination with ipilimumab plus nivolumab in n = 20 patients with melanoma (e). Asterisks in the swimmer plot indicate that ICI treatment was discontinued at the moment of last-follow-up. Patients in the NSCLC cohort were enrolled if they had no first-line actionable oncogenic alterations, PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% and no prior exposure to anti-PD-1 therapy. Patients in the melanoma cohort were enrolled irrespective of BRAFV600 mutational status, and prior adjuvant anti-PD-1 was permitted, provided the last dose was administered more than 6 months prior to enrollment. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are reported in the Methods. Patients underwent single FMT from a healthy donor delivered by oral capsules, administered the day after bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) laxative and within 1 week before first-line anti-PD-1 monotherapy (pembrolizumab) in the NSCLC cohort or dual anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 (nivolumab and ipilimumab) in the melanoma cohort (Extended Data Fig. Ten individual healthy donor volunteers provided feces, with 10 donors participating in the NSCLC cohort and six donors participating in the melanoma cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1b), with donor demographics presented in Supplementary Table 1. Baseline characteristics for the enrolled patients are presented in Table 1. For the NSCLC cohort, median age was 68 (range 52−82) years, and 11 (55%) patients were male. Sixteen (80%) patients had adenocarcinoma histology, and 18 (90%) patients had stage IV disease, with two (10%) harboring unresectable stage III disease not amenable to curative-intent therapy. For the melanoma cohort, median age was 56 (range 27−88) years, and 13 (65%) were male. No patients were treated with BRAF/MEK inhibition for metastatic disease prior to enrollment. Seventeen (85%) patients had stage IV disease, including six (30%) with liver metastases at baseline and two (10%) with brain metastases at baseline. Median follow-up for the study was 24 months. The primary endpoint for this study was ORR in NSCLC. The DCR in NSCLC was 95% (three of four patients who did not achieve response experienced stable disease ≥6 months) (Fig. The median duration of response was 8.7 months (95% confidence interval: 3.1−20). The PFS and OS at 1 year were 65% (95% confidence interval: 47.1−89.7) and 100%, respectively (95% confidence interval not evaluable) (Extended Data Fig. A key secondary endpoint of the study was activity of FMT in combination with anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 in the melanoma cohort. The ORR in the melanoma cohort was 75% (95% confidence interval: 53.1−88.8), with 11 partial responses and four complete responses (Fig. The median duration of response was 10 months (95% confidence interval: 0−20.9). The PFS and OS at 1 year were 58% (95% confidence interval: 39.4−85.4) and 79% (95% confidence interval: 62.9−99.6), respectively (Extended Data Fig. FMT alone prior to ICI initiation resulted in grade 1 AEs in 35% of patients, most commonly diarrhea and changes in stool appearance, consistent with our previously published phase 1 trial23 (Extended Data Table 1). In the NSCLC cohort, any-grade AEs attributable to FMT plus anti-PD-1 occurred in 17 (85%) patients, and no patients experienced grade 3 or higher AEs. Corticosteroids were used in three (15%) patients for grade 2 AEs (arthritis, pancreatitis and pneumonitis). One patient who experienced grade 2 pneumonitis discontinued therapy due to this AE; however, this patient was symptom free with continued response maintained at last follow-up. This patient was also symptom free with continued response at last follow-up. In the melanoma cohort, any-grade AEs related to FMT plus anti-PD-1 plus anti-CLTA-4 occurred in 19 (95%) patients, and 12 (60%) patients experienced grade 3 AEs and one patient experienced a grade 4 AE. The most frequent grade 3 or higher AE was diarrhea or colitis, occurring in 20% of patients. Additional details on the myocarditis cases are presented in Supplementary Table 2. Thirteen (65%) patients in the melanoma cohort required corticosteroids for AEs. Two (10%) patients required second-line immunosuppression (one patient was treated with infliximab for grade 3 diarrhea, and one patient was treated with infliximab and plasmapheresis for grade 4 myocarditis). The median onset of grade 3 or higher AEs was 40 days from the start of anti-PD-1 and anti-CLTA-4. Fourteen (70%) patients in the melanoma cohort discontinued ICI due to toxicity, and six (30%) patients completed all four cycles of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4. The combination of FMT with ICI in both cohorts was deemed safe by an independent data safety and monitoring committee (DSMC) with AEs consistent with known toxicity profile of ipilimumab plus nivolumab, in accordance with the predefined safety criteria outlined in the protocol; however, the DSMC concluded that severe AEs reported in the melanoma cohort had an earlier onset than previously reported in the literature26. Additionally, myocarditis was deemed an AE of special interest for monitoring in future FMT trials. Given the accelerated onset of AEs and potential signal for increased incidence of myocarditis only in the dual anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4-treated melanoma cohort, we investigated these potential adverse safety signals by exploring the association between donor and development of AEs. Among the 13 patients who experienced grade 3 or higher AEs, six were attributed to donor 5 (Extended Data Fig. Moreover, all the fecal donations provided by donor 5 led to grade 3 or higher AEs in the melanoma cohort (Extended Data Fig. Additionally, two out of the three patients who experienced myocarditis received FMT from donor 5 (Supplementary Table 2). The two patients who developed myocarditis after receiving FMT from donor 5 experienced myocarditis of rapid onset (22 days and 25 days, respectively, after the first dose of ICI), compared to a relatively delayed onset (205 days) observed in the third patient who received FMT from donor 9. Due to the relatively high number of healthy donors used in our study, we performed unsupervised clustering of donor gut microbiota composition and observed two distinct donor clusters (P = 0.001) (Fig. 2a), also observed in the NSCLC and melanoma cohorts when analyzed separately (Supplementary Fig. Cluster B, comprising samples from donor 5 and donor 11, was characterized by high relative abundance of Prevotella spp., including Segatella copri (previously Prevotella copri clade A), Prevotella sp. Marseille-P4119, Prevotella stercorea and an unknown species in the Prevotellaceae family (SGB1472) (Fig. 3a), also observed in each cohort when analyzed separately (Supplementary Fig. Conversely, cluster A, consisting of the remaining donors, contained primarily other taxa (Fig. compared to cluster B (Extended Data Fig. Differential abundance analysis comparing patients who developed grade 3 or higher AEs confirmed that P. sp. Marseille-P4119, P. stercorea and Prevotellaceae GGB1146 SGB1472 were enriched in patients who developed grade 3 or higher AEs (Fig. Marseille-P4119 and P. stercorea were enriched after FMT compared to baseline in the patients who experienced grade 3 or higher AEs (Fig. Post-FMT engraftment at the sample level of P. sp. a, Unsupervised cluster analysis using shotgun metagenomic sequencing of healthy donors using Bray−Curtis index (n = 41 samples from nine donors); group separation was assessed using PERMANOVA. b,Contribution of species driving donor clusters (n = 41 samples from nine donors). c, LDA using LEfSe (bar plot representing the log10 transformation of the LDA score) comparing post-FMT samples from patients with grade 3 or higher AEs to those from patients without grade 3 or higher AEs (n = 79 samples from 20 patients). d, LDA using LEfSe (bar plot representing the log10 transformation of the LDA score) of baseline compared to 1 month after FMT among patients with grade 3 or higher AEs (n = 23 samples from 12 patients). Significant values had linear discriminant analysis (LDA) scores greater than 2 and P < 0.05. e–f, Bar plot representation comparing proportion of patients who developed grade 3 or higher AEs according to donor cluster for FMT-LUMINate patients with melanoma (e) and for MIMIC patients with melanoma (f). Group differences were assessed using Fisher's exact test (two-sided). Donor 5 was a Prevotella-rich donor who had participated in our previously published phase 1 study (MIMIC) involving patients with melanoma treated with FMT and monotherapy anti-PD-1, in which five (25%) patients experienced grade 3 or higher AEs23. However, donor 5 feces did not lead to toxicity in these anti-PD-1 monotherapy-treated patients. Moreover, FMT from Prevotella-rich donors was not associated with grade 3 or higher AEs in patients with NSCLC (Extended Data Fig. An analysis including all patients who experienced grade 3 or higher AEs in our current study and previously published phase 1 study23 revealed that feces from cluster B donors caused toxicity only in patients receiving dual PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade (P = 0.051) (Fig. 2e,f), with increased proportion of a subset of CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood after FMT in those who developed grade 3 or higher AEs (P = 0.026). Engraftment of S. copri was associated with these CD4+ T cells in patients who were treated with dual PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade and not in the context of single-agent ICI (Supplementary Fig. Of note, although there was a numerical association between the development of grade 3 or higher AEs and clinical response (Extended Data Fig. There was no association between the engraftment of Prevotella spp. and response (P > 0.05 for all Prevotella spp. Taken together, these results highlight that the gut microbiome—specifically, engraftment of donor-specific Prevotella spp.—was associated with the development of immune-related AEs in the context of dual immune checkpoint inhibition. Unlike the donor effect that we observed with respect to AEs, no donor effect was detected with respect to efficacy—each donor, or donor cluster, led to a proportional number of responses and non-responses (Extended Data Figs. We next explored microbiome features associated with clinical outcomes. Alpha (α) diversity as measured by the Shannon index27—which measures the number of species (richness) and their relative abundances (evenness)—was similar between the healthy donors and patients at baseline in the NSCLC and melanoma groups (Extended Data Fig. After FMT, although there was no difference in α-diversity between R patients and NR patients (Extended Data Fig. 4b), we observed response-associated shifts in the global microbiota composition in both the NSCLC (P = 0.09) and melanoma (P = 0.006) cohorts (Fig. Significant values had LDA scores greater than 2 and P < 0.05. e–f, Heatmap representation comparing responders at baseline compared to 1 month after FMT in NSCLC (n = 28 samples from n = 15 patients; e) and melanoma (n = 26 samples from n = 14 patients; f). Bacteria with P < 0.05 according to Wilcoxon test between timepoints are shown in the heatmaps. No significant differences were observed between R patients and NR patients, indicating similar levels of donor microbiota acquisition according to response status (Extended Data Fig. We next explored strain-level engraftment using the StrainPhlAn pipeline29 as described in Methods, which measures specific subspecies (strains) that engrafted from the corresponding donor. Both R patients and NR patients exhibited effective strain-level engraftment from donors with no significant difference in absolute number of strains engrafted between R and NR (Extended Data Fig. These results suggest that the global shift distinguishing R patients from NR patients observed after FMT was not driven by acquired donor−host similarity or strain engraftment from the donor. In NSCLC R, we observed enrichment of beneficial bacteria14,30,31, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Gemmiger formicilis and Akkermansia muciniphila, after FMT, whereas enrichment of deleterious bacteria such as Streptococcus vestibularis and Fusobacterium nucleatum occurred in NR (Fig. The terminology ‘beneficial' versus ‘deleterious' refers to bacterial classification described in recent articles14,30,32,33,34,35 as associated with a ‘healthy' or ‘immunosensitive' status versus a diseased or immunoresistant status (including cancer and any chronic inflammatory disorders, respectively). In the case of melanoma R patients, we observed a relative enrichment of Bacteroides eggerthii, Bacteroides faecis and Alistipes senegalensis after FMT compared to NR patients (Fig. In both NSCLC and melanoma R patients, we observed a relative enrichment in Oscillospiraceae (also called ‘Ruminococcaceae') family members after FMT, consistent with their previously reported association with favorable ICI response30,35,36 (Fig. Among R patients, a concomitant relative depletion of deleterious bacteria14,30,31, including E. lavalensis, Clostridium scindens and C. innocuum, was observed after FMT compared to baseline (Fig. Aside from Firmicutes SGB15368, there was no overlap in enriched species between NSCLC and melanoma R patients after FMT (Extended Data Fig. Altogether, these results indicate that the post-FMT shift in the gut microbiome in R patients was not dictated by acquired donor−host similarity or strain engraftment from the donor, with limited overlap of enrichment of beneficial species after FMT in the NSCLC and melanoma cohorts. Although the number of SGBs engrafted from the donor was similar in R patients versus NR patients (P = 0.15) (Extended Data Fig. 5a), we noted that the magnitude of SGB loss calculated from the patient at baseline was significantly higher in R compared to NR after FMT (P = 0.016) (Fig. The magnitude of SGBs loss from baseline in R patients was maintained in both NSCLC (P = 0.011) and melanoma (P = 0.096) subgroups (Fig. 4b), we did not observe any significant decrease in overall SGBs counts in R patients over time after FMT (Extended Data Fig. This stability of overall SGBs count over time in R patients was explained by an acquisition of SGBs from the donor (category 1) or new SGBs (category 5) (Extended Data Fig. We confirmed that overall biomass did not change in R patients or in those with high median SGBs loss over time by performing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of the 16S rRNA gene (Extended Data Fig. a–b, Representative bar plot of absolute number of SGBs from one NR (a) and one R (b) patient with melanoma.

Two weeks later, MCA-205 sarcoma cells were inoculated, and anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 was injected intraperitoneally every 3 days. As of day 3, mice also received oral gavage with bacterial cocktail or NaCl every 3 days. j, Tumor measurements at euthanization for n = 10 mice per group, results from three independent experiments using two different R samples and two different cocktails; P values were calculated using Mann−Whitney−Wilcoxon test (two-tailed).

The top SGBs lost in R patients included canonically harmful taxa associated with ICI resistance14,30,31, including Enterocloster citroniae, Enterocloster bolteae, C. innocuum, Clostridium saudiense, Clostridium spiroforme, Ruminococcus gnavus (now a member of Mediterraneibacter genus), Dialister invisus and Sellimonas intestinalis (Fig. Although Akkermansia muciniphila was one of the most frequently depleted species in NSCLC R, patients with aberrantly high relative abundances of A. muciniphila exceeding the 77th percentile (associated with dysbiosis31,35) experienced elimination of this species (Extended Data Fig. 5h), with a trend for more pronounced SGB loss in cluster B (P = 0.07) (Extended Data Fig. We next sought to validate our metagenomics findings using orthogonal approaches. We employed a validated qPCR-based assay of 108 selected species30,38 and confirmed that qPCR relative abundances significantly correlated with shotgun metagenomic data (Extended Data Fig. This qPCR-based approach—which, unlike metagenomics, is not limited by sequencing depth—demonstrated that the magnitude of species lost relative to the patient's baseline significantly correlated with the corresponding losses detected by metagenomics (P < 0.001) (Fig. Moreover, using this qPCR assay, loss of species from the patient's baseline was also associated with response (P = 0.012) (Extended Data Fig. To further strengthen this observation that loss of baseline SGBs was more strongly associated with response than the acquisition of donor-derived SGBs, we performed high-throughput culturomics in four R patients at baseline and at 1 month after FMT. At baseline, we isolated a mean of 54 species, spanning a total of 217 strains, compared to after FMT with a mean of 45 species, spanning a total of 183 strains (P = 0.171) (Extended Data Fig. As observed in the metagenomics results, we confirmed that significantly more species were lost in these R patients after FMT—defined as species detected in the sample at baseline but no longer detected in the post-FMT sample by culturomics—compared to those engrafted from their respective donors (P = 0.029) (Fig. Similar to the metagenomics results, the lost species in R patients belonged to genera that are considered as harmful, such as Enterocloster, Streptococcus and Dialister (Extended Data Fig. We then processed publicly available metagenomic data from published FMT trials and applied our SGB loss pipeline to these data. We observed similar results with regards to elimination of baseline SGBs associated with R patients in our previously published phase 1 trial (MIMIC)23 of FMT in combination with anti-PD-1 in patients with untreated melanoma (P = 0.018) (Extended Data Fig. 7a) and in the first two published studies of FMT in combination with anti-PD-1 in refractory melanoma (P = 0.074 for Baruch et al.21 and P = 0.002 for Davar et al.20) (Extended Data Fig. Accordingly, pooling these results together validated the conclusion that loss of baseline SGBs was associated with favorable clinical responses (P < 0.001) (Fig. Consistent results were obtained when reanalyzing the metagenomic data from our study as well as all published studies using an independent metagenomics pipeline (BiomScope), whereby NR patients exhibited higher retention of their baseline species (Extended Data Fig. Taken together, these findings suggest that microbiome remodeling by depletion of pre-existing species may be more critical to therapeutic response than engraftment of specific donor-derived species. Finally, to validate the relevance of lost bacterial species observed in patients, we performed FMT in antibiotic-treated specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions8,39 (Fig. We recolonized antibiotic-pretreated mice with stool sourced from two R patients with NSCLC after FMT as previously performed23. To assess the functional relevance of specific bacterial losses after FMT, we reintroduced a cocktail of bacteria isolated from the baseline sample that were depleted after FMT, specifically, for R1 (Streptococcus mutans, C. innocuum, Streptococcus parasanguinis and Enterocloster lavalensis) and for R2 (Enterocloster clostridioformis, Streptococcus anginosus and Clostridium tertium) into FMT-recipient mice by gavage. Activity of anti-PD-1 with or without anti-CTLA-4 was inhibited in the groups of mice receiving FMT plus the cocktails compared to controls receiving R FMT alone (P = 0.028 for anti-PD-1 alone and P = 0.022 for anti-PD-1 combined with anti-CTLA-4), suggesting that the loss of deleterious species is necessary to achieve the full therapeutic benefit of FMT when combined with ICI (Fig. Our results suggest that the response to FMT may be better explained by the loss of a group of deleterious bacteria rather than solely by the engraftment of individual donor strains. To investigate how bacterial loss affects the function of the global microbiome composition, we conducted untargeted plasma metabolomics to assess systemic changes in the metabolic profile after FMT. Across all cohorts, NR patients showed a significant within-group time effect for increased levels of quinolinic acid and kynurenine (P < 0.001) (Fig. Both quinolinic acid and kynurenine are metabolites of the tryptophan pathway and have been causatively linked to resistance to ICI40,41,42. In line with the notion that absence of bacterial loss was associated with resistance to therapy in our study, patients with low proportion of bacterial loss relative to their baseline had higher concentrations of plasma tryptophan after FMT (P = 0.004) (Extended Data Fig. Next, examining the metabolomic profile in the feces, we found that metabolism of the tryptophan pathway significantly decreased over time in R patients, and distinct species contributed to these tryptophan pathway dynamics in NSCLC compared to melanoma, consistent with cohort-specific bacterial signatures affecting responders in each malignancy (Fig. Taken together, these results suggest functional redundancy across different taxa in both the plasma and feces, with convergence of effects on the tryptophan pathway distinguishing R patients from NR patients after FMT. a, Longitudinal plasma analysis of quinolinic acid (top) and kynurenine (bottom) metabolites measured by UHPLC−MS; for each metabolite, two representations are shown: smooth trajectories of the model-predicted mean intensity for R (blue) and NR (red) over time.

In addition to the metabolomic profile, we examined the impact of bacterial loss on circulating inflammatory markers using high-throughput proteomics. Patients with high proportion of bacterial loss relative to their baseline exhibited distinct clustering of systemic circulating inflammatory proteins after FMT (P = 0.001) as opposed to patients with low bacterial loss, where no distinct clustering was observed (Extended Data Fig. Patients with high bacterial loss exhibited significant increase in distinct circulating pro-inflammatory proteins after FMT, including IFNγ, CXCL9, CXCL13, CCL20, CD8A, CD4 and CD28, whereas patients with low bacterial loss exhibited no distinct changes in circulating proteins after FMT (Extended Data Fig. We next investigated the impact of bacterial loss on the metabolic profile and on systemic immunity. Patients with pronounced bacterial loss exhibited an increase in the frequency of circulating CD69+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 9 for the gating strategies and Supplementary Fig. 3a for this subset in R versus NR after FMT) but a decrease in circulating CD127lowCD25highCD4+ regulatory T cells (Fig. Linking these findings with the metabolic profile, high plasma concentrations of quinolinic acid were associated with a reduced frequency of circulating CD8+ lymphocyte subpopulations, including PD-1+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3b, showing this subset in R versus NR after FMT) and PD-1+CD45RA−CCR7− effector memory CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3c, showing this subset in R versus NR after FMT). High quinolinic acid was also associated with an increased frequency of circulating CD127lowCD25highCD4+ effector memory regulatory T cells (Fig. Taken together, these results suggest that failure to eliminate baseline deleterious taxa may sustain an immunosuppressive metabolic and systemic immune milieu that compromises ICI responses. Our study demonstrates that FMT from healthy donors can enhance the clinical activity of ICI in two malignant diseases treated with two different ICI backbones. In patients with treatment-naive NSCLC and high PD-L1 expression, FMT prior to anti-PD-1 monotherapy resulted in an ORR that exceeded the prespecified efficacy threshold, meeting the primary endpoint in our study. In addition, the ORR of 80% observed in NSCLC was higher than previously described historical data, which range from 39% to 46%1,3,43. This supports the potential of FMT to overcome primary resistance to ICI and will be assessed as part of the CanBiome2 (NCT06623461) randomized trial evaluating FMT (LND-101) in combination with ICI in 128 patients. FMT was well tolerated in combination with anti-PD-1 in patients with NSCLC, with no grade 3 or higher AEs, whereas, in historical cohorts, single-agent pembrolizumab led to grade 3 or higher AEs in approximately 10% of patients1. However, in the melanoma cohort receiving dual ICI therapy, we observed a potentially accelerated onset of immune-related AEs and also a higher-than-expected frequency of myocarditis at 15%, which has an incidence of less than 1% in the literature45. In addition, the median onset of severe toxicity was 40 days, compared to 60 days in the literature26. and were not observed in patients receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy (this donor provided FMT seven times in the MIMIC trial in combination with anti-PD-1 monotherapy and once in the NSCLC cohort also receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy, and none of these patients experienced grade 3 or higher AEs). These findings suggest a context-dependent interaction between specific microbial taxa and ICI backbone and implicate Prevotella spp. as a potential driver of AEs in the setting of dual immune checkpoint blockade targeting both PD-1 and CTLA-4. As such, myocarditis has been designated an AE of special interest in the ongoing randomized CanBiome2 trial (NCT06623461), where this safety signal will be prospectively monitored. Our study highlights the importance of donor selection for future trials. Mechanistically, our results suggest that clinical benefit from FMT is not mediated by the number of specific donor-derived strains. Although certain taxa, including F. prausnitzii, were enriched in some R patients, these associations lacked overlap across cohorts. In addition, strain-level engraftment did not differ between R and NR patients across our study and in multiple published studies23. By contrast, clinical responses were associated with a robust pattern of depletion of several deleterious bacterial species, including SIG1 (ref. 30), present at baseline from the Clostridium, Enterocloster, Streptococcus and Dialister genera. This pattern of bacterial loss was validated by metagenomics, qPCR and high-throughput culturomics. It is important to note that the two latter techniques are not limited by sequencing depth. Moreover, this pattern of microbial depletion was corroborated in three published FMT trials20,21,23 and also in the concurrent TACITO trial46, underscoring its general validity across different geographies (Asia, Europe and North America), pathologies and treatment regimens. Notably, the TACITO trial demonstrated a significant improvement in median PFS, and elimination of baseline species was noted only in the FMT group and not in the placebo group. In our study, when reintroduced into tumor-bearing mice after oral gavage of favorable FMT, these harmful bacteria led to anti-PD-1 resistance. These findings suggest that therapeutic response of FMT may result from the elimination of immunosuppressive pathobionts. In line with this speculation, we detected consistent signals at the functional level, with relative depletion of the immunosuppressive tryptophan pathway and specific tryptophan metabolites, particularly kynurenine and quinolinic acid, among R patients after FMT. Mechanistically, tryptophan metabolism has been found to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to promote immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment48,49,50. In our study, high bacterial loss was associated with a favorable immunometabolic profile—characterized by increased effector CD8+ T cells, decreased regulatory T cells and reduced tryptophan metabolism. This study has several limitations, including the single-arm design, use of multiple donors and limited power for R/NR comparisons due to the low number of NR patients. In addition, the interplay among toxicity, efficacy and bacterial loss from the intestinal tract must be explored in future mechanistic studies. Our study identified a potentially pharmacodynamic biomarker for FMT efficacy, which is the elimination of deleterious bacteria from the intestinal microbiota. This finding may affect the design of next-generation live biotherapeutic products that should be designed not only to engraft but also to induce the depletion of deleterious pathobionts from the intestinal lumen. To our knowledge, the FMT-LUMINate phase 2 clinical trial provides the first prospective evidence that FMT from healthy donors can enhance the efficacy of ICI in NSCLC in combination with anti-PD-1 and in melanoma in combination with anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA-4, demonstrating that FMT efficacy is reproducible across tumor pathologies and ICI backbones. is associated with accelerated toxicity only in the context of anti-CTLA-4 therapy highlight the need to select donors and rationally design future FMT studies according to the ICI backbone. Mechanistically, the therapeutic effect of FMT may be driven by the elimination of deleterious bacteria—most notably Enterocloster, Clostridium and Streptococcus spp.—that were present at baseline. This bacterial depletion was associated with a favorable immunometabolic milieu, including reduction in quinolinic acid and expansion of CD8+ memory T cells. These results offer an actionable framework for donor selection, biomarker development and design of next-generation microbial therapies aimed at selectively eliminating immunosuppressive pathobionts. The FMT-LUMINate trial (NCT04951583) is a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 trial that included patients with advanced NSCLC, cutaneous melanoma and uveal melanoma who were being treated with first-line ICI therapy. Biological sex was considered in the study based on self-report. Gender was not considered in the study. Patients were 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC, cutaneous melanoma or uveal melanoma and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0–2 was required. Previous treatment with palliative surgery or radiation was allowed. For the melanoma cohort, previous adjuvant anti-PD-1 was allowed provided the last dose occurred more than 6 months prior to enrollment. For the melanoma cohort, previous treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors was allowed. Major exclusion criteria included previous treatment with anti-PD-1 in the NSCLC cohort, a history of autoimmune diseases, active bowel disease, the use of daily corticosteroids >10 mg of prednisone or equivalent, symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease. Patients were enrolled and treated at five academic centers in Canada: the Centre hopitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM; Québec), the London Regional Cancer Program (LRCP; Ontario), the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Québec (CHUQ; Québec), McGill University Health Centre (MUHC; Québec) and Lakeridge Health (Oshawa, Ontario). The research ethics board at each institution approved the conduct of the trial in accordance with current federal regulations, including the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (C.05.001); the US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Part 56); International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practice Guidelines; and the Declaration of Helsinki. Trial monitoring of the conduct of the trial and data management were performed by Ozmosis, Inc. All patients provided written informed consent and were able to withdraw consent at any time without compromising their cancer treatment. Patients were not financially compensated for their participation in this study. The clinical trial and correlative analyses were approved by the CHUM Ethics Review Board and each participating center (ethics number MP-02-2022-10121/21.173). For culturomics analysis, this was conducted under project number 2025-12377 through biobank numbers MP-02-2018-7132/17.035 and 16.161. No prior anti-PD1 treatment with the exception of those who received adjuvant therapy (see point 5) For patients with newly diagnosed advance melanoma who relapsed after adjuvant immunotherapy, patients can be included in this study if they relapsed more than 6 months after their last dose of immunotherapy given in the adjuvant setting. For patients with NSCLC, tumor PD-L1 expression level ≥50% Patients receiving systemic steroids at physiologic doses are permitted to enroll provided the dose does not exceed 10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent. Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential Highly effective contraception (any method above 97% success rate) for both male and female patients throughout the study and for at least 60 days after last treatment administration if the risk of conception exists Pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment Current or recent (in the last 90 days) long-term exposure to high-dose oral or intravenous corticosteroids Patients who require intermittent use of bronchodilators, local steroid injections or short-term corticosteroids for any reason including, but not limited to, brain metastases treatment/prophylaxis are permitted to enroll at the discretion of the sponsor. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency (for example, HIV and transplantation) or receiving systemic steroid therapy (>10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) or any other form of active immunosuppressive therapy Presence of a chronic debilitating intestinal disease (for example, malabsorption and colonic tumor) Probiotics must be discontinued a minimum of 24 hours before FMT administration, and patients are not permitted to take probiotics during the course of immunotherapy treatment. Presence of absolute contraindications to FMT administration Severe dietary allergies (for example, shellfish, nuts and seafood) Expected to require any other form of systemic or localized anti-neoplastic therapy while on study. This time requirement does not apply to patients who underwent successful definitive resection of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer and in situ cancers, including cervical cancer, breast cancer, melanoma or other in situ cancers. Has an uncontrolled autoimmune disease that requires active immunosuppressive agents: Patients with vitiligo, type I diabetes, well-controlled hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto disease or resolved childhood asthma/atopy are not excluded. Has serious concomitant illnesses, such as impaired cardiovascular function or clinically significant cardiovascular disease (uncontrolled congestive heart failure requiring treatment (New York Heart Association grade ≥3), uncontrolled hypertension, acute myocardial cardiac ischemia or unstable angina ≤2 months prior to study entry and severe cardiac arrhythmia) and active inflammatory bowel disorders Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy Patient has received a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of treatment: Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial Patients underwent a standard bowel preparation with 4,000 ml of PEG3350 liquid solution the evening before a single FMT using oral capsules. FMT capsules (now developed as LND-101) are produced using 80−100 g of feces per dose from screened healthy donors under the supervision of the Division of Infectious Diseases at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, Canada. Each dose of capsules contained the feces from a single donor. Major exclusion criteria for healthy donors included any known transmissible pathogen, history of medical illness, any history of major infection, such as COVID-19, monkeypox and hepatitis, and recent travel. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria was previously published23,51. Donor assignment was performed according to donor availability, without particular selection other than the screening requirements. Patients were required to consume 36–40 capsules under supervision and within 2 hours of defrosting the capsules, followed by a 30-minute period of observation. If a patient required antibiotics for an active infection throughout the study protocol, a ‘salvage' FMT was performed within 14 days of the last dose of antibiotics52. Salvage FMT was not performed if the treating investigator deemed that the procedure would interfere with patient safety (that is, antibiotics administered during a severe adverse event (SAE) period). Patients were not required to undergo a second bowel preparation in the event of salvage FMT. In the event of Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis, salvage FMT was not required. Donor screening procedures are listed in Appendix 4 of the protocol and as previously published23. FMT capsules were prepared according to an established protocol as described in our previous study23. In brief, feces donations (80–100 g) were processed separately without pooling by mixing in 0.9% normal saline and glycerol and were filtered using a stomacher bag. The filtrate was centrifuged, and the final sediment was mixed to incorporate residual liquid to allow pipetting into capsules as previously published23. For the NSCLC cohort, patients received pembrolizumab at 2 mg kg−1 every 3 weeks, as per the standard of care. For the melanoma cohort, patients received ipilimumab 3 mgkg−1 intravenously plus nivolumab 1 mg kg−1 intravenously every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by maintenance nivolumab 3 mg kg−1 every 2 weeks or nivolumab 6 mg kg−1 intravenously every 4 weeks. The first cycle of ICI was initiated within 7 days after FMT (Extended Data Fig. Therapy continued at the discretion of the treating oncologist until unacceptable toxicity, completion of 2 years, progression or death. Routine imaging was completed every 3 months for the first 2 years. Acceptable imaging included computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at the discretion of the treating oncologist who was encouraged to use the same modality of imaging throughout whenever possible. The assessment of treatment response was conducted as per RECIST v1.1 (ref. Assessment of treatment response at all other timepoints was done by investigator-assessed RECIST. The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or a partial response and designated as ‘R' for the translational studies. All other patients (the proportion with stable disease or progressive disease as best response), were designated as ‘NR'. At each clinic visit, patient data, to include demographics, clinical and imaging assessments and adverse event recording, were collected per protocol using a secure, password-protected, electronic data capture web-based tool (Medidata Rave Unified Life Science Platform). Patient fecal and blood samples were collected at the following timepoints: before FMT (baseline), the first cycle of ICI therapy (1 week) and the second cycle of ICI therapy (1 month), 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year. A complete clinical assessment was conducted at each visit with routine lab work per standard of care. Patients were permitted to withdraw consent at any time with no impact on treatment, although analysis of previously obtained samples was retained. FMT and ICI-related toxicities were evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) grading scale55. AEs were managed by the treating investigator in accordance with routine clinical practice guidelines. Any patient who experienced an SAE had ICI therapy suspended until resolved or discontinued at the discretion of the treating investigator. All AEs were reviewed by the trial sponsor to ensure consistency in attribution and grading. Best objective response was determined as the best response recorded from the first dose of study treatment until the last tumor assessment prior to initiation of subsequent therapy. Secondary outcomes included DCR, defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete response, partial response or stable disease lasting more than 6 months; ORR in the melanoma cohort; and safety of FMT in combination with ICI. Additional secondary outcomes to be reported subsequently include PFS and OS at 12 months in both the NSCLC and cutaneous melanoma cohorts. Microbiome engraftment was evaluated by acquired donor–host similarity using the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index. Each cohort was analyzed independently, as outlined in the study protocol, given their differing disease biology and treatment context. Sample size was determined as follows: for the NSCLC cohort, assuming that the ORR rate is 39% (null hypothesis)3, a sample size of 18 patients has 80% power to detect an ORR of 64% (alternative hypothesis) using a one-sided binomial test with 0.10 level of significance. The present paper focuses on the NSCLC and cutaneous melanoma cohorts given prespecified primary and secondary endpoints in these groups outlined in the study protocol. Given that the uveal melanoma cohort was explicitly defined to be an exploratory cohort, the uveal melanoma cohort results will be reported separately. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread disruptions to clinical trial operations56,57,58—including delayed site activations and reductions in outpatient oncology services—accrual to the trial was slower than anticipated. The protocol was amended to a total target of 20 patients, enabling evaluation of the primary and key secondary endpoints while maintaining feasibility under pandemic-related constraints. A total of 199 fecal samples collected from 39 patients enrolled underwent whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Stool aliquots were preserved at –80 °C in DNA/RNA Shield Buffer (Zymo Research) until processing. DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep (M) Tagmentation Kit (Illumina), following the manufacturer's instructions, and purified with a 0.7× ratio of Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Sequencing was conducted on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell (Illumina) at the University of Trento's in-house sequencing facility (Trento, Italy). Raw reads were processed through a quality control pipeline available at https://github.com/SegataLab/preprocessing. In brief, reads were filtered out if they had low quality (Q < 20), were shorter than 75 bp or contained two or more ambiguous bases. Host-derived reads (human genome hg19 and Illumina spike-in phiX174) were also removed. On average, each sample yielded approximately 48 million high-quality reads. Five samples failed internal quality control and were excluded from downstream analyses. Taxonomic profiling was carried out using MetaPhlAn 4 (database version vJun23_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202307). Of the 194 samples that passed quality control, 12 were excluded from the downstream analysis: 10 of excluded samples occurred during unscheduled visits, and two excluded samples were collected after salvage FMT. Because the salvage FMT typically involved a different donor, all samples occurring after the patient received salvage FMT were excluded. Microbiome sequencing data were processed and analyzed using the phyloseq package (version 1.50.0). Taxonomic assignments and abundance tables were imported into a phyloseq object, including corresponding sample metadata. α-Diversity analysis was performed using the vegan package (version 2.7.1), calculating richness and Shannon index. Strain sharing between the patients and donors was calculated using StrainPhlAn4 with an in-house database for strain identification as previously published. Bray−Curtis dissimilarity was calculated between the samples and their corresponding donor samples using the ‘distance' function from phyloseq. These distances were then adjusted to their corresponding baseline sample to observe the fold change over time. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) was performed to identify microbial taxa that differentiate between subject groups according to their response, cohort or toxicity development using the package yingtools2 (version 0.0.1.184). Features with LDA scores greater than 2 and P < 0.05 were retained. Taxonomic abundance patterns between groups were visualized via heatmaps generated by the ComplexHeatmap package (version 2.22.0). The analysis was based on differentially abundant taxa between conditions using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Phylogenetic trees were generated for each SGB with StrainPhlAn4. The thresholds on normalized phylogenetic distances to define same-strain pairs were determined for each SGB separately by comparing the distances between pairs of longitudinal samples to the pairs of unrelated samples in the corresponding phylogenetic tree, and their separation was maximized with Youden's index. For all patients with available corresponding donor shotgun metagenomic sequencing data, SGBs in each sample were categorized as follows: ‘Baseline' for the SGBs unique only to the patient at their baseline sample; ‘Donor' for the SGBs present in the sample that matched unique SGBs from the respective donor sample but were not found in the baseline sample; ‘Both' for unique SGBs that were found in both the baseline sample and the matching donor sample; ‘New' for SGBs not present in either the ‘Donor' or the ‘Baseline'; and ‘Lost' when SGBs that were identified at baseline were no longer present in the sample. Shotgun metagenomic samples were also processed with the HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN3) pipeline (version 3.8). Pathways with zero total abundance across all samples were filtered out. Differential abundance analysis between baseline and post-FMT was performed using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0). Filtered high-quality reads were rarefied to 20 million by seqtk and then mapped with an identity threshold of 95% of each catalog using Bowtie (version 2.4.4). First, the uniquely mapped reads (reads mapping to a single gene in the catalog) were attributed to their corresponding genes. Second, shared reads (reads that mapped with the same alignment score to multiple genes) were attributed according to the ratio of their unique mapping counts. For quantification of species, gene abundance was normalized using the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads strategy (normalization by the gene size and the number of total mapped reads reported in frequency), and species abundance was determined from the average abundance of the first 100 core genes of each species provided in the annotation of the each million-gene catalog. Species with fewer than 10 core genes detected were counted with an abundance equal to zero. Species were first categorized for each patient according to their presence status in baseline timepoint of patient and donor, defining the following categories: both, only patient, only donor and new categories. Species never seen at any timepoint were discarded. Species were then grouped by category and filtered for at least 10 observations—for example, seen in one of the categories for at least 10 patients. The curve displaying species retention was obtained as the median of all retention values of the different species in a specific category, with 95% confidence intervals for median. P values were calculated using the Mann−Whitney−Wilcoxon test. From this suspension, seven serial dilutions were prepared, and 50 µl of each dilution was plated onto 5% Columbia agar supplemented with sheep blood (COS; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plates were incubated aerobically and anaerobically in an anaerobic chamber (5% H2, 5% CO2 and 90% N2) at 37 °C for up to 72 hours. Anaerobic conditions were achieved using sealed Zip bags (Becton Dickinson) containing GasPak anaerobic generators (Becton Dickinson). In parallel, enrichment cultures were performed by inoculating 200 µl of stool suspension into BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Aerobic (Becton Dickinson) for aerobic conditions. For anaerobic conditions, BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F (Becton Dickinson) and Yeast Casitone Fatty Acids Broth with Carbohydrates (YCFAC) were used. All broth cultures were supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood and 5% filtered rumen fluid (0.22 µm). After incubation, isolated colonies were subcultured onto fresh COS agar and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 72 hours. Colonies were then purified and subjected to identification. Bacterial identification was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). For each isolate, a double spot was deposited onto a 96-spot MSP target plate, overlaid with 1 µl of a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (prepared in 50% acetonitrile and 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid) and allowed to dry. Spectra were acquired using a MicroFlex LT/SH mass spectrometer (Bruker) and analyzed via FlexControl version 3.4 and MALDI Biotyper Compass version 4 software. Identification was achieved by comparison to the Bruker MBT Compass BDAL reference library and an in-house spectral database. Colonies yielding identification scores higher than 1.9 were considered reliably identified at the species level. Isolates with scores lower than 1.9 were further analyzed by whole-genome sequencing for taxonomic assignment. Bacterial species detected in patient samples at baseline were compared to those identified 1 month after FMT. Due to lack of donor samples available for culturomics, we used the corresponding donor shotgun metagenomics sequencing sample. Engraftment from the donor versus lost from baseline was compared using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test using GraphPad Prism (version 10.4.2) software. Fifty microliters of plasma was mixed with 500 μl of ice-cold extraction solution (methanol:water, 9:1, v/v, at −20 °C) containing isotopically labeled internal standards. The mixture was vortexed for 5 minutes at 2,500 rpm to ensure thorough homogenization and efficient extraction of endogenous metabolites. The resulting supernatants were collected and aliquoted into multiple fractions to be analyzed by different liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC−MS)64. Targeted detection of polyamines and bile acids was performed by LC−MS/MS using a 1290 Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a 6470 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QQQ 6470) (Agilent Technologies). The column was maintained at 40 °C using a Peltier oven. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a binary mobile phase consisting of (A) water with 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% HFBA, both freshly prepared. The initial mobile phase composition was 95% A and 5% B, followed by a linear gradient to 30% B over 7 minutes. The column was washed with 90% B for 2.25 minutes and then re-equilibrated with 5% B for 4 minutes. The mobile phase consisted of (A) water with 0.2% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile:isopropanol (1:1, v/v), both freshly prepared. Initial conditions were 70% A and 30% B, followed by a shift to 38% B over 2 minutes, maintained for an additional 2 minutes. A rapid gradient from 38% to 60% B was applied over 30 seconds. The column was washed with 98% B for 2 minutes and re-equilibrated at 30% B for 1.5 minutes. In addition, pseudo-targeted metabolomic profiling was performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHPLC−HRAM) on a Dionex U3000 UHPLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as previously described65,66. All targeted treated data were merged and cleaned with a dedicated R package (@Github/Kroemerlab/GRMeta). We applied the ComBat function from the sva R package (sva version 3.52.0) to correct for inter-batch effect. The batch correction model included a design matrix preserving the biological signal from key clinical covariates. Clinical features associated with samples included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), tumor type and time of first dose of ICI. Metabolite longitudinal data were analyzed using generalized additive models (GAMs) with the mgcv R package (version 1.9-3) using the ‘gam' function. Each metabolite was fitted with a GAM model that included the two groups (R and NR) present in the study. Before applying any model, data were cleaned by removing individuals with only one timepoint of analysis and duplicated samples. After cleaning the dataset, this metabolite analysis comprised 100 samples from 35 patients, each having at least two timepoints sampled (from two to four). Data normalization was performed before model fitting. Metabolite intensities were transformed using square root normalization with the ‘sqrt' function from R base (version 4.5). Individual GAMs were fitted for each metabolite with the following model structure: In the fitted models, edf values excedeed 1, which is consistent with a nonlinear pattern. Model performance was assessed by calculating root mean squared error to evaluate model accuracy deviance explained and R2 to assess how much the model explained the signal variance, along with residual analysis and concurvity assessment. Temporal evolution was evaluated from the fitted group-specific time smooth across the entire observation window. Reported P values are the significance tests for these time smooths, assessing the null hypothesis of no within-group time effect (flat curve). Temporal evolution was evaluated through model outputs and P value. Between-group differences were calculated using the ‘difference_smooths' function from the gratia package (version 0.10.0) to compute differences between R and NR smooth curves with 95% confidence intervals. Figures displaying temporal evolution were created using smooth estimates calculated with the ‘smooth_estimates' function from the gratia package. All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.5). We used Precision Microbiome Profiling (PMPTM) (Bio-Me), which is a validated qPCR method for analyzing the gut microbiome composition, based on TaqMan technology on the OpenArray format (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Standard curves for the assays were created using reference materials quantified by fluorescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent). Standard curves for each qPCR assay were used to convert the quantification cycle (Cq) value into number of genomic copies per microliter of sample; this number was transformed into normalized absolute quantification. qPCR was performed on 220 samples in total (n = 181 patients and n = 39 donors), and only patient samples with corresponding SGB category information were included in the final analysis (n = 104 samples). Quantitative PCR and metagenomics relative abundance were visualized using the ComplexHeatmap package in R, and a Kendall score Kendall's τ was computed using the ‘cor.test' function in the ‘stat' package using pairwise complete observations. Spearman′s r correlations were performed using GraphPad Prism. Multiplex high-throughput proteomics was performed using the Immuno-Oncology Panel (Olink) and analyzed per the manufacturer's instructions. All Olink data are reported as linearized normalized protein expression (NPX), per the manufacturer's instructions. For volcano plots, Benjamini−Hochberg-corrected P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to assess the relative abundance of total bacterial DNA in stool samples by targeting the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene. For each reaction, 400 ng of extracted DNA was combined with 500 nM of each primer and 1× qPCRBIO SyGreen Blue Mix Hi-ROX (PCR Biosystems). Amplification was carried out using a real-time PCR system, and threshold cycle (Ct) values were obtained. Bacterial load was estimated by comparing sample Ct values to a standard curve generated using serial dilutions of Escherichia coli genomic DNA, allowing for the approximation of bacterial DNA concentration in ng μl−1. Non-parametric Mann−Whitney−Wilcoxon test to compare SGB loss groups and two-way ANOVA were performed in GraphPad Prism. Aliquots of cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), each containing 5 × 106 cells preserved in fetal calf serum (FCS) with DMSO, were quickly thawed, gently washed and resuspended in FACS buffer consisting of 1× PBS supplemented with 5% FCS and 2 mM EDTA. To exclude non-viable cells, samples were incubated with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Surface staining was performed using fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies sourced from BD Biosciences, R&D Systems, MBL, BioLegend, Miltenyi Biotec and Cytek (see reagent list for detailed panel composition; Supplementary Table 3). Data were acquired with a Cytek Aurora 5-laser spectral analyzer, and data analysis was performed using FlowJo version 10.8.1 software. Flow cytometry analysis of PBMCs followed a sequential gating strategy that excluded debris, cell doublets and non-viable cells, ultimately selecting for viable CD45+ immune cells. The resulting CD45+ live-cell populations were exported as new .fcs files using FlowJo version 10.8.1, and these curated datasets served as input for UMAP and Single-cell Cytometry Annotation Network (Scyan) analyses. Cell type annotations were automatically performed using Scyan69 a biology-driven model that leverages prior knowledge of cell types. The percentages of all subpopulations were then determined through manual gating using FlowJo version 10.8.1. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee at the Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM) and carried out in compliance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines (ethical protocol C22017Br). Murine experiments were conducted using 7-week-old female wild-type C57BL/6 SPF-reared mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Mice received 3 days of antibiotics solution containing ampicillin (1 mg ml−1), streptomycin (5 mg ml−1) and colistin (1 mg ml−1) (Sigma-Aldrich), which was added to the sterile drinking water of mice before FMT. FMT was performed by thawing fecal material, and 200 µl of the suspension (100 mg ml−1) was then transferred by oral gavage. An additional 100 µl was applied on the fur of each animal. Two weeks after the first FMT, mice were implanted subcutaneously with 0.8 × 106 MCA-205 cells. When tumors reached 25−35 mm2 in size or 35−45 mm2 in size for anti-PD-1 monotherapy and anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 experiments, respectively, mice were treated four times intraperitoneally every 3 days with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (250 μg per mouse; Bio X Cell, clone RMP1-14) or anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody plus anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (100 µg per mouse; Bio X Cell, clone 9D9). Additionally, the mice received a 200-µl gavage of NaCl or bacterial cocktail group starting 3 days after the tumor implantation and at each treatment. Tumor sizes were measured with manual calipers. Experimental groups were compared using the Mann−Whitney−Wilcoxon test in GraphPad Prism. For murine experiments, bacterial cocktails were prepared as follows. Bacterial strains used in the murine experiments were isolated from patients at baseline enrolled in the FMT-LUMINate clinical trial and stored at –80 °C. Bacteria were cultured from frozen stocks on fastidious anaerobe agar plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PB0225A) for 48 hours at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. Prior to cocktail formulation, the identity of each isolate was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. After identification, bacterial colonies were collected, resuspended in sterile NaCl and adjusted to an optical density of 1.0, corresponding to approximately 1 × 109 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter. MCA-205 fibrosarcoma cells, class I MHC H-2b syngeneic cell lines for C57BL/6 mice, were used for this study and obtained from Jonathan Stagg's laboratory. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 UI ml−1 penicillin−streptomycin. All statistical analysis and visualization were done in R or GraphPad Prism (version 10.4.2).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A comprehensive review finds that tea, especially green tea, is strongly associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), obesity, diabetes, and several forms of cancer. At the same time, the review highlights important concerns related to certain modern tea products, particularly bottled and bubble teas, which may include artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and other additives. Tea is produced from the leaves of Camellia sinensis and has been consumed worldwide for centuries. It was first used mainly for medicinal purposes before becoming a widely enjoyed daily drink. Researchers have long been interested in tea because it contains high levels of polyphenols, especially catechins, which are believed to play a key role in its health effects. While green tea has been studied extensively, much less is known about the health effects of other varieties, including black, oolong, and white tea, particularly when comparing their benefits. The review also considers potential risks tied to additives and contaminants found in some commercially produced tea beverages. The authors emphasize that additional research is needed to more clearly define both the benefits and possible risks of tea consumption across different populations and tea types. Studies show it can help lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol levels. Tea may also play a role in weight management and diabetes control. Evidence indicates that green tea catechins can support weight loss and improve metabolic markers in individuals with obesity. Tea consumption is also associated with benefits beyond heart and metabolic health. Research suggests that regular tea drinkers, particularly older adults, show lower rates of cognitive decline and fewer biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's disease. This effect could support better muscle strength, physical function, and overall performance in seniors. The authors also note concerns about pesticide residues, heavy metals, and microplastics found in tea. While these contaminants are not considered a significant risk for most people at typical intake levels, they may be more relevant for individuals who consume large amounts of tea over long periods. The review also discusses how tea can interfere with the absorption of certain nutrients, including non-heme iron and calcium, which may be important for people following vegetarian diets or those with specific nutritional requirements. Overall, the review concludes that tea provides clear health benefits, especially when consumed in its traditional, freshly brewed form. They also note that future studies examining long-term consumption, differences among tea varieties, and the impact of contaminants will be essential for refining guidance on tea's health effects.
