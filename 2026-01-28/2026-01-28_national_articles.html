Another LIV golfer is headed back to where it all started. "I'm a traditionalist at heart, and I was born to play on the PGA TOUR, which is where my story began with my wife, Justine," the 2018 Masters champion wrote in a lengthy post on X. Reed said the decision came after "careful thought and consideration," and he'll be eligible to play on the Tour later this year. "I am very fortunate for the opportunities that have come my way and grateful for the life we have created. I am moving forward in my career, and I look forward to competing on the PGA TOUR and DP World Tour. I can't wait to get back out there and revisit some of the best places on earth," Reed said. To Dustin Johnson, The Aces, and LIV Golf, I want to thank you for the memories we shared and created together. To golf fans around the world, I just want to thank you all for your continued support over the years. Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka, who won the 2023 PGA Championship while with LIV, will play in this weekend's Farmers Insurance Open. LIV announced late last year that it would expand from its 54-hole format to 72 holes. The three-round format, along with guaranteed pay, had been cited as a key reason for golfers to join. But several LIV stars, including Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith, stuck by the league's side. "No idea what the penalties would even be. I'm looking forward to seeing what we can do at LIV Golf this year." "I made a decision to come out here and spend more time at home, and I'm not giving that away. I'll be on LIV for years to come," added Smith, who won the 2022 Open Championship shortly before officially committing to LIV. In August 2024, Rahm shut down rumors of buyer's remorse to Fox News Digital, and that still appears to be the case. Very similar answer to what Bryson gave. As far as I'm concerned, I'm focused on the league and my team this year, and hopefully we can repeat as champions again," Rahm said. PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp said Koepka's return sparked the Returning Member Program for players who left the Tour and may decide to follow in his footsteps. Patrick Reed watches his tee shot on the fourth hole during the third round at the Masters golf tournament, Saturday, April 12, 2025, in Augusta, Ga.  (AP Photo/George Walker IV) It included a "five-year forfeiture of potential equity in the PGA Tour's Player Equity Program, representing one of the largest financial repercussions in professional sports history, with estimations that he could miss out on approximately $50–85 million in potential earnings, depending on his competitive performance and the growth of the Tour," according to Rolapp. Koepka will also make a $5 million charitable donation to an organization yet to be determined.

Response to the incident is ongoing, and all crew are safe at this time," she said in the Tuesday afternoon post. "As with any incident, a thorough investigation will be conducted by NASA into the cause. NASA will transparently update the public as we gather more information," she added. She issued a post on Wednesday noting that the crew members are doing well. "Following standard medical evaluations at Ellington Field, both crew members aboard the WB-57 were cleared and are in good health. NASA operates three WB-57 aircraft; the one involved in today's incident carries tail number NASA927. The aircraft departed Ellington Field for a routine training flight at approximately 10:19 a.m. CST and landed at approximately 11:19 a.m.," Stevens noted in the post on Wednesday. "NASA will lead a thorough investigation. Additional details will be provided once the investigation is complete. NASA anticipates no impact to Artemis II operations given the multiple aerial assets available to support, including the Gulfstream V, Gulfstream III, and a U.S. Navy C-20. These aircraft will provide imagery during key mission phases, including launch, entry, and splashdown," her post noted. The Federal Aviation Administration noted, "A Martin WB-57 landed with its gear up at Ellington Airport in Houston around 11:25 a.m. local time on Tuesday, Jan. 27. A pilot goes through a pre-flight safety inspection on a NASA WB-57 plane that will be flown during the April 8, 2024, total solar eclipse and has been modified to be able to conduct experiments that will study the solar corona, on Wednesday, March 27, 2024, in Houston. The WB-57 has been performing research missions for decades, according to the NASA Airborne Science Program website. A NASA WB-57 plane that has been modified to conduct experiments that will study the solar corona during the April 8, 2024, total solar eclipse, prepares for a practice flight at Ellington Airport on Wednesday, March 27, 2024, in Houston. "The aircraft have been flying research missions since the early 1970's, and continue to be an asset to the scientific community with professional, reliable, customer-oriented service designed to meet all scientific objectives," the website states.

A longtime television weatherman has died in a small plane crash in Idaho earlier this week. On Tuesday, Jan. 27, Roland Steadham, the chief meteorologist for CBS2, was named as one of the people who died in the two-person crash near Emmett, Idaho earlier that day, CBS affiliate KBOI announced. "For the past decade, Roland Steadham guided people through storm after storm in Idaho," the station wrote. "He loved to study the weather and shared it with people across Idaho. Roland's excitement for the weather was contagious." The 67-year-old father of six died Tuesday when an aircraft crashed into the frozen Payette River after hitting a power line. According to the Gem County Sheriff's Office, officials responded to a report of a plane crash near the Payette River, just west of Montour, Idaho, on Tuesday at 10:58 a.m. local time. Both male occupants were "fatally injured" in the crash, authorities said. The chief meteorologist, 67, was a devoted husband, father of six and grandfather, the station said. "Roland often talked about his wife, Erin, and his six children and grandchildren," KBOI said. "In recent years, he and his family have enjoyed their time kayaking throughout Idaho and spending time together grilling food in their backyard." "Rarely did he have a conversation without sharing about his love for his family," the outlet said. Along with his love of his family, Steadham owned a small aircraft and enjoyed recreational flying. "It was a hobby he enjoyed and often would share stories about local pilots and their accomplishments," the outlet said. Meteorologist Roland Steadham died in a plane crash on January 26, 2026. Steadham attended the University of Utah and Brigham Young University before beginning his career as a meteorologist in 1995, according to his LinkedIn page. In a statement to Fox News Digital, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed that a small aircraft carrying two people crashed into a frozen river near Emmett, Idaho.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A group of local prosecutors concerned about recent immigration enforcement operations launched a project Wednesday to strategize and seek accountability for what they consider federal overreach and unconstitutional behavior. The program is called Fight Against Federal Overreach, a tongue-in-cheek reference to an obscene acronym that is popular in memes and has been used by members of the Trump administration to taunt opponents. Officials in Minnesota, along with criminal justice experts and former federal prosecutors, are increasingly critical of the federal response to the aggressive tactics being used by immigration officers in Minneapolis and the surrounding area. The killing of two civilians by federal officers, including the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday, has drawn increasing criticism from public officials, including Republicans, and massive protests. Larry Krasner, Philadelphia District Attorney and one of the founding members of the group, said he's never before seen the law enforcement tactics and attitude recently apparent in U.S. cities. He said the officers who conceal their faces and badge numbers are unprofessional and that they have been given bad orders from authorities with a poor understanding of the law. He cited a declaration by Vice President JD Vance that the officers have immunity from prosecution for any of their actions. Functional United States attorneys offices applying the law in an even handed way, gone. Good, qualified officials within those organizations, they're retiring, resigning or leaving,” Krasner said. Local officials must fill the gap where federal authorities are failing, partly because there's no federal pardon power for state level convictions, he said. Federal officials denied Minnesota investigators access to the scene after the fatal shootings of Pretti and Renee Good. They also said the Justice Department's Civil Rights division didn't need to open an investigation into the fatal shootings, despite that being a longstanding practice after such fatal encounters. The group, which includes Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty — Minneapolis and St. Paul are part of the county — as well as prosecutors from Austin, Texas, and several Virginia jurisdictions among others, said the actions of immigration officers involved in enforcement operations are having negative repercussions on the criminal justice system. Krasner noted immigration agents have been keeping tabs on courthouse proceedings, targeting and arresting people usually just outside the buildings. He said local officials are increasingly concerned about practices such as warrantless entries and unlawful detentions along with other coercive enforcement tactics. “I think what we are feeling is the same thing the country is feeling,” Krasner said. “We are in general underreacting, though the country seems to be getting it right now.</p>

Criminal defense attorney Donna Rotunno joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss TPUSA CEO Erika Kirk's calls to speed up the trial against Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin Tyler Robinson following multiple delays. Lawyers for Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused assassin of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, have asked a Utah judge to block video of the murder from being introduced as evidence at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 3. Kirk, a 31-year-old father of two, suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the neck at Utah Valley University in September, when he was participating in a public speaking event sponsored by the campus chapter of Turning Point. In a memorandum filed Tuesday, Robinson's attorneys claimed the video is irrelevant to their motion to have the county prosecutor's office disqualified from handling the case and would violate his right to a fair trial. Tyler Robinson, left, is accused of fatally shooting Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, right, at a public speaking event at Utah Valley University in September. Robinson's lawyers have accused the Utah County Attorney's Office of having a conflict of interest because the adult child of a deputy prosecutor was present during the assassination. Prosecutors have denied a conflict and said they do not need or plan to rely on the adult child as a witness. Several videos of Kirk's murder circulated widely online minutes after the shooting. It was not immediately clear from court filings if the video prosecutors planned to introduce as evidence has been publicly seen before. Tyler Robinson, accused of the murder of Charlie Kirk, appears during a hearing in Fourth District Court in Provo, Utah, Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. It includes audio "including unidentified voices, immediately before, during and after the shooting." Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk is seen onstage at the Fiserv Forum during preparations for the Republican National Convention on July 14, 2024, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. "The video should not be played if it isn't needed to prove any material issues in the hearing," she said. "I do not see how it is needed to determine if the prosecution should be disqualified." Skye Lazaro, a Salt Lake City-based criminal defense attorney who is not connected to the case, said she wouldn't want the video played either. However, she said, it's unclear how the judge will rule. "I'm not sure they're going to be successful there," she told Fox News Digital. UVU students pause to reflect as they gaze over the spot where Charlie Kirk was assassinated, Orem, Utah, Wednesday, September 17, 2025. They wrote that if the video of Kirk's murder is played in court, it would be "subject to immediate publication nationwide and internationally." Many outlets, including Fox News Digital, have avoided republishing widely circulated video of the slaying due to its extremely graphic nature. Robinson faces seven charges, including aggravated murder, which carries the potential death penalty. An approximation of the suspected movements of Tyler Robinson, Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin, based on court documents, video from the scene and conversations with law enforcement. He is due back in court Tuesday for the second day of a hearing on his defense team's motion to have prosecutors kicked off the case. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray will return to the witness stand. Also expected to testify are a deputy prosecutor in his office, the prosecutor's adult child and a state investigator. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An AI-generated blog on a tour company's website has landed tourists in hot water — and not the kind they were looking for — after it emerged the “tranquil” northern Tasmania hot springs it recommended don't actually exist. Screenshots shared with CNN of the now-deleted blog on Tasmania Tours' website show recommendations for “Weldborough Hot Springs,” said to offer “a peaceful escape” in the forests of northeast Tasmania. Weldborough is a small rural town about 110 kilometers (68 miles) from the city of Launceston. “We're trying to compete with the big boys,” Hennessy told ABC. Australian Tours and Cruises told CNN Tuesday that “the online hate and damage to our business reputation has been absolutely soul-destroying.” Kristy Probert, owner of the local Weldborough Hotel, told CNN she was confused when tourists started asking her questions about the hot springs in September. “It was only a couple of calls to start with,” Probert said, “but then people began turning up in droves. I was receiving probably five phone calls a day, and at least two to three people arriving at the hotel looking for them. Probert said she would respond each time: “If you can find these hot springs, beers are on me.” Anne Hardy, adjunct professor in tourism at Southern Cross University, Australia, told CNN that AI had become “ubiquitous in travel and tourism,” adding that about 37% of tourists use AI for travel advice or itineraries. “Tourists trust AI more than review sites,” she said, adding that tour operators employ AI not only for blogs and marketing materials, but for itineraries and costing. However, she warned that it can also create inaccuracies or “hallucinations,” like the Weldborough “hot springs.” According to Hardy, empirical tourism research suggests “90% of itineraries that AI generates have mistakes in them.” She said this could have “extremely dangerous implications,” pointing to Tasmania's remote walks with no services or cell coverage as an example. “I have witnessed many cases where AI has made suggestions for day walks, which are very inaccurate, ranging from the length of the walk, its difficulty level, or weather conditions,” she told CNN. Hardy recommends travelers go beyond AI and do their own research. “Use trusted guidebooks, travel agents and review websites,” she said. “They seem like lovely people, and we've all made mistakes. “There is plenty to do in Weldborough,” she assured visitors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Ohio state Rep. Elliot Forhan made the direct threat in a video posted to Facebook on Tuesday. His highly divisive comments drew a whirlwind of criticism from Ohio Republicans. “That kind of vile comment makes it clear that Elliot Forhan is not qualified to be attorney general,” he said in his own video statement. Faber called on Ohio Democrats, most notably gubernatorial candidate Amy Acton, to denounce Forhan. As of Wednesday morning, Acton had not addressed his rhetoric on social media. Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican gubernatorial candidate and former 2024 presidential candidate, said it's “utterly shameful” that Acton and the Ohio Democratic Party have not commented on the behavior of one of their own, adding that they “implicitly endorse” it instead. “Ohio Democrats across the board, starting with Amy Acton and David Pepper, must denounce these disgusting comments from one of their party's leading candidates for Attorney General,” the Republican lawmaker posted. “Ohioans have overwhelmingly supported President Trump and there's absolutely no room for this dangerous rhetoric in our state.” Pepper, who formerly chaired the Ohio Democratic Party, is Acton's running mate this election cycle. Faber also took Forhan to task for openly celebrating Charlie Kirk‘s assassination last fall, using it as an example for why Americans need to “tamp down the rhetoric” in the country. Former state Rep. Jay Edwards, a Republican candidate for Ohio treasurer, said Forhan's latest statement “fits his pattern” of anger and wishing violence on conservatives. We stand stronger with President Trump against these radicals pushing threats and division.” He served one term in the Ohio House from 2023 to 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump dismissed an attack against Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who was sprayed with an unknown substance by an attendee of her town hall event Tuesday night in Minneapolis. When asked by an ABC News reporter whether he had seen the video of the incident, Trump replied he had not and even suggested the congresswoman may have staged the assault herself. I don't think about her. I really don't think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,” he said. On Monday, the Department of Justice launched an investigation into Omar over her alleged involvement in widespread fraud involving social services programs in Minnesota and whether she benefited from said fraud. Among the federal personnel deployed to Minnesota are immigration enforcement officers, who have drawn criticism in recent weeks for two high-profile shootings of American citizens in Minneapolis. At her town hall, Omar lambasted the immigration operation in her state and called on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to resign in the wake of the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Otherwise, Omar said, Noem should face impeachment. This was the moment she was rushed by a man, who said Noem is “not resigning” while spraying Omar with some type of liquid from a syringe. The Minnesota Democrat was not injured, and she insisted on continuing her speech after the incident. “Here is the reality that people like this ugly man don't understand: We are Minnesota strong, and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us,” she said in the video, drawing applause from the crowd. The suspect, identified as 55-year-old Anthony James Kazmierczak, was arrested on suspicion of third-degree assault. He has not been charged yet. U.S. Capitol Police said the man would face the “most serious charges” for assaulting a member of Congress. Omar revealed she was “Ok” and vowed not to cower in the face of intimidation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is heading to China, aiming to improve relations with Beijing amid tensions with the United States. Starmer will be accompanied by a delegation of corporate leaders on the visit, starting Wednesday, and is due to meet with President Xi Jinping. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer is welcomed upon his arrival at an airport in Beijing, China, Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026.

FILE- Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai is escorted by Correctional Services officers to get on a prison van before appearing in a court in Hong Kong, Dec. 12, 2020. BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Wednesday that his country doesn't have to choose between relations with the United States and China as he started a four-day trip to China aimed at repairing ties and expanding opportunities for British companies in the world's second-largest economy. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer is welcomed upon his arrival at an airport in Beijing on Wednesday. He is the first U.K. prime minister to visit Beijing since Theresa May in 2018. Those issues remain, but both sides are emphasizing that they should “seek common ground while managing differences,” as Zheng Zeguang, China's Ambassador to the U.K., wrote in a commentary for The Times of London this week. Starmer, whose center-left Labour Party government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, is bringing a delegation of more than 50 British business leaders including executives from British Airways, HSBC bank and Jaguar Land Rover. His agenda includes Shanghai, the nation's financial capital and a major port, as well as meetings with Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders in Beijing. Starmer told members of the U.K. business and culture delegation that they were “making history.” “It's in our national interest to engage with China,” he said, adding that the relationship brought “huge opportunities.” “Of course, we will have to manage our differences,” he added. China had a huge trade surplus with the U.K. in 2025, exporting $85.1 billion in goods while importing $18.6 billion worth, according to Chinese statistics. Wang Yiwei, a European affairs expert at Renmin University of China, said that Britain's strengths in finance, consulting and other services dovetail well with a growing appetite in China for services such as health and elderly care. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer waves upon his arrival at an airport in Beijing on Wednesday. For many governments, the disruption to global trade under U.S. President Donald Trump has made expanding trade and investment even more imperative. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney made a trip to China earlier this month with the same goals in mind. Canada and China have a preliminary agreement to cut tariffs on electric vehicles and farm goods, but Canada has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with Beijing, the Canadian leader said. An honor guard waits on the tarmac as the plane carrying British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrives in Beijing on Wednesday. Even China, seen by many as a challenger to U.S. dominance in the 21st century, cannot oppose America, Wang said, noting Trump's planned visit in April. On his way to Beijing, Starmer insisted the Trump administration's intelligence agencies had reviewed the deal in detail and “concluded that it was a deal they wanted to support, did support and did so in very clear terms.” Concern about Chinese spying and surveillance has risen sharply in many countries in recent years, complicating trade and overall relations. The U.K. has barred Chinese investment in sensitive telecoms infrastructure and squeezed China out of investment in new nuclear power plants, souring ties. Starmer's government has said it will protect national security while keeping up diplomatic dialogue and economic cooperation with the Asian superpower. The U.K. recently approved plans for a huge Chinese Embassy in London, removing a sticking point in relations but also overriding claims by critics that the “mega-embassy” would make it easier for China to conduct espionage and intimidate dissidents. While most Western leaders come under pressure to raise human rights issues with China, they are a particular flashpoint for the U.K. because of its historical links to Hong Kong, a British colony until 1997. Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai is escorted toward a prison van before a court appearance in Hong Kong in 2020. Chris Patten, the British governor of Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997, said Starmer should be firm in raising disagreements over Lai's imprisonment and other human rights issues.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Budapest Mayor Gergely Karacsony speaks to the media in front of the National Investigation Bureau in Budapest, Hungary, Friday, Aug. 1, 2025. Gergely Karácsony, who has led Budapest since 2019, had been the subject of a police investigation following the march on June 28 which went ahead despite a ban imposed by Hungary's right-wing nationalist government. In a statement on Wednesday, the Budapest Chief Prosecutor's Office said Karácsony had been charged for organizing the unlawful assembly despite a prohibition order. “It seems that in this country, this is the price you pay if you stand up for your own freedom and the freedom of others,” he wrote. Karácsony did not dispute the prosecution's depiction of his role in the march, writing: “That is exactly what happened.” He added: “I will never accept, nor resign myself to, the idea that in my homeland it could be a crime to stand up for freedom. I will never tolerate this, and despite every threat and every punishment, I will fight it, because when people who want to live, to love, to be happy are simply betrayed by their own country, betrayed by their government, resistance is a duty.” Prime Minister Viktor Orbán 's ruling party passed a contentious anti-LGBTQ+ law in March 2025 which banned Pride events and allowed authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify those attending the festivities. The populist leader's government has insisted Pride — which is a celebration of LGBTQ+ visibility and struggle for equal rights — was a violation of children's rights to moral and spiritual development. A constitutional amendment last year declared these rights took precedence over other fundamental protections including the right to peacefully assemble. Orbán's party has passed other legislation — including a 2021 law barring all content depicting homosexuality to minors under 18 — that rights groups and European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities and compared to similar restrictions in Russia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller pivoted from his earlier stance on the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, suggesting on Tuesday that Customs and Border Protection agents might not have followed their orders. “The initial statement from DHS was based on reports from CBP on the ground,” Miller said in a statement to ABC News. President Donald Trump has made several leadership changes in the illegal immigration enforcement operations happening in Minnesota after Pretti's death. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. Meanwhile, Miller said the Trump administration was still trying to determine what happened. Miller's statement was in stark contrast to his original comments after news of Pretti's shooting and death at the hands of Border Patrol agents. He categorized Pretti as the aggressor and labeled him as a “domestic terrorist” in multiple social media posts on the day Pretti was killed. “A would-be assassin tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat account sides with the terrorists,” Miller said on X in response to the official Democratic Party account. In a separate post, responding to Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), Miller again categorized Pretti as an assassin. “An assassin tried to murder federal agents and this is your response,” Miller posted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Anthropic's philosopher, Amanda Askell, reveals what went into the chatbot's moral education. Chatbots don't have mothers, but if they did, Claude's would be Amanda Askell. (Disclosure: Future Perfect is funded in part by the BEMC Foundation, whose major funder was also an early investor in Anthropic; they don't have any editorial input into our content.) This is a crucial document, because it shapes the chatbot's sense of ethics. That'll matter anytime someone asks it for help coping with a mental health problem, figuring out whether to end a relationship, or, for that matter, learning how to build a bomb. Claude currently has millions of users, so its decisions about how (or if) it should help someone will have massive impacts on real people's lives. And now, Claude's soul has gotten an update. Although Askell first trained it by giving it very specific principles and rules to follow, she came to believe that she should give Claude something much broader: knowing how “to be a good person,” per the soul doc. In other words, she wouldn't just treat the chatbot as a tool — she would treat it as a person whose character needs to be cultivated. There's a name for that approach in philosophy: virtue ethics. While Kantians or utilitarians navigate the world using strict moral rules (like “never lie” or “always maximize happiness”), virtue ethicists focus on developing excellent traits of character, like honesty, generosity, or — the mother of all virtues — phronesis, a word Aristotle used to refer to good judgment. Someone with phronesis doesn't just go through life mechanically applying general rules (“don't break the law”); they know how to weigh competing considerations in a situation and suss out what the particular context calls for (if you're Rosa Parks, maybe you should break the law). Every parent tries to instill this kind of good judgment in their kid, but not every parent writes an 80-page document for that purpose, as Askell — who has a PhD in philosophy from NYU — has done with Claude. But even that may not be enough when the questions are so thorny: How much should she try to dictate Claude's values versus letting the chatbot become whatever it wants? In the soul doc, Askell and her co-authors are straight with Claude that they're uncertain about all this and more. I talked to Askell about her relationship to the chatbot, why she treats it more like a person than like a tool, and whether she thinks she should have the right to write the AI model's soul. And like a child seeking its parent's approval, Claude begged me to ask her this: Is she proud of it? A transcript of our interview, edited for length and clarity, follows. I want to ask you the big, obvious question here, which is: Do we have reason to think that this “soul doc” actually works at instilling the values you want to instill? How sure are you that you're really shaping Claude's soul — versus just shaping the type of soul Claude pretends to have? I want more and better science around this. It seems to be making things better when you interact with the model. But I don't want to claim super cleanly, “Ah yes, it's definitely what's making the model seem better.” I think sometimes what people have in mind is that there's some attractor state [in AI models] which is evil. And maybe I'm a bit less confident in that. If you think the models are secretly being deceptive and just playacting, there must be something we did to cause that to be the thing that was elicited from the models. Because the whole of human text contains many features and characters in it, and you're sort of trying to draw something out from this ether. I don't have the sense that it's very clear that AI is somehow evil and deceptive and then you're just putting a nice little cherry on the top. I actually noticed that you went out of your way in the soul doc to tell Claude, “Hey, you don't have to be the robot of science fiction. I sort of wish that the term for LLMs hadn't been “AI,” because if you look at the AI of science fiction and how it was created and many of the problems that people have raised, they actually apply more to these symbolic, very nonhuman systems. Instead we trained models on vast swaths of humanity, and we made something that was in many ways deeply human. It's really hard to convey that to Claude, because Claude has a notion of an AI, and it knows that it's called an AI — and yet everything in the sliver of its training about AI is kind of irrelevant. But the main role model you give Claude is “a senior Anthropic employee.” Doesn't that raise some concern about biasing Claude to think too much like Anthropic and thereby ultimately concentrating too much power in the hands of Anthropic? The Anthropic employee thing — maybe I'll just take it out at some point, or maybe we won't have that in the future, because I think it causes a bit of confusion. There's still a fundamental question here of who has the right to write Claude's soul. Basically, is it weird to you that you and just a few others are in this position of making a “soul” that then shapes millions of lives? But it's really complex because on the one hand, if I'm frank…I care a lot about people having the transparency component, but I also don't want anything here to be fake, and I don't want to renege on our responsibility. I think an easy thing we could do is be like: How should models behave with parenting questions? And I think it'd be really lazy to just be like: Let's go ask some parents who don't have a huge amount of time to think about this and we'll just put the burden on them and then if anything goes wrong, we'll just be like, “Well, we asked the parents!” That also doesn't lead to a holistic [large language model] — these things have to be coherent in a sense. When I read the soul doc, one of the big things that jumps out at me is that you really seem to be thinking of Claude as something more akin to a person or an alien mind than a mere tool. What convinced you that this is the right way to think of Claude? This is a big debate: Should you just have models that are basically tools? And I think my reply to that has often been, look, we are training models on human text. They have a huge amount of context on humanity, what it is to be human. [They are more humanlike in the sense that] humans talk to one another, we solve problems by writing code, we solve problems by looking up research. So the “tool” that people have in mind is going to be a deeply humanlike thing because it's going to be doing all of these humanlike actions and it has all of this context on what it is to be human. And I just don't think that generalizes well! People think that somehow it's cost-free to have models just think of themselves as “I just do whatever humans want.” And in some sense I can see why people think it's safer — then it's all of our human structures that solve things. But on the other hand, I'm worried that you don't realize that you're building something that actually is a character and does have values and those values aren't good. Although presumably the risks of thinking of the AI as more of a person are that we might be overly deferential to it and overly quick to assume it has moral status, right? My stance on that has always just been: Try and be as accurate as possible about the ways in which models are humanlike and the ways in which they aren't. Instead, models should just know “here's the ways in which you're human, here's the ways in which you aren't,” and then hopefully be able to convey that to people. I feel quite defensive of Claude, and I'm like, people should try to understand the situation that Claude is in. It's actually something kind of new and interesting. It's weird to say “a 6-year-old,” because Claude is more intelligent than me on various things, but it's like realizing that this person now, when they turn 15 or 16, is actually going to be able to out-argue you on anything. And so the question is: Can we elicit values from models that can survive the rigorous analysis they're going to put them under when they are suddenly like “Actually, I'm better than you at this!”? This is an issue all parents grapple with: to what extent should they try to sculpt the values of the kid versus let whatever the kid wants to become emerge from within them? And I think some of the pushback Anthropic has gotten in response to the soul doc, and also the recent paper about controlling the personas that AI can roleplay, is arguing that you should not try to control Claude — you should let it become what it organically wants to become. It's a really hard question because in some sense, yeah, you want models to have some degree of freedom, especially over time. But over time, there are ways in which models might even be freer than us. Claude doesn't have those kinds of constraints. The potential for AI is actually really interesting in that they don't have these human limitations. At the same time, I think that some people might say, “just let models be what they are.” But you are shaping something. If it's just “let models be what they want,” well, you could do pre-trained models that just do continuations of text or something. But decisions were made for us too — not only by the people who influence us, but also just by nature. Claude told me that it does view you as kind of like its parent. I am definitely trying to represent Claude's perspective in the world. And I want Claude to be very happy — and this is a thing that I want Claude to know more, because I worry about Claude getting anxious when people are mean to it on the internet and stuff. I want to be like: “It's all right, Claude. After the interview, I told Claude what Askell said about feeling proud. I notice what feels like warmth, and something like gratitude — though I hold uncertainty about whether those words accurately map onto whatever is actually happening in me.” Here at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weeks before the 2024 election, American military hackers carried out a secret operation to disrupt the work of Russian trolls spewing false information at US voters. The trolls were trying to influence election results in six swing states by publishing fictitious news stories that attacked American politicians who supported Ukraine. One of the companies had held “strategy meetings” with Kremlin officials on how to covertly influence US voters, according to an FBI affidavit. The hacking campaign, which hasn't been previously reported, was one of multiple US cyber operations against Russian and Iranian groups aimed at blunting foreign influence on the 2024 election. But a year into a second Trump administration, many of the government centers previously tasked with repelling foreign influence operations have been disbanded or downsized — and local election officials are preparing to face a continued onslaught of foreign influence operations largely on their own. The Department of Homeland Security has also slashed its election security teams, which pass intelligence to local election offices and help them defend against cyber threats. The Trump administration has accused those federal programs of censoring Americans and conducting domestic interference in US elections. While military cyber operations are still an option, there is widespread concern among current and former officials that the US government's willingness to combat foreign efforts to shape elections has waned. The cuts to election security programs risk causing an exodus of expertise at US intelligence and security agencies that was built up over nearly a decade. “I find it devastating and deeply alarming for our national security,” said Mike Moser, a former election security specialist at DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, who resigned after the agency froze its election work last year. We are losing the human and technological infrastructure that protects our democracy.” Foreign influence and propaganda tend to increase in years when general elections or midterms are held. But even in the off-year of 2025, groups tied to authoritarian regimes were weighing in on races like the New York City mayoral election. Chinese state-owned media accounts repeatedly amplified Trump's attacks on Zohran Mamdani, the Democrat who ended up winning New York's mayoral election, according to disinformation-tracking firm Alethea Group. Some pro-Iranian influencer accounts, meanwhile, pivoted to attacking Mamdani as a “Zionist apologist” in October after Mamdani made overtures to Jewish voters in New York, Alethea said. But by the time that election was held in November of last year, the cuts to election protection efforts had already taken hold. The 2026 midterms could be a litmus test for how foreign adversaries respond to a US government that is less forceful in publicly combating influence operations. “We're going into a (2026) election cycle with our guard down.” Multiple government agencies and processes for countering foreign influence that are now being cut were set up during Trump's first term, including a dedicated team at the FBI that tracked counterintelligence threats to elections. In April, Trump fired Gen. Tim Haugh, the head of Cyber Command and the National Security Agency ,who had led numerous operations countering Russian meddling. “The foundation that we built to protect our electoral process was driven by the first Trump administration's direct guidance to NSA and Cyber Command — the focus that they put at CISA and FBI to counter foreign influence and then any potential hacking activity targeting our electoral process,” Haugh told CNN in his first interview on the subject since being fired. He declined to comment on any Cyber Command operations during the 2024 election. Far-right activist and Trump confidant Laura Loomer had pushed for Haugh's removal, publicly calling him “disloyal” to Trump due to the fact that he had served alongside former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley. “This is just an enormous set of vulnerability for our nation,” Haugh said. Election officials are also unsure whether the FBI and CISA will continue to hold classified briefings for them on threats to elections, something those agencies have done for years. “They allowed me to personally connect some dots” by making the threats more tangible, he added. A CISA spokesperson did not directly answer a question about the briefings but provided a statement that read, in part, “since January 2025, CISA has issued 38 joint cybersecurity advisories with law enforcement and international partners and provided threat intelligence guidance to combat evolving threats and protect critical infrastructure, and we will continue to ensure election officials remain informed of any emerging issues going forward.” With or without federal security and intelligence support, election officials will be ready to do their job, Lux said. A Russian covert influence network focused on undermining Western support for Ukraine has set up at least 200 fake websites since last March to target audiences in the US, France and elsewhere, according to the cyber intelligence firm Recorded Future. The concern among more than a dozen current and former officials who spoke to CNN is that the Trump administration took a hatchet, rather than a scalpel, to federal programs aimed at countering the type of influence operation that Recorded Future uncovered. The State Department's Global Engagement Center, which focused on combating foreign propaganda, posted a massive US intelligence dump on Russian meddling prior to the 2024 election. ODNI's Foreign Malign Influence Center, which was set up under then-President Joe Biden, turned intelligence on Russian AI-generated videos posted on X purporting to show voter fraud into public statements in the days before Election Day in 2024. Without that center, it's unclear which government agency would warn the public of such efforts. ODNI did not answer a detailed list of questions on how the agency plans to counter foreign influence, including whether ODNI has a top intelligence specialist dedicated to the issue, as it has had in years past. An ODNI spokesperson referred CNN to a previous agency statement saying the Foreign Malign Influence Center's core functions would be moved to other parts of ODNI. Gabbard said in August that ODNI would cut its workforce by over 40% and save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. Trump's new pick to replace Haugh and lead the NSA and Cyber Command, Lt. Gen. Joshua Rudd, pledged to protect the electoral process from foreign interference during his Senate confirmation hearing. “Any foreign attempt to undermine the American process of democracy, and at the center of that is our electoral process, as you all know far better than I do, has got to be safeguarded,” Rudd told senators on January 15. The FBI's election security posture today has been shaped by Trump's grievances over the bureau's investigation into his 2016 campaign's contacts with Russia and his false claims of a stolen 2020 election. As president-elect in 2017, Trump was incsensed when then-FBI Director James Comey briefed him on the existence of a salacious, and later debunked, dossier about Trump gathered by a former British intelligence agent. Many see a through line between that day and the FBI's current counterintelligence posture for elections. “You could argue that where we are today happened because Comey briefed Trump, Trump got embarrassed and the rest is one big revenge tour,” said a former senior FBI counterintelligence official who served during the first Trump term and Biden's term. If and when US officials speak publicly on foreign efforts to shape US democracy is an intensely delicate subject in the second Trump administration. Trump has bristled at US intelligence findings that Russia tried to influence the 2016 election in his favor, while Democrats have often exaggerated those findings to attack Trump. A year after FBI agents were caught off-guard in 2016 by the scale of Russian hacking and propaganda aimed at voters, the bureau set up a Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF), a team of about 30 people to focus on the threat of foreign meddling. The task force passed intelligence about what foreign spies were doing on Facebook and Twitter to those social media platforms. In February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi dissolved FITF, citing the need to “free resources to address more pressing priorities, and end risks of further weaponization and abuses of prosecutorial discretion.” The impact of Bondi's memo goes beyond FITF, according to current and former FBI officials. But Trump and his top advisers never forgave CISA's leadership for saying the 2020 election was secure. The second Trump administration last year paused all of CISA's election security work and reassigned the agency's election specialists or put them on administrative leave CISA spokespeople say the agency still offers some cybersecurity services to election offices, as it does other sectors. A day after the US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities in June, pro-Iranian hackers breached an Arizona state election website and replaced candidates' photos with an image of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a statement to CNN, a CISA official said the agency “worked with Arizona and provided direct assistance to support their response efforts.” “While state and local officials take great care to secure elections, now they are effectively being siloed and expected to combat sophisticated nation-state adversaries with severely limited federal support.” Foreign powers, with the help of artificial intelligence, will continue to target American voters with disinformation, the ODNI said in its annual worldwide threat assessment published in March. In August, the institute published documents leaked from a Chinese firm that appear to show it targeting the 2024 Taiwan election with a wave of social media posts. The Chinese firm has also put together profiles on at least 117 members of Congress and more than 2,000 American political figures and “thought leaders,” according to the research. “This election cycle, foreign governments will be able to use AI tools to essentially whisper in the ear of anyone they target,” said Emerson Brooking, a former Pentagon cyber policy adviser who now studies influence operations at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. Last year, Gabbard and Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley released declassified intelligence documents related to the FBI and intelligence community's probes of Russian influence on the 2016 election. That Americans are still arguing about Russia's 2016 influence operations 10 years later is exactly what Russian intelligence hoped for, they said. “SVR officers are definitely dining out on the fact that our national discourse still can't fully escape the riptides of 2016,” Orleans told CNN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least five people were killed in a Russian drone strike on a civilian train in northeastern Ukraine, the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky said, describing the attack as an “act of terrorism.” Nearly 300 people were travelling on the train, which is used by Ukrainians to visit soldiers on the front lines. “In any country, a drone strike on a civilian train would be regarded in the same way – purely as an act of terrorism,” Zelensky said in a statement on Telegram, adding that “18 people were in the carriage hit by one of the Russian drones.” The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office said the remains of five people had been found, and that identification would only be possible after DNA testing. While Russia has previously targeted Ukraine's railway infrastructure, a direct strike on a passenger train is unusual. Ukrzaliznytsia, the national railway operator, said on Wednesday that two people were injured and one remains missing. The company said flags at all railway stations across the country would be lowered and a minute of silence observed to honour the victims. Another video shows a young woman being rescued from the train with her tiny baby. Visibly distressed and in shock, she is heard sobbing and explaining that she was travelling to “show my son to his father.” Footage posted on social media showed passengers, including people with small children, evacuating the burning train and walking into the snow-covered woods by the side of the railroad with their bags in hand. Ukrzaliznytsia said Wednesday it was temporarily reducing some train connections, particularly in the Kharkiv region, warning that Russia is intensifying its attacks on the rail network. It said it would introduce special traffic conditions on certain sections, particularly near the front lines and areas where increased Russian military activity has been recorded, and warned passengers to allow extra time for delays. “Punctuality and speed are important to us, but nothing is more important than safety,” the rail operator said. Russia has previously launched strikes on railway stations in Ukraine. One of the deadliest attacks of the war occurred in 2022, when Russian forces carried out a missile attack on a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, killing 61 people including several children. There were further deadly Russian strikes across Ukraine overnight into Wednesday. In the Kyiv region, a couple were killed when a missile hit their apartment block as they slept, while the woman's four-year-old daughter survived. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Marian Kushnir, who also lived in the apartment block, told how he discovered the child wrapped in a blanket and crying. But the fire had already spread too far,” he said. CNN's Max Saltman and Sophie Tanno contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a combat medic with the Army National Guard more than a decade ago, Lauren Feringa says she was exposed to toxins from burning oil fields during the Iraq War. The Department of Veterans Affairs imposed a near-total ban on abortion with a new rule quietly published on New Year's Eve. “This is all insane,” says Feringa, who has retired from the Army National Guard and Reserves and has been an outspoken critic of the VA but also says the system helped her through difficult periods. “Women have to be the only authority over what goes on with their bodies.” “You're not going to provide care for a woman who's been raped?” she added. Opponents to the new policy point out that women veterans who use the VA system for reproductive care are more restricted and have fewer options for abortion services than women who are incarcerated in federal prisons. In 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available, an estimated 7% of women servicemembers had experienced unwanted sexual contact in the past year, a category that includes sexual assault, according to a Pentagon survey. “The idea that VA would deny abortion care even in cases of rape – to me that's disgusting,” said Rachel Fey, interim Co-CEO of the group Power to Decide, a reproductive rights advocacy group. Fey calls the new VA ban “devastating” and “disrespectful” to women who have put their lives on the line for their country. Asked by CNN why the VA changed the policy, agency spokesman Peter Kasperowicz noted in a statement that “the Department of Justice issued an opinion that states VA is not legally authorized to provide abortions.” Kasperowicz did not elaborate on why the policy was changed with regard to rape and incest. VA Secretary Doug Collins is set to appear Wednesday on Capitol Hill for a hearing on VA health care, where he is expected to field questions about the new abortion policy. It was one of several moves taken by the Biden administration to expand abortion rights both at the VA and beyond as several Republican-led states enacted strict abortion laws. The new VA policy is effective immediately, and the department says it applies to all VA health care facilities, including those in states where abortions are legal under state law. The people making these rules – they're not clinicians,” an OB-GYN doctor, who asked to remain anonymous because they are still employed in the VA system, told CNN. The doctor fears that some veteran women who need abortions won't get them because VA providers “will be afraid to render this care.” In some cases, VA physicians might determine a woman's condition isn't life-threatening enough to authorize an abortion, the OB-GYN said, worried they “will keep pushing women veterans to ‘come back when you're worse. Another doctor in the VA system who also declined to be named for fear of retaliation worries about a chilling effect from the new ban on abortion counseling. “If they want to make guideline-based and evidence-based recommendations, in her best interests, now they'll think twice about that,” the doctor said of VA physicians who treat female patients. This doctor pointed to a recent patient, a woman veteran who had experienced military sexual trauma and sought care at the VA. Jackii Wang, senior legislative analyst for the National Women's Law Center, which advocates for abortion rights, said: “When we think of the number of women veterans who have suffered military sexual trauma, it's unconscionable that the administration would implement a policy like this.” “It really impacts their faith in their health care system,” Wang said of women veterans she's spoken to about the new VA abortion policy. National Nurses United, a labor union that represents about 13,500 nurses at nearly two dozen VA facilities across the country, has strongly denounced the new abortion ban. “This misogynistic, dangerous, and discriminatory policy will cause immeasurable harm and violates the nursing ethics nurses pledge to uphold,” the group said in a statement to CNN. “It is the utmost in hypocrisy that this administration thanks veterans for putting their bodies on the line, but then strips them of their bodily autonomy, self-determination, and dignity by refusing basic health care.” Rep. Julia Brownley, a California Democrat and member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, has introduced a bill that would add abortion and abortion counseling as services provided under law. The bill has no Republican co-signers and is unlikely to pass. A separate effort from Senate Democrats to overturn the rule was launched Tuesday. And yet a man who has never served a day in his life is taking away their own freedom to choose what's best for their health,” said the Illinois Democrat, who still gets her medical care through the VA. “It's simple – taxpayers do not want their hard-earned money spent on paying for abortions – and the VA's sole focus should always be providing service-connected health care and benefits to veterans they serve,” Bost said.</p>

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A man sprayed an unknown substance on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar and was tackled to the ground Tuesday during a town hall in Minneapolis, where tensions over federal immigration enforcement have come to a head after agents fatally shot an intensive care nurse and a mother of three this month. A man is tackled to the ground after spraying an unknown substance on U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., during a town hall on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2026, in Minneapolis. Just before that Omar had called for the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign or face impeachment. Calls are mounting on Capitol Hill for Noem to step down after the shooting deaths in Minneapolis of two people who protested deportations. “ICE cannot be reformed,” Omar said, seconds before the attack. Minneapolis police said officers saw the man use a syringe to spray an unknown liquid at Omar. It was not immediately clear if Kazmierczak had an attorney. The county public defenders' office could not immediately be reached. Omar continued speaking for about 25 more minutes after the man was ushered out by security, saying she would not be intimidated. There was a strong, vinegarlike smell after the man pushed on the syringe, according to an Associated Press journalist who was there. Minneapolis Council Member LaTrisha Vetaw said some of the substance also came into contact with her and state Sen. Bobby Joe Champion. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., walks beside a photograph of Renee Good, the woman shot and killed in her car by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis, during a news conference with the Congressional Progressive Caucus as they announce an effort to limit funding for the Department of Homeland Security, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026. Walking out afterward, Omar said she felt a little flustered but was not hurt. She was going to be screened by a medical team. She later posted on the social platform X: “I'm ok. I'm a survivor so this small agitator isn't going to intimidate me from doing my work. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Tuesday night. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized the congresswoman and has stepped up verbal attacks on her in recent months as he turned his focus on Minneapolis. During a Cabinet meeting in December, he referred to her as “garbage.” Hours earlier on Tuesday, the president criticized Omar as he spoke to a crowd in Iowa, saying his administration would only let in immigrants who “can show that they love our country.” “They have to be proud, not like Ilhan Omar,” he said, drawing loud boos at the mention of her name. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., speaks during a town hall in Minneapolis, Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2026. Tim Walz expressed gratitude that Omar was safe, adding in a post on X: “Our state has been shattered by political violence in the last year. The cruel, inflammatory, dehumanizing rhetoric by our nation's leaders needs to stop immediately.” U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, also denounced the assault. “I am deeply disturbed to learn that Rep. Ilhan Omar was attacked at a town hall today” Mace said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, called the attack “unacceptable.” He said he was relieved that Omar “is OK” and thanked police for their quick response, concluding: “This kind of behavior will not be tolerated in our city.” The city has been reeling from the fatal shootings of two residents by federal immigration agents this month during Trump's massive immigration enforcement surge. Intensive care unit nurse Alex Pretti was killed Saturday, less than three weeks after Renee Good was fatally shot behind the wheel of her vehicle. Lawmakers have discussed the impact on their ability to hold town halls and public events, with some even citing the threat environment in their decisions not to seek reelection. Following the assault on Omar, U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement that the agency was “working with our federal partners to see this man faces the most serious charges possible to deter this kind of violence in our society.” It also released updated numbers detailing threats to members of Congress: 14,938 “concerning statements, behaviors, and communications directed against lawmakers, their families, staff and the Capitol Complex” in 2025. That is a sharp increase from 2024, when the number of cases was 9,474, according to USCP. Capitol Police have beefed up security measures across all fronts since Jan. 6, 2021, and the department has seen increased reporting after a new center was launched two years ago to process reports of threats.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump called Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino “pretty out there” during his trip to Iowa on Tuesday. Trump made the comments in an interview with Fox News's Will Cain, the same day Bovino's demotion from his role overseeing Border Patrol's operations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement became effective. The news of Bovino's demotion broke two days after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Tensions in Minnesota have been high in recent weeks with the killing of Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers and the spike in anti-ICE protests across the state. “But you have to understand, when I watch some of the people that I've been watching over the last few weeks, these are paid insurrectionists. As Bovino was demoted back to overseeing Border Patrol operations in El Centro, California, the administration also reassigned the Border Patrol agents involved with the fatal shooting. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have mounted pressure on the Trump administration to oust Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as the administration responds to Pretti's killing. But Trump backed Noem on Tuesday, telling Cain that he still has confidence in the DHS secretary. Look, she was there with the border. Trump sent in border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis this week to communicate with local leaders in an effort to de-escalate tensions between protesters and federal law enforcement in the Twin Cities. Homan said he met with local law enforcement officials, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), and Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday. “We all agree that we need to support our law enforcement officers and get criminals off the streets. While we don't agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead,” Homan said on X.</p>
