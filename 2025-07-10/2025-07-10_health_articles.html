                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team led by Prof. Hai Li from the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has become the first to systematically explore how large language models (LLMs) can assist in predicting liver cancer treatment responses-offering a new path toward AI-powered precision medicine. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide. For patients with advanced HCC, combination therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted treatments offer some hope, but only around 30% of patients respond effectively. This makes accurate prediction of treatment response a critical unmet need in personalized oncology. In this study, the team evaluated the performance of leading LLMs-GPT-4, GPT-4o, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek-in predicting treatment outcomes using zero-shot learning. This means the models were not specifically trained on liver cancer data beforehand. The dataset included clinical and imaging information from 186 inoperable HCC patients. To enhance performance, the researchers tested various decision-making strategies, such as voting rules and logical combinations, and created a hybrid model named Gemini-GPT. The Gemini-GPT model demonstrated predictive accuracy on par with senior doctors (15+ years of experience), while outperforming junior and mid-level clinicians in both speed and accuracy. It consistently produced stable results across various treatment types and disease stages, and proved especially reliable in identifying patients likely to benefit from therapy-often showing greater consistency than human doctors. Applying simple logical strategies further improved its practical utility in clinical settings. This research shows how AI can help doctors make better decisions and offer more personalized treatment for cancer patients." The study marks an important step toward trustworthy AI integration in real-world oncology, demonstrating that LLMs can do more than language-they can reason, predict, and support critical medical decisions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This new article publication from Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B, discusses how a psychological stress-activated NR3C1/NUPR1 axis promotes ovarian tumor metastasis. Ovarian tumor (OT) is the most lethal form of gynecologic malignancy, with minimal improvements in patient outcomes over the past several decades. Psychological stress is known to activate the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), a factor associated with poor prognosis in OT patients. However, the precise mechanisms linking NR3C1 signaling and metastasis have yet to be fully elucidated. The authors of this article demonstrate that chronic restraint stress accelerates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in OT through an NR3C1-dependent mechanism involving nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1). Clinically, elevated NR3C1 positively correlates with NUPR1 expression in OT patients, and both are positively associated with poorer prognosis. Overall, this study identified the NR3C1/NUPR1 axis as a critical regulatory pathway in psychological stress-induced OT metastasis, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for intervention in OT metastasis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) can help to repair the liver, but they often don't stick well to the existing tissue, making treatment less effective. Scientists at the University of Birmingham have now developed a method to coat HPCs with natural sugars (polysaccharides) – such as hyaluronic acid and alginate – making the cells 'stickier'. The coated cells showed a significant increase in their ability to stick to liver tissues and other cells - meaning the cells are more likely to stay in place and help repair the liver. Coated HPCs can still turn into liver cells and perform their functions, like producing important proteins. Publishing their findings today (10 July) in Communications Biology, scientists from the University of Birmingham and InSphero AG (Switzerland) outline how the HPCs are coated with polysaccharides using a special technique that doesn't require modifying their genes. Liver transplants are the only option for many severe liver diseases, but there aren't enough donor livers available. This new method could provide an alternative by making cell therapy more effective, potentially helping many people with liver disease." Dr. Maria Chiara Arno, Lead Author from the University of Birmingham Researchers used a technique called metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) to coat the cells, which were tested - in lab conditions mimicking the human body - on various surfaces, including liver microtissues and endothelial cells, which line blood vessels. The coated HPCs demonstrated a much higher adhesion rate to liver microtissues and other cells compared to uncoated cells. Moreover, coating cells increased their levels of certain proteins (integrins) that help cells attach and sense their environment. Importantly, these coatings were temporary, lasting just long enough to help the cells settle in after transplantation, without interfering with their normal functions. "Our approach avoids genetic modification, making it easier to use in the clinic," added Dr Arno. "We believe this method could be adapted for other cell types and are planning further studies explore its impact on cell health and immune responses."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have discovered a previously unknown molecule that may explain why people with type 2 diabetes often suffer from muscle weakness and muscle loss - a condition that has a major impact on quality of life and overall health. In the new study, published in Sciences Advances, researchers have identified a previously unknown molecule, TMEM9B-AS1, which may explain why people with type 2 diabetes often suffer from muscle weakness and loss of muscle mass. The molecule is a long non-coding RNA that plays an important role in regulating cellular functions. The researchers discovered that TMEM9B-AS1 is significantly reduced in skeletal muscles in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and its absence disrupts the machinery needed to build new muscle proteins. Without this RNA molecule, MYC becomes unstable, and muscle cells lose their ability to maintain normal protein production. This may help explain the muscle deterioration we often see in people with metabolic diseases."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exercise is a crucial and effective intervention for ameliorating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of MASH, which benefit a broad spectrum of MASH patients, including those who have difficulty engaging in physical activity. We established a mouse model of MASH and selectively knocked down L-type amino acid transporter 1 and alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2. Mice were fed a high-fat high-cholesterol diet and subjected to either short- or long-term exercise regimens. We assessed the phosphorylation and activity of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) as well as branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) content in skeletal muscle following exercise. Short-term exercise significantly reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation without causing notable changes in body weight. It also enhanced BCKDH activity in skeletal muscle and decreased hepatic BCAA accumulation. Muscle-specific overexpression of BCKDH further promoted BCAA catabolism and significantly attenuated hepatic steatosis and inflammation in high-fat high-cholesterol-fed mice. In contrast, muscle-specific L-type amino acid transporter 1 knockdown, which suppresses BCAA uptake, markedly abolished these beneficial effects. Hepatic alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2 knockdown, which inhibited glutamine uptake, lessened the protective effect of exercise on MASH. Further in vitro study revealed that glutamine derived from myocytes improved redox homeostasis and inhibited lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. In our study, enhanced BCAA oxidation in skeletal muscle following short-term exercise increased glutamine production, which circulated to the liver and helped ameliorate MASH by promoting redox balance. This mechanism offers a novel perspective and a promising therapeutic target for MASH treatment, with significant implications for future clinical interventions and drug development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An alternative diagnostic method could improve early detection and treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD), according to a new study from the University of Surrey. PAD is a common condition affecting up to a quarter of adults that causes poor blood circulation to the legs and feet, which may result in pain, ulcers, and, most dangerously, in amputation. The study, published in European Heart Journal - Imaging Methods and Practice, looked at finding a more accurate diagnostic measure to what is usually used to diagnose PAD in particular in people with diabetes, the toe brachial index (TBI). By doing this, doctors can tell whether the feet and toes of the patients are getting enough blood flow - however, the test can be unreliable in some patients, especially those with diabetes. Researchers worked with 155 limbs in patients who were undergoing treatment for PAD. The study used a Doppler ultrasound waveform to estimate TBI (eTBI), which provided a faster, more accurate, reproducible, and accessible alternative to the current PAD test. eTBI was found to be more consistent than standard TBI, with different health professionals getting similar results even on different ultrasound machines. This research could lead to earlier diagnosis and more effective management of PAD, especially for people with diabetes and those at higher risk of heart diseases, which could result in preventing serious complications like foot ulcers and amputations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kelli Reardon undergoes an MRI twice a year to screen for breast cancer, a measure she said she must take to protect her health. Her mother died of the disease at age 48, putting Reardon at higher risk, and Reardon has dense breast tissue, which makes it harder to detect a growth through a mammogram. When Reardon moved from Alabama to North Carolina, she had little choice but to switch from having the screening done at an imaging center to having it done at a hospital. Then she saw how much higher the charges were. At first, Reardon thought it was an error: "They made a mistake with billing," she said. In this installment of InvestigateTV and KFF Health News' "Costly Care" series, Caresse Jackman, InvestigateTV's national consumer investigative reporter, and Jamie Grey, director of investigations, explore how the type of medical facility where a patient seeks care can affect the cost of that care — particularly when that facility is a hospital. This article was reprinted from khn.org, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF - the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism. In the interview, Lloyd M. Smith discusses proteoforms, an area of research worthy of the next Human Genome Project. In this interview, the team at n6 discusses their groundbreaking iconPCR thermocycler and its impact on laboratory automation, NGS data quality, and real-time control in life sciences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After completing their analysis, the researchers concluded that regularly consuming even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and colorectal cancer. The data showed that people who ate just one hot dog per day had an 11% greater risk of type 2 diabetes and a 7% higher risk of colorectal cancer compared to those who did not eat processed meat. Processed meats include items such as bacon, sausage, and ham, which typically involve preservatives like salting, curing, or smoking. “Similarly, consuming sugary drinks, such as sodas, was linked to adverse health outcomes,” he added. It is important to note, however, that the studies included in the analysis were observational, meaning they can only show an association between diet and disease risk rather than directly prove cause and effect. In addition, the findings relied on participants' self-reported eating habits, which can introduce inaccuracies due to memory errors or misreporting. Even with advanced analytical methods, the researchers highlighted that diet data remains limited, which is a common challenge in nutritional research. Two nutrition experts, not involved in the study, also spoke to MNT about its findings. Destini Moody, RD, CSSD, LD, registered dietitian at Top Nutrition Coaching, agreed, telling MNT that she “would strongly caution against patients and the public taking away that the risk of chronic disease is small when consuming these foods.” “It's been well-established by prominent entities such as the American Heart Association and WHO [World Health Organization] that trans fats, processed meats, and refined sugars increase risk of chronic disease across the board,” Moody added. “This isn't just because they lead to chronic inflammation, but these foods typically offer little nutrition in terms of micronutrients and antioxidants. I urge the public to focus on these foods while only occasionally indulging in the aforementioned products that can cause harm in excess and provide very little benefits to human health.” “Instead of eliminating foods from your diet, the best approach is to find healthy swaps. For example, many ultra-processed peanut butters and tortillas contain partially hydrogenated oils, which are considered a type of trans fat. Bishoff recommended switch to a natural peanut butter or whole-food based tortillas, for instance, that do not contain hydrogenated oils. Or, “if you enjoy soda, there are many healthier soda alternatives that contain less than 3–5 g of added sugar and still provide a refreshing and crisp taste without sacrificing your health,” she explained. “[Instead] grilling hot dogs and other processed meats this summer, make vegetable kabobs with a lean or plant-based protein, like tofu,” Bishoff suggested. Haile also noted that “while dietary choices are personal and often influenced by individual and environmental factors, the implications of our findings suggest that people should aim to minimize their consumption of these foods as much as practicable.” In this episode, Medical News Today discusses whether intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating practices are safe for the heart, especially in… PFAS are widespread chemical compounds that can even be traced in human diet. But what is their impact on health, and how can a person avoid them? Eating too much dairy, especially if you have lactose intolerance, may be causing nightmares and sleep disturbances, a new study has confirmed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As anyone who ever attended a high-school reunion can tell you, some people age faster than others. But research has shown that we also have what's called a "biological age," a cryptic but more accurate measure of our physiological condition and likelihood of developing aging-associated disorders from heart trouble to Alzheimer's disease. We all guess people's actual ages, almost unconsciously, by scanning their faces for wrinkles, baggy eyes and other telltale signs. But figuring out how old someone's brain, arteries or kidneys are is another matter. The organs tucked inside our bodies are aging at different speeds, too, according to a new study by Stanford Medicine investigators. With this indicator, we can assess the age of an organ today and predict the odds of your getting a disease associated with that organ 10 years later." Tony Wyss-Coray, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences and director of the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience They can even predict who is most likely to die from medical conditions associated with one or more of the 11 separate organ systems the researchers looked at: brain, muscle, heart, lung, arteries, liver, kidneys, pancreas, immune system, intestine and fat. The biological age of one organ - the brain - plays an outsized role in determining how long you have left to live, Wyss-Coray said. The lead author is Hamilton Oh, PhD, a former graduate student in Wyss-Coray's group. The scientists zeroed in on 44,498 randomly selected participants, ages 40 to 70, who were drawn from a longitudinal data-gathering endeavor called UK Biobank. This ongoing effort has collected multiple blood samples and updated medical reports from some 600,000 individuals over several years. Wyss-Coray's team made use of an advanced commercially available laboratory technology that counted the amounts of nearly 3,000 proteins in each participant's blood. Some 15% of these proteins can be traced to single-organ origins, and many of the others to multiple-organ generation. The researchers fed everybody's blood-borne protein levels into a computer and determined the average levels of each of those organ-specific proteins in the blood of those people's bodies, adjusted for age. From this, the scientists generated an algorithm that found how much the composite protein "signature" for each organ being assessed differed from the overall average for people of that age. Based on the differences between individuals' and age-adjusted average organ-assigned protein levels, the algorithm assigned a biological age to each of the 11 distinct organs or organ systems assessed for each subject. And it measured how far each organ's multiprotein signature in any given individual deviated in either direction from the average for people of the same chronological age. These protein signatures served as proxies for individual organs' relative biological condition. A greater than 1.5 standard deviation from the average put a person's organ in the "extremely aged" or "extremely youthful" category. One in four participants had multiple extremely aged or youthful organs. Risks for several of those diseases were affected by numerous different organs' biological age. But the strongest associations were between an individual's biologically aged organ and the chance that this individual would develop a disease associated with that organ. For example, having an extremely aged heart predicted higher risk of atrial fibrillation or heart failure, having aged lungs predicted heightened chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk, and having an old brain predicted higher risk for Alzheimer's disease. The association between having an extremely aged brain and developing Alzheimer's disease was particularly powerful - 3.1 times that of a person with a normally aging brain. Meanwhile having an extremely youthful brain was especially protective against Alzheimer's - barely one-fourth that of a person with a normally aged brain. In other words, someone with a biologically old brain is approximately 12 times as likely to receive a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease over the next decade or so as someone the same age with a biologically young brain. In addition, Wyss-Coray said, brain age was the best single predictor of overall mortality. Having an extremely aged brain increased subjects' risk of dying by 182% over a roughly 15-year period, while individuals with extremely youthful brains had an overall 40% reduction in their risk of dying over the same duration. "This approach could lead to human experiments testing new longevity interventions for their effects on the biological ages of individual organs in individual people," Wyss-Coray said. Medical researchers may, for example, be able to use extreme brain age as a proxy for impending Alzheimer's disease and intervene before the onset of outward symptoms, when there's still time to arrest it, he said. Careful collection of lifestyle, diet and prescribed- or supplemental-substance intake in clinical trials, combined with organ-age assessments, could throw light on the medical value of those factors' contributions to the aging of various organs, as well as on whether existing, approved drugs can restore organ youth before people develop a disease for which an organ's advanced biological age puts them at high risk, Wyss-Coray added. "This is, ideally, the future of medicine," he said. Although the analytical tool is available only for research purposes now, Wyss-Coray has plans to commercialize it. He is a co-founder and scientific officer of Teal Omics and Vero Bioscience, two companies to whom Stanford University's Office of Technology Licensing has licensed technology developed in this and related research for commercializing, respectively, screens for new drug targets and a consumer product. "The cost will come down as we focus on fewer key organs, such as the brain, heart and immune system, to get more resolution and stronger links to specific diseases." In the interview, Lloyd M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study out today in Epidemiology uses AI to solve the mystery, finding an unaccounted-for factor that researchers think points to implicit bias in the clinical decision-making process. The AI model allowed us to distinguish among the many reasons behind these much higher rates of amputation among certain groups of people with vascular disease. We found that, after accounting for everything else, people's unconscious biases are likely behind why some groups receive amputation instead of alternative treatment that preserves their limb." We hope our results will be a catalyst to create evidence-based guidelines that help vascular surgeons and other providers who make this life-changing decision do so objectively." More than 12 million adults in the US live with a vascular disease called Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), a chronic circulation condition that restricts blood flow to the limbs. About 10% of people with PAD develop Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia (CLTI) at which point either they receive a procedure to restore blood flow to their lower leg or their limb must be amputated. Revascularization is a surgical procedure that can save the limb, but it also requires intensive follow-up and is a relatively expensive surgical procedure. After accounting for known differences in clinical presentation, the study found higher rates of amputation among Black, Hispanic, Native American, and white people in rural areas as well as among Black and Native American people in urban areas. "We found a substantial unexplained portion that would suggest an implicit bias in clinical decision-making occurring at the physician and hospital level," Strassle said. The study examined hospitalizations between 2017 and 2019 of people under 40 with PAD or CLTI, across five states (Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi and New York) using State Inpatient Databases from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Researchers programmed an AI model to consider a huge number of variables (70+) that contribute to known reasons for differences in leg amputations of people with PAD. "This AI model will allow us to easily assess intersectionality across race, sex, income and rurality, and offers us the ability to indirectly study hard-to-measure causes of disparities, like implicit bias and stereotyping," said Strassle. Limb-threatening conditions are often the result of decades of difficult-to-control diseases like diabetes, high cholesterol and nicotine dependence. For surgeons, who know these conditions lead to worse surgical outcomes, this can make the decision to pursue a complex limb-saving surgery even trickier. "As vascular surgeons we have surgical guidelines, but we don't have detailed guidelines to help us make the decision between amputating someone's leg and limb-saving surgery in patients who are not medically ready. Given the number and complexity of variables involved, we need more information describing the optimal treatment for each person in different conditions. We need to know we can perform a successful vascular operation, and also not increase the risk of dying," said Katharine McGinigle, a vascular surgeon, associate professor of surgery at the University of North Carolina and senior author of the paper. "There are so many medical, surgical, and social factors that contribute to disease progression, limb-loss and even death. Surgeons and others making treatment recommendations deserve evidence-based guidance that will help us avoid unconscious biases and make the right decision at the right time for each person based on their unique clinical and social needs. AI methods, similar to the one used in this research, can help us achieve that goal," said McGinigle. Strassle and McGinigle hope that their findings will inform comprehensive guidelines and health policies that help clinicians avoid unconscious bias and other unjustified differences in the quality of care provided, to safely save limbs of people living with advanced vascular disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai shows that exposure to lead during pregnancy and early childhood may accelerate the rate at which children forget information-a critical marker of memory impairment that may have implications for learning and development. Using delayed matching-to-sample task (DMTS)-a cognitive task that can be used to evaluate underlying neurobehavioral functions, such as attention and working memory, and has been demonstrated to be sensitive to metal neurotoxicants-the study examined how both prenatal and early childhood blood lead levels affect working memory in children ages 6 to 8. In this task, the children were presented a picture, and then had to select that same picture from three choices presented after a brief delay. Researchers applied an innovative statistical approach known as a nonlinear modified power function to model memory decay, uncovering a measurable link between higher childhood lead levels and faster forgetting rates. The findings showed that higher lead exposure at ages 4–6 was significantly associated with a faster rate of forgetting-even at low median blood lead levels (~1.7 µg/dL). Additionally, older children and those whose mother's IQ was higher were more likely to show better memory retention. The nonlinear modified power function has been validated in previous animal and human studies but is now applied in the field of environmental health. This new usage is important because children are exposed to many environmental chemicals, and this model provides a validated method to further assess the effect of additional environmental exposures, such as heavy metals, air pollution, or endocrine disruptors, on children's working memory." Katherine Svensson, PhD, MS, postdoctoral fellow in Environmental Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and co-first author of the study This study also validates a method for assessing neurobehavioral function, paving the way for translational research that can bridge human data with mechanistic insights from laboratory studies. "Our work advances the current literature by incorporating operant tests-specifically the DMTS-which are commonly used in animal toxicology studies but sparse in human studies. This translational approach is a key innovation of our work," said Jamil M. Lane, PhD, MPH, Instructor, Environmental Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and co-first author. The implications are clear: even low-level lead exposure can undermine key cognitive functions in young children. As memory and attention are foundational for academic and social success, this research underscores the urgent need for continued investment in lead prevention efforts-especially in historically overburdened communities. "There may be no more important a trait than the ability to form memories. "This paper breaks new ground by showing how environmental chemicals can interfere with the rate of memory formation. This study opens the door for future work to explore how environmental exposures like lead intersect with other cognitive domains such as attention, executive function, and reward processing. It also strengthens the case for policy interventions that protect children's developing brains before irreversible harm occurs. Developmental Pb exposure increases rate of forgetting on a delayed matching-to-sample task among Mexican children.
