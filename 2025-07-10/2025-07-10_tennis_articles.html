                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — As if there were any doubt whether Aryna Sabalenka's loss in the Wimbledon semifinals on Thursday brought to mind her loss in the French Open final — and its aftermath — a month ago, she made it quite clear right away. You're not going to see a 'Roland-Garros press conference,'" the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka said when she arrived for her question-and-answer session with reporters after being eliminated by Amanda Anisimova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 at Centre Court, "so anyone who was waiting for that, you can leave right now." It was delivered as a punch line, knowing full well that the three-time Grand Slam champion was widely criticized for her words following a three-set loss to Coco Gauff with the trophy at stake in Paris. There was plenty of online venom directed Sabalenka's way. So much so, that Sabalenka first wrote a private apology to Gauff, then offered a public mea culpa, before the two patched things up by posting TikTok and Instagram videos together right before the start of competition at the All England Club. "I just don't want to face that hate again," Sabalenka said Thursday. We all can lose control over our emotions. Every time when I was really that close in that match today to completely lose it and start — I don't know — yelling, screaming, smashing the rackets, I keep reminding myself that's not an option." After praising Anisimova — an American seeded 13th who will play in her first major final on Saturday against Iga Swiatek — as "the better player," Sabalenka spoke about the feelings she experiences following a setback. "The first moment (is) always the worst one, because every time you compete at that tournament, and you get to the last stages, you think that you're getting close to your dream," said the 27-year-old from Belarus. Sabalenka was hoping to become the first woman in a decade to reach four major finals in a row after winning the U.S. Open last year, then finishing as the runner-up at the Australian Open and French Open in 2025. So used to overpowering opponents, Sabalenka ran into someone who hits as big a ball as she does. "She was more brave today," Sabalenka said. Then she kind of (angered me), saying that, oh, that's what she does all the time," Sabalenka said. Asked about that moment, Anisimova said: "I wasn't celebrating. It was just a long grunt, I guess. I don't really know what was the deal there, to be honest, because I didn't feel like it was that interfering. But I tried to not do it again." During another point, Anisimova benefited from the ball trickling over the tape of the net and, instead of the usual "Sorry, not sorry" gesture players often use by raising a hand when that happens, seemed to be celebrating. "I was like, 'You don't want to say sorry?' She just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match," Sabalenka said. "If she doesn't feel like saying sorry — she barely got that point and she didn't feel like saying sorry for that tricky situation?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka showed how much she has grown from her Roland Garros experience, saying that she won't do a repeat of the rant she had after losing the final to Coco Gauff. However, the World No.1 said she has a 'hate relationship' with Wimbledon now as she exited the competition with a semi-final loss to Amanda Anisimova on Thursday, July 10. Sabalenka courted controversy that time when she said that Gauff won the title in Paris as she wasn't playing at her best on the day and was faced backlash for it. This time around, Sabalenka started her presser by saying that people expecting a similar rant should leave the press room. “You're not gonna see a Roland Garros press conference. Anyone who was waiting for that, you can leave right now,” said Sabalenka. Sabalenka also said she took more time in the press room as she wanted everyone to see the real version of her and not the one they saw at Roland Garros. “I just don't want to face that hate again (laughing). We all can lose control of our emotions. Every time when I was really that close today in this match to completely losing it and start yelling, screaming, smashing racquets, I kept reminding myself that that's not an option and it's not gonna help me stay in the match and fight for my dream. Even right now I took a bit more time before doing my media. After losing three semis and having her fair share of misfortunes as well, Sabalenka said she is hoping that her relationship with Wimbledon will become better in the future. "Of course, if one day I'm going to be able to win it, of course, I'm going to look back on all of these tough losses and think that I still did it. Yeah, now it's tough, but I never give up, and I'm going to come back stronger, for sure," said Sabalenka. - EndsPublished By: alan johnPublished On: Jul 10, 2025Read More: |  Wimbledon: Iga Swiatek ends agonising wait for final, sets up clash with Anisimova</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>13 seed Amanda Anisimova kept a cool head to reach the first Grand Slam final of her career, defeating No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 37 minutes. Stats corner: The result is Anisimova's sixth career Top 5 win, and first over a reigning World No. Four of those Top 5 wins have come over Sabalenka, against whom she now holds a 6-3 head-to-head record with wins on every surface. Anisimova now has a 12-2 record on grass this year, having reached the Queen's final four weeks ago and followed it by making the Berlin quarterfinals. Anisimova is the seventh player born in the 21st century to reach any major final, following Bianca Andreescu, Swiatek, Emma Raducanu, Leylah Fernandez, Coco Gauff and Zheng Qinwen. Anisimova and Swiatek, both born in 2001 have never met at pro level, and just once in juniors -- a 6-4, 6-2 win for Swiatek on clay in the 2016 Junior Billie Jean King Cup final. "The moment of this young woman's life" 👏Amanda Anisimova completes an extraordinary semi-final to defeat No.1 seed Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 and book her spot in her first ever #Wimbledon final 💥Take. "You can get back to the top if you prioritize yourself": A star junior who quickly brought her prodigious talent to the Hologic WTA Tour, reaching the 2019 Roland Garros semifinals as a 17-year-old, Anisimova's path to this moment has not been straightforward. In 2023, she took a seven-month mental health break from tennis. This time last year, she was on the comeback trail, but at No. 189 was ranked too low to get into the Wimbledon main draw; she fell in qualifying to Eva Lys. But since then, Anisimova has rocketed into the Top 20 following her first WTA 1000 final in Toronto last August, then her first WTA 1000 title in Doha this February. She is guaranteed to make her Top 10 debut next Monday. "I think that's a really special message that I think I've been able to show because when I took my break, a lot of people told me that you would never make it to the top again if you take so much time away from the game. Just being able to prove that you can get back to the top if you prioritize yourself. Match moments: The two players finished the match with similar top-line numbers -- indeed, they favored Sabalenka, who hit more winners (31 to 30) and committed fewer unforced errors (37 to 42) overall. As ever, those stats only told part of the story. The first two sets were mostly characterized by straightforward holds (and two medical emergencies in the crowd, Sabalenka earning Centre Court's approval for taking water over each time). Consecutive games midway through the opener saw both players face multiple break points, and both came through unscathed. In the end, there was only one service break in each of the first two sets -- both conceded on a double fault. Doing it in front of those who believed in you first ♥️Amanda Anisimova has endless gratitude for her whole family and team after reaching her maiden #Wimbledon final 🥹What a journey it has been for the 23-year-old 👏 pic.twitter.com/TDpHLfea5h She broke back immediately, then moved up 3-1 as Sabalenka sent a forehand sitter just over the baseline. She passed her first test, saving two break-back points in the subsequent game then coming up with a superb winning pass that landed on the outside of the line en route to holding. A breathtaking redirected winner, bold volleys and a fortuitous net cord enabled her to advance to 5-2. Anisimova's backhand began to let her down for the first time in the match, going wide on her first match point then long down break point. Cheap errors handed Anisimova triple match point in the subsequent game, and Anisimova found a forehand winner to convert her fourth. "I was trying to really stay on top of my serve, was struggling a bit there," Anisimova said. "Holding serve was just going to be super important. In the third set I knew that I was going to really have to go for it. I really had to bring my game and do as much as I could, especially when it came to being aggressive." Her 12 career major semifinals are the most of any player since Maria Sharapova, and she has converted three of those into titles. This experience shows that next year I'm only hungrier and angrier. These tough defeats help me to come back much stronger. I have huge hopes for the next year. I don't have to stop my arms. It seems like in all of these three, three tough defeats on the Slams, for me it seems like I wasn't trusting myself. Every time when I remind myself you have to trust, you can do literally anything on the court, every time I show my best tennis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American tennis sensation Amanda Anisimova upset top seed Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon on July 10, 2025, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, to reach the ladies' singles final. It has been an incredible journey for Anisimova from reaching the French Open semifinal as a 17-year-old from a recent mental health break to now reaching the precipice of tennis immortality on the grass courts on the All England Club. Anisimova, the tournament's 13th seed, will face Iga Swiatek in the final on July 12, 2025, where she will look to become the first American to win Wimbledon since Williams, her tennis idol, in 2016. Get to know Anisimova as she chases her first Grand Slam title. “It doesn't feel real right now,” she said during her post-match interview, gushing that she was happy her sister, Maria Anisimova-Egee, nephew, brother-in-law and best friend were all in London supporting her. “To be honest, if you told me I'd be in the final at Wimbledon, I would not believe you, at least not this soon.” Anisimova took a break from tennis from May 2023 until January 2024 after her first-round loss to qualifier Arantxa Rus in the Madrid Open that April. “I've really been struggling with my mental health and burnout since the summer of 2022,” the then-21-year-old wrote on Instagram. After returning to tennis, Anisimova lost in the qualifying for Wimbledon in June 2024 and was a Canadian Open Finalist that August. Anisimova, who was born in New Jersey and moved to Miami at age 3, climbed the tennis ranks early on. Anisimova rose to fame when she reached the 2019 French Open semifinals after beating reigning champion Simona Halep at age 17. She became the youngest American woman to reach a Grand Slam semifinal since Venus Williams at the 1997 U.S. Open. Anisimova's parents, Olga and Konstantin, immigrated from Russia to the United States in 1998 with their eldest daughter, Maria. Anisimova withdrew from the 2019 U.S. Open after her father and longtime coach died of a heart attack. Her sister Maria played college tennis for the University of Pennsylvania</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Keen to avoid repeating a past mistake, Aryna Sabalenka struck a diplomatic tone immediately after her three-set defeat to Amanda Anisimova in the Wimbledon semifinals. "You're not going to see a Roland-Garros press conference," the No. Sabalenka garnered some criticism for what many perceived to be the dismissive way she described Coco Gauff's performance in the Roland-Garros women's final in June. … I think she won the match not because she played incredible, just because I made all of those mistakes from, if you look from the outside, easy balls." Sabalenka apologized in a subsequent interview with Eurosport Germany (via Charlie Eccleshare of The Athletic) and called her remarks "unprofessional." On Thursday, the three-time major Grand Slam champion did provide one notable soundbite when discussing a contentious moment in the second set against Anisimova. Anisimova started to celebrate before a point ended, which clearly didn't sit well with Sabalenka. She said in her press conference the American "kind of pissed me off." "But I was grateful and thankful that she said that because I was like, it actually helped me to keep fighting," Sabalenka told reporters. The three-time Wimbledon semifinalist didn't want to create another Roland-Garros moment, but she may once again garner the wrong kind of headlines thanks to her London presser.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON — Iga Świątek is not messing around as she moves into her first Wimbledon final. She dominated Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0 Thursday to set up a meeting with Amanda Anisimova of the U.S., with the controlled, clinical aggression on both serve and return that has defined her tennis the past fortnight. She is a five-time Grand Slam champion who has spent 125 weeks as the world No. 1, even if by her own extremely high standards, she has fallen on harder times of late. The win makes Swiatek the only active WTA Tour player to reach a Grand Slam final on all three surfaces and a victory on Saturday would be Świątek's first title anywhere since winning a fourth Roland Garros title in June 2024, in what will be only her second final in that time. Her ability to ride out difficult moments has been a particular feature of this Wimbledon run, in contrast to the way in which she had started letting tight matches run away from her, by overhitting when things got tight and sending herself into a doom loop of mistakes. It happened in her shock defeat to a redlining Yulia Putintseva, who made one unforced error in a 13-game stretch of their third-round meeting here last year. Świątek was so good against Bencic that there weren't too many tight moments. It briefly looked like things might get interesting when consecutive double faults helped give Bencic a couple of break points at the start of the second set, but Świątek quickly closed the door and got back to serving efficiently and returning with devastating aggression. Those strong foundations gave Świątek the platform to produce the kind of masterclass that brought back memories of the 2022 version of her who won two Grand Slams and won 37 matches in a row. She played with variety when needed, volleying with confidence for instance, but she barely needed to veer from her Plan A because it was working so well. Play was paused after a spectator required medical assistance in the crowd, but Świątek did not let up. A feature of watching Świątek during 2022, and whenever she's been at her best, is wondering not whether she will lose, but how many games her opponent will win. Bencic saved it, but Świątek secured a trademark bagel set a couple of points later with another backhand winner, after 71 minutes on court.

Novak Djokovic has canceled his Thursday afternoon practice at Wimbledon, the All England Club confirmed, one day after taking a scary fall in the final game of his win over No. Djokovic slipped on the grass Wednesday after a forehand attempt led to a return from Cobolli that hit the net cord and made Djokovic lean to his left. Djokovic laid on the turf for a few seconds face down as the crowd at Centre Court was silent while Cobolli went to his opponent's side and picked up his racket. Djokovic got back up on his own power, wiped his brow and finished out the final two points of the quarterfinal. "Well, I finished the match" Djokovic said of his injury scare. "Nasty slip, but that's what happens when you play on grass. I didn't fall so far this year, and it's a bit surprising because of the way I move on the grass. And with aggressive movement, you're expected to fall. It did come at an awkward moment, but I managed to find a good serve and close it out. "Obviously, I'll visit this subject now with my physio and will play in a few days." Djokovic is targeting his 25th Grand Slam this week and needs two more wins to get there. "Whether it could be my 'last dance,' I'm not sure ... as I'm not sure about Roland Garros or any other Slam that I play next," Djokovic said before his first-round match last week. "My wish is to play for several more years. I would love to be healthy physically and also mentally motivated to keep on playing at the highest level. But you never know at this stage." Djokovic lost to Alcaraz in straight sets during last year's Wimbledon final and last won the event in 2022. "These tournaments give me the biggest drive, still," Djokovic said. Tennis-wise, I've been playing good on the practice sessions. Obviously completely different when you start a tournament. Djokovic lost to Sinner in the French Open semifinals earlier this summer and has not won a major since 2023. He now gets an opportunity to return the favor on grass. "[It] was a straight-set loss, but I feel like I did give him a run for his money, so to say," Djokovic said at Roland-Garros after falling to the 23-year-old Italian. "I tried to make him work till the last shot. There is no gambling offered on this site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two years after clinching Australian Open as a wildcard entrant alongside compatriot Jason Kubler, the Sydneysider and his partner Pel only secured a slot in the Wimbledon draw as an alternate entry, their spot opening after other combinations withdrew. His share of the prize if successful would be A$700,000. The Aussie has already pocketed A$205,000 after reaching the second round in singles, where he was beaten by American star Ben Shelton. Once again, Hijikata is within range of pulling off another grand slam surprise, this time courtesy of the excellence with which he held his nerve in what was a compelling doubles semi-final on Court 1 at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. But Hijikata was able to whip a backhand crosscourt that drew an error to save the first in a beautiful demonstration of quick hands and touch. On the second, he made a crisp backhand return and then rocketed a forehand to draw an error at the net from their rival. On their first match point, his partner failed to put away a short volley, but Hijikata was able to chase down the response and respond by whipping a forehand crosscourt into the corner to secure a dream slot on the championship weekend at Wimbledon. They survived a super tiebreaker in their opening round encounter against 14th seeds Andre Goransson and Sem Verbeek. It was a similar case in the second round, with the pair again edging their way through in a super tiebreaker against Robert Cash and JJ Tracy. Their third round on paper was a test against third seeds Tim Puetz and Kevin Krawietz, but that proved a straight sets breeze, and they were able to win their quarterfinal in straight sets as well against Rafael Matos and Marcelo Melo. The key, Hijikata said earlier in the week, was that they were treating every outing as a bonus given they were fortunate to earn a start. “Honestly, I feel like we're just enjoying ourselves out there,” Hijikata told Stan Sports. I feel like we've got no expectations and we're just going out there trying to swing away and whatever happens happens. “We're just trying to enjoy every moment as much as we can, and just back ourselves to play some big tennis. It's worked so far, and hopefully we can keep going.” A finalist in the girls' singles last year, Australia's world No.1 ranked junior Emerson Jones's hopes of clinching the title this year where dashed when she was beaten 6-2 6-2 in a quarterfinal on Court 18 by Mia Pohankova on Thursday.</p>

Djokovic, who is set to face World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals on Friday, suffered a fall during the final game of his quarter-final win against Flavio Cobolli on Wednesday. It was very awkward,” Djokovic said on Wednesday evening. “Obviously, my body is not the same today like it was before, so I guess the real impact or effect of what happened I will feel tomorrow.

Now, she is the youngest American woman to advance to the Wimbledon finals since Serena Williams in 2004. 1, but a lot of people were out cheering for me, so I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone," Anisimova said moments after the hard-fought three-set match, referring to her opponent. "It's been a year turnaround since coming back, so to be in this spot, it's not easy," she continued. "It's been such a privilege to compete here, and to be in the final is just indescribable, honestly." Tennis expert and New York Times sports writer Christopher Clarey pointed out an impressive stat, that Anisimova has won 28 consecutive matches when she has won the opening set. Anisimova will go on to face Belinda Bencic or Iga Swiatek in the women's final on Saturday. This matched Anisimova's best-ever Grand Slam singles result, having previously made it to the 2019 French Open semifinals at Roland-Garros. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events</p>

Djokovic is due to play Jannik Sinner on Friday, after Iga Swiatek and Amanda Anisimova won their semi-finals Day 11 at Wimbledon 2025 saw the semi-finals take place in the women's draw, with Iga Swiatek booking her place in the final after a shock defeat for Aryna Sabalenka. An outstanding Amanda Anisimova surged into her first grand-slam final as she knocked out the world No 1 on Centre Court, the American continuing a dream fortnight on the SW19 grass on the back of a runner-up finish at Queen's. Sabalenka had looked short of her supreme best at times during the tournament, and she was visibly frustrated against Anisimova, in a match disrupted by two fainting fans in the crowd. The five-time major winner needed just one hour and 12 minutes to beat Bencic, winning the second set 6-0 as the clay specialist showed off further improvements on grass. Men's semi-final action will follow on Friday, but Novak Djokovic is an injury doubt for his clash with Jannik Sinner after cancelling a practice on Thursday, while Carlos Alcaraz aims for a third straight Wimbledon final – and title – as he plays Taylor Fritz. Follow all the latest tennis updates, scores and results from Wimbledon below. The 38-year-old suffered an awkward fall very late on in his quarter-final victory over Flavio Cobolli on Wednesday. He picked himself up to finish off the four-set victory but admitted afterwards he would likely not know the full effect until Thursday, and the signs did not appear positive when Djokovic first delayed and then cancelled his scheduled practice session at the All England Club. Swiatek: “I don't think I played Amanda on WTA, we played in juniors, and I mean, she can play amazing tennis and she loves fast surfaces ‘cause she has a flat game – and fast. “So, you'll have to be ready for fast shots, for her being proactive, but I'm just gonna kind of focus on myself, and I'll prepare tactically tomorrow. “We never played a match [on the WTA tour]... but I don't have good memory, so...” No meetings between them at a pro level. Swiatek: “Same as every time, I like to keep my routines, so there's some AC/DC, Guns ‘N' Roses, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones. Everybody's asking me if I listen to that all the time, they keep buying me vinyl records and everything. “And I'm like, ‘Guys, if I would listen to that all the time, I wouldn't be able to sleep,' so it's just pre-match, just to pump myself up. Swiatek: “Honestly, I never even dreamt that it's gonna be possible for me to play in the final. “So, I'm just super excited and just proud of myself, and I don't know... Tennis keeps surprising me. Bencic gets ahead at 15-0, but Swiatek turns the game around for 15-30. But she brings up match point on the next go... Credit to Bencic, who bravely takes on a forehand. Somehow, Swiatek gets it back, and the next shot, but Bencic eventually slams home a smash. She bagels Bencic in the second set, wow. Bencic fights, taking Swiatek to deuce, but the Pole eventually holds. She's one game away from the final. Bencic's return effort is valiant, but the ball floats narrowly long. Bencic with a better serve this time, and Swiatek's return is nowhere. Swiatek's next return fails to beat the net, though. Swiatek saves one game point by pushing Bencic into the corner, where the Swiss stretches and can't get much on her backhand. Double fault, and Swiatek has a break point on advantage... Swiatek's forehand in the corner is just wide. But more poor serving gives Swiatek a break point again, which she takes with a powerful forehand in the corner. Again, Bencic just can't get anything on it. For the second set in a row, Swiatek rushes to 3-0. It would take a tennis miracle for Bencic to pull this one back. But stranger things have happened, it's why we love this sport. Poor Bencic, she can't buy a hold right now. Big forehand into the ad court, however, and she forces Swiatek into a lob that lands long. Two break points... but Swiatek frames a forehand return! But the second break point is converted! Swiatek is racing into the final at this rate. Can she put the first set behind her? Maybe, judging by her ability to bring up two break points here... But with a pair of big serves, Swiatek is able to erase them both! She was stopping mid-ball toss, perhaps looking right into the sun? A fist pump from Swiatek now, as she flings an inside-out forehand into the corner for a winner – and the hold.

The New Jersey native notched her best Grand Slam finish to date.

Amanda Anisimova has advanced to The Wimbledon Championships final after defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

The 23-year-old New Jersey native won 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 37 minutes on Centre Court Thursday.

Tennis expert and New York Times sports writer Christopher Clarey pointed out an impressive stat, that Anisimova has won 28 consecutive matches when she has won the opening set.

On Thursday, that became 29 after the American singles star won the first set against Sabalenka in the Wimbledon semifinals.

This matched Anisimova's best-ever Grand Slam singles result, having previously made it to the 2019 French Open semifinals at Roland-Garros.

As a result, next week, Anisimova will jump into the Top 10 of the PIF WTA Rankings for the first time in her career.

American tennis star Amanda Anisimova upset world No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in three sets to advance to the Wimbledon women's final on Thursday at the All England Club. Anisimova, 23, won 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in a grueling three-set match. The victory for Anisimova sends her to a Grand Slam tournament final for the first time in her career. Amanda Anisimova of the U.S. reacts during the women's singles semifinal match against Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Thursday, July 10, 2025. After losing the second set, Anisimosa had her serve broken at love to begin the third set by Sabalenka and momentum seemed to be slipping away. Sabalenka fell down 5-2 in the third set, but won the next two games to bring it back to 5-4, but Anisimova held on to secure the win. The only other time Anisimova had played in a Grand Slam semifinal prior to her win over Sabalenka was at the 2019 French Open, when she lost as a 17-year-old. Sabalenka had been outstanding at rallying back after dropping the first set in major tournaments as the world No. 1 ranked player was 11-2 in major tournaments when losing the first set going into this match.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Russian star had looked dominant during her opening four matches, defeating Mayar Sherif, Lucia Bronzetti, Hailey Baptiste, and Emma Navarro in straight sets. Qualifying for her first Wimbledon quarterfinal, Andreeva took on Switzerland's Belinda Bencic, a former Olympic gold medallist. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live after the match, 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash gave his verdict on Andreeva's quarterfinal defeat. “[Mirra] Andreeva, she's still young, got plenty of years left ahead of her, but that's a great learning lesson there on how to play on grass courts, how to deal with pressure,” he said. “The team and the stats team have got to sit down with her, and go, what were you doing? “I'm assuming she got the instructions, a good lesson to be learned. Andreeva targeted Bencic's backhand throughout, and the Swiss star was happy to engage in those exchanges, coming out on top most of the time. It's hard to imagine that coach Conchita Martinez would have instructed Andreeva to play into Bencic's hands as much as she did. Andreeva has been considered a future Grand Slam winner for quite some time now, but can she get the job done in 2025? At just 18 years of age, there's no rush, but the youngster will no doubt be targeting major glory at Flushing Meadows in a few months' time. Competing in New York twice previously, Andreeva won two of her four matches, losing her second-round match on both occasions. In 2025, Andreeva has won two ‘big' hard-court titles and is the only player on the WTA Tour to have done so. Improving every time she steps on the court, there's truly no limit to what Andreeva can achieve. A trip to Cincinnati will follow before Andreeva makes her third US Open appearance when the tournament begins on Sunday, August 24.</p>

While attending the 2025 Wimbledon Championships on Wednesday, the British actor - who was accompanied by his wife, Anna Eberstein - seemingly took a nap during the men's singles quarter-final match between Novak Djokovic and Flavio Cobolli, according to multiple videos and photos shared on X. The moment quickly went viral as Grant - who was donning a stylish pair of shades and wearing a dark blue suit - was seated directly behind Queen Camilla. Hugh Grant Blasts His Children's 'Posh Private Schools' For 'Pathetic' Rules "Not convinced Hugh Grant is awake," one viewer wrote on X. "Can someone check on him as he's a National treasure." "Fell asleep in front of the entire UK like it was nothing," another person penned. "Hugh Grant dozing off at Wimbledon is such a classic moment — even the thrill of Centre Court couldn't keep him awake through the match!" Olivia Rodrigo, John Cena, Dave Grohl, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have been spotted sitting in the Royal Box at this year's event. Only after, you kind of look up and take it all in, if they're still there." Original article source: Hugh Grant falls asleep at Wimbledon tennis match while seated behind Queen Camilla</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A look at the winners and losers from this year's Roland-Garros, where Carlos Alcaraz was once again crowned the King of Paris This season, the total prize pool of the French major reached a record €56.352 million, 5.21% more than in 2024. Nothing like this has happened at Grand Slam tournaments since the US Open 2013, and on the Parisian courts, since 1984. The struggle between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz is already being called a new tennis classic. Before the decisive match in Paris, the H2H statistics stood at 8-5 in favor of Alcaraz. On May 18, these tennis players faced off in the Rome Masters final, where Sinner lost to his main competitor (6-7 and 1-6). In the pre-match, Sinner's potential success was quoted at 1.94, while a possible victory for Alcaraz was given the odds of 1.89. Despite a three-month absence from game practice due to disqualification, Jannik won the first two sets in a tough fight (6-4, 7-6) and had already imagined raising the prestigious trophy above his head. However, men's singles in Grand Slam tournaments are played to three victories, while the spectators on the Philippe Chatrier court and fans in front of their screens wanted to enjoy a tense five-set match. During the third tie-break, upset Sinner was losing with a score of 0-7 and ultimately won only two rallies. Alcaraz defended his Roland-Garros title with a fantastic comeback victory but remained the world's No. Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff reached the Roland-Garros final for the first time in their careers. In the following two sets, the American proved that pre-match odds mean nothing in sports. Aryna once again lacked psychological stability, which was reflected in the number of unforced errors — 70 compared to her competitor's 30. The 21-year-old American secured a comeback victory with a total score of 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 and earned €2,550M in prize money. The defeat did not affect Sabalenka's top position in the WTA rankings, and her lead over second-place Gauff is still impressive – almost 3,500 points. Marcel Granollers and Horacio Ceballos specialize in doubles. These tennis players have collectively lost seven Grand Slam finals. On June 7, quantity finally turned into quality – the Spaniard and Argentinean won a major for the first time in their careers, predictably beating the British duo Joe Salisbury / Neal Skupski in the final (6-0, 6-7, 7-5). Last year, Jasmine Paolini reached the Roland-Garros and Wimbledon finals but did not become a champion. This season, the 29-year-old Italian decided to win the Grand Slam alongside her 38-year-old compatriot Sara Errani and achieved her goal. Jasmine and Sara defeated the pair Anna Danilina (Kazakhstan) / Aleksandra Krunic (Serbia) in three sets (6-4, 2-6, 6-1). It is worth noting that the highly experienced Errani took home two trophies from Paris, winning the mixed doubles with Andrea Vavassori. The Polish tennis player has not performed at her best and currently ranks only seventh in the ATP standings. 2 in the most prestigious finals suggest one thing: the French Open 2025 did not reveal any new stars. Novak Djokovic graced the tournament with his presence but lost to Sinner in the semifinals. The Serb's time is over, and his dream of winning the 25th Grand Slam remains unfulfilled. Alexander Zverev crashed out in the quarterfinal stage, and last year's lost final remains the German's highest achievement at a clay major.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chile's Cristian Garin sometimes thinks it would've been better never to win the Roland Garros junior title. “Looking back, it all felt like madness. The pressure that was put on me for free… it was too much,” said the former world No. During Wimbledon 2025, the five-time ATP titles opened up about the expectations placed on him in his home country. “I wish I could've played a bit more calmly, without so much tension,” he confessed. In 2013, Chilean tennis had already spent a few years out of the spotlight after the retirements of Fernando González and Nicolás Massú. So Garín's win over Alexander Zverev in the boys' final in Paris triggered huge — and unrealistic — hopes: “It was almost a problem playing juniors, because that's where a lot of people got to know me.” Garin, 29, reflected on the sacrifice of spending so much time away from his family and friends: “Sometimes you wonder, ‘Is it really worth the effort to be away your whole life? – You made a change, and it showed. You seem to be enjoying it now. – Yes, it was hard, especially at first. People think Challengers are easy to win. They expect you to win everything. – The second tier of the tour is becoming more and more competitive and demanding. Challengers are super competitive, everyone plays at a high level, so you have to go in ultra humble. You're going to fight every opponent, you might run for three hours just to earn 10 or 15 points. That made it hard for me, because getting back to where I wanted to be — where I still want to be — felt so far away. I changed my mindset, started focusing on other things, and I started playing better very quickly. – What kind of things did you start focusing on? I was in pain after every match. Physically I didn't feel fast or explosive. The years go by and you have to improve in every area, because you start to recover a bit more slowly. I've been a professional for 12 or 13 years now. At this stage, I started taking better care of myself and doing things that directly help me perform better. Sometimes you fall into a negative loop and think there's no way out. I also hired Guillermo, my new fitness trainer. He's helped me a lot in shaking off bad thoughts through physical work. The people around me are helping me stay focused on what I have to do. Is that the place you're aiming for? I can't expect to be top 20 after only two months of good work. – Every week I see the chance to get into the tournaments I want to play. Everything is very competitive, but also wide open. Today there are 200 players who could potentially break into the top 20 or 30. You have to be mentally sharp every week, take care of your body, and be ready. 110 right now, and that's the reality I have to live with. It's a lot better than it was two months ago, and I'm grateful for that — but I want to keep working like this and see where I am a year from now. – Did you watch the 2025 Roland Garros final? – And what did you feel watching that level of tennis? – It had been a long time since I got nervous watching other people play tennis, and honestly I was blown away by the level. I loved seeing how the match made headlines around the world — not just among tennis fans. The buzz around that final was incredible, and the level those two guys reached was insane. – Do you want to play against Alcaraz and Sinner? But I know this is a new beginning for me. I need to be consistent for at least a year and then see what happens. I know them — Alcaraz and Sinner have been working incredibly for four or five years. Their discipline is out of this world. Even at such a young age, they inspire my whole generation. I pay attention to that and take a lot from both of them. They're true sporting role models in every sense. – A few weeks ago, you spoke on a podcast about the pressure you felt in the months and years following your junior title at Roland Garros. You were champion competing against players like Alexander Zverev, Nick Kyrgios and Borna Coric. It's been 12 years since that title. How do you look back on that stage now? – I look back and feel like it was all madness. I think it was a stage that taught me a lot over time, but back then I wish I could have played a bit more calmly, with less tension. You're there without financial support, paying for everything yourself, my parents helping me out. They didn't have any experience in the sports world, so it was like adding another problem to the situation. – People were paying close attention to you from a very young age. I love playing here in the Wimbledon qualies and having 50 people cheering for me. But back then, it was strange to feel the negativity, the harsh criticism, especially for a 17-year-old. – Yes, I did think that a few times. I told myself that maybe playing juniors had actually been a problem, because that's where a lot of people got to know me. I had—how do you say it?—I don't know if it was the potential to become a superstar, but definitely to be top 20, to win titles, which is what I eventually did. My family isn't from the sporting world, they never put pressure on me, they supported me in everything. So I didn't really have a guide at the time, and maybe that made things harder. The junior circuit is strange, because it guarantees you nothing. And being South American makes it even tougher. I think the difference I see between players like me and those who have been more consistent with a similar level comes down to decision-making. Many of them made better choices than I did or had better people around them from an early age, and that makes a huge difference. And in Chile or South America, that's not easy to find. But I learned from every mistake. – What are you thankful to tennis for? – I'm grateful that it taught me to reinvent myself in very difficult moments. Obviously, there have been things in my career that I've never talked about—and I don't feel like talking about them now. But tennis has always taught me that it's possible to move forward, that the effort is worth it, and that bad times don't last forever. – Where do you see yourself in 20 years? – Honestly, right now I have no idea. I'm just trying to live day by day and let things happen as they will. – And are you enjoying single life? – I've gone through some tough personal times recently in parallel with tennis. So I've been very focused on bouncing back and figuring out how to get back up. I've put a lot of time into that. And if you're with someone, things have to be flowing. There have to be good things happening. – Carlos Alcaraz made headlines by talking about how important going out and partying can be. How do you feel about that? Do you need a good party every now and then to clear your head? I really enjoy being with them. As athletes, we miss birthdays and so many events. And sometimes you ask yourself: is it really worth being away all the time? It's been years on the road, travelling. Obviously with some control, always remembering I'm a tennis player. Some people don't like it, they don't even drink alcohol, and of course I respect that. But for me, going out, being with friends, disconnecting a bit—it helps take off some of that constant pressure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lindsay Davenport has emerged to laud Iga Swiatek for the tweak she's made at Wimbledon this year. Despite being a junior champion at this event, the grass had inexplicably not been working for her, routinely failing to translate her form from a French Open title, usually, to this new surface. In Davenport's eyes, the bulk of this success can be attributed to one key alteration. Davenport led the praise, offering one potential reason for this upturn in form. She admitted: “It's interesting, because I actually thought she was going to go into Wimbledon really down, based on not winning Roland Garros again. “She's liked her draw here, but honestly, she's been more aggressive this year than we've ever seen her be at Wimbledon. Something has clicked and maybe that was her coach Wim kind of encouraging her, Hey, if you're gonna go down, you gotta go down swinging and trying to take balls early. Realistically, a player of Swiatek's calibre should always have the capabilities to perform on any surface. Her relentless running and bruising hitting would trouble most on grass, hard or clay courts, and yet the former has always been the one that got away. If anything, this year's Wimbledon run only reinforces the suggestion that the only thing holding her back was her own mindset. Speaking after one win, she admitted: “Honestly, it is much more fun [on the grass] this year. It really feels like since then, Swiatek actually believes in herself not just to perform on this surface, but to genuinely challenge for the Wimbledon title.</p>
