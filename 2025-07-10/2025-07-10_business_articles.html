That said, this isn't a good fit for power users who like to multitask with lots of apps open at once. Its display is decent with reasonably fast performance for a low price. The M4 MacBook Pro comes with 16GB of RAM standard, compared to the 8GB standard in previous generations, which is more appropriate for demanding workloads. Anyone running on older M1 or Intel MacBook Pros will experience notable performance gains with the M4 model. The newest MacBook Air is powered by an M4 chip for ultimate speed and efficiency.

It is available in 16 GB or 24GB memory configurations with up to 512GB of storage. One of the biggest differences is that gaming laptops have more powerful graphics cards (GPUs), components that let them play modern games with realistic visuals. These laptops are great for users who want to play games, edit 4K videos, and quickly switch between dozens of apps. More typical laptops can have a range of CPUs, from basic to advanced, to power productivity apps like a web browser or the Microsoft Office suite. They usually have integrated graphics rather than powerful GPUs but offer significantly better battery life, as well as lighter and more portable designs. But they're often outfitted with customizable lights that give the keyboard and chassis a sleek neon glow. When it comes to price, the most powerful gaming laptops are far more expensive than any other kind of laptop. But it's not hard to find more affordable options, and many budget gaming laptops can still play all your favorite games, albeit with some performance caveats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's budget chief on Thursday said that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell "has grossly mismanaged the Fed" and suggested he had misled Congress about a pricey and "ostentatious" renovation of the central bank's headquarters. The broadside by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought opened up a new front in Trump's war of words against Powell. Trump has repeatedly called on the Fed chairman to cut interest rates, without success. He reportedly has considered firing Powell and, more recently, publicly naming the chairman's replacement months earlier than the end of Powell's term next spring. Vought's letter raises the question of whether Trump will seek to remove Powell for cause, at least ostensibly. But the Supreme Court in a recent decision strongly suggested that Federal Reserve board members have special protection from being fired by a president. "Now up to $2.5 billion, roughly $700 million over its initial cost," Vought wrote. "The cost per square foot is $1,923--double the cost for renovating an ordinary historic federal building. The Palace of Versailles would have cost $3 billion in today's dollars!" Vought's tweet linked to a letter he sent Powell that referenced the Fed boss's June 25 testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. "Your testimony raises serious questions about the project's compliance with the National Capital Planning Act, which requires that projects like the Fed headquarters renovation be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission," Vought wrote. "The plans for this project called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more," he wrote. But Powell, in his testimony, said, "There's no VIP dining room. "Although minor deviations from approved plans may be inevitable, your testimony appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan with regard to major design elements," Vought wrote. The letter asked Powell to respond to 11 questions about the renovation project within seven business days. The Federal Reserve declined to comment on Vought's letter. We want to hear from you.

DEI Backlash:

JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the Democratic Party went too far in its focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, prioritizing ideology over practical solutions.

“I have a lot of friends who are Democrats, and they're idiots,” Dimon said Thursday at a foreign-ministry event in Dublin. “I always say they have big hearts and little brains. They do not understand how the real world works. Almost every single policy rolled out failed.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The moves came after President Donald Trump said late Wednesday that a 50% U.S. tariff on imported copper will take effect Aug. 1. Trump also announced a 50% tariff on Brazil partly in retaliation for the current trial against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for his role in an alleged attempt to overturn the country's 2022 election results. The move was also due to the "very unfair trade relationship" with Brazil, Trump added, saying it has been "far from Reciprocal." Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva later said that the country would respond to the 50% levy in accordance with its economic reciprocity law. Prior to the president's announcement of levies on Brazil, he sent letters that dictated new U.S. rates on the imports of at least seven additional countries. He had also sent letters laying out new rates earlier this week to the leaders of 14 other countries, such as Japan and South Korea. Despite the increasing trade tensions, U.S. markets have been able to march to record highs, recovering from steep losses suffered in the spring. "It is wild to think that valuations are above where we started the year considering all the uncertainties with tariffs, and we now have a new deadline. Wall Street also saw gains during Wednesday's session. Those gains were spurred by optimism around the artificial intelligence trade, which sent Nvidia shares nearly 2% higher to briefly become the first public company to be valued at $4 trillion. Read the full list of stocks moving here. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) was last trading 0.6% higher on Thursday, and pacing for a week-to-date gain of 1.2%. This also puts the exchange-traded fund on pace for its seventh straight weekly gain. This would mark its longest such streak since an 8-week rally ended in early March 2019. The ETF hit a new all-time high on Thursday. The fund has been driven higher by gains in Nvidia, which has added 2.4% this week and crossed over the $4 trillion market capitalization level on Wednesday. In a Thursday note, UBS stood by its positive stance on emerging market assets. The bank maintained its neutral rating on emerging market equities, noting that it sees "decent mid-single-digit upside" in the next 12 months. "As investors seek to broaden their sources of return, emerging markets offer access to unique macro and policy cycles, structural growth opportunities, and diversification benefits — especially amid rising geopolitical fragmentation and shifting supply chains," the bank wrote. "Emerging market equities remain under-owned and have only recently begun to attract inflows, which could support a more constructive medium-term outlook for the asset class." Specifically, UBS singled out the secular growth stories in Taiwan and India. "We also like mainland China's tech sector due to its resilient earnings and monetization potential, as well as Brazil given attractive valuations and solid economic growth," the bank added. The bank set a price target of $110 per share, implying upside of 27% from the stock's Wednesday closing price. As a catalyst, Bank of America cited improving demand in Asia that could help drive Estée Lauder's sales growth and margin expansion. There's good news ahead for the M&A market, according to Deutsche Bank. Going forward, Deutsche Bank is also optimistic on the state of new listings and initial public offerings in the U.S. "New listings show some green shoots in absolute terms and this underscores relative U.S. exceptionalism. The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) was trading 4.4% higher on Thursday, and hit its highest level since 2011. The exchange-traded fund was on pace for its best day since April 9, when it gained 9.7% in a session. However, the firm noted that this weakening was unlikely to be too substantial. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 43 points, or 0.1%. Initial unemployment benefit filings unexpectedly declined last week as the pace of layoffs held low, the Labor Department reported Thursday. However, continuing claims, which run a week behind, continued to climb. Check out some of the companies making headlines in premarket trading. Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials surged 41% in Thursday's premarket trading session after the company announced that the Defense Department will become its largest shareholder. The Pentagon will buy a newly created class of preferred shares that can be converted into the company's common stock. MP Materials will use the proceeds to invest in its magnet production capacity and to expand its rare earths processing capabilities. Shares of Delta Air Lines jumped about 11% premarket after the company reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and CEO Ed Bastian said bookings have stabilized. Delta had pulled its outlook for the year in April. Bank of America expects firmer inflation on the horizon. "We expect inflation to accelerate over the coming months in large part due to tariff related price increases," wrote economist Stephen Juneau. The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) dropped more than 1.8% in the premarket after President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva responded by saying his country will respond with similar tariffs targeting U.S. products going into Brazil. The S&P 500's information technology and industrial sectors rose to close at records on Wednesday, lifting the broad market index to its first winning day in three. The tech sector gained 0.9%, catching a tailwind from gains in Nvidia, which was up nearly 2%, and Palantir, which added about 2.5%. Nvidia's ascent briefly pushed it into a $4 trillion market capitalization during the session. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday the U.S. will impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, partially due to the trial against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for his role in an alleged coup attempt to overturn his loss in the country's 2022 election. In a letter shared on Truth Social, Trump called Brazil's treatment of Bolsonaro "an international disgrace" and the ongoing prosecution a "Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!" The flagship cryptocurrency has been trading in a tight range for several weeks despite billions of dollars flowing into bitcoin exchange traded funds and public companies racheting up their bitcoin purchases. "The same fundamentals of a scarce asset are at play amid record-breaking budgets and debt ceilings," said Chris Kline, chief operating officer and cofounder of BitcoinIRA. "There is a friendly regulatory environment, and bitcoin has gained legitimacy from institutional adoption. Additionally, the rumor mill has continued to accelerate speculation that Fed Chair Jerome Powell may either step down or be removed, which has crypto bulls excited about a potential rate cut." "This is a perfect storm for even the smallest catalyst to springboard bitcoin and crypto overall to new price discovery levels and ... more volatility," he added. Some stocks are making big moves in extended trading Wednesday: WK Kellogg – Shares surged more than 55% after The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that chocolate maker Ferrero is nearing a deal to buy the breakfast food company for about $3 billion. On Wednesday, PTC shares soared more than 17% after a Bloomberg report, which cited people familiar with the matter, said that Autodesk is exploring a possible takeover of the company. U.S. stock futures were relatively unchanged on Wednesday evening. S&P 500 futures hovered around the flatline just after 6 p.m. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were likewise flat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company is expanding its robotaxi service area and bringing xAI's Grok to vehicles as it rolled out a new iteration of the artificial intelligence chatbot. Musk said on X that Grok, his AI chatbot that praised Adolf Hitler and posted a barrage of antisemitic comments recently, will be available in Tesla vehicles "next week at the latest." In response to a user post on his social media platform X, Musk said the company is expanding its Austin, Texas, robotaxi service area this weekend. He also said Tesla is awaiting regulatory approval for a launch in the Bay Area "probably in a month or two." The expansion of robotaxi and Grok integration comes at a fraught time for Musk and his empire. Tesla set its annual shareholder meeting for Nov. 6, a Thursday filing showed. Its last shareholder meeting was in June 2024, as Musk established himself as a major backer of President Donald Trump's reelection campaign. Musk later led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. After stepping down from DOGE at the end of May, Musk has openly feuded with Trump on social media over the major tax bill, with the president suggesting the government look at cutting contracts for Musk's companies. Shares have tanked from their post-election high over investor concerns that the public fight could hamper Tesla. Slowing sales and rising competition also stifled some investor appetite. Tesla shares fell Monday, with the company losing $68 billion in value after Musk continued to blast Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" and said he was establishing his own political party, the "America Party." On Wednesday, Linda Yaccarino stepped down as CEO of his social media platform X, leaving the world's richest man with a major position to fill at one of his companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The spending and tax megabill President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 contains a number of provisions that will change the way students and their families pay for higher education. Aimed at reducing federal spending, the bill reshapes the current student loan landscape by placing limits on borrowing and reducing the number of repayment options available for some current and future federal student loan borrowers. While former President Joe Biden focused on debt forgiveness and trying to help current borrowers afford their monthly payments, President Donald Trump and his administration have prioritized ensuring borrowers pay back their debts and stopping the nation's massive student debt load from growing. Here are three key ways the bill will change how students pay for college. Effective July 1, 2026, the bill places lower limits on how much graduate and professional students can take out in federal loans. Grad students will have an annual limit of $20,500, while professional students, like those in medical or law school, can borrow up to $50,000 a year. Over the course of their studies, graduate students can borrow a maximum of $100,000 in federal loans and professional students can borrow up to $200,000. The law eliminates Grad PLUS loans, which have allowed students to borrow up to the total cost of their education, minus any federal aid. Beginning in July 2026, no new Grad PLUS loans will be disbursed. Current borrowers will be able to continue borrowing with the current loan limits and Grad PLUS loan availability through the end of their studies. The law also allows academic institutions to set their own, program-specific borrowing limits beginning July 1, 2026. Pell Grants are federal student aid awards that help low-income students pay for college. The new legislation doesn't change the maximum Pell Grant award — which is determined by Congress each year — but places a new limit on Pell Grant awards starting in July 2026. The Student Aid Index is a figure calculated when a student and their family fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and is used by the Department of Education and academic institutions to determine students' aid eligibility. The law also requires that foreign income be included when determining students' Pell Grant eligibility. The legislation creates a new workforce Pell Grant program that allows students enrolling in workforce training programs, like HVAC, at community colleges to receive Pell Grants to help cover their costs beginning on July 1, 2026. Qualifying programs must lead to a "portable" credential recipients can use with more than one employer. Students who take out federal student loans on or after July 1, 2026 will have just two repayment options when it's time to start paying back their loans: The new standard repayment plan will have borrowers make fixed monthly payments for a term ranging from 10 to 25 years, depending on the amount they borrowed. The Repayment Assistance Plan will set monthly payments between 1% and 10% of a borrower's adjusted gross income minus $50 a month for every dependent the borrower claims on their taxes. Payments for each income group will calculated be as follows: Additionally, borrowers with loans disbursed on July 1, 2027 and after will not have access to economic hardship or unemployment deferments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the process, he has shaken up CNBC's annual competitiveness ranking, America's Top States for Business. 1 state and a top three finisher in each of the last five years, slips to fourth place in 2025 — its worst showing since 2018 — and cedes the No. Economy is the heaviest weighted category in the study under this year's methodology as more states pitch themselves as safe havens in a potential downturn. Virginia is already seeing a small downturn of sorts, as the Trump administration sets out to slash the federal workforce. That hits The Old Dominion where it lives. The federal government accounted for more than 144,000 jobs in Virginia last year, according to the Congressional Research Service. That is a larger percentage of the workforce than any state except Maryland and Hawaii. And that doesn't include Virginians who work for federal contractors, or commute to federal jobs elsewhere in the D.C. metro area. Include all of those, and the number approaches 300,000. In May, Virginia was one of only three states whose unemployment rate rose from the prior month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state is still adding jobs each month, albeit at a slower pace than last year, and Virginia's 3.4% unemployment rate in May was still below the national average. "Virginia has been an economy, historically, that is pretty resilient," he said. "But now, we're seeing something quite different, where Virginia is seeing some job losses, or at least job stagnation, whereas the nation as a whole is still creating jobs." While Scorsone said those job losses will occur primarily in the federal sector, he also sees a ripple effect. "Things like leisure and accommodations," he said. "As people lose jobs, they're going to spend less on those things, [and] maybe in retail," he added. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, says the state can absorb those federal job cuts. In February, the state launched a web site, VirginiaHasJobs.com, targeting displaced workers with job listings and other resources from across the state. "We have 250,000 open jobs posted that are unfilled. A recent check of the site showed that the number of openings has shrunk to 199,000 as jobs have been filled and private sector hiring has slowed. That still would appear to be more than enough for the federal workers likely to be displaced. But Scorsone said it is not that simple. "Virginia's federal workforce is different than, say, other states. Our workforce tends to be highly educated, professional executive level," he said. "Many of the jobs that are open may be in different sectors, like health care. You can't just easily move into a health care job if that's not your area of expertise," he added. In his CNBC appearance in April, Youngkin acknowledged the likelihood that the state will lose jobs, and that the private sector alternatives will not be an exact fit for many displaced government employees. "They're high paying, good jobs that require someone to possibly get some retraining or re-skilling, or go into a new field, but they're really good jobs." Youngkin said the budget cuts, and job losses, are necessary. "We need to rein in spending and re-establish fiscal reality back into the federal government," he said, adding that Virginia goes into the upheaval from a position of strength. Over time, no state has performed better than Virginia in the CNBC rankings. But in 2025, with economic anxiety rising, Virginia's economic situation is just shaky enough to take it down a few pegs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google has long been revered within Silicon Valley for its generous compensation packages, and its DeepMind unit even resorted to aggressive noncompetes in the UK. At the same time, Google has made changes to its compensation processes in recent months as others in the tech industry — such as Meta and Microsoft — have sought to weed out low performers. Its head of compensation told staff in a memo that "high performance is more important than ever," Business Insider previously reported. While Google keeps salary data confidential, publicly available work-visa data can provide a glimpse into how much it pays for certain roles. The figures are derived from filings that all companies submit to the Labor Department to obtain work visas for foreign workers. It's worth noting that these figures reflect only salaries and don't account for the equity or bonuses that Google employees also receive. In 2023, BI obtained an internal spreadsheet where thousands of Googlers self-reported their 2022 pay, including some equity and bonus data. Despite the relatively high sums, many said they still felt underpaid. Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Here's what Google is paying across key roles, based on roughly 6,800 applications from the first quarter of 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla risks violating a corporate governance rule in Texas, and shareholders are sounding the alarm. The EV maker, which was incorporated in the state of Texas in 2024 after leaving Delaware, has yet to schedule its annual shareholder meeting, which by state law must occur within 13 months of the last one. In a letter obtained by Business Insider sent four days ahead of the deadline, a group of investors managing $1.5 trillion in collective assets is demanding that Tesla publicly announce an "Annual General Meeting" date, disclose access details, and give shareholders "sufficient time and information to engage meaningfully in the governance process." "As fiduciaries, we believe strong corporate governance and responsive board oversight are foundational to long-term company success." The letter is signed by 27 shareholders, including multiple large pension funds and state treasurers, such as New York City Comptroller Brad S. Lander, Oregon State Treasurer Elizabeth Steiner, and State of Maryland Comptroller Brooke E. Lierman. International funds from Denmark and Sweden, such as the Friends Fiduciary Corporation, a Quaker-aligned investment firm, have also signed on. Kevin Thomas, CEO of Shareholder Association for Research and Education, the main signatory of the letter, told Business Insider that he has yet to hear back from Tesla. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Thomas, in charge of the Canada-based advocacy group that advises funds with $150 billion in assets, told BI that corporations usually provide notice at least two weeks ahead of a meeting, but Tesla has yet to do so "as the clock starts to tick." "So that's why we want to have the meeting, not just because we like going to meetings, but because we actually think there are things that need to be discussed with shareholders in a transparent and accountable way." "I'll just say this, that shareholders shouldn't have to rely on courts to enforce basic rights," Thomas added of Tesla. For Tesla, that would be Travis County, where its Gigafactory Texas is located. Tesla moved its headquarters to Texas from California in late 2021 after CEO Elon Musk expressed dissatisfaction with the Golden State's COVID-19 policies and housing costs for employees. Tesla shares are down nearly 40% compared to their peak in December 2024, and down around 30% since President Donald Trump's inauguration day. Analysts have recently written that investors are "growing tired" of Musk's political activities, which are seen as a distraction from his company. This follows the billionaire's public split from Trump and his recent announcement of a new political party.</p>
