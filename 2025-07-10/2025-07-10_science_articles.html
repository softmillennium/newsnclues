                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Day is underway, and we're seeing sizeable deals on Apple tech. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. We're seeing massive price cuts on all sorts of Apple products, including AirPods, Beats headphones, iPads, and more. While this year's Prime Day spans four whole days—running today through July 11—we don't recommend waiting to shop if you spot a deal you love. In past years, popular items like AirPods and iPads have sold out almost immediately. And with the ongoing (and uneven) tariff situation looming over our heads, now is as good a time as ever to stock up on Apple essentials while they're below retail. Because, at this juncture, even retail might be a steal. I'm particularly fond of the deals on audio: The Apple AirPod Pro 2s are already 40 percent off, which is $100 off their normal price. Not to mention $149 is the lowest price we've ever seen. If you're looking for earbuds with unmatched noise-cancellation, I couldn't recommend these more, especially if you're someone who likes to listen at work or in the gym. My go-to over-ear headphones, the Beats Solo 4, are now 51 percent off. I can wear these all day long without even realizing they're on my head. One of my favorite Prime Day deals is $150 off the brand new Apple 2025 M4 MacBook Air. This laptop was just released back in April, and to get it $150 off within the first few months is an incredible deal. Save $120 on the latest Apple Watch Series 10, featuring a larger display, advanced health metrics, and enhanced durability. The simpler Apple Watch SE—a perfect starter smart watch—is currently also 32 percent off and under $200. He has a strong affinity for cats, Batman, and early 90's Nicolas Cage films, in that order.

Despite dealing with extremely cold temperatures, food scarcity, and long-term radiation exposure, the Chernobyl dogs aren't just surviving—they're thriving. Andrew and John investigate how the dogs that live closest to the reactor have developed genetic traits distinct from other dogs in nearby regions. But the changes don't seem to come from radiation damage; instead, scientists say the animals are adapting through natural selection and sheer toughness passed down across generations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shop drones during Prime Day for close to half off. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. With warm weather and blue skies looking like they are here to stay (for a few months, at least), nab yourself a drone you can fly freely in the open air. Drones are great gadgets for both the casual flier who wants to capture a few fun videos and zoom around to their heart's content, as well as for videographers and filmmakers looking to capture aerial shots or high-speed action. Drones, especially ones with strong wind resistance, high-quality cameras, and agile maneuverability, can be quite expensive. Even more affordable models cost a few hundred dollars. During Prime Day, you can grab a top-rated drone for hundreds of dollars off the original price. So, unlike previous years where sales come and go so quickly, you may miss out, this Prime Day gives you time to find the right product, compare it to a few others, and grab it when you've made your decision. That said, many of these drones are at the best price we've seen all year, so don't miss out on your chance to get a model you like before it reverts to full price. In fact, some of the drones are ones we've tested out and reviewed ourselves. DJI's Air 3 might be a little more expensive than other deals on this list, but the brand is no joke. DJI almost single-handedly swept our list of the best drones due to the consistently high quality of its cameras, motors, and controls. The medium tele camera is great for traditional shots and high-resolution close-ups, while the wide-angle camera captures massive landscapes and sweeping shots from a high vantage point. The drone is also capable of taking off at altitudes of up to 6,000 meters, allowing you to take it on hikes, through hills, and even on snowy slopes. If you're looking for a beginner-focused model, we like the Ruko U11 Mini. This already more affordable model is on sale for nearly 50 percent off its original price, further reducing the cost. This model also weighs less than 250 grams, which means you don't need any FAA registration to operate it. The purchase also comes with a remote control, cables to connect your phone to the remote control, extra propellers, three rechargeable batteries, and a carrying case. If you're less interested in flying it around on your own and just want quality video, the HoverAir X1 offers numerous easy-to-use video and flying modes that help you record solid footage without requiring top-notch aerial control. All we had to do was press which mode we wanted, and the drone would orbit us, follow us, or even zoom out. Also on sale are quality options from both Potensic and Holy Stone, which both have models we recommend on our overall best drones list and best drones for beginners list, respectively.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For people with Type 1 diabetes, developing hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is an ever-present threat. When glucose levels become extremely low, it creates a life-threatening situation for which the standard treatment of care is injecting a hormone called glucagon. As an emergency backup, for cases where patients may not realize that their blood sugar is dropping to dangerous levels, MIT engineers have designed an implantable reservoir that can remain under the skin and be triggered to release glucagon when blood sugar levels get too low. This approach could also help in cases where hypoglycemia occurs during sleep, or for diabetic children who are unable to administer injections on their own. "This is a small, emergency-event device that can be placed under the skin, where it is ready to act if the patient's blood sugar drops too low," says Daniel Anderson, a professor in MIT's Department of Chemical Engineering, a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), and the senior author of the study. We think this can also help relieve the fear of hypoglycemia that many patients, and their parents, suffer from." The researchers showed that this device could also be used to deliver emergency doses of epinephrine, a drug that is used to treat heart attacks and can also prevent severe allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock. Siddharth Krishnan, a former MIT research scientist who is now an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University, is the lead author of the study, which was published on July 9 in Nature Biomedical Engineering. Most patients with type 1 diabetes use daily insulin injections to help their body absorb sugar and prevent their blood sugar levels from getting too high. However, if their blood sugar levels get too low, they develop hypoglycemia, which can lead to confusion and seizures, and may be fatal if it goes untreated. To combat hypoglycemia, some patients carry preloaded syringes of glucagon, a hormone that stimulates the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream. However, it isn't always easy for people, especially children, to know when they are becoming hypoglycemic. "Some patients can sense when they're getting low blood sugar, and go eat something or give themselves glucagon," Anderson says. This is also a problem when patients sleep, as they are reliant on glucose sensor alarms to wake them when sugar drops dangerously low." The reservoir is sealed with a special material known as a shape-memory alloy, which can be programmed to change its shape when heated. Like many other protein or peptide drugs, glucagon tends to break down quickly, so the liquid form can't be stored long-term in the body. Each device can carry either one or four doses of glucagon, and it also includes an antenna tuned to respond to a specific frequency in the radiofrequency range. Because the device can receive wireless signals, it could also be designed so that drug release is triggered by a glucose monitor when the wearer's blood sugar drops below a certain level. "In this case, the continuous glucose-monitoring technology that a lot of patients use is something that would be easy for these types of devices to interface with." Within less than 10 minutes of activating the drug release, blood sugar levels began to level off, allowing them to remain within the normal range and avert hypoglycemia. They found that within 10 minutes of drug release, epinephrine levels in the bloodstream became elevated and heart rate increased. "The idea is you would have enough doses that can provide this therapeutic rescue event over a significant period of time. We don't know exactly what that is -- maybe a year, maybe a few years, and we're currently working on establishing what the optimal lifetime is. But then after that, it would need to be replaced," Krishnan says. "It's really exciting to see our team accomplish this, which I hope will someday help diabetic patients and could more broadly provide a new paradigm for delivering any emergency medicine," says Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and an author of the paper.

Nature Catalysis (2025)Cite this article Efficient biomimetic reactions provide a powerful platform for producing bioactive chiral compounds. Chiral β-hydroxy-α-amino acids display exceptionally high bioactivity and are key functional components of many marketed drugs. However, the efficient synthesis of chiral β-hydroxy-α-amino acids remains a long-standing challenge for both chemical and biological syntheses. Chemical synthesis is problematic due to low step- and atom-efficiencies, high costs and environmental hazards. The enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine can make β-hydroxy-α-amino acids in one step, but it is constrained by issues such as limited substrate scope, unsatisfactory stereoselectivity and low conversion. Here we have successfully realized the biomimetic aldol reaction of glycinate with aldehydes, using 0.01–1.0 mol% of a chiral pyridoxal as the catalyst to produce a remarkably broad range of chiral β-hydroxy-α-amino esters. Moreover, a high-diversity parallel asymmetric synthesis has also been tested using over 1,100 aldehydes and it yielded over 1,700 chiral β-hydroxy-α-amino acid esters, demonstrating its important potential for drug innovation.

Nature Communications volume 16, Article number: 6349 (2025) Cite this article Borylation chemistry plays a crucial role in the development of new synthetic methodologies. However, the reactivity of zinc-boryl species has not been fully explored, particularly in relation to diverse reaction pathways. Here we show that a zinc-boryl species is successfully synthesized from bis(catecholato)diboron, exhibiting amphiphilic reactivity. This compound acts as a nucleophilic boron anion with methyl iodide and as an electrophile with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, facilitating zinc-boron bond dissociation and generating zinc-carbon and zinc-nitrogen bonds while cleaving carbon-nitrogen double bonds. The enhanced reactivity is likely due to the stronger covalency of the zinc-boron bond. Additionally, the zinc-boryl compound promotes the catalytic diborylation of azobenzene, underscoring its versatility as a reactive intermediate. Density functional theory studies illuminate the electronic structure and reactivity of the zinc-boron bond, providing insights into potential applications in synthetic chemistry. Organozinc compounds have become ubiquitous and versatile intermediates, finding widespread applications in synthetic chemistry1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Common zinc-carbon bonded reagents, such as ZnEt₂, serve as mild carbon-centered nucleophiles in organic synthesis8,9,10,11. Recently, there has been a growing interest in a new class of heteroatom-zinc species, where the heteroatom introduces unique reactivity to the Zn-heteroatom bond12,13,14,15. Boron, with its empty 2p orbital when it is three-coordinated, presents a particularly attractive option16,17,18. The Zn-B bonds present in zinc-boryl compounds can potentially provide access to nucleophilic boryl anions and unlock new reactivity modes. However, structurally characterized zinc-boryl species are extremely rare. Their synthesis has generally relied on nitrogen-stabilized bulky boryl frameworks, all of which utilized lithium boryl compounds as precursors. Furthermore, these zinc-boryl reagents have been demonstrated to show limited reactivity with small electrophiles, likely due to the presence of bulky groups on the boryl ligand. These groups can also hinder the reactivity of the empty p orbital at the boron atom. On the other hand, Zinc-boryl compounds prepared from diboron esters (such as B2pin2, B2cat2) have been proposed as catalytically active species for various borylation reactions22,23,24,25,26. Therefore, it is of great interest to synthesize such a zinc-boryl ester complex and further investigate its synthetic applications. a reported examples of zinc-boryl compounds; b zinc-bornic ester compounds; c zinc-boryl compound reported in this work. In the literature, stable metal-boryl bonds can also be achieved by installing bulky ligands at the metal sites27. Based on this, NHC-carbene stabilized copper- and gold-boryl complexes have been successfully isolated28,29,30,31. Previously, attempts to isolate Zn-boryl complexes derived from diboron esters with NHC carbene ligands resulted in decomposed zinc powder and a minor product involving a Zn-inserted NHC ring product32. Moreover, the bulky β-diketiminate species proved to be an ideal ligand for stabilizing low-valent metals, highly reactive low-coordinate species, and metal-boryl complexes33,34,35,36,37,38. Inspired by these achievements, we envisioned preparing a stable Zn-B bond by introducing a β-diketiminate-based ligand at the zinc site, thus enhancing the reactivity of the Zn-B bond. During the review process of this manuscript, the Aldridge group reported a Zn-Bpin bonded compound, and its DMAP adduct has been fully characterized (Fig. In this work, we successfully synthesized a zinc-boryl compound 1 starting from the common diboron ester, B2cat2 (Fig. Compound 1 demonstrates the ability to act as a nucleophilic Bcat anion, engaging productively with an electrophilic partner. Furthermore, this zinc-boryl species exhibited a rich diverse reactivity profile, undergoing transformations with N-containing unsaturated substrates such as carbodiimide, azo benzenes, and isonitriles. Notably, compound 1 was also found to be a competent catalyst in diboration processes. Besides, DFT computation studies were carried out to understand the reaction mechanism. The zinc amido compound 2 was chosen as the starting material12, as its reaction with B2cat2 generates stable B-N bonded products, which might be a driving force for the formation of the Zn-B bond. Indeed, treatment of compound 2 and B2cat2 at room temperature in toluene afforded the desired zinc boryl product 1 in a 53% isolated yield (Fig. The11B NMR of 1 shows a broad singlet at 39 ppm, indicating the presence of a three-coordinated boron moiety. Furthermore, the formation of the Zn-B bond was unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis (Fig. The crystals of 1 were obtained from a hexane solution, exhibiting a dimeric structure. The zinc atom exhibits a Zn-O interaction distance of 2.325(1) Å, which is notably longer than typical Zn–O coordination bonds (generally <2.15 Å)40,41. This extended bond arises from a weak coordination interaction involving the oxygen atom of the Bcat group, resulting in the formation of a six-membered ring structure that stabilizes the dimeric assembly. In contrast, in toluene solution, it forms a monomer, as supported by single-crystal X-ray analysis (see Supplementary Fig. However, both crystals obtained from the hexane or toluene solutions show the same signal in1H NMR (see Supplementary Fig. The DOSY NMR results confirm that compound 1 exists as a monomer in the C6D6 solution (see Supplementary Fig. The Zn-B bond length of compound 1 (2.055(1) Å) is close to that of N-heterocyclic boryl zinc species (2.052, 2.075 Å)19,20,21, but the distance is slightly longer than the Cu-boryl complexes(average 1.990 Å)19,28,42,43,44,45,46. a Synthesis of Zinc-boryl compound 1; b Molecular structure of the dimer of compound 1. (thermal ellipsoids are set at the 30% probability level, hydrogen atoms are omitted and the side Dipp parts are set as sticks model for clarity). Metal boryl complexes serve as essential reactive intermediates or catalysts in the formation of various borylated reagents used in organic synthesis47,48,49,50,51,52. The reactivity of the metal-boron bond is crucial for the further transformation. To gain deeper insights into the Zn-B bond in compound 1, DFT computation studies were carried out (Fig. 3) at the BP86 level of theory (see Supplementary information). The computed molecule is a simplified model of 1 by substituting dipp groups with 2,6-dimethyl phenyl moieties. Figure 3 shows the natural localized molecular orbital (NLMO) calculated for the Zn(II)-boryl complex 1, describing the Zn-B sigma bonding interaction. For comparison, Fig. 3 also presented the corresponding NLMO calculated for the closely related Mg(II)-boryl species, [HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2Mg(DMAP)(Bpin). The NLMO plots clearly indicated that when compared to the Mg-B sigma bond, the Zn-B sigma bond contains a greater orbital contribution from the metal center. Furthermore, the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis revealed that the boron atom carries a charge of +0.478, which is higher than that of magnesium (+0.382) and lithium boryl species (+0.072)3,52,53. Meanwhile, the zinc metal center in compound 1 carries a charge of 0.950, indicating a more covalent character of the Zn-B bond compared with the known magnesium and lithium boryl species. To further support the covalent nature of the Zn–B bonding interaction in 1, we performed Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Principal Interacting Orbital (PIO) analyses. Both the molecular graph from QTAIM and the PIO results indicate that the Zn–B bond exhibits covalent character. The results of these analyses are provided in the Supplementary Information. The natural localized molecular orbital (NLMO) plots showing the orbital characters related to the metal-B sigma bonds for 1 (left) and the closely related Mg(II)-boryl species, [HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2Mg(DMAP)(Bpin) (right). DFT computation studies were carried out at the BP86 level of theory. The reaction of compound 1 with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) afforded a product, compound 3, where the DMAP unit was coordinated to the zinc atom, as confirmed by X-ray single-crystal analysis (Fig. This observation implies that the zinc metal center in compound 1 is more electrophilic compared to the boryl group, which is consistent with the DFT computational results discussed above. a Reaction of compound 1 with DMAP; b Reaction of compound 1 with MeI; c Reaction of compound 1 with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (Molecular structure of compounds 6 and 5: thermal ellipsoids are set at the 30% probability level, hydrogen atoms are omitted and the side Dipp parts are set as sticks model for clarity). The magnesium, lithium, and copper boryl compounds have demonstrated their reactivity of nucleophilic boryl anions in reactions with electrophiles33,45,53,54. The similar reactivity of zinc-boryl compound 1 was also examined (Fig. The reaction of compound 1 with MeI in C6D6 over 6 h resulted in a clear conversion, as indicated by a new 11B NMR signal at 35.2 ppm, suggesting the formation of the methyl-substituted boronic ester. The MeBcat could also be synthesized from Rh-Me complex with B2cat255, but our synthetic route indicates a clear nucleophilic Bcat- derived from the Zn-B σ−bond. Additionally, the zinc-I species 4 was identified by 1H NMR, which is consistent with the reported data (see Supplementary Fig. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) further confirmed the identities of the generated compounds. This reaction demonstrated the nucleophilic activity of the Bcat- anion derived from compound 1. To explore further the reactivity of the Zn-B bond in compound 1, we conducted a series of reactions with unsaturated N-containing substrates. The reaction of compound 1 and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) has been explored. Based on previous literature reports33, we expected that the borylation might occur at the C atom, forming a ZnN2C four-member ring. To our surprise, the reaction of compound 1 and DCC gave a clean conversion to compound 5 at 85 °C (Fig. X-ray crystallographic analysis confirmed the structure of this new compound as a zinc imide complex. In this case, DCC acted as an equivalent of Cy-nitrene, which was inserted into the Zn-B bond. This indicates a C=N bond cleavage event facilitated by the Zn-Bcat compound 1 that displays unusual reactivity. To elucidate the mechanism behind the unique bond cleavage process, we conducted a control experiment. Upon heating the reaction at 60 °C, a new 11B signal at 26.8 ppm was observed, and the 1H NMR spectrum also showed the appearance of a new set of signals, suggesting the presence of a stable transition intermediate. X-ray single crystal analysis confirmed the structure of this species, compound 6, as a 1,2-addition compound involving the Zn-B bond, where the zinc atom coordinates with the central carbon atom and the oxygen atom (O1), forming a five-membered ring. And the Bcat group is connected to the terminal N-Cy moiety. Continued heating of 6 at 85 °C led to a smooth transformation into the final product 5, proving it to be a key intermediate in this transformation. Attempts to isolate any other side products from these reactions were not successful. Similar results regarding the cleavage of the C=N double bond leading to imido species have also been reported for low-valent main group metals58,59 and transition metal borylenes60,61. In contrast to its nucleophilic reactivity with MeI, compound 1 acts as an electrophile toward DCC, demonstrating amphiphilic character within the Zn-B bond. In these reactions, it is interesting to find out whether the related transformations have been initiated by a highly reactive nucleophilic or electrophilic boron moiety. To understand the reaction mechanism for the formation of compounds 5 and 6, DFT computational studies have been conducted, and the results are summarized in the next section. The reactivity of compound 1 towards isonitrile was also investigated. When an equimolar amount of tBuNC was added to a toluene solution of compound 1, an immediate color change from colorless to dark green was observed11.B NMR analysis revealed the formation of a new species with a signal at 17.2 ppm, along with the presence of unreacted compound 1. Upon the addition of another equivalent of tBuNC, a complete conversion of compound 1 was observed. The product, compound 7, was successfully isolated (Fig. X-ray single crystal analysis revealed the formation of a C-C coupled moiety derived from tBuNC, coordinated with the Bcat unit to generate a four-membered C2NB heterocycle (Fig. The C-N bond lengths of 1.280(4) and 1.301(4) Å, along with the terminal C-C bond length of 1.495(4) Å, suggest the formation of two N=C double bonds and a C-C single bond in the isonitrile-coupled moiety. This interesting C-C coupling pathway that gives a C=N-B-C 4-membered ring product was also observed when excess isonitrile reacted with the above-mentioned manganese-carbonyl boryl and low valent aluminum complexes62,63. However, unlike the Mn (I) carbene complex, 7 does not show carbene character judging from the planar C-N-B-C ring and its Zn-C bond length of 1.96 Å, which is the average bond length of a Zn-C single bond3,64. Regarding the reaction pathway, though mechanistic study is still underway, it is believed that there is an insertion of tBuNC into the Zn-B bond, followed by an attack of second tBuNC at the C centre that cleaves C-B bond. This is in contrast to the previously reported Au-B(o-tol)2 complex30, where the isocyanide was transformed into an azaallenylgold compound, implying distinct reaction pathways in the two systems. a Reaction of compound 1 with isocyanide; b Reaction of compound 1 with azobenzene; c Molecular structure of compound 7. (thermal ellipsoids are set at the 50% probability level, and the hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity); d Molecular structure of compound 8. (thermal ellipsoids are set at the 30% probability level, hydrogen atoms are omitted and the side Dipp parts are set as sticks model for clarity). Additionally, compound 1 was found to react with azobenzene, forming a new zinc-imide product 8 (Fig. The structure of compound 8 was confirmed by X-ray single-crystal analysis, which revealed the formation of Zn-N and B-N bonds (Fig. The N-N bond length of 1.434(3) Å is within the expected range of a N-N single bond. The diborylation of azobenzene is a known transformation; however, it typically requires either stoichiometric amounts of highly electrophilic boron reagents or noble metal catalysts65,66,67. Based on the formation of 8, we hypothesized that compound 1 might promote the catalytic diborylation of azobenzenes, driven by the regeneration of a strong B-N bond. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the reaction of compound 8 with B2cat2, which led to the regeneration of compound 1, suggesting the establishment of a catalytic cycle. After screening various reaction conditions (see Supplementary information), we achieved the diboration of azobenzene with an isolated yield of 82% at 60 °C in toluene, using 10 mol% of catalyst 1. We evaluated substrates with substituents exhibiting different electronic effects in this system (Fig. Complex 1 proved effective in catalyzing the diborylation of substrates containing electron-withdrawing groups. In contrast, it did not facilitate the reaction with substrates bearing electron-donating groups. The catalytic efficiency of the Zn-boryl complex for the diborylation of azobenzene and substrates with electron-withdrawing groups is comparable to that achieved with precious metal catalysts68, and this was accomplished without the addition of a base in the catalytic system to fully utilize the boron source69. The reaction conditions and substrate scope are outlined. To shed light on the reactivity of the Zn-B bond, DFT computations were conducted on the reaction of compound 1 with DCC shown in Fig. 7 at ωB97X-D level in toluene (see Supplementary information). We selected this reaction for DFT studies because the formation of 6 clearly signifies the potential electrophilic nature of the boryl ligand, allowing us to distinguish a Zn-B bond and an Mg-/Li-B bond. The formation of the final thermodynamically more stable product 5 occurs through two steps (Fig. In the first step, the Zn-B bond reacts with one of the C=N bonds in DCC to yield the zincate-borylation intermediate INT1 (a model for compound 5). This step proceeds through transition structure TS1 with an overall barrier of 22.4 kcal/mol. In the second step, the nitrogen atom bonded to the boryl group further coordinates with the Zn metal center, resulting in the cleavage of the Zn-C bond and the release of Cy-NC through the transition structure TS2. The second step requires overcoming a barrier of 26.5 kcal/mol, which is higher than that of the first step. This elucidates the experimental observation of 6 (INT1 in Fig. 7) as a product at a lower temperature. These findings contrast sharply with the reaction of Mg-Bpin species with carbodiimide, where the boryl group attaches to the electrophilic carbon center in the final product[33]. Consequently, we also examined the hypothetical reaction pathway in which the Bcat acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon atom of DCC. However, such a reaction mechanism needs to overcome a much higher energy barrier of 32.3 kcal/mol (see Supplementary information). Based on these results, we can conclude that a unique concerted reactivity of the Zn-B bond contributes to such an interesting isonitrile elimination result observed in the reaction with DCC. Relative Gibbs free energies and relative electronic energies (in parenthesis) are given in kcal/mol. DFT computations were conducted on the reaction of compound 1 with DCC shown in at B97X-D level in toluene. In summary, we employed a straightforward metathesis strategy to synthesize a Zn-boryl complex from a Zn imide complex and B2Cat2. This Zn-Bcat complex exhibits a unique Zn-boron bond, displaying significant differences from Zn-boryl compounds derived from lithium-boryl precursors. The enhanced covalent character boosts its reactivity towards unsaturated nitrogen-containing bonds, enabling it to exhibit behavior akin to highly reactive diborane(4) species67,70,71. The Zn-Bcat complex can act as a typical nucleophile, reacting with CH3I to form C-B bonds. Additionally, it activates carbodiimide (DCC), facilitating the addition of C=N bonds and cleaving inert C=N double bonds through a unique concerted reactivity, leading to the generation of imide Zn complexes. It also activates NC triple bonds in isonitrile, converting them to double bonds while facilitating C-C single-bond coupling. Furthermore, the N=N double bond of azobenzene can be inserted into the Zn-B bond, resulting in borylated N-N bonded species, and it further functions as a catalyst in the diborylation of azobenzene. DFT computational results confirm the enhanced covalent character of the Zn-B bond, indicating that its reaction pathway differs from that of known nucleophilic boryl reagents. Ongoing studies in our laboratory focus on exploring the reactivity of zinc-boron bonded species with various unsaturated substrates and their catalytic applications in organic synthesis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is according to new research published in the British Ecological Society journal, People and Nature. In a new study led by researchers at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv), the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) and the Friedrich Schiller University Jena, participants with no ecological training were asked to sort images and audio recordings of forests based on perceived biodiversity. How we perceive the natural world has implications for our health. Lead author Kevin Rozario, iDiv, said: "Because it's suspected that perceived biodiversity translates into mental health benefits, it's important to identify what people perceive with regards to biodiversity, what the contribution of the different senses could be, and under which circumstances people's perception of biodiversity best aligns with what ecologists measure." Visually, people noticed vegetation density, light conditions or color. Acoustically, people noticed birdsong characteristics, volume or emotions that the audio evoked. "We recommend to conserve and restore diverse forests characterised by a variety of tree species and structures to also provide habitats for different vocalising bird species. These conservation measures will have the dual benefit of meeting conservation goals while also increasing people's experience of biodiversity and therefore likely increasing mental well-being." Actual biodiversity in the audio files was measured via bird species richness. The researchers caution that people's abilities to accurately perceive biodiversity may be reliant on them being able to directly compare environments with different biodiversity levels. They point to similar studies that found that participants could not easily perceive biodiversity when they were asked to rate one environment on its own.

The AI tools Gemini and DeepSeek came behind o3 in a league table of responses to scientific questions.Credit: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty o3, an artificial intelligence (AI) model developed by the creators of ChatGPT, has been ranked the best AI tool for answering science questions in multiple fields, according to a benchmarking platform launched last week. o3, created by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, was ranked the best at answering questions on natural sciences, health care, engineering, and humanities and social science, after more than 13,000 votes. Users' preference for o3 might stem from the model's tendency to give a lot of detail on the literature it cites and to produce technically nuanced responses, says Arman Cohan, a research scientist at Ai2. But explaining why models' performance varies is challenging because most are proprietary. Differences in training data and what the model has been optimized for, among other things, could partially explain it, he says. SciArena is the latest platform developed to evaluate how AI models perform on certain tasks — and one of the first to rank performance on scientific tasks using crowdsourced feedback. The platform is now publicly available and lets users ask research questions for free. “This will help researchers find work they may have otherwise missed.” LINK Should I use AI to help draft my science job application?
