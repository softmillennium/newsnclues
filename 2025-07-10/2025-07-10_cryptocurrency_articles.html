                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ant Group may be gearing up for a major move into regulated cryptoand it's picking a hot partner to get there. People familiar say Jack Ma-backed Ant is working with Circle to bring its USDC stablecoin onto Ant's blockchain platform, pending U.S. compliance. The integration would mark a meaningful step for Circle (NYSE:CRCL), which just went public in June and is already up over 500%. With regulators beginning to draw clearer lines around stablecoins, this tie-up could be an early signal of how traditional fintech giants are planning to plug into tokenized paymentscautiously, but decisively. Circle's USDC could serve as a bridge for Ant's cross-border ambitions. Ant International processed over $1 trillion in global transactions last year, and a third of that flowed through its blockchain. The company is reportedly pursuing stablecoin licenses in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourgadding a layer of credibility and compliance to its crypto push. Behind the scenes, Ant has already signed deals with major players like JPMorgan, HSBC, and BNP Paribas to support tokenized assets on its network. Its growing treasury business, especially through Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) e-commerce ecosystem, is quietly becoming a high-value anchor in this evolution. Ant International, which generated close to $3 billion in revenue in 2024 and has now logged two straight years of adjusted profit, could be lining up for a Hong Kong listing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With many altcoins competing for attention, it's easy to miss the ones actually gaining real progress. But if you're searching for the top altcoins to buy now, a few clearly stand apart. These are not just trending names, but projects showing steady development, future launches, growing networks, and well-structured presales. From new technical models to builder tools and updated staking options, each is showing clear movement forward. Whether your focus is on technology, timing, or potential growth, the four mentioned here are worth a detailed look. BlockDAG comes first with a growing presale and new mining tools. Following that, Arbitrum, Sui, and Aave bring their own strong features to the table. BlockDAG is gaining traction through a unique Layer 1 design that uses both Proof-of-Work and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) models. It also works fully with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, so developers can bring over their dApps or create new ones. For users without coding skills, a no-code tool helps them launch NFTs or tokens. Right now, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gearing up for its GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. The expected listing price is $0.05, which suggests a gain of more than 3,025% from today's rate. Arbitrum is quietly building its role as a leading Layer 2 project. Its recent growth reflects this progress, with total value locked rising by 60% this quarter and nearly 2.4 million active DeFi users now on the network. Its RSI sits near 48, meaning it's neither overbought nor oversold. CoinCodex and Changelly suggest a possible short-term range of $0.32 to $0.50, depending on how it performs against the 50-day moving average. With both fast transaction scaling and growing real-world adoption, ARB stands as a strong option among the top altcoins to buy now. Sui has bounced back this month after falling below $2.70 in early June. It now trades near $2.92 following Lion Group's $600 million treasury backing, which helped the price climb 15% in under a week. Even more notable is the rise in project activity, with developer growth up 54% over the past two years and aggregator traffic up 19% in June. Sui has also released new NFT and GameFi protocols, which are attracting more user activity. Aave is gaining attention again with the rollout of its V4 update. It also brings multichain growth and lower gas fees to help keep Aave ahead in the DeFi space. Though still below recent highs, it has room to grow as development moves forward. CoinCodex shows targets between $314 and $358 in July, with longer-term forecasts near $650. In today's fast-changing market, finding the top altcoins to buy now means focusing on actual use, clear growth, and strong entry prices. Arbitrum is expanding with traditional finance while growing its DeFi base. Aave is preparing for the next stage of DeFi growth with V4 updates. Each coin here has clear strengths, whether in community reach, tech roadmap, or user growth. If you're planning your moves for late 2025, these four names offer focused paths worth tracking.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTC$110,770.05 clinched a fresh record high above $113,000 on Thursday, attempting to break away from the range it has been trading in for months. It was up 3.7% over the past 24 hours. The new record comes less than a day after it briefly topped $112,000 on some exchanges, then retreated below $111,000 in the later hours. Bitcoin's rally to new highs was buoyed by strong inflows into ETFs, relentless corporate adoption by crypto treasury companies and an increasingly favorable regulatory climate, Gerry O'Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex, said in a note. "While the macro environment will continue to remain uncertain, we believe the bull market is far from over and new catalysts, including more institutional platforms allowing access to bitcoin, may help drive the price of BTC to $140,000 or higher this year," he said. The broader crypto market was also climbing higher on Thursday. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index advanced 3.4% to its strongest level since May.

Jack Dorsey has launched the beta version of an app that is being seen as quite radical and (potentially) groundbreaking — Bitchat. It lets you send/receive Bitcoin and chat with other users entirely offline, without requiring an internet connection. This quick guide explores the new app, including its underlying technology, whether it packs enough punch to revolutionize crypto, potential vulnerabilities, and other key details. ➤ Bitchat enables encrypted Bitcoin and message transfers using Bluetooth, with no internet or mobile network required. ➤ Messages relay across a Bluetooth mesh network with no central servers, accounts, or permanent identifiers involved. ➤ Reliability depends on user density, with no delivery confirmations or routing logic in the current beta version. ➤ However, Bitchat does not function as a wallet or signing tool, the transactions are only delivered if a relay device eventually connects to the internet and broadcasts them. Bitchat is an offline, encrypted chat app that uses Bluetooth mesh networking to relay messages without internet, servers, accounts, emails, or phone numbers. Under the hood, Bitchat creates a peer-to-peer Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh network among devices. Every smartphone running Bitchat acts as both a client and a relay node, and each passes along encrypted messages to extend beyond the usual 30-meter Bluetooth range. “'What if the electricity goes out' is a common concern of Bitcoin skeptics. Jack Dorsey's Bitchat solves the problem with cheap, easily sourced mesh nets,” Bitcoin pioneer Max Keiser told BeInCrypto. Dorsey likened the system to old-school IRC chatrooms, but with modern encryption and no central servers. When you open the app, it generates an ephemeral ID for your device (which can even change each session for privacy). You can join chat “rooms” labeled with hashtags or message individuals directly. All messages are protected with end-to-end encryption so that only the intended recipients can read them. Bitchat also uses a “store-and-forward” feature to handle offline devices. For example, if your friend's phone is off or out of range, your message can be cached on an intermediate node and delivered once they come back online (within the mesh). Bitchat supports relaying pre-signed Bitcoin transactions, but only as encrypted data packets. Users must create and sign transactions using a separate Bitcoin wallet, then use Bitchat to pass the signed transaction data from device to device via Bluetooth. Notably, BitChat keeps these messages only in device memory (no cloud storage), so once delivered or expired, they are permanently deleted. So, while this feature will definitely woo privacy-focused users, it can also be a double-edged sword if you were to retrieve an old message. The app also features a few other useful additions. It uses a compressed header structure, message deduplication, and fragmentation to handle short payloads efficiently. Devices scan for beacons and periodically establish encrypted connections to exchange queued messages. Each user is identified by a public key-derived ID that changes frequently to enhance anonymity. The app stores undelivered messages in memory (not disk) for up to 12 hours, or longer for marked “favorites.” Messages are deleted once delivered or expired. The Bitchat whitepaper assures users on that front, saying that battery consumption is minimized through duty cycling, adaptive scan intervals, and automatic power-saving during inactivity. It works best when many users are nearby, like at protests or festivals. However, in remote or low-density areas, messages may never find a path out. Bluetooth range is short, and even with seven-hop relaying, the effective reach will likely stay very limited. So, if you send a message or Bitcoin transaction, you won't know if it was received unless the recipient replies through some other channel. And with no routing logic, the mesh can get flooded in dense environments, which would risk delays or message loss. Security-wise, while encryption appears solid, Bluetooth itself can be jammed or spammed. Attackers, in theory, could flood the mesh with junk messages or block signals entirely. The app also relies on someone eventually having internet access to broadcast Bitcoin transactions. Put simply, without a connected node or satellite link, the transfer stays local and incomplete. For instance, in natural disasters, democratic protests, or internet shutdowns, you can use the app to share information with nearby devices without needing cell towers or Wi-Fi. This makes it a potential lifeline in emergencies — whether you are coordinating rescue efforts, sending location details, or simply staying in touch. And because it runs on everyday smartphones using Bluetooth, there's no need for special gear. So, all these factors considered, Bitchat can evolve with time to serve as a secure, local communication layer in places or situations where traditional networks break down. The potential impact, in theory at least, is huge. Offline Bitcoin transfers could make crypto more usable during emergencies and major power outages. It could also push mainstream wallets and apps to consider offline-capable designs. While earlier projects like goTenna and LochaMesh explored similar ideas, Bitchat is one of the first, if not the first, to deliver this in a mobile app that can run on regular smartphones. So, even though it might not bring a radical change overnight, Bitchat could mark the early stages of a shift where your ability to use crypto no longer depends on centralized infrastructure. And more importantly, where you stay in control, even when the internet isn't. Bitchat is a peer-to-peer messaging app that operates entirely offline using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). There are no servers, accounts, or internet connections involved. However, delivery is not guaranteed unless a relay eventually connects to the internet. The app doesn't yet support native Bitcoin wallet functions at launch — it simply transports raw data. Message metadata, such as sender and recipient IDs, is also encrypted. The app supports dummy traffic to mask real communication patterns. However, it lacks delivery confirmations as of early-July 2025 and is still in beta. In low-density areas, messages may not reach their destination. It also lacks routing optimization and delivery acknowledgments, which can affect reliability. An internet-connected device is still required to finalize Bitcoin transactions on-chain.

As with previous digital currency pilots, it is a joint project between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC). One of the most notable aspects is that the wCBDC will be issued on a range of public and private blockchains and DLTs. For example, Australian Payments Plus is a participant on the Hedera public network. Apart from Hedera, the DLTs for the pilot include Redbelly Network, R3 Corda, Canvas Connect and other EVM-compatible networks. Fourteen companies will participate, including three of the big four Australian banks and Northern Trust. However, National Australia Bank is not one of the participants. “The use cases selected in this project will help us to better understand how innovations in central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, might help to uplift the functioning of wholesale financial markets in Australia.” As with some other explorations, a wide range of use cases are planned including various asset classes, such as fixed income, private markets, trade receivables and carbon credits. There are several similar projects around the world, including Europe's recent wholesale DLT settlement trials, Hong Kong's Project Ensemble and Switzerland's Project Helvetia which is live in a production environment despite being in a two year pilot phase.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One can say that everything is about being recognized and known in the crypto market. Different meme coins hope to attract attention with promises, viral marketing, and other strategies. However, many of them fail to sustain investor interest in the long term. They don't have what matters in today's market: utility. That's why Snorter ($SNORT) is taking a slightly different path in its business. While other presales have only moments of glory, Snorter presale has shown strong momentum, positioning itself among promising altcoin projects. This meme coin has terrific momentum, with over $1.6 million raised in its presale. Foremost, Snorter is on Solana and Ethereum, offering investors multi-chain opportunities, unlike many other altcoins. Among notable altcoins, only Chainlink and NEAR Protocol offer cross-chain capabilities. Multi-chain is crucial in helping to minimize compatibility issues between different blockchains. One of Snorter's core advantages is that it operates on Telegram. These trading bots are great because Telegram is where crypto communities live. It's trusted, widely used, and already the go-to platform for crypto chatter. Speed is where Snorter outperforms its competition, with lightning-fast execution times. Unlike most meme coins, Snorter provides massive utility to investors. Its features make $SNORT one of the rare meme coin presales with real tech utility. The utility could help Snorter avoid Dogecoin's fate of becoming dependent on community and influencer mentions. Snorter secures long-term demand because token holders can employ $SNORT daily for their trading operations. The Snorter presale has raised past $1.6 million, demonstrating momentum and capturing investor attention. It is one of the notable meme coin presales offering real technological utility. With its successful presale, multi-chain technology, attractive staking, and strong community, Snorter is gaining recognition as a noteworthy meme coin in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emirates has signed a preliminary agreement with cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com to enable digital asset payments across its services, as the airline looks to broaden its appeal to younger, tech-savvy customers. The partnership, expected to take effect next year, would integrate Crypto.com Pay into Emirates' payment infrastructure, subject to regulatory approvals and compliance checks, the airline's parent company said in a statement on Wednesday. “ This strategic move is in line with Dubai's vision to be at the forefront of financial innovation while at the same time providing our customers with greater flexibility and choice in how they transact with Emirates,” said Adnan Kazim, Emirates' Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer. The MoU was signed in Dubai in the presence of Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive of Emirates Airline & Group. The two companies will also explore joint marketing campaigns to drive awareness and adoption of the new payment option. Several use cases have already taken shape, including cryptocurrency payments for real estate, school fees and transportation. One of the largest crypto ecosystems in the region is housed within Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), where more than 650 crypto firms are currently based. Other regional carriers have also begun experimenting with digital currencies. In May, Dubai-listed Air Arabia announced it would accept AE Coin, a UAE dirham-backed stablecoin, for flight bookings.

Project Acacia, a joint initiative between the Reserve Bank of Australia and Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC), has selected 14 participants to undertake trials of tokenised asset settlement in financial markets. 10 hours Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. 24 innovative use cases from a diverse range of organisations, ranging from local fintechs to major banks, have been conditionally selected for this next stage of the project. This will include 19 pilot use cases, which will involve real money and real asset transactions, and five proof-of-concept use cases involving simulated transactions.The use cases involve a range of asset classes, including fixed income, private markets, trade receivables and carbon credits.Proposed settlement assets for the use cases include stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, and pilot wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), as well as new ways of using banks' existing exchange settlement accounts at the RBA.Issuance of pilot wholesale CBDC for testing use cases will occur on a range of private and public-permissioned DLT platforms, including Hedera, Redbelly Network, R3 Corda, Canvas Connect and other EVM-compatible networks.Testing of use cases will occur over the next six months, with a report on the findings from the project expected to be published in the first quarter of 2026. Brad Jones, assistant governor at the RBA says: “Ensuring that Australia's payments and monetary arrangements are fit-for-purpose in the digital age is a strategic priority for the RBA and the Payments System Board. Project Acacia represents an opportunity for further collaborative exploration on tokenised asset markets and the future of money by the public and private sectors in Australia.“The use cases selected in this project will help us to better understand how innovations in central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, might help to uplift the functioning of wholesale financial markets in Australia.The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Asic) is providing regulatory relief to participants to support and streamline the pilot.Asic commissioner Kate O'Rourke says: "Asic sees useful applications for the technologies underlying digital assets in wholesale markets. The relief from regulatory requirements that we have announced today will allow these technologies to be sensibly tested—to explore opportunities and identify and tackle risks.“Importantly, Project Acacia will allow industry and regulators to work together to learn more about how these use cases may reshape the financial services industry, potentially boosting efficiency and foster economic growth.” You may change your preferences at our Cookie Centre.</p>
