The judge indicated that his reasoning in issuing the injunction was “not a close call to the court.”

A federal district judge has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction on the Trump administration, forbidding the enforcement of an executive order signed on President Donald Trump's first day in office that attempted to unilaterally redefine the Birthright Citizenship clause of the Constitution's 14th Amendment.

The order comes weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court limited the ability of federal judges to issue such injunctions, finding that, except in limited circumstances, federal judges should issue injunctions that are more tailored to the parties involved.

U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante, who is based in New Hampshire, issued the ruling in a class-action lawsuit featuring multiple parties, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who would be detrimentally affected by Trump's executive order. The Supreme Court suggested in its decision last month that class-action suits could be one of the ways in which a federal judge may be able to issue a nationwide order.

Laplante's injunction places a temporary block on Trump's enforcement of the executive order, barring the administration from enforcing it against citizens who were born in the U.S., as well as future children who may be affected by Trump's order.

In a statement announcing his decision, Laplante indicated that his reasoning was “not a close call to the court.”

“The deprivation of U.S. citizenship and an abrupt change of policy that was longstanding” is tantamount to “irreparable harm” for those involved in the lawsuit and others like them across the country, Laplante said.

In the text of his one-page order, Laplante indicated that the aggrieved parties had shown a “likelihood of success on the merits of their claims.”

“The potential harm to the class petitioners if the order is not granted outweighs the potential harm to Respondents if the order is granted,” Laplante added. 

Trump and his loyalists have frequently derided judges for issuing rulings against his orders — including his attempt to change the definition of birthright citizenship — by baselessly claiming that such judges were partisan. However, that argument may fall flat, as Laplante was appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush. 

Laplante has also been more cautious in his previous rulings. Whereas Trump has bashed judges in the past for issuing nationwide injunctions, the New Hampshire-based federal judge previously found Trump's birthright citizenship order to be unconstitutional but narrowed the scope of his order to only those involved in the case.

On Thursday, in announcing his nationwide injunction in the class-action lawsuit, Laplante acknowledged this point.

“I'm the judge who wasn't comfortable with issuing a nationwide injunction,” he said in his courtroom. “Class action is different. The Supreme Court suggested class action is a better option.”

Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, called the injunction “a huge victory” that will “help protect the citizenship of all children born in the United States, as the Constitution intended.”

“We are fighting to ensure President Trump doesn't trample on the citizenship rights of one single child,” Wofsy added.

By using denaturalization as a threat, Trump shifts the goal posts of citizenship to further his political agenda.

I used to take my United States citizenship for granted. Don't get me wrong, I was always aware of the benefits conferred on me by a U.S. passport, but I didn't give it much more thought than that. My great-grandparents immigrated through Ellis Island, and eventually I happened to be born on a certain tract of land, within certain lines drawn up by men many years ago. 

It's hard to know how many U.S. citizens are children of other U.S. citizens. That granular data isn't tracked. For more than 150 years, the Fourteenth Amendment has guaranteed birthright citizenship to every child born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents' immigration status. About 85 percent of U.S. residents have citizenship through birthright. Another seven percent of the country — or 24.5 million people — are naturalized U.S. citizens.

But over the past several months, Donald Trump has given lie to the idea that citizenship was ever objective or resolute. When Trump's presidency goes down in the bowels of history, he will be remembered for his fervid and unlawful crusade to remold the fabric of the U.S. population in his image — with immigration agents as his key executors. A mass deportation agenda once pitched as targeting the “worst of the worst” has quickly expanded into an all-out assault on immigrant populations, sweeping up citizens and non-citizens alike.

Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly weaponized immigration status to silence his critics, targeting and deporting what he's called “the enemy from within.” First, he went after the visas of international college students, especially those students who protested to demand an end to Israel's genocide in Gaza. Then, when the Trump administration learned that Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was in fact a lawful permanent resident, officials attempted to revoke his green card and deport him too. Now, we're seeing the goal posts shift yet again: In a June 11 memo, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is prioritizing efforts to strip naturalized Americans of their citizenship.

One man in particular has been at the center of the right's latest denaturalization campaign. Last week, Trump amplified baseless claims — circulated online by racist extremists — that Zohran Mamdani, the New York City Democratic mayoral candidate, could be living in the U.S. without authorization. He also said he would have Mamdani arrested if he interferes with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the city. 

Mamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, to one Indian parent and one Ugandan parent of Indian descent, and moved to New York City at age seven. He became naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2018 and was elected to the New York state assembly two years later. Still, Trump told reporters on July 1 that “a lot of people are saying he's here illegally” and vowed that his administration would “look at everything.”

Whether or not the administration moves forward on its threat to revoke Mamdani's citizenship, Trump's comments clearly aim to intimidate opponents and curb Mamdani's enforcement of New York City's sanctuary city policies, should he be elected mayor. Republicans have already threatened to arrest and criminally prosecute several Democratic mayors of sanctuary cities — even as courts have long upheld the legality of policies that restrict local law enforcement from collaborating with ICE. Brandishing Mamdani's status as an international-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, and painting it as something subject to the Oval Office's whims, is just another ugly iteration of Trump's crackdown on dissent.

History has also shown us that authoritarian regimes readily exploit legal frameworks, eroding the already-porous bounds of legality to further repression.

The ominous rhetoric puts a target on the back of all naturalized politicians who might seek to push back against the current administration, but immigrant mayors are particularly vulnerable, given their unique role in having to organize and implement the sanctuary policies that Trump is directly threatening. I wouldn't be surprised, though, if Trump broadens the scope of his attacks to target progressive members of Congress who are naturalized citizens, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), who was born in Somalia, or Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington), who was born in India. 

The Trump administration claims it's only going to target the citizenship of people who have committed crimes, but that provides no comfort. We've seen how quickly this administration has weaponized allegations of “criminality” to further political goals — sanctuary cities, for instance, are not illegal, but the administration has repeatedly claimed that they are. And in his push to revoke international student visas, Trump has falsely claimed that protesting against Israel's genocide in Gaza amounts to illegal support for terrorist organizations.

History has also shown us that authoritarian regimes readily exploit legal frameworks, eroding the already-porous bounds of legality to further repression. In 1940s Germany, for instance, the Nazis engaged in a perfectly legal mass denaturalization campaign that rendered thousands of Jewish people and political adversaries stateless. 

Trump has made it clear that his issues with Mamdani are ideological. On July 8, Trump ramped up his diatribe against Mamdani by suggesting to reporters during a Cabinet meeting that the White House would somehow take control of New York City if the Democratic socialist is elected mayor in November. “If a communist gets elected to run New York, it can never be the same. But we have tremendous power at the White House to run places when we have to,” Trump said.

Still, while Trump's authoritarian second term has brought the U.S. to a point of Constitutional crisis, denaturalization itself isn't new. It was heavily used as a political tool during Sen. Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist crusade of the late 1940s and 1950s — a political movement known as McCarthyism. Back then, fears about the spread of communism led to more than 20,000 denaturalization cases per year. It's deeply troubling that we're now in a period of intense political repression that meets and exceeds the McCarthyist blueprint. But let us not forget that the Red Scare eventually fell out of favor. McCarthy was censured by the Senate and exposed for his baseless accusations. 

We must not let Trump's threats dissuade us from speaking out for what is right, pushing back against political persecution and standing up for our neighbors regardless of immigration status. After all, at the end of the day, your citizenship won't protect you from an authoritarian regime — but your community might.

It took Noem four days to respond to requests from FEMA, delaying access to some search and rescue tools.

Officials within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) who were tasked with responding to massive flooding in central Texas this past week say that some of their lifesaving efforts were delayed due to cost-saving rules imposed by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem. 

Noem, whose department oversees FEMA's work, issued a new agency rule this year requiring all contracts and grants costing over $100,000 to be personally approved by her. As floodwaters were rising in Texas, Noem failed to respond to such requests over the weekend, taking four days to approve the spending that could have saved lives. 

As of Wednesday evening, 120 people in Texas have been killed by the massive floods, with 173 people still missing.

FEMA officials were prompt to respond to the devastating natural disaster as it was happening. But according to four officials within the agency who spoke to CNN on the matter, the new rule directly impeded their efforts.

“We were operating under a clear set of guidance: lean forward, be prepared, anticipate what the state needs, and be ready to deliver it. That is not as clear of an intent for us at the moment,” one of the sources told the network. 

A spokesperson for FEMA defending the policy said Noem's changes to the agency were mostly positive.

“The old processes are being replaced because they failed Americans in real emergencies for decades,” that spokesperson said.

But some crucial tools to assist in rescuing people were left unused for days, the anonymous FEMA officials said. For example, Urban Search and Rescue Crews, typically dispatched immediately when a disaster occurs, were unable to move into position within the state when floodwaters started to rise rapidly on Friday. Aerial imagery to assist in rescue efforts was also delayed, the officials said. 

Although these requests were made on Friday, Noem did not approve them until Monday, several days after the flooding had started and wrought most of its destruction. 

Noem — who frequently shares social media posts of her dressing in the same garb as other DHS agents — did take the time to post on her Instagram account on Sunday a few potential options for her official portrait as a former governor of South Dakota, The Daily Beast reported, asking her followers which image was their favorite.

A post shared by Kristi Noem (@kristinoem)

On the same day Noem had asked her followers to weigh in on her portrait, President Donald Trump deflected questions from reporters on his administration's response to the Texas floods, including questions on whether cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) had affected efforts to warn residents.

Trump ignored a reporter who had started to ask a question about those cuts, claiming he couldn't hear her, despite having no difficulty hearing reporters moments before. He also attempted to place partial blame for the floodwaters on his predecessor, claiming without evidence that “the water situation” was a “Biden setup.”

The move came just a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Trump in the White House.

Defenders of Palestine and the rule of law on Wednesday condemned Secretary of State Marco Rubio's announcement of sanctions targeting United Nations expert Francesca Albanese, one of the most outspoken critics of Israel's U.S.-backed genocidal war on the Gaza Strip.

In a post on the social media site X, Rubio said he is imposing sanctions on Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, “for her illegitimate and shameful efforts to prompt International Criminal Court action against U.S. and Israeli officials, companies, and executives.”

“Albanese's campaign of political and economic warfare against the United States and Israel will no longer be tolerated,” Rubio added. “We will always stand by our partners in their right to self-defense. The United States will continue to take whatever actions we deem necessary to respond to lawfare and protect our sovereignty and that of our allies.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Rubio's announcement came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza including murder and forced starvation — met with President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials in Washington, D.C.

Trump and the fugitive Israeli leader reportedly discussed plans for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and a deal to secure the release of the 22 remaining living hostages believed to be held by Hamas and the bodies of over two dozen others.

The Trump administration previously sanctioned ICC officials including Prosecutor Karim Khan for issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.

Albanese has accused Israel of violating the Genocide Convention since early 2024. Last week, she asserted that “Israel is responsible for one of the cruelest genocides in modern history.”

“The situation in the occupied Palestinian territory is apocalyptic,” she said. “In Gaza, Palestinians continue to endure suffering beyond imagination.”

Israel's 642-day assault and siege on Gaza — which is the subject of an ongoing International Court of Justice genocide case — has left more than 209,000 Palestinians dead, maimed, or missing, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, whose figures have been deemed accurate by Israeli military intelligence and peer-reviewed studies, at least two of which concluded the official death toll is likely an undercount.

U.N. experts, jurists, genocide scholars including numerous numerous Jews in Israel and around the world, national leaders, and human rights groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Jewish Voice for Peace, and CodePink are among those accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.

Responding to Rubio's announcement, Amnesty International secretary general Agnès Callamard said on social media that “Francesca Albanese is working tirelessly to document and report on Israel's unlawful occupation, apartheid, and genocide, on the basis of international law.”

“Governments around the world and all actors who believe in the rule-based order and international law must do everything in their power to mitigate and block the effect of the sanctions against Francesca Albanese and more generally to protect the work and independence of special rapporteurs,” she added.

Medea Benjamin, co-founder of CodePink, highlighted the movement to nominate Albanese for the Nobel Peace Prize, which stands in stark contrast with Netanyahu's dubious nomination of Trump for the award.

Millions are rallying behind Francesca, calling for her to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.👇 Drop your words of… pic.twitter.com/iqgvtiRO7f

U.S. human rights attorney Craig Mokhiber — who in October 2023 resigned from his U.N. post over what he called the world body's inaction in the face of “a genocide unfolding before our eyes” — accused Rubio of “a lawless, vile act.”

“Your arrogance will catch up to you,” Mokhiber added. “The impunity that you are enjoying now will be gone within a few years, and I am confident that you will be held accountable for your persecution of human rights defenders and for your violations of the human rights of countless people in the U.S. There are millions who will work to ensure it.”

Laura Boldrini, a lawmaker from Albanese's native Italy and former U.N. human rights official, said on social media that Rubio's move is “a disgrace that cannot be ignored.”

“Albanese's latest report, which lists the companies involved in the illegal annexation policies of the West Bank carried out by the Israeli government, has clearly hit the mark,” she added. “It is no longer just a matter of political interests, but also economic ones. And this, for Netanyahu and Trump, is truly too much. Nothing and no one must disturb business: not even the denunciation of a genocide and the illegal occupation of another people's territories.”

Mr Rubio, with this post you have sealed your legacy as an enemy of international law and basic human decency. History will judge you harshly. In the meantime-, the rest of us are standing with Francesca Albanese, a tireless servant of minimum ethical standards. https://t.co/C845knzM1D

Arab American Institute founder James J. Zogby contended that Rubio's “crude effort to sanction U.N. human rights champion Francesca Albanese and the International Criminal Court only serves to establish that the U.S. is an international outlaw.”

“Israel is violating international law and human rights, and the U.S. is enabling it,” he added. “It's a disgrace.”

Trita Parsi, co-founder and executive director of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, noted that the Trump administration this week removed al-Qaeda-linked militants who toppled the regime of longtime Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but is sanctioning a U.N. human rights official.

“Let that sink in,” Parsi said.

            Former Vice President Mike Pence says he thinks isolationists “may have lost some of their footing” in President Donald Trump's administration, as he praised Trump's tougher talk toward Russia's Vladimir Putin and his decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities.
    


            Pence, since his split with Trump after the 2020 election, has often criticized the president's approach to Russia and his tepid support for Ukraine.
    


            But he told CNN's Kate Bolduan in an interview Thursday he hopes Trump is “starting to recognize” that Putin is not interested in a negotiated end to the war he started in Ukraine. And he praised Trump's decision this week to reverse his administration's pause on some weapons shipments to Ukraine, including air defense missiles.
    


            “While I had concerns and expressed them in those first 100 days about the president's kind of ongoing hope and desire for a negotiated settlement, I welcome his decisions this week and his rhetoric,” he said.

            Pence said Trump's sharper criticism of Putin and support for Ukraine could be the result of Trump tuning out those advocating isolationist policies after some criticized the United States' direct military involvement in Israel's efforts to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions.
    


            “I think what may have changed is that some of the isolationist voices in and around this administration have recently condemned the president's correct and courageous decision to launch a military assault against Iran,” Pence said. “I think they may have lost some of their footing with the president.”
    


            Pence said that Trump “is not an isolationist.”
    


            “His bias is to lead,” he said. “I think he understands that America is the leader of the free world.”
    


            He also called on Trump to provide Ukraine with “offensive capability” in addition to air defense missiles and he urged Senate Majority Leader John Thune to bring a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill to the floor for a vote. Thune said Wednesday that the Senate could take up the legislation before the August recess..
    


            GOP lawmakers are seeking not to get ahead of the White House on the measure, but Pence said he “spoke Trump fluently for four years” and noted that Trump said Tuesday he is “looking very strongly” at the bill. He suggested it could strengthen Trump's hand against Putin.
    


            “When I saw the other day that he said he's strongly looking at it, I know what that means,” Pence said. “My hope is that the president will understand the value of the Senate acting, and they can put that on his desk.”
    


            Pence broke with Trump's homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, who on Wednesday — in the wake of the disastrous flooding in Texas — reiterated her desire to “eliminate” the Federal Emergency Management Agency and remake the way it operates.
    


            Noem, at a meeting of the FEMA Review Council, said disaster response should be led by state and local governments, rather than the federal agency.
    


            “It has been slow to respond at the federal level,” said Noem, a former South Dakota governor. “It's even been slower to get the resources to Americans in crisis, and that is why this entire agency needs to be eliminated as it exists today and remade into a responsive agency.”
    


            Pence, who was governor of Indiana prior to serving as vice president alongside Trump for four years, said he takes Noem's point that states play the primary role in disaster response. But he also said FEMA provides a “backstop of expertise and personnel and the ability to be on the ground, getting resources directly to the American people to help rebuild their lives.”
    


            “I think making sure that the federal government is there, speeding those resources to hurting Americans, is important and should be continued,” Pence said.
    


            The former vice president, a long-time critic of tariffs, also urged Congress to step in and assert its authority as Trump tacks steep fees on most goods entering the United States.
    


            “I think it's absolutely important that the Congress essentially reclaim, in the spirit of the separation of powers, its control over setting industrial policy, setting tax policy, setting tariff policy,” he said.
    


            Pence paired his call for Congress to check the president on tariffs with praise for the far-reaching policy law Trump signed last week to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, slash spending and impose work requirements on Medicaid and more.
    


            As Democrats prepare to highlight cuts to Medicaid entering the 2026 midterm elections, Pence said he believes if Congress steps in on tariff policy, the GOP can also sell the new law to voters.
    


            “I think that, combined with telling the story about how they extended those tax cuts, defunded Planned Parenthood, reformed Medicaid, rebuilt our military, is a winning message in 2026 and beyond,” he said.

Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island gives 300th climate speech on the US Senate floor

The Democratic party and the climate movement have been “too cautious and polite” and should instead be denouncing the fossil fuel industry's “huge denial operation”, the US senator Sheldon Whitehouse said.

“The fossil fuel industry has run the biggest and most malevolent propaganda operation the country has ever seen,” the Rhode Island Democrat said in an interview on Monday with the global media collaboration Covering Climate Now. “It is defending a $700-plus billion [annual] subsidy” of not being charged for the health and environmental damages caused by the burning of fossil fuels. “I think the more people understand that, the more they'll be irate [that] they've been lied to.” But, he added, “Democrats have not done a good job of calling that out.”

Whitehouse is among the most outspoken climate champions on Capitol Hill, and on Wednesday evening he delivered his 300th Time to Wake Up climate speech on the floor of the Senate.

He began giving these speeches in 2012, when Barack Obama was in his first term, and has consistently criticized both political parties for their lackluster response to the climate emergency. The Obama White House, he complained, for years would not even “use the word ‘climate' and ‘change' in the same paragraph”.

While Whitehouse slams his fellow Democrats for timidity, he blasts Republicans for being in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry, an entity whose behavior “has been downright evil”, he said. “To deliberately ignore [the laws of physics] for short-term profits that set up people for huge, really bad impacts – if that's not a good definition of evil, I don't know what is.”

The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's trade association, says on its website that “API and its members commit to delivering solutions that reduce the risks of climate change while meeting society's growing energy needs”.

Long before Donald Trump reportedly told oil company CEOs he would repeal Joe Biden's climate policies if they contributed $1bn to his 2024 presidential campaign, Republicans went silent on climate change in return for oil industry money, Whitehouse asserted. The key shift came after the supreme court's 2010 Citizens United ruling, which struck down limits on campaign spending. Before that, some GOP senators had sponsored climate bills, and John McCain urged climate action during his 2008 presidential campaign.

But Citizens United, Whitehouse said, “told the fossil fuel industry: ‘The door's wide open – spend any money you want in our elections'”. The industry, he said, promised the Republican party “unlimited amounts of money” in return for stepping away from bipartisan climate action: “And since 2010, there has not been a single serious bipartisan measure in the Senate.”

Whitehouse said that after delivering 300 climate speeches on the Senate floor, he has learned to shift from talking about the “facts of climate science and the effects on human beings to calling out the fossil fuels' massive climate-denial operation”.

He said: “Turns out, none of [the science] really matters while the operation is controlling things in Congress. I could take facts from colleagues' home states right to them, and it would make no difference because of this enormous, multibillion-dollar political club that can [punish] anyone who crosses them.”

Most Republicans even stay silent despite climate change's threat to property values and other traditional GOP priorities, Whitehouse said. He noted that even the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell – who is not known for his climate bona fides, he said – testified before the Senate in February that in 10-15 years there will be whole regions of the country where nobody can get a mortgage because extreme weather will make it impossible to afford or even obtain insurance.

Democrats can turn all this to their advantage if they get “more vocal and aggressive”, Whitehouse argued. “The good news is that the American people hate dark money with a passion, and they hate it just as much, if not more, in districts that went for Trump as in districts that went for Biden.”

Democrats also need to recognize “how much [public] support there is for climate action”, he said. “How do you have an issue that you win 74 [percent] to 12 [percent] and you don't ride that horse as hard as you can?”

Whitehouse said he was only estimating that 74% figure, but that's exactly the percentage of Americans who want their government to take stronger climate action, according to the studies informing the 89 Percent Project, the Guardian and other Covering Climate Now partner news outlets began reporting in April. Globally, the percentage ranges from 80% to 89%. Yet this overwhelming climate majority does not realize it is the majority, partly because that fact has been absent from most news coverage, social media and politicians' statements.

Democrats keep “getting caught in this stupid doom loop in which our pollsters say: ‘Well, climate's not one of the top issues that voters care about, so then we don't talk about it'”, said Whitehouse. “So it never becomes one of the top issues that voters care about. [But] if you actually go ask [voters] and engage on the issue, it explodes in enthusiasm. It has huge numbers when you bother to engage, and we just haven't.”

Nevertheless, Whitehouse is optimistic that climate denial won't prevail forever. “Once this comes home to roost in people's homes, in their family finances, in really harmful ways, that [will be] motivating in a way that we haven't seen before around this issue,” he said. “And if we're effective at communicating what a massive fraud has been pulled on the American public by the fossil fuel industry denial groups, then I think that's a powerful combination.”

Redistricting gives Republicans in the state the opportunity to ‘increase their strength and numbers', experts say

Experts, politicians and concerned Texans say their state could be a blueprint for Republican efforts to stave off losses in next year's elections, with some calling the GOP division a “festering wound” in Texas – all while Donald Trump stacks the deck against potential Democratic inroads.

Last month, nearly 150 people showed up at a Tarrant county commissioners court meeting in north Texas. The packed building wasn't used to such a high volume of visitors, but the day's key vote had been hotly contested for weeks.

In an unusual move, the commissioners court initiated a redistricting process that both liberal and conservative voters widely criticized. One map, as proposed, would essentially funnel more people of color away from precinct 2 and into precinct 1, thereby creating an opening for a GOP that has historically underperformed with people of color. The map's staunchest critics called the map “racial gerrymandering”, while the county judge, Tim O'Hare, claimed it was just about politics.

“It's purely partisan,” he told a local TV station in the days before the vote. “At the end of the day, I'm doing it to put another Republican on the commissioners court, period, the end.”

At the 3 June meeting, dozens of speakers rose to voice their concerns, and several were kicked out of the meeting by O'Hare.

“Your constituents are telling you that they do not want these maps,” one woman said during the public comment section. She was then removed from the building.

The controversial map was approved by a 3-2 vote. Shortly afterward, the Trump administration said it wanted more maps to be redrawn in Texas ahead of the 2026 midterms – and the governor, Greg Abbott, said on Wednesday that a special legislative session called for later this month would pick up that cause.

Amid a heated Senate primary race and Trump's slipping approval rating, Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist at the University of Houston who has extensively researched the Texas GOP, said “partisan leaders are always looking for an edge”.

“Redistricting gives them the clearest opportunity to increase their strength and numbers. Tarrant county is the last big urban purple county and Republicans definitely want to plant their flag deeply there,” he continued.

Bob Stein, a gerrymandering expert at Rice University in Houston, echoed Rottinghaus's comments.

“Republicans are afraid they're going to lose upwards of three to four seats in Louisiana, California and New York and probably New Jersey,” he said. “In fact, some of the privileged stuff I get to see says it could be a complete sweep. So what they want to do is get going now, and what you're seeing in Tarrant county is the effect of that.”

Multiple experts and politicians interviewed for this story pointed out how Texas isn't as conservative as one might think. Rather, Texans just don't vote enough.

A little over 60% of eligible Texas voters cast ballots in the 2024 election, which was six percentage points lower than the total in 2020. Most recently, less than 8% of Tarrant county voters cast ballots in May's local elections.

Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat, received more votes in Tarrant county in 2018 than the Republican senator Ted Cruz, and both Joe Biden and recent Cruz challenger Colin Allred also won Tarrant county in their respective races.

All of this spells trouble for the GOP as it prepares for 2026, especially in light of a GOP primary race that has already gotten personal.

Senator John Cornyn, who has been in office since 2002, is being challenged by the state attorney general, Ken Paxton, whose controversies includes an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and an impeachment on charges of bribery, obstruction of justice, harassment and abuse of office.

Cornyn, who is typically seen as a more traditional Republican, has attacked Paxton's character, using terms such as “conman” and “fraud” to describe his opponent. Paxton, for his part, has cast Cornyn as an establishment figure out of touch with Texas.

“The split in the Republican party will definitely be on full display in this election,” Rottinghaus said. “The establishment Republicans are very worried about losing the seat. You can see that in all the polling. You can see that in their attitudes and actions in how they're giving money and which staff are supporting which candidate. I mean, this is a wound that's been festering for a long time. It has not been sutured closed, and it may never be.”

The worry from the GOP, Rottinghaus added, is that a Paxton primary win could pave the way for a Democrat to mount a successful challenge in 2026.

Ken Shimamoto, a Fort Worth resident who opposed his county's recent redistricting, is following the Cornyn-Paxton primary race and displeased by what he sees. But he was not surprised.

“Everybody hates Ted Cruz, but Cornyn seemed the more reasonable senator until Paxton mounted his challenge,” he said. “And ever since then, it seems like Cornyn has been bending over backwards to appease Donald Trump.”

Some of Cornyn's bending has been overt, such as posting a photo of himself reading Trump's book The Art of the Deal with a one-word caption: “Recommended.”

Other efforts have been less obvious but far more insidious.

Three days after Paxton announced his challenge, Cornyn asked the Department of Justice to investigate the East Plano Islamic Center's plans to build a community around a mosque. Without evidence, the senator claimed such a project could constitute religious discrimination.

Despite widespread criticism (the Council on American-Islamic Relations called Cornyn's complaint “factually baseless”) the justice department opened an investigation – only to close it roughly a month later.

To Texans like Shimamoto, as well as the political scientists interviewed for this story, there's a clear tie between gerrymandering and races like the Cornyn-Paxton fight. Only the most extreme candidates win in a primary, which means conservatives must run further right if they hope to triumph or keep the seat they already have.

“We've been gerrymandered to death,” said Allison Campolo, who lives in Fort Worth and is running to be chair of the Tarrant county Democratic party. “That really drives down engagement, it prevents people from knowing what their elected representatives are doing and how it affects them.”

At the same time, politicians like Cornyn, Paxton and even Trump are unpopular in Texas. Recent polls show a majority of Texans disapprove of Trump, while only 29% of the state's residents currently approve of Paxton's performance. For Cornyn, that number is 24%.

Theoretically, this is good news for people upset about redistricting efforts or unhappy with their current leadership – but only if they vote.

“Texans have to continue to vote and make their voices heard,” said Democratic House representative Marc Veasey, whose district includes part of Fort Worth.

On redistricting, Veasey said that it was already being challenged in court on the basis that it violates both the constitution and the Voting Rights Act. To defend against the lawsuit, the commissioners court once again voted 3-2 to hire a law firm called the Public Interest Legal Foundation – the same firm that led the redistricting process.

As disheartening as this may be, Veasey urged Texans to “not give up”. “Texans can continue to tune in, not out. Continue to fight, vote, and make your voices heard.”

Journey Through the Clouds reopened in spring after a July, 2024, wildfire devastated the UNESCO World Heritage Site.Aruna Dutt/The Globe and Mail

As the train slowed to a halt, the usual chatter of passengers aboard the Rocky Mountaineer dimmed to a quiet hum, as if to mimic our surroundings. I stood outside on the viewing deck, just steps from the still, clear water of Moose Lake, which was gleaming in the sun. The warm smell of fresh-baked bread wafted from the train's kitchen into the crisp air of Alberta's Rockies.

Are you travelling in Canada this summer? Send us a postcard

I had let time slip away. Maybe it was because I had gone two days without much cell reception and WiFi, or because unlike my usual jam-packed travels, I was forced to stay put. Taking this legendary rail journey last April, I departed from Vancouver, rolled along hills and through hot desert canyons, and found myself near the end among the ice-capped peaks of Jasper National Park. I was pleasantly surprised to have reached this level of disconnection – having no need to worry about logistics, I completely forgot to change my phone's time zone while on board. 

This route to Jasper, Journey Through the Clouds, just reopened in spring, almost a year since the July, 2024, wildfire devastated the UNESCO World Heritage Site. As Jasper welcomes tourists back, this train is one of the most awe-inspiring ways to get there, turning a 90-minute flight into a two-day, one-night adventure. When travelling a century-old rail path, built in the 1880s by the Canadian Pacific Railway, you're left with time to ponder the past and present. For travellers like myself, it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. But even for train staff who make the trip on the regular, it never gets old.

“I have the absolute best office view in the world,” says Wendy McMichael, who has been a senior on-board manager with the Rocky Mountaineer for 14 years, in which she's seen everything from marriage proposals to a bear on its hind legs watching the train go by. “No two days are the same” she says, reflecting on the ever-changing weather and terrain. 

Though each day may be different, they are all just as well-rehearsed. 

Red carpets are rolled out at the station and men in Scottish dress play bagpipes – a nod to the heritage of the founders and owners, the Armstrong family. The Rocky Mountaineer's crew works overnight to get the train ready, says Celia Bautista, who has been a train manager for four years.

If you're venturing upstairs to “GoldLeaf” service, plush, heated seats await and you can almost touch the lush foliage that brushes the outside of the glass-domed ceiling. Soon after boarding, you're offered tea, coffee and cake with lemon glaze poured on top at your seat, before you're invited to the dining cart for breakfast.

(The train's cheaper SilverLeaf service still offers great views – the main difference is you're served breakfast and lunch at your seat.) 

The breakfast and lunch menu uses ingredients local to the regions the train passes through. Elaborate and colourful meals include Fraser Valley chicken paillard with corn and fennel sauté, locally-farmed steelhead with gnocchi, seared albacore tuna with truffle aioli, and for dessert, a lavender lemon posset. The food is prepared fresh by just two people in the tiny kitchen on board. It's a fascinating feat, with the 72 guests split into two groups to allow for service.

The first part of the trip cuts through lumberyards and the flower fields and farmlands of Abbotsford, where cows graze under highway bridges. Along the way, big-horned sheep stop their hopping to examine our noisy intrusion, people come out to their porches to wave, and speed boaters show off their drifting skills for the audience.

Often, there are relics of the original line such as telegraph poles still standing from when Morse code messages were sent to train stations. As we pass large, unmarked stone graves, our host Tina Mohns acknowledges those who died while building the tracks – among them, around 4,000 Chinese construction workers.

As the diesel-electric train twists and turns through the Coast and Cascade Mountains at 50 kilometres an hour to 100 km/h, Mohns tells tales of local sites, legends of long-ago epic journeys, and the 1858 Fraser River Gold Rush.

In one day, we go from the steely grey, towering cliffs of Hell's Gate on the Fraser River to the dusty-brown ridges and large osprey nests in Ashcroft, B.C. (which I'm fascinated to learn is classified as an arid desert). Overnight, we get off in Kamloops and sleep at a hotel. The next morning, 10 railcars split off with some heading to Banff, while our three railcars head to Jasper. We were back to lush greens by the Thompson River, one of the longest salmon runs in the world. Here, the train did a “Kodak roll,” moving slowly past the remote Pyramid Creek Falls – which are difficult to access by car or foot – so passengers could snap pictures. 

While we were in Jasper National Park's Yellowhead Pass, Mohns told us the area is home to around 1,500 moose and that if we see wildlife, we should yell so the staff can alert the other coaches. Here I was, on the lookout for moose, drinking a Caesar, with Shania Twain's You're Still the One playing over the speaker (could it get more stereotypically Canadian?), when someone yelled “Bear! Bear! Bear!” I plastered myself against glass-domed windows for a better look, along with the rest of the passengers.

Eventually, we reached Mount Robson – the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies and the end of our journey. I enjoyed my cabin in Jasper, walking the trails near the gushing Athabasca Falls, and seeing wildlife such as mountain goats, elk, and a black bear emerging from hibernation. 

But I missed the train, with its promise of serendipity, and an excuse to be still. It helped me forge a deeper connection to this part of the country. Sometimes, the journey can be as exciting as the destination.

Rocky Mountaineer runs between April to October. The Vancouver to Jasper route starts at $2,654 for SilverLeaf class and $3,565 for GoldLeaf. Travellers in wheelchairs can use a lift to get on the train, and also have access to narrow wheelchairs on board that fit in the aisle and the railcar elevator. 

The Rocky Mountaineer is not a sleeper train – the night in Kamloops is spent in a three- or four-star hotel. Pre and post-trip extensions are offered in five-star hotels, such as the Fairmont Waterfront in Vancouver and Jasper Park Lodge. 

Rocky Mountaineer packages can include excursions such as wildlife tours, ice plunges and Indigenous plant walks. Some areas of Jasper National Park remain closed because of wildfire damage; you can find updated information on the Parks Canada website. You can extend your trip by booking a bus from Jasper to Banff on the Icefields Parkway, where you pass jagged sawtooth mountains, gravel flats with braided streams, and the Columbia Icefield.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained two Chinese nationals in Kyiv suspected of attempting to steal classified military technology related to Ukraine's Neptune cruise missile system, the agency announced on July 9.

According to the SBU, the two individuals, a 24-year-old former student of a Kyiv technical university and his father, were gathering secret documentation with the intent to illegally transfer it to Chinese intelligence.

The younger man, who remained in Ukraine after being expelled from university in 2023 for poor academic performance, allegedly attempted to recruit a Ukrainian national with access to classified defense technologies in order to obtain technical data on the RK-360MC Neptune missile system.

China has emerged as one of Moscow's key wartime partners, helping Russia circumvent sanctions and becoming the largest supplier of dual-use goods aiding its defense sector.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly accused China of backing Russia and signed an order on July 8 imposing sanctions on five Chinese-registered companies for allegedly supplying components found in Russian Shahed-type drones used to attack Ukraine.

The Neptune, a Ukrainian-developed coastal defense missile, gained international attention after it was used to sink the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva in 2022.

The SBU said the former student was caught "red-handed" during the transfer of sensitive documents, and his father was detained shortly afterward. Investigators allege the elder suspect, who resides in China but made periodic visits to Ukraine, personally supervised his son's espionage activities.

Searches of the suspects' belongings uncovered mobile phones containing evidence of coordinated efforts to spy on Ukrainian military technology, including encrypted communications between the two men.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on July 10 that it is "verifying" information regarding the case.

"If Chinese citizens are involved, we will… safeguard Chinese citizens' legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said, according to AFP.

Both suspects have been charged with espionage. If convicted, they face up to 15 years in prison and confiscation of property. 

Ukraine struck a Russian warehouse storing ammunition and reconnaissance drones with a Neptune missile near the village of Chaltyr in Russia's Rostov Oblast in a January operation carried out by the SBU and Ukraine's Navy.

"We need a person (as an ambassador to the U.S.) to be strong and to be in the context of the most important thing, in the context of strengthening Ukraine — through weapons, first of all. Therefore, one of my ideas is that it can be Ukraine's defense minister," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.



Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets mistakenly presented a June 30 report by a little-known group as an internal U.N. analysis on the 2022 Olenivka prison explosion, which killed over 50 Ukrainian POWs, Slidstvo.Info reported on July 10, citing a response from Lubinets's office.

"I wouldn't characterize it as something that guarantees peace, but it's a concept that, you know, that I'll take back to the president (Donald Trump)," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said without giving further details.

At least two were killed and 25 injured in a Russian attack on Kyiv overnight on July 10. The assault comes a day after Russia launched its largest-ever drone and missile strike against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. 

The U.K has committed to producing missiles for Thales air defense systems in support of Ukraine over the next 19 years.

"The Americans need some of them (Patriot air defense systems) themselves, but they also have a lot of them," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.



The Economist estimates roughly 31,000 Russian soldiers were killed in the offensive so far, in comparison to some 190,000-350,000 deaths and up to 1.3 million overall Russian casualties of the entire full-scale war.

Moscow's forces launched yet another mass aerial attack, deploying 18 missiles and about 400 drones, including 200 Shahed-type kamikaze models, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Thirty-one construction workers have been rescued from a huge industrial tunnel that partially collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) said.

The incident happened at about 8 p.m. local time at the Los Angeles County's Clearwater Project, a nearly $700 million effort to carry treated wastewater from across the county to the Pacific Ocean.

Lawyers for activist freed from Ice detention filed damages claim alleging false imprisonment and malicious prosecution

Mahmoud Khalil files $20m claim against Trump administration for false imprisonment

Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, whose role in college campus protests against Israel's war on Gaza led to his detention for over three months in immigration jail, is now seeking $20m in damages from the Trump administration.

His lawyers filed a claim Thursday, alleging false imprisonment and malicious prosecution after his March arrest by federal agents. Khalil, a legal US resident, said he suffered severe anguish in jail, and continues to fear for his safety. The government has accused him of leading protests aligned with Hamas, but has not provided any evidence of a link to the terror group.

The fossil fuel industry poured more than $19m into Donald Trump's inaugural fund, accounting for nearly 8% of all donations it raised, a new analysis shows, raising concerns about White House's relationship with big oil.

The president raised a stunning $239m for his inauguration – more than the previous three inaugural committees took in combined and more than double the previous record – according to data published by the US Federal Election Commission (FEC). The oil and gas sector made a significant contribution to that overall number, found the international environmental and human rights organization Global Witness.

The group pulled itemized inaugural fund contribution data released by the FEC in April, and researched each contributor with the help of an in-house artificial intelligence tool. It located 47 contributions to the fund made by companies and individuals linked to the fossil fuel sector, to which Trump has voiced his fealty.

Six Secret Service agents have been suspended without pay after the assassination attempt against Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally last July.

The suspensions range from 10 to 42 days, with a loss of both salary and benefits during the absence, the agency's deputy director, Matt Quinn, told CBS News.

The disciplinary action comes nearly a year after the 13 July 2024 shooting at the Butler farm show grounds, where 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired multiple rounds from an unsecured rooftop, grazing Trump's ear and killing firefighter Corey Comperatore.

Quinn defended the agency's decision not to dismiss the agents outright, telling CBS News the service would not “fire our way out of this” crisis.

“We're going to focus on the root cause and fix the deficiencies that put us in that situation,” he said, adding that suspended personnel would return to reduced operational roles.

In an emailed statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, called Khalil's claim “absurd,” accusing him of “hateful behavior and rhetoric” that threatened Jewish students.

The state department said its actions toward Khalil were fully supported by the law.

Mahmoud Khalil said in a statement that he wanted to send a message that he won't be intimidated into silence. In lieu of a settlement, Khalil suggested he would accept an official apology and changes to the administration's deportation policies.

He said of the Trump administration: “They are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable. Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.”

Khalil is planning to share any settlement money withy others targeted by officials over pro-Palestinian protests.

The AP has more on the filing. It says the Trump administration smeared Mahmoud Khalil as an antisemite while it sought to deport him over his prominent role in campus protests.

The filing — a precursor to a lawsuit under the Federal Tort Claims Act — names the Department of Homeland Security, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the state department.

It comes as the deportation case against Khalil, a 30-year-old recent graduate student at Columbia University, continues to wind its way through the immigration court system.

Citing the CNN report about bureaucratic hurdles at Fema, US senator Ron Wyden said homeland security secretary Kristi Noem was responsible for deaths related to the flooding.

“Kids in Texas died as a direct result of Kristi Noem's negligence. She should be removed from office before her incompetence gets Oregonians killed in a wildfire,” Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, posted on the social media network Bluesky.

New cost-cutting measures at FEMA may have slowed the agency's response to the Texas floods, CNN reported on Thursday.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — whose department oversees FEMA — recently enacted a sweeping rule aimed at cutting spending: Every contract and grant over $100,000 now requires her personal sign-off before any funds can be released.

For FEMA, where disaster response costs routinely soar into the billions as the agency contracts with on-the-ground crews, officials say that threshold is essentially “pennies,” requiring sign-off for relatively small expenditures.

In essence, they say the order has stripped the agency of much of its autonomy at the very moment its help is needed most.

“We were operating under a clear set of guidance: lean forward, be prepared, anticipate what the state needs, and be ready to deliver it,” a longtime FEMA official told CNN. “That is not as clear of an intent for us at the moment.”

For example, as central Texas towns were submerged in rising waters, FEMA officials realized they couldn't pre-position Urban Search and Rescue crews from a network of teams stationed regionally across the country.

In the past, FEMA would have swiftly staged these teams, which are specifically trained for situations including catastrophic floods, closer to a disaster zone in anticipation of urgent requests, multiple agency sources told CNN.

But even as Texas rescue crews raced to save lives, FEMA officials realized they needed Noem's approval before sending those additional assets. Noem didn't authorize FEMA's deployment of Urban Search and Rescue teams until Monday, more than 72 hours after the flooding began, multiple sources told CNN.

Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, is pushing back amid new disclosures from a fired DoJ lawyer suggesting justice department attorneys were instructed to defy court orders.

“We support legitimate whistleblowers, but this disgruntled employee is not a whistleblower – he's a leaker asserting false claims seeking five minutes of fame, conveniently timed just before a confirmation hearing and a committee vote,” she wrote in a post on X. “As Mr. Bove testified and as the Department has made clear, there was no court order to defy, as we successfully argued to the DC Circuit when seeking a stay, when they stayed Judge Boasberg's lawless order.”

“And no one was ever asked to defy a court order. This is another instance of misinformation being spread to serve a narrative that does not align with the facts. This “whistleblower” signed 3 briefs defending DOJ's position in this matter and his subsequent revisionist account arose only after he was fired because he violated his ethical duties to the department.”

As temperatures soared on a sweltering July day in New York City, shoppers at Queens's largest mall said they were feeling the heat – of rising prices.

“T-shirts, basic t-shirts, underwear, the basic necessities – the prices are going up,” said Clarence Johnson, 48, who was visiting the Macy's at the Queen Center mall to pick up shirts he ordered online.

As Donald Trump presses on with his trade wars, retailers have been passing price increases onto customers. Department stores – which rely on a variety of imported goods and materials, from shoes to t-shirts – have particularly been scrambling to deal with the flux in prices.

At Macy's, signs advertising sales of as much as 60% off original prices were sprinkled around the store – even next to diamond-encrusted necklaces locked inside display cases in the jewelry department. But for some customers, the prices are still too high.

The future of the US government's premier climate crisis report is perilously uncertain after the Trump administration deleted the website that housed the periodic, legally mandated assessments that have been produced by scientists over the past two decades.

Five national climate assessments have been compiled since 2000 by researchers across a dozen US government agencies and outside scientists, providing a gold standard report to city and state officials, as well as the general public, of global heating and its impacts upon human health, agriculture, water supplies, air pollution and other aspects of American life.

But although the assessments are mandated to occur every four years under legislation passed by Congress in 1990, the Trump administration has axed the online portal holding the reports, which went dark last week. A contract to support this work has also been torn up and researchers who were working on the next report, due around 2027, have been dismissed.

A copy of the latest assessment, conducted in 2023, can be found deep on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's website. The Guardian replicated the report here in full in a more visible way for the public to access.

US judge issues preliminary injunction to block Trump's order and certifies a class-action lawsuit that includes all children who will be affected

New Hampshire judge blocks Trump's birthright citizenship order

DoJ whistleblower emails back claim Trump lawyer defied courts over deportations

A federal judge in New Hampshire has again blocked Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship and applied the injunction nationwide.

US district judge Joseph Laplante argued the plaintiffs could be represented as a class and blocked the executive order.

Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, is pushing back amid new disclosures from a fired DOJ lawyer suggesting Justice Department attorneys were instructed to defy court orders.

“We support legitimate whistleblowers, but this disgruntled employee is not a whistleblower — he's a leaker asserting false claims seeking five minutes of fame, conveniently timed just before a confirmation hearing and a committee vote,” she wrote in a post on X. “As Mr. Bove testified and as the Department has made clear, there was no court order to defy, as we successfully argued to the DC Circuit when seeking a stay, when they stayed Judge Boasberg's lawless order.”

Donald Trump has appointed his transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, as interim administrator of Nasa, six weeks after withdrawing the nomination of Elon Musk ally and billionaire Jared Isaacman for the permanent role.

The president announced the appointment on Truth Social on Wednesday evening, praising Duffy's work on transportation infrastructure and describing him as someone who will be “a fantastic leader of the ever more important space agency, even if only for a short period of time”.

Duffy, who will maintain his cabinet position while taking on Nasa duties, wrote on X: “Honored to accept this mission. Time to take over space. Let's launch.”

A federal judge in New Hampshire blocked Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship, certifying the case as a nationwide class action. The decision from U.S. District judge Joseph Laplante comes after the US supreme court said federal judges could only issue nationwide injunctions if they certified plaintiffs as a nationwide class. The issue is expected to return to the US supreme court, which has not yet decided on the constitutionality of Trump's order.

Here's what else is happening:

A Justice Department whistleblower turned over text messages and emails in support of his explosive claim that Emil Bove, a top department official, told lawyers they should be prepared to say “fuck you” and defy court orders.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, where he said the US and Russia had exchanged new ideas for Ukraine peace talks

Some Planned Parenthood affiliates are alerting patients that they can no longer accept Medicaid for care Because of a provision in the GOP reconciliation bill that passed earlier this month.

At least two regional Planned Parenthood affiliates have notices on their websites telling patients that, thanks to a provision in Republicans' new tax-and-spending bill that “defunds” the reproductive healthcare giant, they can no longer accept Medicaid.

However, this provision – which abortion rights supporters have called a “backdoor abortion ban” – was recently blocked by a court order. Other Planned Parenthood affiliates are continuing to treat patients who use Medicaid to pay for treatment.

Although the Planned Parenthood network is overseen by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, it includes dozens of independent affiliates that directly provide care to patients.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington DC and Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains had notices on their websites alerting patients that they can no longer accept Medicaid, the US government's insurance program for low-income people.

Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, is taking on a conspiracy theory on Thursday about contrails – the white streaks that appear behind airplanes. 

As CNN reported, there is a longstanding conspiracy theory that the streaks are actually chemicals sprayed by the US government to control the weather. The streaks are condensation trails, formed by water vapor that freezes around an aircraft's exhaust.

“Americans have questions about geoengineering and contrails. They expect honesty and transparency from their government when seeking answers. For years, people who asked questions in good faith were dismissed, even vilified by the media and their own government. This ends today,” he posted on X.

The EPA announced it was launching a webpage explaining what contrails are. The page addresses the “chemtrails” conspiracy theory.

“It is a term some people use to inaccurately claim that contrails resulting from routine air traffic are actually an intentional release of dangerous chemicals or biological agents at high altitudes for a variety of nefarious purposes, including population control, mind control, or attempts to geoengineer Earth or modify the weather,” the page says.

The 14th amendment to the US constitution has long been understood to guarantee citizenship to any person born on US soil. “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,” the amendment says.

Trump has sought to overturn the longstanding interpretation of the law to say that a person can only be considered a US citizen if they have at least one parent who is a US citizen or a lawful permanent resident.

If the order were to take effect, it's estimated that around 150,000 babies would be denied citizenship each year.

Laplante's order is significant because it comes after the US supreme court ruled 6-3 that district court judges could not issue nationwide injunctions unless the plaintiffs in the case had been certified as a nationwide class. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order ending birthright citizenship.

The plaintiffs before Laplante had asked to be certified as a class representing all babies whose citizenship could be affected by Trump's order, according to Reuters.

Laplante's decision to certify the class and issue an injunction shows that there is a path forward for the lawsuits, which are likely to quickly return to the US supreme court, which will likely return to the issue to address the bigger underlying legal issues in the order.

A federal judge in New Hampshire has again blocked Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship and applied the injunction nationwide.

US district judge Joseph Laplante argued the plaintiffs could be represented as a class and blocked the executive order.

“At this point why don't we just submit an emoji of a middle finger as our filing,” Reuveni wrote in one text 19 March message. “A picayune middle finger.” “So stupid,” his boss wrote back. The messages provide an unusual and remarkable level of insight into how justice department lawyers knew they were defying court orders.

One of the newly-disclosed emails shows that Bove gave the OK to deplane the flights, despite an order from US district judge James Boasberg to turn planes carrying detainees around. According to the email, Bove gave the legal advice that it was OK to deplane the detainees because the planes had left US airspace before Boasberg's written order had been filed on the court docket. Prior to issuing his written order, Boasberg had issued an oral order from the bench.

During a hearing before the senate judiciary committee last month, Emil Bove denied that he had ever instructed justice department attorneys to defy a court order.

“I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,” he said.

The messages released by Erez Reuveni suggest that DoJ lawyers were, at the very least, aware of the possibility they might have to ignore judicial orders.

Lawyers for activist freed from Ice detention filed damages claim alleging false imprisonment and malicious prosecution

Mahmoud Khalil files $20m claim against Trump administration for false imprisonment

Mahmoud Khalil said in a statement that he wanted to send a message that he won't be intimidated into silence. In lieu of a settlement, Khalil suggested he would accept an official apology and changes to the administration's deportation policies.

He said of the Trump administration: “They are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable. Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.”

Khalil is planning to share any settlement money with others targeted by officials over pro-Palestinian protests.

Oregon's junior senator, Jeff Merkley, announced on Thursday that he is running for re-election next year, citing the threat posed by “Donald Trump and his Maga cronies”.

Merkley, a liberal Democrat, will turn 70 before election day in 2026, and his decision to run for a fourth term will not please party activists who are concerned that there are too many older Democrats in Congress. He was first elected to the senate in 2008.

Oregon's senior senator, Democrat Ron Wyden, who is 76, was elected to a fifth term in 2022.

In an interview with the Washington Post in 2023, Merkley said that while he did not support calls for a mandatory retirement age for senators: “I do say to my team, when I am at that point, that pivot in my life, where you start to see the changes in my abilities, don't let me run for re-election.”

The Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil filed a claim against the Trump administration seeking $20m in damages, alleging he was falsely imprisoned. The suit comes as Khalil, a lawful permanent resident who has not been charged with a crime, is out on bail and the administration continues to actively seek his removal from the US. The Thursday filing is a precusor to a lawsuit under the Federal Tort Claims Act. “They are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable. Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked,” Khalil said in a statement.

Here's what's also happened so far today:

A US district judge issued an injunction blocking Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship, certifying a nationwide class of plaintiffs

Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, pushed back against new evidence from a whistleblower suggesting Department of Justice lawyers were instructed to ignore court orders.

US senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said Kristi Noem was responsible for deaths related to flooding in Texas.

Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and his wife, state senator Angela Paxton, announced on Thursday they were getting divorced.

The Texas radio station KUT obtained the petition for divorce filed in Collin county. The petition accuses the attorney general of adultery and says the couple hasn't lived together since June 2024.

Ken Paxton, who is running for US Senate, said on X:

After facing the pressures of countless political attacks and public scrutiny, Angela and I have decided to start a new chapter in our lives. I could not be any more proud or grateful for the incredible family that God has blessed us with, and I remain committed to supporting our amazing children and grandchildren. I ask for your prayers and privacy at this time.

Angela Paxton said on X:

Today, after 38 years of marriage, I filed for divorce on biblical grounds. I believe marriage is a sacred covenant and I have earnestly pursued reconciliation. But in light of recent discoveries, I do not believe that it honors God or is loving to myself, my children, or Ken to remain in the marriage. I move forward with complete confidence that God is always working everything together for the good of those who love Him and who are called according to His purpose.

The fossil fuel industry poured more than $19m into Donald Trump's inaugural fund, accounting for nearly 8% of all donations it raised, a new analysis shows, raising concerns about White House's relationship with big oil.

The president raised a stunning $239m for his inauguration – more than the previous three inaugural committees took in combined and more than double the previous record – according to data published by the US Federal Election Commission (FEC). The oil and gas sector made a significant contribution to that overall number, found the international environmental and human rights organization Global Witness.

The group pulled itemized inaugural fund contribution data released by the FEC in April, and researched each contributor with the help of an in-house artificial intelligence tool. It located 47 contributions to the fund made by companies and individuals linked to the fossil fuel sector, to which Trump has voiced his fealty.

Six Secret Service agents have been suspended without pay after the assassination attempt against Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally last July.

The suspensions range from 10 to 42 days, with a loss of both salary and benefits during the absence, the agency's deputy director, Matt Quinn, told CBS News.

The disciplinary action comes nearly a year after the 13 July 2024 shooting at the Butler farm show grounds, where 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired multiple rounds from an unsecured rooftop, grazing Trump's ear and killing firefighter Corey Comperatore.

Quinn defended the agency's decision not to dismiss the agents outright, telling CBS News the service would not “fire our way out of this” crisis.

“We're going to focus on the root cause and fix the deficiencies that put us in that situation,” he said, adding that suspended personnel would return to reduced operational roles.

In an emailed statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, called Khalil's claim “absurd,” accusing him of “hateful behavior and rhetoric” that threatened Jewish students.

The state department said its actions toward Khalil were fully supported by the law.

Mahmoud Khalil said in a statement that he wanted to send a message that he won't be intimidated into silence. In lieu of a settlement, Khalil suggested he would accept an official apology and changes to the administration's deportation policies.

He said of the Trump administration: “They are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable. Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.”

Khalil is planning to share any settlement money with others targeted by officials over pro-Palestinian protests.

The AP has more on the filing. It says the Trump administration smeared Mahmoud Khalil as an antisemite while it sought to deport him over his prominent role in campus protests.

The filing — a precursor to a lawsuit under the Federal Tort Claims Act — names the Department of Homeland Security, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the state department.

It comes as the deportation case against Khalil, a 30-year-old recent graduate student at Columbia University, continues to wind its way through the immigration court system.

Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, whose role in college campus protests against Israel's war on Gaza led to his detention for over three months in immigration jail, is now seeking $20m in damages from the Trump administration.

His lawyers filed a claim Thursday, alleging false imprisonment and malicious prosecution after his March arrest by federal agents. Khalil, a legal US resident, said he suffered severe anguish in jail, and continues to fear for his safety. The government has accused him of leading protests aligned with Hamas, but has not provided any evidence of a link to the terror group.

Citing the CNN report about bureaucratic hurdles at Fema, US senator Ron Wyden said homeland security secretary Kristi Noem was responsible for deaths related to the flooding.

“Kids in Texas died as a direct result of Kristi Noem's negligence. She should be removed from office before her incompetence gets Oregonians killed in a wildfire,” Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, posted on the social media network Bluesky.

New cost-cutting measures at FEMA may have slowed the agency's response to the Texas floods, CNN reported on Thursday.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — whose department oversees FEMA — recently enacted a sweeping rule aimed at cutting spending: Every contract and grant over $100,000 now requires her personal sign-off before any funds can be released.

For FEMA, where disaster response costs routinely soar into the billions as the agency contracts with on-the-ground crews, officials say that threshold is essentially “pennies,” requiring sign-off for relatively small expenditures.

In essence, they say the order has stripped the agency of much of its autonomy at the very moment its help is needed most.

“We were operating under a clear set of guidance: lean forward, be prepared, anticipate what the state needs, and be ready to deliver it,” a longtime FEMA official told CNN. “That is not as clear of an intent for us at the moment.”

For example, as central Texas towns were submerged in rising waters, FEMA officials realized they couldn't pre-position Urban Search and Rescue crews from a network of teams stationed regionally across the country.

In the past, FEMA would have swiftly staged these teams, which are specifically trained for situations including catastrophic floods, closer to a disaster zone in anticipation of urgent requests, multiple agency sources told CNN.

But even as Texas rescue crews raced to save lives, FEMA officials realized they needed Noem's approval before sending those additional assets. Noem didn't authorize FEMA's deployment of Urban Search and Rescue teams until Monday, more than 72 hours after the flooding began, multiple sources told CNN.

Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, is pushing back amid new disclosures from a fired DoJ lawyer suggesting justice department attorneys were instructed to defy court orders.

“We support legitimate whistleblowers, but this disgruntled employee is not a whistleblower – he's a leaker asserting false claims seeking five minutes of fame, conveniently timed just before a confirmation hearing and a committee vote,” she wrote in a post on X. “As Mr. Bove testified and as the Department has made clear, there was no court order to defy, as we successfully argued to the DC Circuit when seeking a stay, when they stayed Judge Boasberg's lawless order.”

“And no one was ever asked to defy a court order. This is another instance of misinformation being spread to serve a narrative that does not align with the facts. This “whistleblower” signed 3 briefs defending DOJ's position in this matter and his subsequent revisionist account arose only after he was fired because he violated his ethical duties to the department.”

As temperatures soared on a sweltering July day in New York City, shoppers at Queens's largest mall said they were feeling the heat – of rising prices.

“T-shirts, basic t-shirts, underwear, the basic necessities – the prices are going up,” said Clarence Johnson, 48, who was visiting the Macy's at the Queen Center mall to pick up shirts he ordered online.

As Donald Trump presses on with his trade wars, retailers have been passing price increases onto customers. Department stores – which rely on a variety of imported goods and materials, from shoes to t-shirts – have particularly been scrambling to deal with the flux in prices.

At Macy's, signs advertising sales of as much as 60% off original prices were sprinkled around the store – even next to diamond-encrusted necklaces locked inside display cases in the jewelry department. But for some customers, the prices are still too high.

The future of the US government's premier climate crisis report is perilously uncertain after the Trump administration deleted the website that housed the periodic, legally mandated assessments that have been produced by scientists over the past two decades.

Five national climate assessments have been compiled since 2000 by researchers across a dozen US government agencies and outside scientists, providing a gold standard report to city and state officials, as well as the general public, of global heating and its impacts upon human health, agriculture, water supplies, air pollution and other aspects of American life.

But although the assessments are mandated to occur every four years under legislation passed by Congress in 1990, the Trump administration has axed the online portal holding the reports, which went dark last week. A contract to support this work has also been torn up and researchers who were working on the next report, due around 2027, have been dismissed.

A copy of the latest assessment, conducted in 2023, can be found deep on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's website. The Guardian replicated the report here in full in a more visible way for the public to access.

            McDonald's Snack Wrap is finally returning to menus, going on sale Thursday in the chain's latest push to revive slumping sales.
    


            Despite being pulled from a majority of menus in 2016, the Snack Wrap has remained a fan favorite, with thousands of people demanding McDonald's bring it back. They finally get their wish this week with the relaunched version: the chain's new crispy chicken strips, lettuce and cheese on a tortilla, with the option of either ranch dressing or spicy pepper sauce. The menu item, which will be a permanent addition, is priced at $2.99.
    


            It's McDonald's latest change as it hopes to turn its fortunes around. McDonald's recently reported two consecutive quarters of sales declines in the United States, including a 3.6% drop in same-store sales at the beginning of the year — its worst decline since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            The company said low- and middle-income consumers pulled back their spending because of economic uncertainty from the Trump administration's chaotic trade war.
    


            McDonald's isn't alone in its financial slump. Other fast-casual chains, including Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Starbucks, reported meager earnings results this year as consumer sentiment sank to record lows in the spring.
    


            The re-introduction of the Snack Wrap “will likely be a positive move” for McDonald's, according to RJ Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, which tracks foot traffic. He told CNN that the “return of nostalgic products has driven incremental visits” for competing fast food chains.
    


            McDonald's menu has already gone through a slew of changes this quarter.
    


            The chain this week also introduced a spicy version of its Egg McMuffin for a limited time. Consumers are increasingly choosing to make breakfast at home, meaning slower sales for McDonald's in the mornings, executives revealed on its most recent earnings call.

            The chain is adding a new “Daily Double” cheeseburger to its value menu beginning July 22 — a new option for its “McValue Meal Deal” bundle. Also new on the menu are a Hershey's S'mores McFlurry and a blueberry and crème pie. Those limited-time dessert offerings come after a planned partnership with Krispy Kreme to sell donuts at all of its US restaurants was cancelled mid-rollout.
    


            “McDonald's latest menu additions align with several innovation trends we've seen across the fast food category, including a shift toward afternoon snacking and the introduction of new sauces to create product excitement,” Hottovy said, adding that the new additions rolled out so far “have helped drive incremental visits” during specific times of day. 



            Beverages will likely be part of the next shakeup. McDonald's announced in May that it was pulling the plug on its CosMc's spinoff, which was opened in response to demand for specialty coffee and rise of beverage chains. Some of the drinks formerly sold there will soon be available at McDonald's.

Prime Minister Mark Carney meets with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in May.Leah Millis/Reuters

Carlo Dade is the director of the Trade and Trade Infrastructure Centre at the Canada West Foundation.

Is Canada about to make it through the worst of what a Trump administration can bring? 

That may be an odd question given Tuesday's announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump of a 50-per-cent tariff on copper, adding to a seemingly endless series of bad-to-worse news from Washington on trade.

However, there is a larger, more significant change working its way through U.S. courts to which we should be paying attention. This change will either limit the President's ability to impose tariffs on Canada – or reinforce it. This means Canada should not rush into a deal with Mr. Trump and should instead wait it out.

Recall that, on May 28, a panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, including a Trump-appointed judge, unanimously and decisively ruled that the administration's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose what in essence have become whatever-whenever-wherever-however-on-whomever tariffs, at the snap of the President's finger, is unconstitutional and that the tariffs imposed using this power should be struck down. (A separate suit in a U.S. District Court also ruled against the administration's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs.)

This ruling on tariffs issued under the IEEPA struck down the fentanyl and immigration tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, as well as the “Liberation Day” tariffs. The ruling is on hold while the case is being appealed, potentially all the way to the Supreme Court. But the appeals court has put the case on an expedited timeline and is set to hear arguments on July 31. 

If the appeals court or the Supreme Court reverses the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling, then the courts will have given the current and future administrations explicit, rather than assumed, legal sanction to tariff whenever, wherever, however and whomever they want.

But if the ruling is upheld, the tariffs issued on the President's sole authority, such as fentanyl and “Liberation Day” tariffs, as well as future threats, would end. 

This is important. Even though Mr. Trump has already chosen to exclude products traded under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement from these IEEPA tariffs, that exemption is based on presidential whim; should the President change his mind, those tariffs could reappear. The court ruling, if upheld, would remove the threat of those tariffs entirely. 

U.S. court rules Trump does not have ‘unbounded authority' to impose tariffs

As bad as Tuesday's announcement on copper was, a decision by the President to change his mind on the CUSMA exemption for his global tariffs would be worse.

In a side note, the Trump administration has already conceded in legal filings that importers who have paid IEEPA tariffs will be eligible for refunds, including interest, if the U.S. Court of International Trade's decision survives appeal.

This is obviously a momentous ruling for Americans and Canadians and needs to be unpacked, especially in light of Tuesday's announcement.

A U.S. president has several powers, all delegated from Congress, that can be used to impose tariffs. The IEEPA has been the most far-reaching and hence the most consequential and damaging. The recent rulings against its use will not bring relief or certainty to Canadian steel and aluminum and the seven items, including copper, on the current list of products under investigation for tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

The distinction between IEEPA tariffs and Section 232, or steel and aluminum tariffs, is hugely important.

Section 232 and other non-IEEPA tariff measures require an investigation, public comment and the issuance of a report, all of which turn a “snap of the fingers” act into a drawn-out, politicized, public process. The Section 232 investigation into steel and aluminum took nearly 270 days. Copper took a few months, but the investigations all take time.

U.S. appeals court reinstates Trump's tariffs as legal battle reframes global trade war

Furthermore, these tariffs are applied at the four-digit level of classification under the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule, which has more than 1,220 four-digit headings. 

The political and regulatory math is not in the President's favour for widespread use of this or other IEEPA substitutes. 

There is still the potential for real economic harm from the use of other tariff measures, as we have seen. However, it is critical to put this in perspective. As bad as Tuesday's news may be, a handful of items, each individually investigated and taking almost a year to implement, are not the tariff threat that is the everything, everywhere and all at the snap of the President's fingers tariffs. 

For Canada and other countries, if the ruling stands, Mr. Trump's negotiating leverage will be weakened – both in imposing new tariffs and threatening to, in effect, abrogate agreements by imposing new tariffs at will. 

If his favourite and easiest tool for imposing tariffs is constrained and the current fentanyl and across-the-board tariffs are about to be revoked, then it's a whole new ball game and Canada needs to change its negotiating objectives and strategy.

Step 1 is to pause making any further concessions or signing agreements until the court cases play out. There is little sense in making concessions to end tariffs that are likely to be revoked. Second, signing agreements now, when the President still has a strong hand, makes even less sense. 

For example, Canada already has, or thought it had, an agreement to end the steel and aluminum tariffs. But in his second term, Mr. Trump reneged on the agreement he signed in his first term without adhering to any of its conditions.

With steel and aluminum tariffs, what Canada needed was not an agreement to temporarily suspend the tariffs; it needed an exemption to prevent the use of presidential power to impose them. The administration's expansion of Section 232 tariff investigations to other products makes this point. This reneging on an agreement by Mr. Trump, of course, also applies to the North American trade agreement he negotiated.

Neither agreements nor the President's word will protect us; only U.S. law and regulations that constrain the President will. 

In other words, the goal for negotiations is a binding commitment and U.S. law that prevents, limits or conditions the use of the presidential tariff authority.

Not having this sort of concession is an explicit acknowledgment that, like the steel and aluminum agreement, sooner or later, any deal will not be worth the paper on which it is written.

Donald Trump's frustration was clear when he was asked who had approved a pause on sending weapons to Ukraine during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

“I don't know,” he snapped at the reporter. “Why don't you tell me?”

The freeze in military aid last week blindsided top national security figures, alarmed key allies and was rapidly reversed by the US president himself, but not before generating a rush of headlines about dysfunction and incoherence in the policy process.

At the centre of it all is a little-known Pentagon official: Elbridge Colby, a national security policy chief, who reportedly halted supplies because US stockpiles were running low.

Insiders say that, at best, it illustrates confusion about how to put Mr Trump's “America First” policies into practice and, at worst, it shows how the administration's decision-making process has broken down.

A former member of the US national security council said Mr Colby had come unstuck because he was trying to put proverbial flesh on the bones of Mr Trump's vague platform of ending foreign wars and avoiding anything that looked like intervention.

“I don't think he's trying anything he didn't think is the position of the president or the defence secretary. He's not freelancing,” he said. “He thinks this is the position of the people above him.”

Others pushed back on the claim that Mr Colby was behind a freeze.

“There was no pause,” said a person familiar with the events. “The review and the assessment may have slowed things down temporarily, but there was never a decision made to pause those shipments.

Mr Colby served in the first Trump administration and was a lead author of the US 2018 national defence strategy. The report set out a shift from conflicts dominated by counterterrorism operations to great power competition between the US, Russia and China.

But his return in the second Trump administration has proved controversial.

He has argued consistently that America can no longer rely on massively outspending rivals.

“The fundamental reality is that there are structural limitations on what the United States can do – it cannot do everything at once,” he wrote in his 2021 book, The Strategy of Denial. “Thus it must make hard choices.”

His argument that defence resources should be reoriented away from Europe and the Middle East and towards China ignited a feud between Maga loyalists and hawkish conservative senators when his name was put forward earlier this year.

Tom Cotton, an Arkansas senator, led opposition to his nomination and highlighted some of Mr Colby's past comments on Iran, including how he had played down the threat of Tehran obtaining nuclear weapons.

A nuclear-armed Iran could be contained, he argued in 2012, angering Israel's allies who, much like Mr Trump, see it as an existential threat.

Opponents scoured his background for ammunition to prevent him taking up the position. They pointed to a grandfather who ran the CIA and degrees from Harvard University and Yale Law School as evidence that he was too “establishment” for the Trump administration.

He was eventually confirmed with a Senate vote of 54 to 45, thanks to the backing of some heavy hitters from Trump world.

Arthur Schwartz, an adviser to Donald Trump Jr who is also close to JD Vance, the vice-president, had responsibility for steering his nomination through the Senate.

Key Trump confidants, such as Charlie Kirk, head of the Turning Point USA youth movement, spoke up in his support.

And Mr Vance delivered a telling line at his confirmation hearing, setting out an “America First” approach to Pentagon policy.

“We cannot fight wars unless our troops have the ammunition we need; we cannot defend our own national security unless we have the tank shells, the artillery shells and increasingly the drones and other advanced weapons that are necessary to actually fight battles when – God forbid – those battles are necessary to fight,” he said.

After Mr Colby concluded his review last month, the US halted supplies of Patriot air defence systems, Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, missiles used by Himars rocket artillery, Stinger portable air defence systems and 155mm artillery shells promised by the Biden administration.

“This decision was made to put America's interests first following a [US department of defence] review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,” said Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman.

Russia met the announcement with its biggest barrage of attacks on Ukraine in more than three years of war.

One person was killed and 26 were wounded after waves of missiles and drones rained down on Thursday, prompting a phone call between Mr Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky.

The US president reportedly told his Ukrainian counterpart that he did not know about the halt in supplies.

By Monday the pause had been reversed.

“We're gonna send some more weapons. We have to,” Mr Trump told reporters. “They have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now.”

The reversal won praise from friends of Ukraine, even as some worried about the message the U-turn sent to the rest of the world.

Mitch McConnell, who was until recently the leader of Republicans in the Senate, said: “Today, the strategic incoherence of underfunding our military and restricting lethal assistance to partners like Ukraine is measured in the avoidable erosion of American credibility with allies and the mounting deaths of innocents.”

Some of that stems from the administration's mix of traditional conservatives and Maga World iconoclasts, according to John Herbst, former US ambassador to Ukraine.

“Even if the pause was approved at no higher level than the under secretary of defence for policy or even the secretary of defence, it is a reminder that administration policy on Russia and Ukraine is put together with the input of people with vastly different worldviews,” he wrote in a paper for the Atlantic Council.

And Mr Colby has his supporters.

Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to Mr Trump, said pivoting away from Ukraine to China made more sense from an “America First” perspective.

“This is key to our hemispheric defence, and we're being sucked dry,” he said, before drawing an analogy with the strikes on Iran.

“Bridge knows the process, once you supply the weapons, next thing you know you're a combatant like the 12-day war.”

Editor's note: The story is being updated.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a Marshall Plan-style reconstruction strategy to help Ukraine recover from Russia's all-out war in his opening remarks at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 10.

Earlier in the day, the president and First Lady Olena Zelenska arrived at the two-day event focused on mobilizing political and private-sector support for Ukraine's reconstruction. The previous three conferences have taken place in Lugano, London, and Berlin.

"We need a Marshall Plan-style approach, and we should develop it together," Zelensky told representatives of governments, international organizations, and businesses who gathered in Rome.

The Marshall Plan was an economic aid program that the United States offered to European countries after World War II to help them rebuild their economies.

"Rebuilding Ukraine is not just about our country. It's also about your countries, your companies, your technology, your jobs," Zelensky said.

Drawing comparisons to existing international coalitions supporting Kyiv's military efforts, he called upon international partners to form a recovery coalition and help Ukraine rebuild with a systematic approach.

"The way we rebuild our country can also modernize your infrastructure and industries. And I ask you to support the recovery coalition and help define specific financing mechanisms."

Zelensky stressed that Kyiv would welcome only "true partners" in the initiative, "those who are not helping Russia continue this war."

The president called for more "active" ways of using roughly $300 billion in Russian assets immobilized by the West to aid Ukraine's recovery efforts. He also urged foreign partners to increase investment in Ukraine's missiles, air defenses, and interceptor drones to help fend off Russian aerial attacks.

Zelensky pointed out that earlier on July 10, Russia launched around 400 drones and 18 missiles against Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, killing two people and injuring, according to the latest figures, over 20.

Speaking before Zelensky, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni emphasized Italy's commitment to mobilizing private capital for Ukraine's reconstruction.

"We can play this match and win it only if we manage to mobilize private capital, the entrepreneurial spirit of enterprises, and their ability to attract investments," she told the participants.

The conference yielded significant financial commitments, with participants agreeing to "more than 10 billion euros ($12 billion) commitment" for reconstruction efforts, according to Meloni.

"Don't be scared of investing, of building, of reconstructing in Ukraine. Because investing in the reconstruction of Ukraine is a fruitful investment in a nation that has shown resilience”, Meloni said.

"Investing in Ukraine means investing in ourselves. Because you may like it or not, but what happens in Ukraine is about all of us."

Drawing comparisons to Italy's "economic miracle" after the devastation caused by World War II, Meloni voiced hope that the Rome conference would usher in a new "miracle" in Ukraine.

The URC 2025 is organized jointly by the governments of Ukraine and Italy, with the participation of the European Commission, international financial institutions, business leaders, civil society, and local authorities.

The conference's primary goal is to mobilize political, financial, and technical support for Ukraine, focusing on attracting private investment, strengthening human capital, rebuilding communities and regions, and advancing reforms for European integration.Ahead of the conference, Zelensky met with Pope Leo XIV and U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg.

Zelensky told the conference that he and Pope Leo discussed efforts to bring home Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.

"We really must explore every possible way to bring our children back home to their families, to Ukraine, so they don't forget who they are... And so they are not used against Ukraine in war or sabotage when they grow up."

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha earlier announced that on July 10, Zelensky is scheduled to hold further talks in Rome with U.S. officials to discuss sanctions policy and the imminent adoption of a new U.S. sanctions package against Russia.

"We need a person (as an ambassador to the U.S.) to be strong and to be in the context of the most important thing, in the context of strengthening Ukraine — through weapons, first of all. Therefore, one of my ideas is that it can be Ukraine's defense minister," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.



Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets mistakenly presented a June 30 report by a little-known group as an internal U.N. analysis on the 2022 Olenivka prison explosion, which killed over 50 Ukrainian POWs, Slidstvo.Info reported on July 10, citing a response from Lubinets's office.

"I wouldn't characterize it as something that guarantees peace, but it's a concept that, you know, that I'll take back to the president (Donald Trump)," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said without giving further details.

Filmed over several weeks in June and July, our journalists take shelter in bathrooms, basements, and parking garages as explosions ring out overhead.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during the ASEAN Summit.

At least two were killed and 25 injured in a Russian attack on Kyiv overnight on July 10. The assault comes a day after Russia launched its largest-ever drone and missile strike against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. 

The U.K has committed to producing missiles for Thales air defense systems in support of Ukraine over the next 19 years.

"The Americans need some of them (Patriot air defense systems) themselves, but they also have a lot of them," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.



The Economist estimates roughly 31,000 Russian soldiers were killed in the offensive so far, in comparison to some 190,000-350,000 deaths and up to 1.3 million overall Russian casualties of the entire full-scale war.

Moscow's forces launched yet another mass aerial attack, deploying 18 missiles and about 400 drones, including 200 Shahed-type kamikaze models, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

International partners must help Ukraine rebuild by introducing their own Marshall Plan, U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg said on July 9 during an open discussion in Rome, Ukrinform reported.

Kellogg's statement comes on the eve of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome, co-hosted by Ukraine and Italy from July 10 to 11. It marks the fourth major international event focused on mobilizing political and private-sector support for Ukraine's reconstruction.

Kellogg emphasized the importance of rebuilding Ukraine and mentioned the Marshall Plan, an economic aid program the United States offered to European countries after World War II to help them rebuild their economies.

According to Kellogg, a similar initiative could be developed for Ukraine. The U.S. envoy said this would be "extremely challenging," as the situation is very complicated. A ceasefire must first be achieved, which could eventually lead to the end of the Russian war in Ukraine, he added.

The diplomat noted that the Ukrainians agreed to the ceasefire, but it was a unilateral agreement.

Kellogg also placed particular emphasis on the issue of returning Ukrainian children. 

According to Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump raised the issue directly with President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging that it be a key point in any future negotiations with Moscow. Kellogg added that the Russian side reportedly agreed to include it on the agenda of the future talks.

Prior to the open discussion, Kellogg also met Zelensky on July 9 ahead of the Recovery Conference. The president described their conversation as "substantive" and said the meeting focused on weapons support and sanctions.

The Recovery Conference opens as Ukraine continues to face daily aerial bombardments and repel Russian ground offensives across the front line. The destruction has placed immense pressure on Ukraine's economy and infrastructure.

The Financial Times reported on July 8 that Kyiv faces a projected deficit of $8 billion to $19 billion for 2026, driven largely by declining U.S. assistance and the absence of a breakthrough toward a ceasefire.

Just weeks into Donald Trump's second presidency, the Department of Homeland Security began sending immigrants living in the United States to prisons in Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Panama and to the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. At the time, newspapers reported that the Trump administration was pursuing similar agreements with Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Kosovo, Libya, Moldova, Rwanda, and Ukraine. The list has more recently grown to dozens of countries, including South Sudan.

Although this strategy shocked many Americans, the offshoring of detention is not new. In fact, it has a recent precedent in American history: it was used during the so-called war on terror, when Washington detained suspected terrorists in one country and took them to another, a process formally known as “extraordinary rendition.” This was often done for the express purpose of torturing suspects or enabling other governments to do so. But the practice also has a longer history. For decades, the United States and other countries have systematically and forcibly moved asylum seekers to “third countries,” or territories that have lower legal standards and that are neither their places of origin nor their intended destinations.

Trump's approach to offshore detention, however, is unprecedented. His administration has sent hundreds of immigrants who were living in the United States, some of them for years, to third countries where there is no practical way to judge their asylum claims. Moreover, immigrants have been removed from the United States before they have had a chance to defend themselves before an immigration judge, as is standard practice in the United States. “The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,” a U.S. appellate court wrote in April, in a decision demanding that the Trump administration return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was wrongly sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, to the United States.

But on June 23, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily allowed the Trump administration to continue deporting immigrants to third countries, including to South Sudan. The summary ruling, in which no reasoning was offered, paused a lower court's order halting such deportations and affirming immigrants' rights to know where they are being deported to and to challenge being sent to a country where they could face persecution or torture.

Although this offshoring practice sends a strong signal that the government is taking a hard line on immigration, it is bad policy: it is far more expensive than detaining and processing asylum seekers on the mainland, offers too many concessions to host countries that often have poor human rights records, and is used to skirt the human rights obligations to which the United States has agreed. It also portends a broader threat to the rule of law domestically; normalizing offshore detention can normalize the mistreatment of U.S. citizens. “Homegrown criminals next,” Trump told Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's president, during a televised meeting in the Oval Office in April.

Following World War II, most of the world's countries signed international accords designed to prevent “refoulement,” or sending refugees back to places where they might be persecuted. But most governments still sought to block the entry of refugees; to do so without blatantly violating new international laws, they prevented people from setting foot on their territory and being able to ask for asylum.

One of the methods to achieve this was by offshoring the detention and processing of asylum seekers, which in the past few decades the United States has done more than any other country. In the early 1990s, the U.S. Coast Guard began intercepting asylum seekers at sea and taking them to the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo, where they were granted fewer rights than they would enjoy on the U.S. mainland, including access to information about their right to ask for asylum, their right to be represented by a lawyer, and their ability to file an appeal. At the height of this practice, in 1994, the base held more than 30,000 asylum seekers, most from Cuba and Haiti. With capacity at Guantánamo full, the Clinton administration sent 8,000 of the asylum seekers to Howard Air Force Base, in what was then the Panama Canal Zone, and to ships anchored in Kingston Harbor, Jamaica. Most who were found to meet the criteria of being persecuted at home were ultimately settled in the United States, but some were quietly resettled as refugees in other countries, including Australia, Nicaragua, Panama, Spain, and Venezuela, as a result of diplomatic favors from these governments.

Inspired in part by the Guantánamo model, the Australian government created its own offshore detention system, the so-called Pacific Solution. In 2001, the country's special forces boarded a container ship carrying 433 asylum seekers, most of them from the persecuted Hazara minority group in Afghanistan. The Australian navy then transported the asylum seekers to two Pacific islands for detention: Manus, in Papua New Guinea, and Nauru, the world's smallest island state. The countries, which were under Australian control for much of the twentieth century, accepted the deal in return for financial compensation and development aid.

From 2001 to 2007 and from 2012 to 2014, Australia sent 5,800 asylum seekers it had intercepted at sea to these islands. Hundreds who had been verified as refugees nonetheless remained detained there for years, because the Australian government wanted to deter more asylum seekers from using that route.

One of the purposes of offshore detention is to restrict the access of journalists, attorneys, and watchdogs to detention facilities. The islands' isolation allowed abuses by detention staff to go unchecked. A cache of documents from the facility in Nauru obtained and published by The Guardian in 2016 included extensive reports of assaults on children, including sexual assault. Doctors Without Borders treated 208 patients there; it reported that 60 percent of them experienced suicidal thoughts and that 30 percent attempted suicide. The organization said that the level of mental suffering it found on Nauru was among the most severe it had “ever seen among its patients anywhere.” At least seven asylum seekers detained on Nauru died by suicide.



Denmark twice planned offshore schemes with Rwanda, first in 2011 and again in 2022, in which it would transfer asylum seekers on its territory to Rwanda for processing. The European Commission and the UN Committee Against Torture condemned the plans based on Rwanda's history of human rights violations and the risk of refoulement, and Denmark shelved the idea without implementing it. The United Kingdom announced a similar deal with Rwanda, also in 2022. Under the plan, asylum seekers sent from the United Kingdom and granted refugee status by Rwanda could stay in Rwanda but would not be allowed to return to the United Kingdom. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom blocked the policy in 2023, citing concerns that the asylum seekers would not be safe in Rwanda. But the country may yet become an offshoring destination: in May 2025, Rwanda's foreign minister, Olivier Nduhungirehe, claimed that Kigali was negotiating with the Trump administration to receive migrants expelled by the United States.

The clearest implementation of Europe's aspirations to push its border control into other countries was a deal signed by the EU and Turkey in March 2016. The EU paid Turkey six billion euros and promised to grant Turkish nationals visa-free travel in exchange for the Turkish government attempting to stop asylum seekers—mostly Syrian refugees fleeing that country's civil war—from crossing into Greece and agreeing to accept people who had been intercepted during attempts to cross. But Europe may also be on the cusp of more direct offshoring arrangements. Last year, Italy signed a five-year deal with Albania that would allow the transfer of up to 36,000 intercepted asylum seekers per year to detention facilities in Albania. Italian officials would manage the camps and process the migrants' asylum cases in Albania, which is not an EU member state. Anyone determined to be eligible for asylum would be admitted to Italy, but those whose cases were denied would be repatriated. Asylum seekers successfully challenged the plan in Italian courts, citing the risk of refoulement.

But this past April, under a new version of the plan, Italy sent 40 migrants to the facilities for forced repatriation after their asylum applications were rejected in Italy. This marked the first known instance of an EU member state sending rejected asylum applicants to a third country outside the EU. Politicians around the EU have expressed a desire to emulate the newer Italian model, but it remains unclear if the practice will pass scrutiny in Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation and the European Court of Human Rights.

Despite the recent proliferation of third-country candidates, rich countries have generally had difficulty finding hosts for their offshoring schemes. Few governments want to be stuck with masses of migrants whose countries of origin may not facilitate repatriation. There can also be reputational costs to offshore detention. After its participation in Australia's Pacific Solution, for instance, Nauru came to be known as the “Pacific Gulag.”

Those countries that do partake have their reasons. For some, the schemes represent a way to rehabilitate their images. Rwanda's longtime president, Paul Kagame, used the country's deals with Denmark and the United Kingdom to promote a vision of a peaceful, stable country that was flourishing after the 1994 genocide. Critics, meanwhile, suggested that the deals were an attempt to whitewash Kagame's support for armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and his authoritarian policies at home. Negative global reactions to the Rwandan deals suggest they have not been a reputational blessing. El Salvador, for its part, has tried to put a positive spin on having the world's highest incarceration rate, with Bukele using the deal with the Trump administration to boast of “the best prison system in the world.”

These arrangements can also be incredibly lucrative. Italy was expected to spend around $1 billion over five years through its deal with Albania. British taxpayers will also be paying an estimated $1 billion for their government's deal with Rwanda, despite its cancellation. The Australian government paid private contractors and the governments of Papua New Guinea and Nauru an estimated $7.75 billion to detain around 4,180 asylum seekers between 2012 and 2024. A 2016 study estimated that the Australian government would have saved about $300,000 annually per asylum seeker if it had transferred them to Australia for community detention while their claims were adjudicated. For host countries, these payments can be a windfall. During the 2012 to 2014 offshore transfers, for instance, Australian payments to Nauru represented two-thirds of the island's GDP.

Speaking at a press conference in February, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the Salvadoran government's “very generous offer” to detain immigrants deported from the United States. Rubio said that the $6 million plan between the countries—the details of which are opaque—would “outsource, at a fraction of the cost, at least some of the most dangerous and violent criminals that we have.” Yet the economic costs of processing and detaining asylum seekers offshore are much higher than processing and detaining them onshore. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has estimated that the average daily cost of detaining an immigrant in the United States is $152. Alternatives to detention are far cheaper: the agency's Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, for instance, which monitors asylum seekers via telephone reporting, a smartphone application, or an ankle or wrist bracelet, costs only $4.20 per immigrant per day.

Countries seeking offshore processing and detention often offer concessions beyond direct payments for services. In the past, such deals have paved the way for trade agreements, diplomatic support, weapons transfers, or the easing of visa requirements. Like several other countries that serve as migration buffers, Albania is a candidate for EU membership; the Italian government has expressed support for its accession. Willingness to allow the detention of migrants on their soil gives countries such as Albania leverage in these negotiations. Several third countries approached by the Trump administration to detain migrants have reportedly sought to avoid being placed on the list of countries whose nationals are banned from traveling to the United States.

The real rationale for countries wishing to offshore the processing and detention of asylum seekers and even long-term immigrants is to create a spectacle of control while hiding individual immigrants in legal black holes. Offshoring schemes make for compelling political theater. Bukele, for instance, released a slick video on social media, with English-language commentary, that celebrated the arrival of deportation flights from the United States. It opens with drone footage of the aircraft but then cuts to a montage of machine guns and guards in balaclavas frogmarching detainees under flashing red and blue lights before roughly shaving their heads and stuffing them into cells. The following day, the White House released its own video in which a handcuffed man is frisked on an airport tarmac to the tune of Semisonic's hit song from 1998, “Closing Time”: “Closing time / you don't have to go home / but you can't stay here.”

Such productions are a way for the Trump administration to show domestic supporters that it is making good on its promise to carry out mass deportations—even if the number of deportations this year is on pace to be lower than it was during the final year of the Biden administration. Other aims are to scare asylum seekers and unauthorized migrants already in the United States into self-deporting and to deter potential future immigrants with images of harsh treatment.

Hidden beneath the spectacle are the fates of real-life people. The United States is party to a UN convention against torture or degrading treatment, the domestic obligations of which are implemented through the U.S. Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998. The law's core provision states that “it shall be the policy of the United States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, regardless of whether the person is physically present in the United States.” And yet the U.S. government is actively sending immigrants to places such as El Salvador, where according to independent watchdogs and to the State Department itself, prisoners are subject to endemic torture.

Moreover, most instances of offshoring under Trump have arguably amounted to extrajudicial deportations, the results of orders from Department of Homeland Security officials and not immigration judges. The Immigration and Nationality Act specifies that when immigrants are deported, they should be sent to their country of citizenship or former residence. Only if those options are “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible” can they be deported to a third country. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor laid out in her dissent in the June 23 Supreme Court case, the Trump administration's policy is to “ignore the clear statutory command that notice and a hearing must be provided.”



In the case of Abrego Garcia, the administration sent the Maryland resident to a Salvadoran prison despite the fact that a judge had issued a legal order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador. The administration admitted that Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake but then openly flouted a district court order, upheld by the Supreme Court, to facilitate his return to the United States. The government finally brought him back, in June, only to detain him on federal charges of human smuggling.

The Trump administration has not released complete lists of people it has sent to offshore detention. The White House's website features only partial lists of deported violent criminals, who represent a minuscule fraction of migrants in the United States. This is because, at its core, offshore processing and detention are attempts to hide people from public scrutiny, strip immigrants of their right to seek asylum, and normalize indefinite detention and even torture. They are forms of disappearance.

The point of these policies is not to deter migration or to save money: it is to put on a show of being tough on the border. The major question is whether national and international legal systems will consistently compel governments to follow their own domestic laws as well as international treaty obligations. Rich countries around the world are watching one another for policy models. If the Supreme Court's June 23 decision on deportations to South Sudan opens the floodgates from the United States, it will likely start a global race to the bottom.

The NATO summit held two weeks ago in The Hague delivered on the low expectations the allies had set for it. Amid fears that U.S. President Donald Trump would blow up a normal agenda, NATO leaders significantly pared back the program, taking hard discussions on issues such as support for Ukraine, NATO's relations with Russia, and Russian hybrid attacks in Europe off the table. But the summit did close with a historic agreement by most allies, Spain being a notable exception, to increase members' defense spending to five percent of GDP over the next ten years, with 3.5 percent earmarked for core military spending and 1.5 percent for hardening civilian infrastructure and overall resilience. The pledge to spend more on defense, in addition to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte's sycophantic praise of Trump at the summit, smoothed the way for Trump to stick largely to the summit's highly choreographed script, keeping the alliance's cohesion intact. Trump even appeared to leave The Hague with a newfound appreciation for NATO members, telling reporters: “These people really love their countries. It's not a rip-off, and we're here to help them.”

Any sense of relief among the allies, however, may be short-lived. The relatively positive headlines coming out of the summit obscure the storm brewing across the Atlantic. The Trump administration is undertaking a sweeping force posture review slated for release in late summer or early fall that could fundamentally reshape the U.S. military's global footprint. If that process results in a significant and swift reduction of U.S. forces in Europe, an outcome that administration officials have publicly suggested is possible, the alliance will become more vulnerable to further Russian aggression.

Europe is stepping up in a big way, and defense budgets are rising, but it will take time to ramp up production and deliver the capabilities that the United States currently provides on the continent. The United States may see fit to make some force adjustments in Europe that allow it to bolster its defense posture in Asia to counter rising threats from China. But Washington must carefully plan any such shift, leaving U.S. forces in place long enough that Europeans can work to fill the coming gaps and retain their credible deterrent against Russia. It is critical that any drawdown be closely coordinated with NATO military authorities and that allies agree in advance to cover lost capabilities. Otherwise, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be tempted to take advantage of a weakened alliance.

The political signals surrounding the U.S. Defense Department's force posture review have only increased European allies' fears that a rapid drawdown is coming. In a speech at his first NATO defense ministers meeting in February, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth underscored the Trump administration's view that Europe could no longer be a U.S. priority, saying that given the “strategic realities,” European NATO leaders “should take primary responsibility for defense of the continent.” Those comments contrasted sharply with the message Hegseth delivered in Singapore in May, when he underscored the U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific and called it the United States' “priority theater.” Media coverage of the Pentagon's 2025 Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance—issued this spring as a placeholder for the National Defense Strategy, which is expected to be released late this year—suggests that the department intends to fund a military buildup in the Indo-Pacific by diverting resources from other places, including Europe, and accepting greater risk in those areas. Even Matthew Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said in May that Washington was “not going to have any more patience” when it came to reducing the U.S. presence in Europe.

The Trump administration's attitude toward Russia is also feeding NATO allies' concerns about the U.S. commitment to Europe. Trump has been reluctant to define Russia as a threat, instead calling Putin a “good guy” and making clear his aim to normalize U.S. relations with Moscow. Senior U.S. officials have also downplayed Putin's risk to Europe. Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, who also oversees diplomacy with Moscow, said in an interview with the conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson in March that it was “preposterous” to think that Russia would “march across Europe”—a straw-man argument meant to suggest that European assessments of the Russian threat are overblown. NATO allies had planned to present a Russia strategy for approval at the June summit but suspended it in fear that they could not get Trump on board.

Even if Moscow does not march across Europe, Russia will pose a threat to NATO. The Russian military, although not without its flaws, is no longer the disorganized force it was just over three years ago, when it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since February 2022, Putin has transformed Russia's economy and military to support prolonged confrontation. Russian defense spending in 2025 amounts to 7.7 percent of GDP, a 12 percent increase from 2024. Moscow's defense industrial base is running at full capacity. As Rutte said at Chatham House in June, “The facts are clearly there that Russia is able, within five years, to mount a credible attack against NATO territory.” Multiple European intelligence agencies have arrived at similar conclusions. Washington can ill afford to rapidly reduce its presence in Europe just as Russia is gearing up for further aggression.

NATO has been overly dependent on the United States for its military capabilities since the alliance's founding, in 1949. After the Cold War, when most European militaries substantially cut their defense budgets, this dependence only deepened. The United States also lowered its defense expenditures and reduced its forces in Europe, from about 300,000 during the Cold War to about 100,000 troops today (including 20,000 additional forces Washington deployed in 2022 in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine). But despite this decrease in manpower, U.S. capabilities have remained key to NATO's posture, plans, command and control, and force models. Today, the U.S. Army supplements NATO forces along the alliance's frontier with Russia in the Baltics and Romania, and it maintains permanent bases in Germany and Poland. The U.S. military also stores equipment, its Army Prepositioned Stocks, in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland to outfit army reinforcements that arrive by air. The U.S. Navy has six Aegis-class destroyers deployed at a U.S. base in Rota, Spain, to support NATO's missile defense and take on other maritime tasks in European waters, such as maritime patrols in the Baltic Sea. The U.S. Air Force has combat and support squadrons stationed at allied bases across NATO territory, from the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to those in Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Azores.

Should U.S. military capabilities be removed from NATO defense plans, Europe would be unable to quickly fill the resulting gaps, creating vulnerabilities that Putin would be tempted to exploit. U.S. intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms, for example, are essential for NATO's awareness of Russian activity. Their withdrawal would leave the alliance especially vulnerable to Russian hybrid attacks, such as undersea cable sabotage, jamming, or cyberattacks. Fewer such resources would also limit early warnings about incoming attacks and hinder NATO's ability to select, prioritize, and engage Russian targets in the event of conflict. The personnel that process, analyze, and fuse this intelligence—many of them American—are too specialized to replace quickly and often in short supply.

Europe also remains highly reliant on U.S. air-to-air refueling tankers, heavy lift aircraft, and other such “strategic enablers” to move forces across the continent and supply it with battlefield intelligence. Despite European allies' progress on procuring the military equipment needed to meet their newly mandated responsibilities in NATO planning, they have made less headway in developing these particular capabilities at scale. NATO would therefore struggle to move troops and equipment quickly across Europe in a crisis, just as it did after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when some allies relied on the United States to transfer their troops to eastern Europe to reinforce the eastern flank. With a pared-down U.S. presence, critical shortfalls of air and missile defenses would also become even more acute, leaving allied forces and countries that are within striking distance of Russian missiles and drones particularly vulnerable.

Other essential capabilities—long-range precision missile systems such as HIMARS, stockpiles of precision-guided munitions, and advanced drones—could also be diminished by a premature U.S. withdrawal. One of NATO's key deterrents against Russia is its credible ability to target high-value assets within the country. Losing stocks of long-range missiles would significantly erode this deterrence and increase Europe's vulnerability in the event of a Russian attack. And these capability gaps do not exist in isolation. The United States provides European militaries with most of their sustainment units, including medical and logistics personnel and a large share of specialists in cyber, space, and electronic warfare. Even as European countries ramp up defense spending, the timelines for assuming the functions the United States fills today will stretch into the next decade.

The Kremlin would likely see a rapid U.S. drawdown in Europe as a golden opportunity. Moscow has long sought to undermine NATO, seeing its demise as a critical step toward reasserting Russia's position as a global power. Most immediately, the Kremlin would seize on any U.S. retreat to amplify Europeans' anxiety that Washington is abandoning them. With Europe feeling vulnerable, Moscow would ratchet up its coercive tactics to intimidate European publics and pressure their governments to be more accommodating to Moscow.

As Russia perceived gaps in NATO's conventional forces, Moscow would probably become more willing to take risks to advance its aims. Putin would assume that with a smaller U.S. presence in Europe, the West would be forced to favor de-escalation, creating an environment the Kremlin would view as exceptionally permissive and paving the way for increasingly brazen acts. Moreover, Russia has long viewed Europeans as supplicants of Washington, unable to function effectively without U.S. direction. If the United States goes forward with a rapid reduction in forces, Moscow might judge that European unity would collapse, fueling Putin's propensity to overestimate Russia's ability to achieve its goals.



Most immediately, Putin would look to further scale up gray-zone activities in Europe, such as cable cutting and other forms of sabotage. With fewer U.S. intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets in place, such acts would be harder for European countries to detect or attribute, allowing Moscow to operate with greater impunity. Beyond hybrid attacks, Russia could be tempted to take limited military action. Because a reduction in U.S. assets in Europe would lead to slower NATO response times, Putin might have greater confidence that Moscow could successfully seize territory, for example in a Baltic state or in Svalbard, a strategic Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic, and then use coercion and nuclear threats to compel NATO to accept the result. With air and missile defense in short supply and long-range missiles withdrawn, NATO could find it challenging to mount an immediate and coordinated defense—undermining NATO's credibility and dramatically altering the European security order.

Russia is not going away, and Europe's buildup will take time. If the United States does plan to reduce its troop deployment in Europe, simply notifying the alliance that such a change is underway will be woefully insufficient to ensure NATO's continued ability to protect its members. To avoid a dramatic blow to the alliance's defenses, allies must procure today what they will need to quickly fill the gaps tomorrow. NATO military authorities must be given time to review and update their battle plans, and individual countries with the means to do so must commit to replicating specific capabilities that that will be lost as the United States pivots.

Pulling back as Russia is ramping up its military capacity and before Europe is ready to defend itself would embolden the Kremlin and raise the risk of another war—this time on Trump's watch. The best way to prevent a future war in Europe is to make sure Moscow never dares to start one. And that will require Washington and its European partners to design a careful and coordinated handoff. The United States must tell its partners exactly where any new gaps will be—long before they appear.

Cuts further the push to slash federal government through early retirement, buyouts and deferred resignations

The Trump administration is reportedly planning to cut at least 2,145 high-ranking Nasa employees with specialized skills or management responsibilities.

According to documents obtained by Politico, most employees leaving are in senior-level government ranks, depriving the agency of decades of experience as part of a push to slash the size of the federal government through early retirement, buyouts and deferred resignations.

The documents indicate that 1,818 of the staff currently serve in core mission areas, such as science or human space flight, while the others work in mission support roles including information technology, or IT.

Asked about the proposed cuts, agency spokesperson Bethany Stevens told Reuters: “NASA remains committed to our mission as we work within a more prioritized budget.”

Since Trump returned to office in January, planning in the US space industry and among Nasa's workforce of 18,000 people has been thrown into chaos by the layoffs and proposed budget cuts for fiscal year 2026 that would cancel dozens of science programs.

Last week, seven former heads of Nasa's Science Mission Directorate signed a joint letter to Congress condemning the White House's proposed 47% cuts to Nasa science activities in its 2026 budget proposal. In the letter, the former officials urged the House appropriations committee “to preserve US leadership in space exploration and reject the unprecedented cuts to space science concocted by the White House's Budget Director, Russ Vought”.

“The economics of these proposed cuts ignore a fundamental truth: investments in NASA science have been and are a powerful driver of the U.S. economy and technological leadership,” the letter read. “In our former roles leading NASA's space science enterprise, we consistently saw skilled teams innovate in the face of seemingly impossible goals, including landing a car-sized rover on Mars with pinpoint precision, build a massive telescope that can unfold in the vacuum of space to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, design and operate a spacecraft hardy enough to survive temperatures of many thousands of degrees at the Sun, inspiring young and old alike worldwide by the stunning images from the Hubble Space Telescope, and pioneering the use of small satellites for science.”

They also warned that the cuts threatened to cede US leadership to China: “Global space competition extends far past Moon and Mars exploration. The Chinese space science program is aggressive, ambitious, and well-funded. It is proposing missions to return samples from Mars, explore Neptune, monitor climate change for the benefit of the Chinese industry and population, and peer into the universe – all activities that the FY 2026 NASA budget proposal indicates the US will abandon.”

Nasa also remains without a confirmed administrator, since the Trump administration abruptly withdrew its nominee, the billionaire private astronaut Jared Isaacman, in an apparent act of retaliation against Elon Musk, who had proposed his nomination.

In a social media post attacking Musk on Sunday, Trump wrote that he thought it would have been thought “inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life”.

Thirty-one construction workers inside a huge industrial tunnel in Los Angeles made it to safety after a portion of it collapsed Wednesday evening, an outcome officials called a blessing after they initially feared much worse.

A portion of a huge industrial tunnel under construction in Los Angeles collapsed Wednesday and up to 15 workers may have been trapped, the Los Angeles Fire Department said.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — All 31 construction workers who were far inside a huge industrial tunnel being dug under Los Angeles made it to safety after a partial collapse, an outcome officials called a blessing after they initially feared much worse.

The workers were 400 feet (121 meters) underground and as much as 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) inside from the only entrance when the cave-in Wednesday evening threatened to trap them on the far side of the tunnel's boring machine, said Michael Chee, spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts.

Fire Department Chief Ronnie Villanueva said the workers had to make it through the most treacherous part themselves, climbing over more than 12 feet (3.6 meters) of loose dirt and debris to reach the boring machine before rescuers could drive them to the opening of the nearly $700 million project, which is designed to carry treated wastewater to the Pacific Ocean.

Aerial footage showed a crane hoisting workers out of the tunnel in a yellow cage. None had major injuries, authorities said.

AP correspondent Donna Warder reports on the successful rescue of 31 construction workers in a partially collapsed tunnel in Los Angeles.

The accident happened as workers were operating the boring machine, said Robert Ferrante, chief engineer and general manager for the sanitation districts. “A section that they have already built had squeezing ground and had a collapse, a partial collapse,” he told reporters.

Arally Orozco said she was at church when her phone started buzzing with calls and her son texted her the news of the tunnel where her three brothers worked.




“It was sad and scary,” she said in Spanish. “We feared the worst.”

After an hour, she managed to get through to one brother who told her they had to squeeze through a tight space to get out.

“My brother was crying,” she said. “He told me he thought he was going to die underground.”

The collapse in the tunnel, which is 18 feet (5.5 meters) wide and will be 7 miles (11.3 kilometers) long, happened under the Wilmington neighborhood, a heavily industrial area filled with oil refineries just north of the Port of Los Angeles. 

Working so near the shoreline and at such a depth means crews could have been contending with very wet conditions that add challenges during design and digging, said Maria Mohammed, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Southern California. 

“You would design not just for the pressure from the soil and the weight of the soil, you have to design for the pressure from the water,” said Mohammed, whose group is not involved in the Wilmington project.

The cause is under investigation, Chee said. Work will not resume until they can figure out what happened and determine that it's safe to proceed, authorities said.

Mohammed said that investigation could take months, if not longer. It will take some time just to make the tunnel safe for investigators to enter. Once inside, they'll try to determine where the collapse originated, she said. 

“It all comes down to, what's the first element that broke?” Mohammed said Thursday. “Usually a collapse is a propagating thing. One thing fails and it takes other things with it. So you would try to figure out, of the broken elements, which one broke first.”

City Councilmember Tim McOsker praised the workers for keeping cool heads.

“This is a highly technical, difficult project. And they knew exactly what to do. They knew how to secure themselves,” he said. “Thank goodness for the good people that were down in the tunnel.”

Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference that she met with some of the workers. 

“I know when we raced down here I was so concerned that we were going to find tragedy. Instead, what we found was victory,” Bass said. “All of the men that were in that tunnel, rescued, up, safe.”

Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on Kilmar Abrego Garcia's trial on 'Special Report.'

GREENBELT, MD. – A federal judge will hear from a top Homeland Security official Thursday as she weighs next steps in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant erroneously deported from the U.S. and now central to a legal fight over Trump's presidential powers.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration on Monday to produce a government witness "with personal knowledge" about the administration's plans for Abrego Garcia, who she said will be expected to testify, under oath, about the "who, what, where, and when" involving the government's plans to deport him again to either El Salvador or a third country pending release from federal custody.

Justice Department officials notified Judge Xinis hours before the hearing that they plan to call as a witness Thomas Giles, the assistant director for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations office in Los Angeles, California.

Trump administration officials are expected to address on Thursday, "among other topics, the asserted lawful bases for detention, the nature and timing of any notice to be provided to Abrego Garcia, the location of any proposed custody or transfer, and the procedural steps Defendants intend to pursue," Xinis said in her order. 

FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP BAN FOR ALL INFANTS, TESTING LOWER COURT POWERS

The request came after Justice Department officials conceded at a hearing earlier this week that Abrego Garcia could be removed from the U.S. as soon as July 16 — nine days from today, when a federal judge in Tennessee will consider whether he should be freed and transferred to DHS custody.

Abrego Garcia, currently held by U.S. Marshals in Tennessee, was returned from El Salvador in June — three months after his deportation and weeks after the Supreme Court backed Xinis's order to facilitate his return.

Upon arrival, Abrego was immediately slapped with federal charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. Justice Department officials acknowledged in court this week that they plan to immediately take him into ICE custody as early as this month and deport him to a third country — regardless of the status of his criminal case.

Xinis, who is handling his civil case, grilled Trump administration lawyers for details Monday as to when they opened a federal investigation into Abrego Garcia in the U.S. Middle District of Tennessee — and how the timing of the investigation and federal indictment squared with the government's testimony in her own court.

She took umbrage at the dueling timelines of the criminal investigation, noting that, by the government's own admission, it began investigating Abrego Garcia in the Middle District in Tennessee on April 28, 2025 — the same time officials were telling the court that the administration was powerless to order a foreign government to return Abrego Garcia, in compliance with the court order.

"Now I have real concerns — as if I haven't for the last three months," Xinis noted in response.

Justice Department lawyers also told Xinis that they do not plan to keep him in the U.S. until his trial is over.

"No," Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn answered simply.

"There's no intention to just put him in limbo in ICE custody while we wait for the criminal case to unfold," Guynn told Xinis. "He will be removed, as would any other illegal alien in that process."

"Given the series of unlawful actions" here, I feel like it's well within my authority to order this hearing — perhaps more than one — to hear testimony from at least one witness with firsthand knowledge, who can answer these questions about the immediate next steps" from the government pending Abrego Garca's release from custody, Xinis said.

The Justice Department charged seven Chinese nationals this week for allegedly operating a multi-million dollar marijuana trafficking ring.

Authorities in Massachusetts arrested six of the defendants on Tuesday morning, but one remains at large. The DOJ says the migrants were smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border to work in marijuana grow houses and had their passports withheld "until they repaid their smuggling debts."

"This case pulls back the curtain on a sprawling criminal enterprise that exploited our immigration system and our communities for personal gain," said U.S. Attorney Leah Foley. 

"These defendants allegedly turned quiet homes across the Northeast into hubs for a criminal enterprise – building a multi-million-dollar black-market operation off the backs of an illegal workforce and using our neighborhoods as cover. That ends today," she added.

Authorities say the marijuana ring began operations around January 2020, focusing mostly on Massachusetts and Maine. Prosecutors claim the grow house operators maintained contact with each other through a list of marijuana cultivators and distributors from or with ties to China in the region called the "East Coast Contact List."

Constitutional Accountability Center President Elizabeth Wydra and constitutional attorney Mark Smith weigh in on how the Supreme Court limiting nationwide injunctions on federal judges will impact the birthright citizenship ruling.

A federal judge in New Hampshire blocked President Donald Trump's executive order banning birthright citizenship and granted nationwide class certification status to all infants impacted by the order on Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Joseph LaPlante said that he will issue a written ruling by the end of the day further explaining his decision. The injunction also narrows down the scope of the class to infants, removing parents from the case. 

In his order, LaPlante ruled that deprivation of citizenship, as held by the 14th Amendment, and changes in longstanding policy would create "irreparable harm."

Still, it is almost sure to be quickly appealed by the Trump administration. It comes after the Supreme Court reviewed the case earlier this year, and ruled 6-3 in late June that plaintiffs seeking nationwide relief must file their cases as a class action lawsuit — narrowing the instances in which lower district courts can issue so-called universal injunctions.

That high court ruling narrowly focused on the authority of lower courts, and justices did not wade into the legality of Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship, which served as the legal pretext for the case.

Still, Justice Department officials told a federal judge last week they plan to begin enforcing Trump's birthright citizenship order as early as July 27, in recognition of a 30-day stay included in the Supreme Court's ruling, showing they plan to act quickly. 

Trump's order, signed on the first day of his second White House term, directs all U.S. government agencies to refuse to issue citizenship documents to children born to illegal immigrants, or who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen of lawful permanent resident.

The order, signed by Trump on his first day in office, was immediately challenged in January by more than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups, which argued the effort to end birthright citizenship was both unconstitutional and "unprecedented," and threatened more than 100 years of legal precedent. 

It was almost immediately blocked by lower courts, before eventually making its way to the Supreme Court for review in May.

The high court's decision also touched off a flurry of new lawsuits from the ACLU and other immigration advocacy groups, who re-filed class action lawsuits in federal courts in Maryland and in New Hampshire, where LaPlante reviewed the request Thursday.

Lawyers for the Trump administration stressed last week that the Supreme Court's ruling did not preclude it from taking other actions before that date, and told U.S. it plans to "immediately" begin developing and issuing public guidance on the order.

Advocates have warned possible fallout from the order could prove "catastrophic."

            Websites for Harvard College centers serving minority and LGBTQ students and women vanished Wednesday, The Harvard Crimson reported, marking the continued unraveling of diversity initiatives at the nation's most prestigious university as it faces fresh pressure from the Trump administration.
    


            Websites for the Harvard College Women's Center, the Office for BGLTQ Student Life and the Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations now redirect to a page for an Office of Culture and Community, the student newspaper reported.
    


            That office – which promotes “(e)xposure to and learning from different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences,” its site states – was announced internally just Wednesday as a replacement for the soon-to-close diversity office for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which encompasses Harvard College, the undergraduate school and university's PhD programs.
    


            The White House welcomed the development, viewing it as a goodwill gesture one official described Thursday as “good news.”
    


            Also Wednesday, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services notified the New England Commission of Higher Education that Harvard is “in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws and therefore may fail to meet the standards for accreditation set by the Commission,” according to a joint statement.
    


            That statement followed a June 30 finding by the Trump administration's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism that Harvard was in “violent violation” of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in programs or activities receiving federal funding.
    


            The new Office of Culture and Community is part of an effort to “break down silos, ensuring all members of our community are connected, supported, and empowered,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Hopi Hoekstra told colleagues Wednesday in a memo to which a university spokesperson directed CNN for information about the disappearance of the Harvard College website.
    


            As for its accreditation, Harvard “continues to comply with the New England Commission of Higher Education's Standards for Accreditation, maintaining its accreditation uninterrupted since its initial review in 1929,” the spokesperson said Thursday in a statement.
    


            “Antisemitism is a serious problem and no matter the context, it is unacceptable,” the statement said, adding the university “has made significant strides to combat bigotry, hate and bias.”
    


            The moves Wednesday come amid a monthslong fight between Harvard and the Trump administration, which has sought to coerce the school to make changes that adhere to its more conservative ideology and less than a month ago suggested a deal was in sight. Other US universities have faced similar pressure from the White House and met at least some of its demands.
    


            At Harvard, the White House since April has frozen billions of federal dollars and threatened to yank more if Harvard does not comply, accusing the university in part of failing to adequately combat antisemitism and curb diversity practices – designed to advance racial, gender, class and other representation in public spaces – it decries as “illegal and immoral discrimination.”
    


Attacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months. A timeline of the dispute



            Harvard in April announced it would rename its central diversity office from the Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging to the Office of Community and Campus Life.
    


            It also has acknowledged antisemitism is an issue, and two school task forces in late April released a pair of internal reports – one on its handling of antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias, and the other of anti-Muslim, anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian bias.
    


            Its antisemitism task force, among other proposed changes, recommended updating the admissions process to focus on the need to work alongside people of differing viewpoints and be prepared to accept disagreements. Harvard should also “become a hub for antisemitism research” and dedicate a faculty member to its study, the task force said.
    


            “We remain committed to ensuring members of our Jewish and Israeli community are embraced, respected, and can thrive at Harvard,” its spokesperson added Thursday.
    


            Meantime, Harvard continues to battle the Trump administration in federal court on two fronts: In one, it seeks to claw back the frozen federal funds, with a hearing set for July 21; in the other, a judge has indefinitely blocked the White House's effort to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students, who make up about a quarter of its enrollment.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins discusses how the Trump administration is addressing the Chinese land grab in the United States on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

FOX NEWS FIRST: Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is reigniting a congressional push to ban the Chinese Communist Party from buying up farmland and residential land in the U.S. on Thursday.

Hawley is introducing the Protecting Our Farms and Homes from China Act, which bans Chinese corporations and individuals associated with the Chinese Communist Party from making such purchases. President Donald Trump's administration has sounded the alarm about Chinese ownership of U.S. land in recent days, particularly around American military bases.

"China's ownership of U.S. farmland poses a direct threat to American interests," Hawley told Fox News Digital in a statement. "We should never let our nation's greatest adversary have access to our vital resources, including our housing supply. That's why I'm introducing legislation to protect American assets from the CCP once and for all."

While the bill would impose a flat ban on relevant purchases of farmland, the ban on residential purchases would only apply for two years, leaving an option for the president to re-up the prohibition every two years beyond that.

TEXAS THE LATEST STATE WITH A LAW BANNING FOREIGN ADVERSARIES FROM BUYING REAL ESTATE

Sen. Josh Hawley is pushing to ban Chinese corporations and individuals associated with the CCP from owning U.S. land. 

The legislation also requires Chinese corporations and CCP-affiliated individuals who own affected land to divest that ownership within one year. It also establishes penalties for failing to comply with the law, ranging from fines to outright forfeiture.

Hawley's move comes in tandem with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announcing its National Farm Security Action Plan earlier this week.

The plan is specifically meant to address threats from foreign governments, like China, and how those threats impact American farmers. The plan laid out executive reforms and called for Congress to pursue legislation like Hawley's.

"The farm's produce is not just a commodity, it is a way of life that underpins America itself. And that's exactly why it is under threat from criminals, from political adversaries, and from hostile regimes that understand our way of life as a profound and existential threat to themselves," USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said at a press event in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.

"For them, agricultural lands and our farms, because they are a previous inheritance, are weapons to be turned against us," she continued. "We see it again and again, from Chinese communist acquisition of American farmland to criminal exploits of our system of agriculture, to the theft of operational information required to work the land and beyond. All of this takes what is profoundly good and turns it toward evil purposes."

Numerous states have laws on the books restricting land purchases by those with ties to China and other foreign adversaries. Nevertheless, in 2021, over 383,000 acres had ties to China. While the number has dipped in recent years, it remains a significant issue, according to Agriculture Dive.

            The remains of a famous sycamore tree, which stood on Britain's Roman-built Hadrian's Wall in northern England for more than 200 years, has found a new home nearly two years after it was illegally felled.
    


            The removal of the tree from its spot known as “Sycamore Gap,” a pronounced dip in Hadrian's Wall, in September 2023 sparked global outrage. Sycamore Gap was considered one of the most photographed trees in England and was made famous to millions when it appeared in Kevin Costner's 1991 blockbuster film “Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.”
    


            In May, two men were found guilty of criminal damage for felling the landmark tree.
    


            Now, a section of it will be put on permanent display at The Sill: National Landscape Discovery Centre, about two miles (three kilometers) from where it once stood.
    


            The UK's National Trust gave the largest remaining piece of the salvaged trunk to the Northumberland National Park, where the tree was located.
    


            “In the days and months after the tree was felled, The Sill became a place of celebration and memory. Visitors left post-it notes, letters, drawings and messages expressing grief, love, and hope,” the park said in a press release Thursday.
    


            A public consultation was held in the aftermath of the felling on the future of the tree trunk. “The resulting exhibit honours the tree's natural form while inviting people to engage with it in a deeply personal way,” The Sill said in a press release Thursday.
    


            A spokesperson for the park told CNN on Thursday that the tree piece, which will be on public display from Friday, “can be touched and is huggable.”
    


            The trunk is positioned upright, as it once was, and is surrounded by tree oak benches and streams of wood bent to form a canopy in the shape of a huge leaf – recreating the shelter the tree once offered for people to sit and reflect.
    


            Some tributes from the local community have been carved into the wood.
    


            “The original tree may be gone in the form we knew it, but its legacy remains, and what has come since has been endlessly positive, affirming our belief that people nature and place cannot be separated and are interdependent,” said Tony Gates, chief executive of Northumberland National Park Authority, in the release.
    


            “This commission has been the biggest honour of my career,” said Charlie Whinney, the artist behind the new exhibition, in the release.
    


            “I really hope what we've done in some small way allows the people of Northumberland and those who held this tree close to their hearts to process the loss they still feel from that day in September 2023, when the tree was illegally cut down,” he added.
    


            “The work looks forward with hope, the tree is regrowing, and Sycamore Gap will always be a magical place to visit,” Whinney continued.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins discusses how the Trump administration is addressing the Chinese land grab in the United States on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

This week, U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced a nationwide ban on farmland sales to Chinese nationals and other foreign adversaries. At the same joint press conference, Defense Sec. Hegseth added that the Department of Defense would also work specifically to restrict the sale of other properties near American military bases.

As a former Army intelligence captain, this week's announcement doesn't just bring welcome news—it delivers a sigh of relief. After four years of weakness under the Biden administration, we finally have a commander-in-chief who isn't afraid to confront the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) dangerous moves on American soil.

In recent years, Chinese nationals expanded their ownership of U.S. land to 265,000 acres. Even worse, Chinese entities have strategically purchased properties near 19 key military installations, including Fort Bragg and Fort Hood. They've also bought control of key industries vital to our food supply lines. In fact, China now controls the import of 70% of crop protection products that our farmers rely on to grow their crops. You don't need to be an intelligence expert to see the inherent national security vulnerability that arises if we surrender key American industries to Chinese-backed companies.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES DECISIVELY TO BLOCK CHINA FROM ‘WEAPONIZING' AMERICAN FARMLAND

Fortunately, several states like Georgia, Florida, and Texas have already stepped up to ban foreign land purchases, especially near military bases within their states. Now, the Trump administration is taking the fight nationally. Officials are cracking down on acquisitions across the country and taking the decisive steps needed to protect both our military infrastructure and American food security.

These concerns aren't just hypothetical—they're playing out in alarming ways.

Take, for example, the CEO of TP-Link, a Chinese state-sponsored networking company currently under intense federal scrutiny. Jianjun Zhao, a Chinese national, acquired at least two significant agricultural land parcels in California's Silicon Valley and neighboring Monterey County. This is the same company whose Wi-Fi routers were the subject of a congressional hearing earlier this year, during which a member of Congress warned America not to use their routers and exposed how Chinese state-backed hackers use devices like TP-Link's to pre‑position for potential cyberattacks on America's critical infrastructure—our power grids, water systems, telecommunications networks, and more.

Today, TP-Link controls a staggering 65% of the U.S. home and small-business router market, allegedly achieved through predatory pricing. Now, with Zhao's land purchases, we may be witnessing a troubling pattern: strategic acquisitions by Chinese nationals tied to entities under intense national security scrutiny, in regions of high infrastructure and economic sensitivity. This is exactly the type of threat the Trump administration's new policies are designed to address—before it's too late.

Make no mistake. President Trump isn't just taking action against foreign ownership in the agriculture industry. He's also addressing threats posed by TP-Link head on. Not only has the Trump administration launched a criminal antitrust investigation against TP-Link for alleged predatory pricing enabling it to dominate the US Wi-Fi market, but the administration is also considering banning TP-Link sales in the United States altogether as early as this calendar year as reported by The Wall Street Journal — a critically important step toward improving our national security posture.

Thankfully, Trump saw threats like this coming and made sure America was ready. During his first term, he had the foresight to establish the Information and Communications Technology and Services (ICTS) Authorities—a powerful mechanism designed to swiftly root out national security threats – such as those allegedly posed by TP-Link—from America's internet and communications networks. Today, that bold move is paying dividends.

Of course, there will be many who still do not see the importance of taking action against Chinese threats. Others have recently adopted the bizarre claim that banning foreign ownership of key industries somehow "weaponizes racism." But no enemy of the United States—whether China or otherwise—has the right to own vast parcels of real estate or control key industries that threaten the security of the United States. Yesterday's press conference sent the message loud and clear to our enemies abroad that the days of American complacency are over. 

Make no mistake, the CCP threat remains high. Their spies are persistent, their hackers sophisticated, and their land purchases calculated. That's why we must continue investing in counterintelligence, bolstering our cybersecurity, and blocking foreign ownership of strategic assets. President Trump's leadership and decisiveness is breathing new life into a long-running push by the national security community to counter this threat from the CCP. We must demand vigilance, support policies that prioritize our security, and reject the complacency of the past. The Chinese threat is real and with new leadership in the White House, we're finally fighting back.

Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova is departing Washington, D.C., according to Ukraine's foreign ministry.

The move comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy looks to inject new blood into U.S.-Ukraine relations. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha announced the change on Wednesday in a broadcast on Ukrainian radio.

"She is extremely effective and charismatic, but every diplomat has a rotation cycle," Sybiha said.

Markarova made headlines for her reaction to President Donald Trump's disastrous meeting with Zelenskyy inside the Oval Office in late February. Markarova could be seen holding her head in despair as Trump and Vice President JD Vance needled Zelenskyy.

Markarova has also faced criticism from Republicans for being overly partisan in her dealings with Washington. House Speaker Mike Johnson called her out in September 2024 for hosting what he described as a campaign event for Democrats just weeks before the general elections.

The event saw Zelenskyy visit a munitions factory in Pennsylvania alongside Democratic politicians and officials. Johnson noted that no Republicans were invited to the event and demanded Zelenskyy fire Markarova.

Johnson said the tour "purposely excluded" Republicans, calling it "election interference." 

"The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited," Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy, noting the attendance of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.

He said the "shortsighted and intentionally political move" prompted Republicans to "lose trust" in Markarova's ability to fairly and effectively serve as a diplomat.

"She should be removed from her post immediately," Johnson wrote.

Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.



            Ruby Williams' birthday was not your average 18th. She celebrated it on the Klamath River, with a group of young people making a historic journey paddling from the river's headwaters in southern Oregon to its mouth in the Pacific Ocean, just south of Crescent City, California. It marked the first time in a century that the descent has been possible, after the recent removal of four dams allowed the river to flow freely.
    


            Williams, together with fellow paddler Keeya Wiki, 17, spoke to CNN on day 15 of their month-long journey, which they are due to complete on Friday. At this point, they had just 141 miles (227 kilometers) of the 310-mile (499 kilometer) journey left to go and had already passed through some of the most challenging rapids, such as those at the “Big Bend” and “Hell's Corner” sections of the river.
    


            Both were exhausted and hadn't showered in days — although they promised they “aren't completely feral.” However, despite tired minds, they were steadfast in their commitment.
    


            “We are reclaiming our river, reclaiming our sport,” said Williams.
    


            “We are getting justice,” Wiki, who is from the Yurok Tribe, added. “And making sure that my people and all the people on the Klamath River can live how we're supposed to.”
    


            The Klamath River runs deep in the cultures of the native peoples living in its basin, who historically used dugout canoes to travel along it. They view it as a living person, a relative, who they can depend on — and in turn protect.
    


            “It's our greatest teacher, our family member,” said Williams, who is from the Karuk Tribe, which occupies lands along the middle course of the Klamath. “We revolve ceremonies around it, like when the salmon start running (the annual migration from the sea back to freshwater rivers to spawn), we know it's time to start a family.”
    


            Historically, it was also a lifeline, providing them with an abundance of fish. The Klamath was once the third-largest salmon-producing river on the West Coast of the US. But between 1918 and 1966, electric utility company California Oregon Power Company (which later became PacifiCorp), built a series of hydroelectric dams along the river's course, which cut off the upstream pathway for migrating salmon, and the tribes lost this cultural and commercial resource.
    


            For decades, native people — such as the Karuk and Yurok tribes — demanded the removal of the dams and restoration of the river. But it was only in 2002, after low water levels caused a disease outbreak that killed more than 30,000 fish, that momentum really started to build for their cause.
    


            Twenty years later, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission finally approved a plan to remove four dams on the lower Klamath River. This was when Paddle Tribal Waters was set up by the global organization Ríos to Rivers to reconnect native children to the ancient river. Believing that native peoples ought to be the first to descend the newly restored river, the program started by teaching local kids from the basin how to paddle in whitewater. Wiki and Williams were among them — neither had kayaked before then.

            In the fall of 2024, the last of the four dams was removed – completing what has been called “the world's largest dam removal effort” by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Upriver (beyond where the Klamath River technically begins), two smaller non-hydroelectric dams remain, where the paddlers had to disembark and carry the kayaks overland; there are currently no plans to remove them despite an ongoing campaign.
    


            Wiki recalled feeling giddy when she heard that the last dam had fallen. “So many of our elders and our aunties and uncles… fought so hard to get these dams down,” she said. “It was a really long, hard fight, and a lot of people thought — even my grandma thought — they would never see the dams come down in their lifetime.
    


            “So, for us to paddle down the river… it's very surreal. I think we're all just so grateful, knowing that the salmon can finally go from the mouth to the headwaters, and that we can go from the headwaters to the mouth too.”
    


            Weston Boyles, founder and director of Ríos to Rivers, who is also on the journey, said that it was critical that native people lead the first descent.
    


            “Historically, ‘first descents' have been a colonial idea: outsiders staking claims on waterways that indigenous communities have navigated for millennia,” he said. “We're reclaiming a stolen narrative. It matters because those waters flow through ancestral homelands, and these young paddlers are reasserting sovereignty, healing cultural trauma, and honoring their tribes' deep connections to the river.”
    


            The ecological impact is also something to celebrate. Within a few days of the final dam being removed, chinook salmon (the largest of the Pacific salmon species) were seen swimming past the former location of Iron Gate Dam in northern California — a spot where no fish had passed in 60 years, said Dave Coffman, director of northern California and southern Oregon for Resource Environmental Solutions (RES), the company working on the Klamath's restoration.
    


            “We were hopeful that within a couple of years we would see salmon return to Southern Oregon. It took the salmon two weeks,” he told CNN. “No one saw that coming — the response has exceeded our wildest hopes. It demonstrates the remarkable resilience of these fish: if we give them a chance, they will make their way back home.”
    


            But there is no denying the landscape has changed dramatically since before the dams and it will take years to recover, according to Coffman. RES is working to accelerate the natural process by reshaping channels, excavating sediment, planting billions of native seeds along the riverbanks, and even using helicopters to place downed trees in tributaries to provide crucial cover for fish and wildlife.
    


            “Sometimes we give nature a gentle nudge, but sometimes we give it a great big shove in the right direction,” says Coffman.
    


            Wiki and Williams have already witnessed the results. “It's been so cool to paddle through where the old reservoirs were and see all the new growth,” said Williams. “I got to see it earlier this year and it was kind of looking sad, and then I paddled through a couple days ago and it looks like a completely different river.”

            After completing the epic journey, the girls will go their separate ways. Williams will head off to college in fall and Wiki is starting her final year of high school. But despite living on different sections of the river and being from different tribes, they are confident their paths will cross again. Both strongly believe their futures are grounded in the Klamath.
    


            Williams dreams of coming back in her college breaks and becoming a paddle instructor, while Wiki sees herself doing advocacy work for her community.
    


            “We are celebrating (now), but there's still so much work to be done in the United States and also globally around dams and dam removal,” said Wiki. “(I want to) create a larger global community.”

A truly scary new revelation about Trump's effort to circumvent the TikTok ban.

Just before the July Fourth holiday, we learned that President Donald Trump secretly claimed a power so dangerous that even King George was prohibited from using it. 

The claim came in a series of identical letters that Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to 10 leading tech companies on April 5 — each instructing the company to ignore Congress's law effectively banning TikTok in the United States. The letters, released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, consist mostly of weakly argued claims about why companies do not have to stop hosting TikTok on their platforms (as the legislation explicitly requires).

But when put together, those claims amount to a frighteningly raw assertion of power: that the president can exempt specific companies from complying with legislation if he believes it interferes with his control over foreign policy.

This is called the “dispensing power.” It was an old prerogative of English kings, one in which they could simply assert that the law doesn't apply to their friends (a power not limited to foreign affairs). Dispensations were basically proactive pardons, telling someone they can feel free to ignore specific laws and never suffer any consequences.

The dispensation power was so sweeping, and so anti-democratic, that it was abolished by name in the 1689 English Bill of Rights. In 1838, the US Supreme Court ruled that the president does not have dispensing power — a ruling that modern legal scholars across the political spectrum treat as obviously correct.

Bondi's letters seem to directly contradict this basic principle of constitutional law.

“The effect [of the letter] is to declare an almost unbridled dispensation power when it comes to foreign relations,” says Alan Rozenshtein, a law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who has been closely following the TikTok case.

The Bondi letters have gotten virtually no attention outside of dedicated legal blogs and podcasts. And yet the implications of Trump claiming a dispensing power — the ability to issue licenses for lawlessness — are stunning. 

The Bondi letters are very short — about six paragraphs. They do not directly assert a dispensing power, but instead confusingly mash together multiple different legal claims without spelling out how they fit together into a coherent argument. During our conversation, Rozenshtein asked to be described as “spittle-flecked with rage” at the letters' technical legal incompetence.

Inasmuch as there is a cogent argument, it appears to be something like this: The president has unilateral power under Article II of the Constitution, which defines the powers of the executive branch, to determine whether legislation would (in Bondi's words) “interfere with the execution of the President's constitutional duties to take care of the national security and foreign affairs of the United States.” 

If Trump determines that legislation might “interfere” with his conduct of foreign affairs, Bondi suggests, he can bindingly promise individual corporations or people that the administration will not take any legal action against them for violating its provisions. 

On its surface, this argument seems like a mashup of two relatively normal presidential prerogatives: the ability to assert that a statute contradicts presidential power and the ability to use discretion in enforcing it. But if you look more deeply, it looks less like those normal claims and a lot more like dispensation.

The Supreme Court has indeed held that legislation can unconstitutionally interfere with Article II powers, the most notable recent case (2014's Zivotofsky v. Kerry) overturning a law requiring that US passports list “Israel” as the birthplace for US citizens born in Jerusalem.

However, this doesn't mean that all legislative constraints on the president's foreign policy powers are unconstitutional — far from it. And there is no credible case that the TikTok ban contravenes Article II. In fact, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the TikTok ban's constitutionality in January.

Presidents are also widely understood to have discretion in how they enforce the law. There is far more lawbreaking than there are Justice Department attorneys to prosecute offenses; given scarce resources, presidents and attorneys general have to make choices about which crimes to prioritize.

This discretion can give rise to tricky gray area cases. Barack Obama, for example, ordered the Justice Department to stop immigration enforcement actions against undocumented migrants brought to the US as children. There is a robust debate over whether this is a legitimate use of discretion, as the Obama administration argued, or an abuse designed to usurp Congress's lawmaking power.

But the TikTok case, legal experts say, is very different. There's no issue of enforcement or limited resources; before Trump issued his exemptions, Apple and Google had already removed TikTok from their US app stores. So this isn't a decision of non-enforcement, in the sense of redirecting law enforcement resources. 

Rather, it was giving big tech platforms a blank check to ignore a law they had previously complied with — which is, essentially, an assertion that the president has a version of the dispensing power that English kings lost centuries ago.

To understand how scary these letters are, it's worth considering an analogy: the pardon power.

The pardon power is eminently, and famously, abusable. Because the president can forgive any federal crime (at least theoretically), he can dangle pardons in front of anyone he wants to break the law — promising them that he'll make sure they get away with it.

But the pardon power only covers criminal offenses, not violation of the civil code. Jack Goldsmith, a leading expert on presidential power at Harvard Law School, reads Bondi's letters as claiming the power to proactively forgive civil violations. This would, in effect, allow the president to authorize whole new categories of illegal conduct, provided he can find a sufficient foreign policy-related excuse.

At the moment, it does not appear that this sweeping reasoning is being employed for anything other than giving companies cover to violate the TikTok ban. But as Goldsmith notes, executive power assertions typically function like one-way ratchets: Once used successfully, presidents turn to them again in the future. 

“There is an immense danger in Bondi's assertion of a dispensing power here—that it might set a precedent for assertions of the same authority in future cases in which the dispensations are far less popular and far more corrupting,” writes Steve Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University and author of a newsletter on the Supreme Court.

I have to admit, at this point, that I'd mostly been tuning out the debate over the lawfulness of the TikTok ban. It struck me as yet another in a long string of technical arguments over presidential non-enforcement, one that applied to law that it seems many in Congress regret ever passing. 

But after reading Bondi's letters, and studying their legal implications, I've started to see this as fundamentally different. This case isn't about TikTok, not really; it's about Trump being able to make an obviously unconstitutional power grab in secret and get away with it — as he very well may, as Rozenshtein believes the letters' claims will be hard to challenge in court due to standing issues.

It's a situation that looks especially dangerous in light of his broader agenda.

“Trump, unlike [previous] presidents, has clearly expressed, in word and deed, his disregard of any limits on his powers to do pretty much anything he wants to do,” writes David Post, a legal scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute. “It gives each individual act of malfeasance — such as ‘nullifying' a federal statute — a much, much more sinister resonance.”

Calley Means, TrueMed co-founder and MAHA advocate, tells Fox News Digital why removing soda from SNAP benefits will Make America Healthy Again.

As the health of Americans continues to decline, researchers at the University of Florida are urging a national rethink about fruits and vegetables.

Their message is that it's time to treat produce not just as food but as medicine.

In a recent article published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers endorse the "food is medicine" movement, arguing fruits and vegetables play a crucial role in preventing chronic diseases and improving public health.

TROPICAL FRUIT COULD BE THE ANSWER TO BETTER HEART HEALTH, RESEARCHERS SUGGEST

Yet only one in 10 adults in the U.S. consumes the recommended daily servings – a shortfall researchers claim is fueling the crisis.

The article warns that current U.S. agricultural output is insufficient to support a healthy population.

To address this gap, the authors advocate for a substantial increase in fruit and vegetable production, with a focus on nutrient-dense produce such as berries, leafy greens and carrots.

Danielle Treadwell, an associate professor of horticultural sciences at the University of Florida, spoke to Fox News Digital about her involvement in the study.

EATING THESE COMMON FOODS BEFORE BED COULD TRIGGER SWEET DREAMS OR NIGHT TERRORS

"In the U.S., we have a healthcare crisis, due in large part to dietary choices," she said.

Treadwell defined horticulture as "the art and science of fruit production and vegetable production" — integral to expanding the quantity and quality of produce in the U.S.

"Where are all those fruits and vegetables going to come from?" Treadwell said. "Because currently, the United States is only able to produce 50% of what we anticipate we would need if every adult in the U.S. were to follow the dietary advice of eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day."

Americans aren't eating enough fruits and vegetables, a University of Florida researcher told Fox News Digital. (iStock)

She added, "That is not enough."

Treadwell cited common barriers to eating more produce, including the time required to prepare them and limited access — especially in underserved areas.

"Here in Florida, we grow fruits and vegetables nine months out of the year [and] many of us have citrus trees in our yard," the horticulturist said. "However, that's not true in other parts of the country."

Treadwell also observed that many Americans work "very long hours, sometimes multiple jobs."

She added, "All of these things can come together and really [have] an impact on how many servings a day [of produce that] the average adult can take in."

"Frozen vegetables, by and large, retain 100% of their nutritional content that they had when they left the field."

Treadwell's main advice is to choose what you eat wisely and to start out small.

"Remember that a serving is half a cup … so maybe, eat a whole cup at a time," she suggested. "It certainly doesn't necessarily have to be fresh. Frozen vegetables, by and large, retain 100% of their nutritional content that they had when they left the field."

The U.S. currently produces only half the fruits and vegetables needed for a healthy population, a problem that horticulturists hope to remedy. (iStock)

So if food can be medicine, which specific fruits and vegetables target certain ailments?

Dr. William W. Li, author of the book "Eat to Beat Disease: The New Science of How Your Body Can Heal Itself," shared some examples with Fox News Digital.

He cited pears and strawberries as two fruits that can target specific medical conditions.

"Pears contain polyphenols like quercetin and chlorogenic acid that can reduce blood pressure, shrink body fat, improve energy balance and reverse metabolic syndrome," Li said. 

Strawberries, on the other hand, contain "polyphenols such as ellagic acid and anthocyanins that can decrease insulin resistance in obese persons to improve metabolism."

Pears and strawberries are two fruits that can target specific medical conditions.

For those with a high amount of "bad" LDL cholesterol and stubborn abdominal fat, the doctor suggested the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in avocados.

Blueberries can also help "reduce body weight, increase insulin sensitivity, shrink visceral fat and improve metabolism," Li said. 

Berries, leafy greens and carrots are among the most important crops for public health, researchers say. (iStock)

Yaa Boakye, a dietitian based in Illinois, echoed the notion of the healing powers of fruits and vegetables.

"Physiological shifts happen when fruits and vegetables become a daily, consistent part of your life," Boakye told Fox News Digital. "Not once a week. Not a once-a-month juice cleanse, but consistency."

"Fruits and vegetables must be a non-negotiable part of our daily diet."

She also said that diet is one of many factors in a person's health and encouraged Americans to be well-balanced in their approaches to health.

"Stress, sleep, trauma, environment, medications, access — they all matter, too," Boakye said. "If nutrition is your shield, then movement, sleep and emotional regulation are your armor, reinforcements and escape routes."

Boakye said Americans should make eating produce a habit.

            Hundreds of millions of flies dropping from planes in the sky might sound like a horrible nightmare, but experts say such a swarm could be the livestock industry's best defense against a flesh-eating threat poised to invade the southwestern border of the United States.
    


            An outbreak of New World screwworms — the larval form of a type of fly that's known to nest in the wounds of warm-blooded animals and slowly eat them alive — has been spreading across Central America since early 2023, with infestations recorded in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize and El Salvador. Most Central American countries hadn't seen an outbreak in 20 years.
    


             The fly reached southern Mexico in November, sparking concern among US agricultural industry officials and triggering the closure of several border-area cattle, horse and bison trading ports.

            It wouldn't be the first time the US has had to battle these invasive bugs. The nation mostly eradicated the New World screwworm populations in the 1960s and 1970s by breeding sterilized males of the species and dispersing them from planes to mate with wild, female flies.
    


            The strategy — essentially fighting flies with flies — slowly degraded the insects' populations by preventing them from laying more eggs. Now, as the insects continue to spread north officials are hoping the approach could work again.
    


            However, today only one facility in Panama breeds sterilized New World screwworms for dispersal, and hundreds of millions more sterile flies are needed to slow the outbreak, according to a June 17 letter from 80 US lawmakers.
    


            The next day, the US Department of Agriculture announced plans to open a “fly factory” in a yet to be determined town near the Texas-Mexico border. But the process of defeating the screwworm may not be quick — or inexpensive.
    


            New World screwworms are the parasitic larva of a metallic blue blow fly species called Cochliomyia hominivorax. Unlike all other blow flies native to the Western Hemisphere, the New World screwworm feeds on the flesh of living animals, rather than dead ones, said Dr. Phillip Kaufman, a professor and head of the department of entomology at Texas A&M University.
    


            The flesh-eating maggots go for most warm-blooded animals, including horses and cows.They have also been known to infect domestic pets and even humans in rare cases, Kaufman said.
    


            “After mating, the female fly finds a living host, lands on its wound, and will lay up to 200 to 300 eggs,” Kaufman explained. “After 12 to 24 hours, those eggs all hatch, and they immediately start burrowing and feeding on the tissue of that animal, causing very, very large wounds to form.”
    


            After the larvae feed on the tissue with their sharp mouth hooks for several days, they drop from the animal and burrow into the ground to emerge later as fully grown adult flies, according to Thomas Lansford, the deputy executive director and assistant state veterinarian for the Texas Animal Health Commission.
    


            Since the outbreak began in 2023, there have been more than 35,000 New World screwworm infestations reported, according to statistics listed on the Panama–United States Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of Screwworm Infestation in Livestock (COPEG) website. Of those cases, cows make up about 83% of the affected animal species.
    


            Treatment for infested cattle often involves cleaning, antiseptic treatment and coverings for the wounds, Lansford said.
    


            If left untreated, the flies can kill an animal in a matter of one to two weeks and spread to others, posing a threat to the livelihood of ranchers.
    


            “It's a daily chore to provide those inspections to our livestock, just to make sure they're not infested,” said Stephen Diebel, a rancher and the first vice president of the Texas & Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. “We know the incredible economic impact an infestation would cause.”
    


            There are no known vaccinations or effective repellant methods to prevent infestation, Diebel said. Instead, during warmer months, ranchers should avoid branding, tagging and other procedures that create potential entry points for the screwworms in livestock, he recommended. The tropical fly is less active in the winter.
    


            While regional cattle trading is thought to be a major way the fly populations travel, Diebel said infestations can also affect wildlife such as deer, birds and rodents, making surveillance of the parasite's spread even more challenging.
    


            Just like a caterpillar goes into a cocoon before becoming a butterfly, the New World screwworm becomes a black, pill-sized pupa before emerging as an adult fly, Kaufman explained.
    


            In a sterile fly production facility, the pupae are subjected to high-energy gamma rays that break down the DNA of the males, damaging their sex chromosomes, according to the USDA. The result: impotent adult flies that cause female mates to lay unfertilized eggs.
    


            The amount of radiation the male flies are exposed to does not pose a danger to animals or humans, according to the USDA. But since the female flies only mate one time in their short, 20-day lifespan, once populations are exposed to sterile males, the populations die out over the course of months or years, depending on the size of the outbreak.
    


            While it is unclear how dispersal would work in the US in the event of an outbreak, Kaufman said the adult flies are typically loaded into temperature-controlled containers and dropped from planes. However, there's no need to panic about the fly drops coming to a suburb near you, he said — they usually target sparsely populated rural areas, since the flies have no interest in urban environments.
    


            At the COPEG facility, about 100 million sterilized flies are produced and dispersed aerially in affected regions each week.
    


            Currently, the dispersal efforts have been focused in the southern regions of Mexico and throughout Central America, where cases of infestation have been reported, according to COPEG's website.
    


            The new US dispersal facility is expected to be located at the Moore Air Base in Hidalgo County, Texas, and to cost $8.5 million, per the release. The location and price tag of the production facility, or the “fly factory” itself, has not been revealed, but lawmakers estimate it could cost around $300 million.
    


            In addition to the new sterile fly facilities, the USDA also announced $21 million plans to renovate an old fly factory in Mexico by late 2025.
    


            While the plans are expensive, it's a price worth paying to save the multibillion-dollar livestock industry, Diebel said.
    


            ‘When you offset the $300 million to the $10 billion of economic impact these flies would have, it's an easy trade-off to understand,” Diebel said. “Having (a domestic production facility) here is super important … to control the distribution of those sterile flies more efficiently.”

            Shortly after the June 18 announcement, the USDA shared plans to begin reopening  livestock trading ports in Arizona, Texas and New Mexico that closed last year, citing “good progress” in surveillance and sterile fly dispersal efforts throughout Mexico.
    


            COPEG did not immediately respond to request for comment on further details about the current progress of the US dispersal initiatives.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad marked a historic milestone as he turned 100 on Thursday, calling the moment “quite frightening” without showing signs of slowing down.

A towering figure in Malaysian politics, Mahathir is known for his transformative and at times controversial leadership. First serving as the nation's fourth prime minister from 1981 to 2003, and then returning as its seventh from 2018 to 2020, Mahathir has been the country's longest-serving and oldest-serving prime minister. 

Despite the weight of the century mark, Mahathir remains remarkably active. After birthday wishes from his family, he turned up early for work at his Putrajaya office in his signature safari suit. 

“I'd like to thank all those who sent cakes, flowers, letters and for turning up to wish me a happy 100th birthday. To be 100 is quite frightening,” he said in a special live podcast to mark the occasion. 

During the podcast, Mahathir also reflected on key moments in Malaysia's history, voiced solidarity with the Palestinian people and spoke about the rise of China. 

Mahathir, who previously attributed his longevity to neither smoking nor overeating and exercising his brain, also offered personal insights on aging. Although he has a history of heart disease, including two bypass surgeries, Mahathir said staying mentally and physically active has kept him going.

“I have always been active. I cannot understand people wanting to rest. I mean, you take a holiday, you do something, you go on a holiday that is doing something. But some people retire, and they want to rest. What is the meaning of rest? You do nothing?” he said.




“So long as I can function, I want to function. I want to behave almost as if I am not getting old. I try to live the same life that I lived when I was younger. I work, I come to the office, I attend functions and all that. And I think being active is what keeps me alive,” he added. 

Mahathir acknowledged he was fortunate not to have been struck by any fatal diseases.

“I didnt make an effort to live this long but I look after my health,” he said, describing his milestone birthday as just a “normal day.” 

During his first 22-year term, Malaysia transformed into a modern economy, but Mahathir used stifling political control to hold power and silence dissent. He came out of retirement to challenge his former party over a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal, forming an alliance with old foes that produced a 2018 election victory hailed as a triumph for democracy.

When he returned to power at age 92, he was hailed as a hero who ousted a corrupt government and led Malaysia's first opposition victory since independence from Britain in 1957. But that aura wore off.

His government collapsed during infighting after just 22 months and in opposition Mahathir became a divisive voice advocating Malay supremacy, working with an Islamist party he had long denounced.

After his birthday podcast, Mahathir met more well-wishers at his office. While there was no grand celebration, staff brought out a small cake and sang a birthday song, his aide Sufi Yusoff said.

True to form, Mahathir ended the moment with his trademark discipline: “Ok, back to work!”

KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Dozens of rescuers searched the banks of a mountain river Wednesday looking for people missing after monsoon floods swept away Nepal's main bridge connecting to the country to China and caused at least nine deaths. 

Police said dozens of rescuers were already at the area and more are expected to join the rescue efforts. Nine dead bodies have been recovered from the river. Security forces have rescued 55 people, including four Indians and a Chinese person so far, according to the Rasuwa District Administration Office.

Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli, along with top ministers and officials, flew to the area. Oli called an emergency meeting Tuesday night and instructed all security forces and government offices to assist the rescue and recovery efforts. 

The flooding on the Bhotekoshi River early Tuesday destroyed the Friendship Bridge at Rasuwagadi, which is 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of the capital, Kathmandu. Several houses and trucks that were parked at the border for customs inspections also were swept away. Hundreds of electric vehicles imported from China had been parked at the border point.

The 19 missing are 13 Nepali citizens and six Chinese nationals, said the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority.

The Chinese and eight of the Nepalis were workers at a Chinese-assisted construction project on the Nepali side of the border, according to the Chinese Embassy in Nepal, quoted by state media.

The destruction of the bridge has halted all trade from China to Nepal through this route. The longer alternative is for goods to be shipped from China to India and then brought overland to Nepal.

Monsoon rains that begin in June and end in September often cause severe flooding in Nepal, disrupting infrastructure and endangering lives.

            Australian universities may lose funding if they're not judged to be doing enough to address anti-Jewish hate crimes, according to new measures proposed by the country's first antisemitism envoy.
    


            Jillian Segal was appointed to the role a year ago in response to a surge in reports of attacks against Jewish sites and property in Australia, following Israel's invasion of Gaza, and was tasked with combating antisemitism in the country.
    


            Standing alongside Prime Minister Anthony Albanese Thursday, Segal released a report nine months in the making proposing strong measures, including the university funding threats and the screening of visa applicants for extremist views.
    


            “The plan is not about special treatment for one community; it is about restoring equal treatment,” Segal said. “It's about ensuring that every Australian, regardless of their background or belief, can live, work, learn and prosper in this country.”
    


            Like in the United States, Australian campuses were once the hub of pro-Palestinian protests led by students who pitched tents demanding action to stop Israel's assault on Gaza.
    


            The campus protests dwindled after restrictions were tightened and some protesters were threatened with expulsion, a move condemned by the activists as an infringement on free speech.
    


            Segal's report said antisemitism had become “ingrained and normalised” within academia and university courses, as well as on campuses, and recommended universities be made subject to annual report cards assessing their effectiveness in combating antisemitism.
    


            Universities Australia chief executive Luke Sheehy said the organization had been working “constructively” with the special envoy and its members would “consider the recommendations.”
    


            “Academic freedom and freedom of expression are core to the university mission, but they must be exercised with responsibility and never as a cover for hate or harassment,” he said in a statement.
    


            Antisemitic attacks in Australia surged 300% in the year following Israel's invasion of Gaza in October 2023.
    


In the past week alone, the door of a synagogue was set on fire in Melbourne, forcing 20 occupants to flee by a rear exit, as nearby protesters shouting “Death to the IDF” – using the initials of the Israeli military – stormed an Israeli-owned restaurant.
    


A man is facing arson charges over the synagogue attack, and three people were charged Tuesday with assault, affray, riotous behavior and criminal damage over the restaurant raid.
    


            The Executive Council of Australian Jewry, which Segal once led and is the umbrella organization for hundreds of Jewish community groups, said the report's release “could not be more timely given the recent appalling events in Melbourne.”
    


            However, the Jewish Council of Australia, which opposes Israel's war in Gaza, voiced concerns about Segal's plan, saying it carried the overtones of US President Donald Trump's attempts to use funding as a means of control over institutions.
    


            In a statement, the council criticized the plan's “emphasis on surveillance, censorship, and punitive control over the funding of cultural and educational institutions,” adding that they were “measures straight out of Trump's authoritarian playbook.”
    


            Max Kaiser, the group's executive officer, said: “Any response that treats antisemitism as exceptional, while ignoring Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism, and other forms of hate, is doomed to fail.”
    


The envoy's 20-page plan includes sweeping recommendations covering schools, immigration, media, policing and public awareness campaigns.
    


            Segal wants Holocaust and antisemitism education baked into the national curriculum “as a major case study of where unchecked antisemitism can lead,” according to the report.
    


            Arts organizations could be subject to the same restrictions as universities, with threats to pull public funding if they're found to have engaged in, or facilitated, antisemitism.
    


            “While freedom of expression, particularly artistic expression, is vital to cultural richness and should be protected, funding provided by Australian taxpayers should not be used to promote division or spread false/ distorted narratives,” the report said.
    


            Under the recommendations, tougher immigration screening would weed out people with antisemitic views, and the Migration Act would enable authorities to cancel visas for antisemitic conduct.
    


            Media would be monitored to “encourage accurate, fair and responsible reporting” and to “avoid accepting false or distorted narratives,” the report added.
    


            During Thursday's press conference, Albanese pointed to an interview on the country's national broadcaster with a protester, saying the interviewee tried to justify the Melbourne restaurant attack.
    


            “There is no justification for that whatsoever,” he said.  “The idea that somehow the cause of justice for Palestinians is advanced by behavior like that is not only delusional, it is destructive, and it is not consistent with how you are able to put forward your views respectfully in a democracy,” he said.
    


            Asked if the country had become less tolerant of different views and had, perhaps, lost the ability to have a debate, Albanese pointed to social media.
    


            “I think there is an impact of social media, where algorithms work to reinforce people's views,” he said. “They reinforce views, and they push people towards extremes, whether it be extreme left, extreme right. Australians want a country that is in the center.”
    


            His comments came as Grok, X's AI chatbot, was called out for spreading antisemitic tropes that the company said it was “actively working to remove.”
    


            Albanese said, regarding antisemitic views, “social media has a social responsibility, and they need to be held to account.”
    


            Asked whether anti-Israel protests were fueling the antisemitic attacks, the prime minister said people should be able to express their views without resorting to hate.
    


            “In Israel itself, as a democracy, there is protest against actions of the government, and in a democracy, you should be able to express your view here in Australia about events overseas,” he said. “Where the line has been crossed is in blaming and identifying people because they happen to be Jewish.”

NEW YORK (AP) — One game into his major league career, Cam Schlittler is the hardest-throwing member of the New York Yankees' rotation.

Schlittler used his 100 mph fastball to shut down Cal Raleigh and the Seattle Mariners during an eye-opening debut Wednesday night, pitching the Yankees to a 9-6 victory before a throng of friends and family members in the crowd.

“Obviously, it's been my goal my whole life,” Schlittler said. “I don't think I've really processed it yet.” 

One of the team's top-rated prospects, the 6-foot-6 Schlittler struck out seven over 5 1/3 innings to earn the win. He threw New York's seven fastest pitches this season and his average fastball velocity of 97.9 mph was the highest for a Yankees pitcher this year.

But it was his poise and improved secondary pitches that really impressed manager Aaron Boone.

“You see his stuff really plays,” Boone said. “I see a lot of potential.”

Boone called it “a great first step” and said Schlittler will get another big league start, likely after the All-Star break.

“He was sick,” said Yankees teammate Jazz Chisholm Jr., who homered twice and drove in four runs.

Schlittler was called up from Triple-A to pitch in place of injured Clarke Schmidt, who is expected to undergo a second Tommy John surgery on his right elbow that would sideline him for the rest of this season and much of next year. 

So there's a genuine opportunity for Schlittler to stick in the rotation for a Yankees squad trying to catch Toronto atop the AL East.




“Obviously, just trying to get the first one under my belt and then whatever happens. I'm just fortunate that they gave me that opportunity,” Schlittler said. “Just take it day by day and see what happens.” 

Staked to an early 3-0 lead, Schlittler gave up three runs and four hits — including solo homers by J.P. Crawford and Jorge Polanco. 

The 24-year-old right-hander walked his first batter but settled down quickly and froze Raleigh, the major league home run leader, with a 100 mph heater for his first strikeout in the opening inning.

“He was nasty,” Yankees outfielder Jasson Domínguez said.

That baseball was one of two sitting in Schlittler's locker after the game, both keepsakes inscribed and encased above the Yankees' championship belt for the night.

Schlittler said the strikeout ball will probably end up in his room back home eventually, but first he planned to give it to his parents.

“I know they'll cherish that,” he said.

Schlittler, who walked two, ending his outing with another strikeout of Raleigh before leaving with a 6-2 lead in the sixth to a standing ovation as his parents hugged in the Yankee Stadium stands.

Schlittler was born in Massachusetts but said he always wanted to play for the Yankees. They selected him in the seventh round of the 2022 amateur draft from Northeastern in Boston, right in the heart of rival Red Sox country. 

The pitcher said his girlfriend and cousin were on hand in addition to plenty of friends, and he left 23 tickets for his supporters. But he said he wasn't all that nervous come gametime. 

“I think probably had more jitters this morning, honestly,” Schlittler said. “I know my dad just in general gets more nervous than I do when I throw.”

Follow:


            When President Donald Trump searched for his top Cabinet secretaries, a flair for running a smooth governing machine was nowhere on the job description.
    


            So rising frustration among White House aides about chaos coming from the offices of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi seems a bit rich.
    


            Trump is getting exactly what he should have expected after spurning traditional public servants and filling top roles with high-wattage Fox News performers, MAGA favorites, conspiracy theorists and central-casting archetypes with little knowledge of how Washington works.
    


            The most disruptive president in modern history never showed much interest in governing. His administrative arson is vital to his image as an elite establishment scourge. But even in his unorthodox administration, there comes a time when incessantly playing to the outlandish fringe of the conservative media machine clashes with Trump's and the nation's interests.
    


            Hegseth, after an accident-prone six months at the Pentagon, is feeling heat again — this time for halting US arms shipments to Ukraine without telling the president. This followed his towel-snapping boasts about US strikes on Yemen on a group chat that leaked earlier this year.
    


            Bondi is paying the price for a habit of exaggeration and trying to feed the MAGA media beast after failing to stand up her earlier promises of stunning revelations from files about the death and clients of child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            Two other top officials, FBI Director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino, who made their names fanning right-wing conspiracy theories before joining the “deep state” they once demonized, also found themselves in damaging climbdowns on the issue.
    


            They are not the only Trump favorites under rising scrutiny. The president's choice of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run the department of Health and Human Services is becoming even more controversial after measles cases hit their highest levels since the disease was eradicated in the US a quarter-century ago. Kennedy has recommended that parents vaccinate their kids against the disease. But he recently dismissed an expert panel of vaccine advisers who have shaped government policy on inoculations, causing widespread concern among the US public health community.
    


            RFK Jr. is not directly responsible for the current measles outbreak. But a president who appoints the country's best-known vaccine skeptic is clearly sending a message to families who mistrust government public health guidelines. If the breakout gets worse and the administration gets the blame, Trump will reap what he sowed for trying to play into his base's suspicion of federal health advice dating at least back to the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            But Kennedy can't hold a candle to the ultimate example of Trump appointing a wild iconoclast who then, in the president's words, “went off the rails.” The only surprise with Elon Musk is that the chainsaw-wielding Tesla chief lasted as long as he did at the Department of Government Efficiency before his and Trump's bromance imploded.
    


            There's so far no public sign that the White House is getting ready to jettison Trump's controversial Cabinet picks.
    


            But there's barely concealed fury in the presidential mansion over another Trump appointment for a big Washington job. Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell is frequently berated for refusing to slash interest rates and unleash what Trump insists is massive pent-up economic growth.
    


            Trump chose Powell — who fears the US economy has yet to fully vanquish inflation as Trump risks price hikes with his tariff policy — in his own first term. But he's long since turned on the man who was instrumental in ending an inflationary crisis without triggering a recession and widespread unemployment, a feat many economists predicted was impossible.
    


            Powell is being slammed by the president for doing his job — rather well, in contrast to Bondi, Hegseth and other top Trump acolytes, whose inexperience is glaring.
    


            The latest storm around Hegseth has recharged speculation as old as Trump's second administration: How long is he going to last at the Pentagon?
    


            CNN reported Tuesday that the defense secretary failed to inform the White House before he authorized a pause on weapons shipments to Ukraine last week. The move, confirmed by five sources, set off a scramble in the administration to work out what was going on and what to tell Congress and the Ukrainian government.
    


            It was the latest demonstration of administrative mayhem around Hegseth, who has no experience in government, is charged with running one of the world's most complex bureaucracies and has already fired several top aides in a purge that likely worsened the disarray in his policy apparatus.
    


            He might have been forgiven, however, for failing to anticipate Trump's sudden reversal on Ukraine. After criticizing former President Joe Biden for arming Kyiv as it fights for survival after a Russian invasion, the president has suddenly and belatedly gotten fed up with President Vladimir Putin, who embarrassed Trump over a push for peace that he'd hoped would end in a Nobel Prize.
    


            The White House denied that Hegseth failed to tell Trump about pausing the shipments to Ukraine, and the administration said that they will resume. Wider uncertainty remains, however, about whether Trump's turn against Putin — to whom he has always genuflected — will be sustained, or even whether it's a negotiating ploy to get the Russian president to the table.
    


            But until Hegseth crosses Trump's invisible red line, he could survive. That's because he might keep messing up, but he constantly delivers on what Trump really wants.
    


            Hegseth shows total fealty to the president and is the only Cabinet member who comes close to his boss's mastery of stunt politics.
    


            After reports that early intelligence assessments contradicted Trump's claims to have “obliterated” Iran's nuclear program in B-2 bombing raids, Hegseth put on a wildly theatrical show in a Pentagon briefing, slamming the media and pouring exaggerated praise on the president in a made-for-television tirade that rivaled any of his former work on Fox News.
    


            Hegseth's outspoken loyalty to Trump is a cause for concern across Washington because he is such a departure from the president's first-term secretaries of defense, James Mattis and Mark Esper, who reined in some of the president's riskiest impulses. If Trump ousts Hegseth, he'd have to find someone else who'd implement his orders unquestioningly.
    


            The Pentagon chief's defenders can argue that the sophisticated US raid on Iran's nuclear plants went off without a hitch operationally, in a way that suggests the pandemonium in the secretary's office is not yet hurting US readiness.
    


            But every time Hegseth shows up on Capitol Hill, he's asked by Democrats whether he'd carry out an order from the president to open fire on protesters. And he's yet to give a straight answer.
    


            Bondi has a record as an accomplished lawyer and public official in Florida, and, like anyone who aspired to a job in the Trump Cabinet, she is good on TV.
    


            But her willingness to foster the MAGA movement's obsession with conspiracy theories — which helped her get her job in the first place — has tripped her up.
    


            It's long been an article of faith on the fevered extreme of the conservative movement that Epstein, who died in jail awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, was murdered and that he had once kept a list of famous people who used him to gain access to underage girls.
    


            Bondi promised she'd expose the truth. But the truth turned out to be prosaic: Epstein was not murdered and that there was no list.
    


            Bondi's problems started with a Fox interview in February in which she implied the Epstein list was sitting on her desk. And she orchestrated a big photo op at the White House where conservative influencers were handed files on Epstein. The plan backfired because those files didn't contain any revelations. As is the way with conspiracy theories, the opacity only fueled the conspiracy machine.
    


            This may be one case where a lack of experience in national politics is to blame. There may not be a line between governance and conservative opinion television anymore, but Bondi's loose comments on the case raised expectations and created a political mess.
    


            The White House tried to fudge the issue by saying her quotes on Fox were misinterpreted. But that has not stopped fringe influencers such as Laura Loomer — who previously convinced Trump to fire top staffers on the National Security Council — from calling for Bondi's dismissal.
    


            Bondi also said on Wednesday that she could not release large amounts of video from the Epstein case because it contained child pornography. But the online crowd is now fixated on a “missing minute” on prison surveillance tapes.
    


            Trump appeared frustrated at the story, which is detracting from a purple patch of political success.
    


            “Are people still talking about this guy, this creep?” Trump said of Epstein on Tuesday. He may have had a point. While this is a huge issue for certain conservative media influencers, it's not clear at all that most Republican voters really care that much about it.
    


            Trump did not express public frustration with Bondi. But CNN reported on Tuesday that there's impatience inside the West Wing about how the issue has been handled.
    


            It's not the first Bondi misstep. Earlier this year she faced ridicule after claiming in a previous Cabinet meeting that Trump's crackdown on fentanyl coming across the border had saved 258 million lives — in a country of about 340 million people.
    


            Still, like Hegseth, Bondi offers Trump real value. She's an enthusiastic partner in the president's effort to enact revenge against prosecutors, legal firms and political foes who investigated or crossed him.
    


            In a new bombshell Wednesday, CNN reported that former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan — both vehement Trump critics — are under investigation by the Justice Department for possible false statements to Congress. The probe arises from one of Trump's longstanding obsessions — an intelligence community finding that Russia's 2016 election interference operation was meant to help him beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
    


            Bondi's Justice Department prosecutors have been infuriating district court judges for months as the tip of the spear of Trump's war on the justice system. Her team has won several big Supreme Court victories as Trump pushes his power to its limits.
    


            So, as with Hegseth, there are good reasons for Trump to keep her around.
    


            In any case, if promoting conspiracies; engaging in bombast and exaggerations; and politicizing the legal system and the military while creating chaos in government were disqualifications for high office, Trump would never have made it back to the White House.

The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday blasted CNN for an article the outlet ran claiming Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem delayed FEMA's response to the Texas floods, calling the story a “FAKE NEWS LIE.”

The report, citing anonymous sources, suggested the agency's response was delayed by bureaucracy that required Noem to sign off on any contract and grant over $100,000 due to a Trump administration cost-saving rule.

“This reporting is an unparalleled display of activist journalism and distracts from the robust, coordinated federal response led by Secretary Noem that has saved over 900+ lives,” DHS said in a post on X.

“While these ‘journalists' slept comfortably in D.C., Secretary Noem deployed to Texas, working day and night to approve every possible need that search and rescue workers had. Within moments of the flooding in Texas, DHS assets, including the U.S. Coast Guard, tactical Border Patrol units, and FEMA personnel, surged into unprecedented action alongside Texas first responders. The U.S. Coast Guard alone rescued over 230 Americans,” the agency added.

The article alleged that the spending rule strips the agency of its autonomy. 

“We were operating under a clear set of guidance: lean forward, be prepared, anticipate what the state needs, and be ready to deliver it,” a longtime FEMA official said. “That is not as clear of an intent for us at the moment.”

The article also suggested that Noem “didn't authorize FEMA's deployment of Urban Search and Rescue teams until Monday, more than 72 hours after the flooding began.”

DHS told the outlet that FEMA is shifting away from being “bloated” to being “lean” in a statement.

“FEMA is shifting from bloated, DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,” spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said. “The old processes are being replaced because they failed Americans in real emergencies for decades.”

While FEMA's response and local officials' and meteorologists' predictions of the storm have been debated, some regard the rain as a freak phenomenon that struck at the wrong time. Many people, including hundreds of campers and counselors at Camp Mystic, were celebrating the Fourth of July weekend when heavy rains hit, rapidly flooding the area overnight.

Warnings had been in effect before the flooding hit, but many were unaware. As a result, many people have died or are missing in Central Texas, and the world has mourned the effects. President Donald Trump is set to visit the area later this week and has approved a disaster declaration.

DHS said Noem is leading a “first-of-a-kind” approach that it describes as a “breakthrough in how FEMA supports state-led disaster recovery.”

“@Sec_Noem is leading a historic, first-of-its-kind approach to disaster funding: putting states first by providing upfront recovery support — moving money faster than ever and jump-starting recovery. This is a breakthrough in how FEMA supports state-led disaster recovery,” DHS said.

At least 120 people have died due to the floods, with more than 173 missing.

CENTRAL TEXAS FLASH FLOODS LEAVE MORE THAN 100 DEAD: WHAT TO KNOW

CNN's reporting has drawn the ire of the Trump administration a few times over the past month. Aside from the Texas flood story, the outlet also published an interview highlighting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement tracker, which the government argued puts officers in danger. It also published partial findings from a preliminary report on Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which cast doubt on their effectiveness. Trump and Noem have weighed whether it is possible to prosecute CNN for the latter two stories.

The Washington Examiner reached out to CNN for comment, but did not receive a response.

Former first lady Michelle Obama suggested there is a persistent and unfair confidence gap between men and women, one that begins early and lingers throughout life.

In the latest episode of her IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson podcast, which was released Wednesday, Obama told actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus that many women spend much of their lives second-guessing themselves, while young men, especially those in their 30s, often exude confidence they haven't necessarily earned.

“We're always hedging … because in the back of our minds, we weren't raised with the certainty of maleness,” Obama said. “That kind of confidence that young men in their 30s have, which they haven't earned. They just have it.”

The conversation was part of a broader discussion on aging, confidence, and cultural invisibility, especially for women.

Obama, 60, said she has only recently reached a point in her life where she feels fully secure in herself.

“This is really the first time in my life where I feel completely me, and I can absolutely embrace my wisdom,” she said. “We, as women, spend most of our lives saying, ‘Well, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.' We qualify everything.”

Louis-Dreyfus agreed, adding that women are often conditioned to “apologize” for their views or downplay their opinions. 

Obama echoed that sentiment, emphasizing how society discourages women from expressing confidence when they gain the experience to justify it.

“We don't start feeling that and owning that until our 50s and 60s, at a time when we start to be treated as invisible in society,” Obama said.

MICHELLE OBAMA DEBUNKS DIVORCE RUMORS OVER LACK OF SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS: ‘WE'RE 60!'

She also reflected on the personal freedom that has come with this stage of her life, saying that for the first time, her decisions are entirely her own.

“This stage in life for me, for me personally, is the first time that I've been completely free,” Obama shared. “There's a real release. Where every choice that I make in my life is not about my husband, not about his career, not about what my kids need, or where they're going. It's totally about me.”

The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected Florida‘s emergency request to allow the state to enforce a law that would ban illegal immigrants from entering the state.

The decision leaves a lower court's ruling in place. The Supreme Court did not explain its decision, and no dissents were filed.

Senate Bill 4C, approved by Florida's legislature and signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) earlier this year, makes it a crime for illegal immigrants to enter the state if they had been deported or previously denied entry into the United States, regardless of their history or if they had become lawful residents.

Re-entering the state after being deported would have been deemed a felony. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier asked the Supreme Court to intervene last month and allow law enforcement. He said the state and its citizens will “remain disabled from combating the serious harms of illegal immigration for years as this litigation proceeds through the lower courts,” without intervention.

But the Supreme Court is leaving U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams's preliminary injunction in place while a legal battle on the law continues.

Florida's position is supported by 18 states, which have submitted an amicus brief backing the immigration law. The ACLU has filed a motion opposing the law, saying it would undermine federal immigration enforcement and “lead to an unmanageable patchwork of varying state criminal regulations of immigration.”

FLORIDA LEADS STATES IN CARRYING OUT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION MISSION

The Justice Department has also filed a 33-page amicus brief backing Florida in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. The Trump administration said the law does not “preempt” federal supremacy over immigration law, and that Florida's S.B. 4C “is in harmony, not conflict, with federal law.”

However, the appeals court declined to pause the injunction. The ACLU said in a court filing that several other states have tried to pass similar legislation, but all remain blocked in the courts.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Sweeping tariffs set to be imposed by President Donald Trump next month may overshadow his top diplomat's first official trip to Asia this week — just as the U.S. seeks to boost relations with Indo-Pacific nations to counter China's growing influence in the region. 

Trump on Monday sent notice to several countries about higher tariffs if they don't make trade deals with the U.S., including to a number of Asian countries. The move came just a day before Secretary of State Marco Rubio departed for a Southeast Asian regional security conference in Malaysia. 

Top diplomats and senior officials from several countries that Trump has targeted for the new tariffs, which would go into effect on Aug. 1, will be represented at the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional forum in Kuala Lumpur that Rubio will attend on Thursday and Friday.

State Department officials say tariffs and trade will not be Rubio's focus during the meetings, which Trump's Republican administration hopes will prioritize maritime safety and security in the South China Sea, where China has become increasingly aggressive toward its small neighbors, as well as combating transnational crime.

But Rubio may be hard-pressed to avoid the tariff issue that has vexed some of America's closest allies and partners in Asia, including Japan and South Korea, which Trump says would face 25% tariffs if there is no deal.

Neither of those countries is a member of ASEAN, but both will be represented at the meetings in Kuala Lumpur.




Rubio's “talking points on the China threat will not resonate with officials whose industries are being battered by 30-40% tariffs,” said Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific during the Obama administration.

“In fact, when Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim last week said ASEAN will approach challenges ‘as a united bloc' — he wasn't talking about Chinese coercion but about U.S. tariffs,” Russel said.

Among ASEAN states, Trump has so far announced tariffs on almost all of the 10 members of the bloc, including the meeting host Malaysia, which would face a 25% tariff that could specifically hit its electronics and electrical product exports to the United States.

Trade Minister Zafrul Aziz said Wednesday that while Malaysia is ready to resume tariff negotiations, it would not cross its red lines, including U.S. requests for changes to government procurement, halal certification, medical standards and digital taxes. 

Trump sent tariff letters to two more ASEAN members Wednesday: Brunei, whose imports would be taxed at 25%, and the Philippines, at 20%.

Vietnam recently agreed to a trade deal for 20% tariffs on its imports, while Singapore wasn't part of Trump's original April 2 tariffs. Both are ASEAN countries. The Trump administration has courted most Southeast Asian nations in a bid to blunt or at least temper China's push to dominate the region.

In Kuala Lumpur, Rubio also will likely come face-to-face with the foreign ministers of two of America's biggest adversaries: China and Russia. U.S. officials could not say if meetings with either are planned for the short time — about 36 hours — that Rubio will be in Malaysia.

Russel noted that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is a veteran of such gatherings and “fluent in ASEAN principles and conventions,” while Rubio “is a rookie trying to sell an ‘America First' message to a deeply skeptical audience.”

Issues with both countries remain substantial, particularly over Ukraine.

Trump on Tuesday expressed his exasperation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying, “I'm not happy with him, I can tell you that much right now” as Moscow ramps up attacks in Ukraine amid the American leader's push for a peace deal.

Trump also announced that the U.S. would resume providing Ukraine with defensive weapons after the Pentagon announced a surprise pause in some deliveries last week.

U.S. officials continue to accuse China of resupplying and revamping Russia's military industrial sector, allowing it to produce additional weapons with which it can attack Ukraine.

One of the biggest differences is that gaming laptops have more powerful graphics cards (GPUs), components that let them play modern games with realistic visuals. They also tend to have stronger processors (CPUs), meaning programs and files open faster and are better for multitasking. These laptops are great for users who want to play games, edit 4K videos, and quickly switch between dozens of apps.

More typical laptops can have a range of CPUs, from basic to advanced, to power productivity apps like a web browser or the Microsoft Office suite. They usually have integrated graphics rather than powerful GPUs but offer significantly better battery life, as well as lighter and more portable designs.

Design-wise, the best gaming laptops tend to be bigger and heavier, and battery life isn't great. But they're often outfitted with customizable lights that give the keyboard and chassis a sleek neon glow.

When it comes to price, the most powerful gaming laptops are far more expensive than any other kind of laptop. But it's not hard to find more affordable options, and many budget gaming laptops can still play all your favorite games, albeit with some performance caveats.

Windows laptops range wildly in price, starting in the low hundreds and going up into the thousands. But in general, you should expect to pay $300 to $700 for a decent budget laptop, around $1,000 to $1,300 for a midrange model, and upward of $1,600 for a really powerful option.

President Donald Trump's budget chief on Thursday said that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell "has grossly mismanaged the Fed" and suggested he had misled Congress about a pricey and "ostentatious" renovation of the central bank's headquarters.

The broadside by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought opened up a new front in Trump's war of words against Powell.

Trump has repeatedly called on the Fed chairman to cut interest rates, without success. He reportedly has considered firing Powell and, more recently, publicly naming the chairman's replacement months earlier than the end of Powell's term next spring.

Vought's letter raises the question of whether Trump will seek to remove Powell for cause, at least ostensibly.

But the Supreme Court in a recent decision strongly suggested that Federal Reserve board members have special protection from being fired by a president.

"While continuing to run a deficit since FY23 (the first time in the Fed's history), the Fed is way over budget on the renovation of its headquarters," Vought wrote in a post on the social media site X.

"Now up to $2.5 billion, roughly $700 million over its initial cost," Vought wrote. "The cost per square foot is $1,923--double the cost for renovating an ordinary historic federal building. The Palace of Versailles would have cost $3 billion in today's dollars!"

Vought's tweet linked to a letter he sent Powell that referenced the Fed boss's June 25 testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.

"Your testimony raises serious questions about the project's compliance with the National Capital Planning Act, which requires that projects like the Fed headquarters renovation be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission," Vought wrote.

"The plans for this project called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more," he wrote.

But Powell, in his testimony, said, "There's no VIP dining room. There's no new marble. There are no special elevators. There are no new water features. There's no beehives and there's no roof terrace gardens," Vought wrote.

"Although minor deviations from approved plans may be inevitable, your testimony appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan with regard to major design elements," Vought wrote.

"This would bring the project outside of the NCPC's approval and thus in violation of the NCPA, and require the Fed to immediately halt construction and obtain a new approval from the NCPC before proceeding any further."

The letter asked Powell to respond to 11 questions about the renovation project within seven business days.

The Federal Reserve declined to comment on Vought's letter.

DEI Backlash:

JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the Democratic Party went too far in its focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, prioritizing ideology over practical solutions.

“I have a lot of friends who are Democrats, and they're idiots,” Dimon said Thursday at a foreign-ministry event in Dublin. “I always say they have big hearts and little brains. They do not understand how the real world works. Almost every single policy rolled out failed.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Thursday as traders shook off the tariff tumult.

The 30-stock index added 270 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high shortly after the open and was last trading 0.1% higher.

The moves came after President Donald Trump said late Wednesday that a 50% U.S. tariff on imported copper will take effect Aug. 1. Trump also announced a 50% tariff on Brazil partly in retaliation for the current trial against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for his role in an alleged attempt to overturn the country's 2022 election results. The move was also due to the "very unfair trade relationship" with Brazil, Trump added, saying it has been "far from Reciprocal."

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva later said that the country would respond to the 50% levy in accordance with its economic reciprocity law. The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) shed 2%.

Prior to the president's announcement of levies on Brazil, he sent letters that dictated new U.S. rates on the imports of at least seven additional countries. He had also sent letters laying out new rates earlier this week to the leaders of 14 other countries, such as Japan and South Korea. The duties are set to take effect Aug. 1.

Despite the increasing trade tensions, U.S. markets have been able to march to record highs, recovering from steep losses suffered in the spring.

"It is wild to think that valuations are above where we started the year considering all the uncertainties with tariffs, and we now have a new deadline. The market's been extremely desensitized to all of this back and forth, and I think for good reason," said Mike Dickson, head of research and quantitative strategies at Horizon Investment.

Wall Street also saw gains during Wednesday's session.

The S&P 500 and Dow posted their first positive sessions in three with a rise of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.9% and closed at a record. Those gains were spurred by optimism around the artificial intelligence trade, which sent Nvidia shares nearly 2% higher to briefly become the first public company to be valued at $4 trillion.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) was last trading 0.6% higher on Thursday, and pacing for a week-to-date gain of 1.2%.

This also puts the exchange-traded fund on pace for its seventh straight weekly gain. This would mark its longest such streak since an 8-week rally ended in early March 2019.

The ETF hit a new all-time high on Thursday. The fund has been driven higher by gains in Nvidia, which has added 2.4% this week and crossed over the $4 trillion market capitalization level on Wednesday.

In a Thursday note, UBS stood by its positive stance on emerging market assets. The bank maintained its neutral rating on emerging market equities, noting that it sees "decent mid-single-digit upside" in the next 12 months.

"As investors seek to broaden their sources of return, emerging markets offer access to unique macro and policy cycles, structural growth opportunities, and diversification benefits — especially amid rising geopolitical fragmentation and shifting supply chains," the bank wrote. "Emerging market equities remain under-owned and have only recently begun to attract inflows, which could support a more constructive medium-term outlook for the asset class."

Specifically, UBS singled out the secular growth stories in Taiwan and India.

"We also like mainland China's tech sector due to its resilient earnings and monetization potential, as well as Brazil given attractive valuations and solid economic growth," the bank added.

Shares of Estée Lauder were trading 6% higher on Thursday, after Bank of America reinstated coverage of the stock at a buy rating.

The bank set a price target of $110 per share, implying upside of 27% from the stock's Wednesday closing price.

As a catalyst, Bank of America cited improving demand in Asia that could help drive Estée Lauder's sales growth and margin expansion.

There's good news ahead for the M&A market, according to Deutsche Bank.

"Our M&A growth indicator predicts dealmaking will continue to decline this summer but could start bottoming out in Q3 — we see a recovery in H2 and in the coming years," the bank wrote in a Wednesday note.

Going forward, Deutsche Bank is also optimistic on the state of new listings and initial public offerings in the U.S.

"New listings show some green shoots in absolute terms and this underscores relative U.S. exceptionalism. The types of companies that went public YTD also underscore our view that U.S. innovation power is second to none and that the country has, by far, the deepest, most liquid, most diversified capital markets in the world," the bank said.

It continued: "Will this carry on into H2? We believe that the roaring animal spirits that lifted lossmaking stocks in Q2 mean riskier deals that were shelved in H1 are likely to be back in H2. Risk assets continue to perform well and volatility and credit risk remain low across many ways of slicing and dicing the various indicators."

The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) was trading 4.4% higher on Thursday, and hit its highest level since 2011.

The exchange-traded fund was on pace for its best day since April 9, when it gained 9.7% in a session. The ETF was boosted by shares of MP Materials, last up 54% after the company said that the Pentagon would become its largest shareholder.

A resumption in DOGE layoffs — combined with the ongoing hiring freezes — will lead to weakening in the job market, Wolfe Research wrote in a Wednesday note.

However, the firm noted that this weakening was unlikely to be too substantial.

"At the margin, this adds to the softening in the labor market but likely isn't a game changer for the Fed — at least not ahead of the next live meeting in September," wrote Stephanie Roth, the firm's chief economist.

— Lisa Kailai Han

Stocks opened little changed on Thursday morning.

The S&P 500 was trading around flat, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 43 points, or 0.1%.

Initial unemployment benefit filings unexpectedly declined last week as the pace of layoffs held low, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

Jobless claims totaled a seasonally adjusted 227,000 for the week ending July 5, down 5,000 from the previous period and below the Dow Jones estimate for 235,000.

However, continuing claims, which run a week behind, continued to climb. The total increased to 1.96 million, up 10,000 to the highest level since Nov. 13, 2021 as long-term unemployment held higher.

Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials surged 41% in Thursday's premarket trading session after the company announced that the Defense Department will become its largest shareholder.

The Pentagon will buy a newly created class of preferred shares that can be converted into the company's common stock. MP Materials will use the proceeds to invest in its magnet production capacity and to expand its rare earths processing capabilities.

Shares of Delta Air Lines jumped about 11% premarket after the company reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and CEO Ed Bastian said bookings have stabilized.

Delta had pulled its outlook for the year in April. The airline now expects adjusted earnings of between $5.25 and $6.25 a share in 2025, down from a January forecast of more than $7.35 a share.

The carrier's outlook for summer travel beat Wall Street expectations, with Bastian saying bookings have stabilized albeit at a lower than the start of the year.

Bank of America expects firmer inflation on the horizon.

"We expect inflation to accelerate over the coming months in large part due to tariff related price increases," wrote economist Stephen Juneau. "But tariffs aren't the only reason to expect firmer inflation in the coming months; the rebound in stock prices is another."

More specifically, the economist pointed out that the recent rebound in equity prices means that portfolio management fees should turn into a driver of inflation in the upcoming months.

The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) dropped more than 1.8% in the premarket after President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva responded by saying his country will respond with similar tariffs targeting U.S. products going into Brazil. 

— Fred Imbert

The S&P 500's information technology and industrial sectors rose to close at records on Wednesday, lifting the broad market index to its first winning day in three.

The tech sector gained 0.9%, catching a tailwind from gains in Nvidia, which was up nearly 2%, and Palantir, which added about 2.5%. Nvidia's ascent briefly pushed it into a $4 trillion market capitalization during the session.

The industrial sector added 0.7%. Boeing and Caterpillar were among the notable winners in the space, up 3.7% and 2%, respectively.

President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday the U.S. will impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, partially due to the trial against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for his role in an alleged coup attempt to overturn his loss in the country's 2022 election.

In a letter shared on Truth Social, Trump called Brazil's treatment of Bolsonaro "an international disgrace" and the ongoing prosecution a "Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!"

Trump also accused Brazil in the letter of having a "very unfair trade relationship" with the U.S., adding that the U.S. is launching an investigation into Brazil for its trade practices.

Bitcoin hit a fresh record on Wednesday afternoon as an Nvidia-led rally in equities helped push the price of the cryptocurrency higher into the stock market close. Just before 4:00 p.m. ET, it hit a high of $112,052.24, surpassing its May 22 record of $111,999.

The flagship cryptocurrency has been trading in a tight range for several weeks despite billions of dollars flowing into bitcoin exchange traded funds and public companies racheting up their bitcoin purchases.

"The same fundamentals of a scarce asset are at play amid record-breaking budgets and debt ceilings," said Chris Kline, chief operating officer and cofounder of BitcoinIRA. "There is a friendly regulatory environment, and bitcoin has gained legitimacy from institutional adoption. Additionally, the rumor mill has continued to accelerate speculation that Fed Chair Jerome Powell may either step down or be removed, which has crypto bulls excited about a potential rate cut."

"This is a perfect storm for even the smallest catalyst to springboard bitcoin and crypto overall to new price discovery levels and ... more volatility," he added.

Some stocks are making big moves in extended trading Wednesday:

WK Kellogg – Shares surged more than 55% after The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that chocolate maker Ferrero is nearing a deal to buy the breakfast food company for about $3 billion. The acquisition could be finalized as early as this week, the report said.

PTC – The global software stock fell almost 3%, reversing some of the gains seen during the day's regular session. On Wednesday, PTC shares soared more than 17% after a Bloomberg report, which cited people familiar with the matter, said that Autodesk is exploring a possible takeover of the company. Autodesk shares, which finished Wednesday's session with a more than 2% decline, were likewise more than 2% lower after hours.

U.S. stock futures were relatively unchanged on Wednesday evening.

S&P 500 futures hovered around the flatline just after 6 p.m. ET, as did Nasdaq 100 futures. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were likewise flat.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company is expanding its robotaxi service area and bringing xAI's Grok to vehicles as it rolled out a new iteration of the artificial intelligence chatbot.

Shares gained about 5%.

Musk said on X that Grok, his AI chatbot that praised Adolf Hitler and posted a barrage of antisemitic comments recently, will be available in Tesla vehicles "next week at the latest."

xAI officially launched the Grok 4 update overnight as the company continued to face backlash for the vitriol written by the chatbot.

In response to a user post on his social media platform X, Musk said the company is expanding its Austin, Texas, robotaxi service area this weekend. He also said Tesla is awaiting regulatory approval for a launch in the Bay Area "probably in a month or two."

The expansion of robotaxi and Grok integration comes at a fraught time for Musk and his empire.

Tesla set its annual shareholder meeting for Nov. 6, a Thursday filing showed. A group of investors recently called on the electric vehicle company to schedule the meeting.

Its last shareholder meeting was in June 2024, as Musk established himself as a major backer of President Donald Trump's reelection campaign. Musk later led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.

After stepping down from DOGE at the end of May, Musk has openly feuded with Trump on social media over the major tax bill, with the president suggesting the government look at cutting contracts for Musk's companies.

Shares have tanked from their post-election high over investor concerns that the public fight could hamper Tesla. Slowing sales and rising competition also stifled some investor appetite.

Tesla shares fell Monday, with the company losing $68 billion in value after Musk continued to blast Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" and said he was establishing his own political party, the "America Party."

On Wednesday, Linda Yaccarino stepped down as CEO of his social media platform X, leaving the world's richest man with a major position to fill at one of his companies.

The spending and tax megabill President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 contains a number of provisions that will change the way students and their families pay for higher education.

Aimed at reducing federal spending, the bill reshapes the current student loan landscape by placing limits on borrowing and reducing the number of repayment options available for some current and future federal student loan borrowers. 

While former President Joe Biden focused on debt forgiveness and trying to help current borrowers afford their monthly payments, President Donald Trump and his administration have prioritized ensuring borrowers pay back their debts and stopping the nation's massive student debt load from growing.

Here are three key ways the bill will change how students pay for college.

Effective July 1, 2026, the bill places lower limits on how much graduate and professional students can take out in federal loans. Grad students will have an annual limit of $20,500, while professional students, like those in medical or law school, can borrow up to $50,000 a year. 

Over the course of their studies, graduate students can borrow a maximum of $100,000 in federal loans and professional students can borrow up to $200,000. The bill maintains the current aggregate undergraduate borrowing limit of $57,500, bringing the total maximum borrowing limit up to $257,500 for students who borrow for undergraduate and professional studies.

Parents can borrow up to $20,000 per year per dependent through Parent PLUS loans, with a lifetime limit of $65,000 per student, beginning July 1, 2026.

The law eliminates Grad PLUS loans, which have allowed students to borrow up to the total cost of their education, minus any federal aid. Beginning in July 2026, no new Grad PLUS loans will be disbursed.

Current borrowers will be able to continue borrowing with the current loan limits and Grad PLUS loan availability through the end of their studies. 

Students who are not enrolled full-time will have lower annual loan limits, proportional to the time they are enrolled. Part-time students taking half the number of credits to be considered full-time would have half the annual borrowing limit, for example. 

The law also allows academic institutions to set their own, program-specific borrowing limits beginning July 1, 2026.

Pell Grants are federal student aid awards that help low-income students pay for college. The grants are worth up to $7,395 for the 2025-26 school year and do not need to be repaid, except in certain cases, according to Federal Student Aid.

The new legislation doesn't change the maximum Pell Grant award — which is determined by Congress each year — but places a new limit on Pell Grant awards starting in July 2026.

Students whose Student Aid Index is double the maximum Pell Grant or more will not be eligible to receive any Pell funds. The Student Aid Index is a figure calculated when a student and their family fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and is used by the Department of Education and academic institutions to determine students' aid eligibility. 

The law also requires that foreign income be included when determining students' Pell Grant eligibility.

The legislation creates a new workforce Pell Grant program that allows students enrolling in workforce training programs, like HVAC, at community colleges to receive Pell Grants to help cover their costs beginning on July 1, 2026. 

Eligible students are not enrolled in a program that leads to a graduate credential like a master's degree and have not already received such a credential. Eligible programs have between 150 and 600 hours of instruction or equivalent credit hours and last between eight and 15 weeks, among other requirements.

Qualifying programs must lead to a "portable" credential recipients can use with more than one employer. State governors must also approve programs for eligibility, confirming each meets employer needs in that state.

Remedial, non-credit, English language learning and study abroad programs, as well as unaccredited programs, are not eligible for workforce Pell Grants.

Students who take out federal student loans on or after July 1, 2026 will have just two repayment options when it's time to start paying back their loans:

The new standard repayment plan will have borrowers make fixed monthly payments for a term ranging from 10 to 25 years, depending on the amount they borrowed. 

The Repayment Assistance Plan will set monthly payments between 1% and 10% of a borrower's adjusted gross income minus $50 a month for every dependent the borrower claims on their taxes. Borrowers earning $10,000 a year or less will have a $10 minimum monthly payment.

Payments for each income group will calculated be as follows:

Additionally, borrowers with loans disbursed on July 1, 2027 and after will not have access to economic hardship or unemployment deferments.

Six months into his second term in office, President Trump has begun to fundamentally change the relationship between the federal government and the states. In the process, he has shaken up CNBC's annual competitiveness ranking, America's Top States for Business.

Virginia, last year's No. 1 state and a top three finisher in each of the last five years, slips to fourth place in 2025 — its worst showing since 2018 — and cedes the No. 1 spot to North Carolina.

A major reason is a drop in the state's Economy ranking, to No. 14 in 2025 from No. 11 last year. Economy is the heaviest weighted category in the study under this year's methodology as more states pitch themselves as safe havens in a potential downturn.

Virginia is already seeing a small downturn of sorts, as the Trump administration sets out to slash the federal workforce. That hits The Old Dominion where it lives.

The federal government accounted for more than 144,000 jobs in Virginia last year, according to the Congressional Research Service. That is a larger percentage of the workforce than any state except Maryland and Hawaii. And that doesn't include Virginians who work for federal contractors, or commute to federal jobs elsewhere in the D.C. metro area. Include all of those, and the number approaches 300,000.

In May, Virginia was one of only three states whose unemployment rate rose from the prior month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state is still adding jobs each month, albeit at a slower pace than last year, and Virginia's 3.4% unemployment rate in May was still below the national average. But the slowdown — and the fact that many of the federal job cuts have yet to be reflected in the official numbers — concerns University of Virginia economist Eric Scorsone, Executive Director of the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service.

"Virginia has been an economy, historically, that is pretty resilient," he said. "But now, we're seeing something quite different, where Virginia is seeing some job losses, or at least job stagnation, whereas the nation as a whole is still creating jobs."

The Center's most recent forecast, published in April, calls for the state to lose 32,000 jobs this year, with the job losses accelerating as the year goes on.

While Scorsone said those job losses will occur primarily in the federal sector, he also sees a ripple effect.

"Things like leisure and accommodations," he said. "As people lose jobs, they're going to spend less on those things, [and] maybe in retail," he added.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, says the state can absorb those federal job cuts.

In February, the state launched a web site, VirginiaHasJobs.com, targeting displaced workers with job listings and other resources from across the state.

"We have 250,000 open jobs posted that are unfilled. And so, there's a great opportunity for folks to find a new opportunity, new job, new career," Youngkin said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" on April 15.

A recent check of the site showed that the number of openings has shrunk to 199,000 as jobs have been filled and private sector hiring has slowed. That still would appear to be more than enough for the federal workers likely to be displaced. But Scorsone said it is not that simple.

"Virginia's federal workforce is different than, say, other states. Our workforce tends to be highly educated, professional executive level," he said. "Many of the jobs that are open may be in different sectors, like health care. You can't just easily move into a health care job if that's not your area of expertise," he added.

In his CNBC appearance in April, Youngkin acknowledged the likelihood that the state will lose jobs, and that the private sector alternatives will not be an exact fit for many displaced government employees.

"Listen, they're not perfect matches," he said. "They're high paying, good jobs that require someone to possibly get some retraining or re-skilling, or go into a new field, but they're really good jobs."

 Youngkin said the budget cuts, and job losses, are necessary. "We need to rein in spending and re-establish fiscal reality back into the federal government," he said, adding that Virginia goes into the upheaval from a position of strength. "We're seeing record surpluses in our budgets. We're able to use those surpluses to reduce taxes and invest in education and law enforcement and other investments in business development," Youngkin said.

Indeed, Virginia is still a business powerhouse, with the top Education ranking in the CNBC study, and the second best rating for Infrastructure.

Over time, no state has performed better than Virginia in the CNBC rankings. The state has taken top honors six times since the project began in 2007.

But in 2025, with economic anxiety rising, Virginia's economic situation is just shaky enough to take it down a few pegs.

London-listed mining firms bounced on Thursday, shaking off recent losses to drive the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index to a record high as investors assessed the impact of 50% U.S. copper tariffs and stronger Chinese economic data.

Anglo American shares were 5% higher at midday in London, with Rio Tinto and Glencore both up 4.5% and Antofagasta up 3%.

The gains come amid turbulence in the copper market, where prices are at a record high and the premium paid by U.S. buyers over those in the rest of the world is soaring, following this week's unexpected announcement that 50% U.S. duties will be introduced on Aug. 1 — at the top end of expectations.

The news is mixed for the mining giants, which have large operations in key U.S. copper export locations such as Chile, with uncertainty over supply and demand dynamics massively elevated. A broad price spike may be beneficial to producers in the short-term, according to Hargreaves Lansdown's head of money and markets, Susannah Streeter. 

However, the main beneficiaries of higher U.S. copper prices are its major domestic mining companies which sell on Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) pricing, according to analysts, which are set to see higher realized revenues.

The U.S. imports just under half its copper, and is widely considered unlikely to be able to ramp up production enough to significantly alter that mix in the short-term, putting continued pressure on prices.

It has been a rough year so far for Europe-listed mining firms, which saw the worst performance among Stoxx 600 sectors in the first half, even as commodities such as gold have rallied. Shares have pulled back from their April lows, but firms including Rio Tinto are down in the year-to-date as poor weather disrupted operations.

The companies are sensitive to expectations for global growth, which have been dented this year by U.S. tariff uncertainty, along with economic signals from resource-hungry China.

Maurizio Carulli, global energy and mining analyst at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC on Thursday that mining gains were being supported by data showing a rise in Chinese construction machinery sales, a key indicator for the Chinese economy.

News on Wednesday that some members of the U.S. Federal Reserve's voting committee expect interest rate cuts to be appropriate later this year is also positive for the sector, he said.

"Finally, there has been somewhat of a technical rebound after the [mining] sector showed a bit of weakness yesterday," Carulli added.

Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, flagged wider market talk of a "potential new wave of government stimulus in China," with any support for its giant property sector leading to greater commodities demand.

"Second is a weaker dollar, as that makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper to buy with other currencies," Coatsworth told CNBC. The U.S. dollar index was slightly lower Thursday, continuing its recent sensitivity to tariff updates.

Coatsworth said that stock markets were meanwhile broadly in a risk-on mood, shrugging off a slew of updates on national tariffs largely viewed as "noise and not facts."

"Trump is throwing out numbers left, right and centre, and investors have begun to dismiss anything that isn't set in stone... that means a shift in focus back to economic data and corporate news flow as key drivers for markets," he said.

Optimism appears to be high among European traders that the EU and White House will strike a framework trade deal before the end of the week.

The Defense Department will become the largest shareholder in rare earth miner MP Materials after agreeing to buy $400 million of its preferred stock, the company said Thursday.

MP Materials owns the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S. at Mountain Pass, California, about 60 miles outside Las Vegas. Proceeds from the Pentagon investment will be used to expand MP's rare earths processing capacity and magnet production, the company said.

Shares of MP Materials were last up about 50% on the news.

Rare earths are used in magnets that are key components in a range of military weapons systems including the F-35 warplane, drones and submarines, according to the Defense Department.

The U.S. was almost entirely dependent on foreign countries for rare earths in 2023, with China representing about 70% of imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Rare earths have been a central point of contention in recent trade disputes between the U.S. and China.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in April that the Trump administration was considering making direct equity investments in critical mineral companies to break U.S. dependence on China.

MP Materials CEO James Litinsky described the Pentagon investment as a public-private partnership that will speed the buildout of an end-to-end rare earth magnet supply chain in the U.S.

"I want to be very clear, this is not a nationalization," Litinsky told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Thursday. "We remain a thriving public company. We now have a great new partner in our economically largest shareholder, DoD, but we still control our company. We control our destiny. We're shareholder driven."

U.S. miners are facing a unique threat from "Chinese mercantilism," Litinsky said. The Pentagon investment in MP could serve as a model for similar deals with other U.S. companies, the CEO said.

"It's a new way forward to accelerate free markets, to get the supply chain on shore that we want and make sure that mercantilism is not going to hurt our ability to do so," Litinsky said.

The Pentagon is buying a newly created class of preferred shares convertible into MP Materials' common stock, in addition to a warrant convertible at $30.03 a share for 10 years that allows the U.S. to buy additional common stock.

Exercising the convertible preferred shares and the warrant would leave the Pentagon holding about a 15% stake in MP Materials as of July 9, nearly twice the 8.61% held by Litinsky and the 8.27% held by BlackRock Fund Advisors, according to FactSet data.

MP Materials will build its second magnet manufacturing facility in the U.S. to serve defense and commercial customers with support from the Pentagon. The facility, whose location wasn't disclosed, is expected to start commissioning in 2028 and will bring MP Materials rare earth magnet manufacturing capacity to 10,000 metric tons annually.

This manufacturing capacity is enough to "meaningfully support U.S. defense and commercial needs," Litinsky told investors on a call Thursday morning.

The Pentagon has agreed to buy 100% of the magnets made at the new facility, called 10X, for 10 years after the plant is built to support defense needs and the commercial market. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are providing $1 billion to help finance the manufacturing facility.

The Pentagon is also guaranteeing a minimum price of $110 per kilogram for 10 years for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, or NdPr, that is stockpiled or sold by MP Materials. NdPr is a rare earth compound used to make permanent magnets.

If the market price is below $110 per kilogram, the U.S. will pay MP Materials the difference in a quarterly cash payment, Litinsky said. The Pentagon, in turn, will receive 30% of the upside above $110 per kilogram once MP Materials' second magnet facility is operational, the CEO said.

The Defense Department negotiated a very tough deal, Litinsky said. "The taxpayers are going to make a lot of money," the CEO said.

MP Materials also expects to receive a $150 million loan in 30 days from the Pentagon to expand its rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.

Delta Air Lines reinstated its 2025 profit outlook Thursday and said it expects a stronger summer travel season than Wall Street anticipated.

Bookings have stabilized after a drop in demand earlier this year, CEO Ed Bastian said in an interview, though at lower levels than the airline forecast at the start of the 2025.

Delta shares rose 11%. Shares in other airlines, which report results later this month, also rose after Delta's report.

Delta expects adjusted full-year earnings of $5.25 to $6.25 a share, down from a forecast in January of more than $7.35 a share, when Bastian predicted 2025 would be the carrier's best year ever.

In April, Delta said it couldn't reaffirm that forecast as on-again, off-again tariffs and hesitant consumers dented bookings. Rival U.S. carriers also pulled their guidance, and Delta and other airlines have announced plans to cut flights after the summer peak. Bastian said the passage of the tax and spending bill and the Trump administration rolling out more trade deals with "less rhetoric and more action" are giving customers more clarity and confidence.

"People are still traveling," Bastian said. "What they've done is they've shifted their booking patterns a little bit. They're holding off making plans until they're a little closer in to their travel dates. And so that's shifted some of our bookings and yield management strategies."

That includes trimming capacity outside of top travel periods, as well as what Bastian described as "surgical" cuts after the peak summer travel season ends around mid-August.

Here's how the company performed in the three months ended June 30, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on consensus estimates from LSEG:

Delta, the first of the U.S. airlines to report results for the three months ended June 30, expects adjusted earnings per share of between $1.25 and $1.75 in the third quarter, compared with Wall Street analysts' forecast for $1.31 a share. It also said it expects revenue that's flat to up 4%, topping forecasts for a 1.4% sales increase.

Delta posted strong growth from sales of higher-priced seats like first class and from its lucrative American Express partnership, which increased 10% in the second quarter from the same period last year to $2 billion. Airlines have become more reliant on travelers who are willing to spend more to fly rather than more price-sensitive consumers.

Corporate travel has also stabilized as Bastian said businesses have more clarity and confidence than they did earlier this year, but it's in line with last year, not the 5% to 10% growth Delta expected at the start of the year.

While fares have dropped across the U.S., Delta's premium-product revenue rose 5%, as sales from the main cabin fell 5% from last year. Its total revenue per seat mile, a measure of how much an airline is bringing in for the amount it flies, fell 4% in the second quarter.

Bastian said Delta is prepared to continue updating its premium products.

"Whether it's the Delta lounges or the quality of the product on board, the premium products have had life cycles … and what we thought was state of the art six or seven years ago no longer is," he said. "We're continuing to upgrade and update it."

Delta has been working for years to tamp down overcrowding and long lines at Delta's popular airport Sky Clubs by building larger lounges and spaces dedicated to its top-tier Delta One cabin travelers, as well as with visit limits and other policies.

Delta's president, Glen Hauenstein, said the airline expects to have "almost all" of the crowding problems resolved in the next 18 to 24 months, though he noted that one challenge is that bad weather like thunderstorms that can spark hourslong delays.

"You can't build a club big enough for lengthy delays," he said on an earnings call with analysts. "So I think we're trying to look at alternatives that we can use as overflow in those instances."

Hauenstein reiterated that more customers are choosing to take European vacations after the traditional peak summer months to avoid heat waves, crowds and high hotel rates.

In the second quarter, Delta posted adjusted revenue of nearly $15.51 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Its net income in the three months ended June 30 totaled $2.13 billion, or $3.27 a share, up 63% on the year. That compares with net income of $1.3 billion, or $2.01 a share, in the same period last year. Adjusting for one-time items, its per-share net income was $1.37 billion, or $2.10 a share.

As the AI talent wars rage on, Google and other tech giants are shelling out top dollar to lure top talent.

Google has long been revered within Silicon Valley for its generous compensation packages, and its DeepMind unit even resorted to aggressive noncompetes in the UK.

At the same time, Google has made changes to its compensation processes in recent months as others in the tech industry — such as Meta and Microsoft — have sought to weed out low performers.

In April, the search giant changed the way it ranked employees in their yearly performance reviews. Its head of compensation told staff in a memo that "high performance is more important than ever," Business Insider previously reported.

While Google keeps salary data confidential, publicly available work-visa data can provide a glimpse into how much it pays for certain roles. The figures are derived from filings that all companies submit to the Labor Department to obtain work visas for foreign workers.

Google employs thousands of software engineers through this process, and according to the data, they can command salaries as high as $340,000.

It's worth noting that these figures reflect only salaries and don't account for the equity or bonuses that Google employees also receive.

In 2023, BI obtained an internal spreadsheet where thousands of Googlers self-reported their 2022 pay, including some equity and bonus data. Despite the relatively high sums, many said they still felt underpaid.

Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Here's what Google is paying across key roles, based on roughly 6,800 applications from the first quarter of 2025.

The Faroe Islands are rolling out road trips for travelers looking to explore beyond the usual hot spots.

The catch? Visitors don't know where the trips will take them.  

The Danish archipelago's tourism board, Visit Faroe Islands, on Tuesday launched 30 itineraries that take travelers on self-guided driving tours. The tours are accessible via phone, but each stop is kept secret throughout the journey.  

"You never know where you're going to end up, and none of the routes are published," said Marta Karadottir, the organization's content and communications manager. "We're trying to keep that kind of curiosity alive with travelers … [and] make traveling a little bit more unpredictable."

Travelers follow a designated route that ensures no other travelers show up at the same destination at the same time, according to a press release.

"We really want people to get that sense of … other-worldly places where you're alone and with nature," Karadottir said.

Journeys take visitors to small villages, lesser-known restaurants and lookout points, where travelers can stop, hike and spend time, according to a press release. Some of the itineraries take travelers from one island to another via ferry too, Karadottir said.

Each trip takes between three and six hours, depending on how long travelers want to spend at each stop, she said.

Trips, however, come with one caveat. Travelers must commit to completing the entire route, without deviating to popular tourist spots, she said.  

"Instead of queuing up to take that one iconic picture, why not go to a place that's right next to it that you wouldn't know of … that is just as equally stunning," she said. "When you let go, you get surprised by something more beautiful, or something more real."  

The guided trips, dubbed "Auto Odyssey," can be taken in travelers' own cars or via rented vehicles, starting at around $100 per day. Bookings can be made through Visit Faroe Islands.

Cradled between Iceland and Scotland, the Faroe Islands are known for their dramatic landscapes and off-grid appeal. The archipelago's population of 55,000 live on most of its 18 major islands, with 40% living in the capital city of Tórshavn, according to a governmental website.

Visitors can get to the Faroe Islands by taking a ferry from Iceland or Denmark, or by flying from mainland Europe, according to Visit Faroe Islands.

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Thursday as traders assessed the Bank of Korea's decision to keep rates steady, as well as U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement to slap a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports beginning August 1.

Trump also said Wednesday that the 50% tariff on copper imports, which he had announced the previous day, will take effect on Aug. 1. Here are today's market highlights:

Asia markets closed mostly mixed on Thursday.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.44% to close at 39,646.36, while the Topix declined 0.56% to end the trading day at 2,812.34.

Mainland China's CSI 300 rose 0.47% to 4,010.02.

JPMorgan is turning more positive on Vietnam stocks after the country's trade deal announcement with the U.S., upgrading its position to overweight. This comes after Vietnam became the first Southeast Asian nation to strike a tariff deal with the U.S. at a 20% rate.

"This, combined with strong economic growth (2Q25 GDP near 8%), prompts us to upgrade Vietnam to [overweight] within ASEAN, with a new VN-Index base/bull target of 1,500/1,600 by year end," analysts led by the bank's Khoi Vu wrote in a research note.

The Vietnam Index was trading 0.78% higher at 1,442.29 as of Thursday, 12.45 p.m. local time.

Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index scaled to another new high Thursday, notching its fourth straight day of gains.

The country's equities climbed 0.47% to hit a fresh record of 4,077.41 points Thursday as of 11.24 a.m., data from LSEG showed.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the 50% tariff on copper imports, which he had announced the previous day, will take effect on Aug. 1.

The decision was made after he received a national security assessment, Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

"I am announcing a 50% TARIFF on Copper, effective August 1, 2025, after receiving a robust NATIONAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT," Trump wrote.

"Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many. Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense."

South Korea's central bank held its policy rate at 2.5%, keeping it steady at an almost three-year low.

South Korea's economy contracted by 0.2% quarter on quarter in the first three months of this year due to weak construction activity and softening export growth, while it remained flat on an year on year basis.

Just this morning Singapore time, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the 50% tariff on copper imports, which he announced earlier on Tuesday, will begin on Aug. 1.

On Wednesday, Trump posted a fresh slate of tariff letters on goods from at least seven more countries, including Mexico, the no. 1 importer of goods to the U.S., Philippines, Brunei and Sri Lanka. 

But the president took a few steps further with Brazil by threatening a 50% tariff on the country. This is partly in response to the ongoing trial of his vocal ally Jair Bolsonaro over the role of Brazil's former president in an alleged coup to overturn his 2022 reelection loss.

The 50% tariff on Brazil marks the largest duties rate that the White House has imposed on its trading partners in the recent round of new levies, which are set to begin on Aug. 1. 

But it appears that investors have decided to approach Trump's tariffs by not responding at all. They seem to have shifted their focus away from tariff developments and instead rekindled their appetite for artificial intelligence.

On Wednesday, traders boosted shares of Nvidia, causing the company to be the first in the world to touch a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Other major tech names also rose, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet.

New tariff developments. Trump revealed updated tariff rates on the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Iraq, Libya and Sri Lanka, via screenshots on Truth Social. The 50% duty on copper imports is set to kick in on Aug. 1.

U.S. stocks rise as investor appetite for AI rekindles. On Wednesday stateside, all three major U.S. benchmarks were up. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.94% to close at a new high of 20,611.34. Singapore stocks hit a new high for a fourth consecutive day amid mixed trading in Asia-Pacific markets Thursday.

Bank of Korea keeps rates steady. The central bank stood pat on its policy rate at 2.5% Thursday as it assessed the impact of recent measures to cool the property market. Housing prices in Seoul spiked over 19% in June on an annualized basis, according to Goldman Sachs.

Most Fed officials see rate cuts coming, but are split on how many. Officials saw tariff-induced inflation pressures as potentially "temporary and modest" while economic growth and hiring could weaken, minutes from the June 17-18 meeting released Wednesday showed.

[PRO] Potential in UK stocks despite weak economy. An asset manager sees opportunities in the London market that are "hard to ignore," picking three stocks that he thinks are undervalued.

Linda Yaccarino steps down as CEO of Elon Musk's X

Linda Yaccarino on Wednesday announced she is stepping down as CEO of Elon Musk's social media site X after two years in the role. Her departure comes one day after Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok repeatedly made antisemitic comments and referenced Hitler in response to posts about the Texas flooding.

Yaccarino did not give a reason for her departure, but her exit had been in the works for more than a week, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News.

[PRO] AI is still reigning over the market. Chipmaker Nvidia briefly passed $4 trillion in market value on Wednesday, the first company ever to do so. Being the world's most valuable company is not a sign of permanent superiority. But Wall Street sees more potential in Nvidia. 

The hidden drag on China's economy

Falling real estate prices are the elephant in the room when it comes to China's economy. Even as authorities have tried to address the financial risks, the property market is far from rebounding.

The impact of the property slump has continued to weigh on consumer sentiment and real estate-related industries. It's a perfect storm of events weighing on China's economy, even without a trade war.

Tesla risks violating a corporate governance rule in Texas, and shareholders are sounding the alarm.

The EV maker, which was incorporated in the state of Texas in 2024 after leaving Delaware, has yet to schedule its annual shareholder meeting, which by state law must occur within 13 months of the last one.

ForTesla, that deadline is Sunday, July 13.

In a letter obtained by Business Insider sent four days ahead of the deadline, a group of investors managing $1.5 trillion in collective assets is demanding that Tesla publicly announce an "Annual General Meeting" date, disclose access details, and give shareholders "sufficient time and information to engage meaningfully in the governance process." "This lack of transparency raises serious concerns about the company's respect for shareholder rights," the letter said. "As fiduciaries, we believe strong corporate governance and responsive board oversight are foundational to long-term company success."

The letter is signed by 27 shareholders, including multiple large pension funds and state treasurers, such as New York City Comptroller Brad S. Lander, Oregon State Treasurer Elizabeth Steiner, and State of Maryland Comptroller Brooke E. Lierman. International funds from Denmark and Sweden, such as the Friends Fiduciary Corporation, a Quaker-aligned investment firm, have also signed on.

The letter and Tesla's impending deadline were first reported by the New York Times.

Kevin Thomas, CEO of Shareholder Association for Research and Education, the main signatory of the letter, told Business Insider that he has yet to hear back from Tesla.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Thomas, in charge of the Canada-based advocacy group that advises funds with $150 billion in assets, told BI that corporations usually provide notice at least two weeks ahead of a meeting, but Tesla has yet to do so "as the clock starts to tick."

"We definitely are concerned about the global drop in sales, the share prices tanking, and the CEO's attention span," Thomas said. "So that's why we want to have the meeting, not just because we like going to meetings, but because we actually think there are things that need to be discussed with shareholders in a transparent and accountable way."

"I'll just say this, that shareholders shouldn't have to rely on courts to enforce basic rights," Thomas added of Tesla. "We've invested in it for a good reason, and as its returns and its sales and its performance tips, now is the time to intervene."

Texas' Business Organization Code states that a court in the county where the company's principal executive office is located "may order a meeting to be held" if the company fails to hold the meeting or obtain written consent within a 13-month period. For Tesla, that would be Travis County, where its Gigafactory Texas is located.

Tesla now has four days left to schedule a meeting, or the shareholders can take matters to a judge, who could compel a meeting.

Tesla moved its headquarters to Texas from California in late 2021 after CEO Elon Musk expressed dissatisfaction with the Golden State's COVID-19 policies and housing costs for employees. The official incorporation of the company also moved to Texas from Delaware after a state court invalidated Musk's pay package, which was worth $56 billion at the time.

Tesla shares are down nearly 40% compared to their peak in December 2024, and down around 30% since President Donald Trump's inauguration day. The EV giant also saw declining sales over the first two quarters of 2025.

Analysts have recently written that investors are "growing tired" of Musk's political activities, which are seen as a distraction from his company. This follows the billionaire's public split from Trump and his recent announcement of a new political party.

Oops, something went wrong

Ant Group may be gearing up for a major move into regulated cryptoand it's picking a hot partner to get there. People familiar say Jack Ma-backed Ant is working with Circle to bring its USDC stablecoin onto Ant's blockchain platform, pending U.S. compliance. The integration would mark a meaningful step for Circle (NYSE:CRCL), which just went public in June and is already up over 500%. With regulators beginning to draw clearer lines around stablecoins, this tie-up could be an early signal of how traditional fintech giants are planning to plug into tokenized paymentscautiously, but decisively.

Circle's USDC could serve as a bridge for Ant's cross-border ambitions. Ant International processed over $1 trillion in global transactions last year, and a third of that flowed through its blockchain. The company is reportedly pursuing stablecoin licenses in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourgadding a layer of credibility and compliance to its crypto push. Behind the scenes, Ant has already signed deals with major players like JPMorgan, HSBC, and BNP Paribas to support tokenized assets on its network. Its growing treasury business, especially through Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) e-commerce ecosystem, is quietly becoming a high-value anchor in this evolution.

There's also an IPO narrative developing. Ant International, which generated close to $3 billion in revenue in 2024 and has now logged two straight years of adjusted profit, could be lining up for a Hong Kong listing. Estimates suggest a potential valuation between $8 billion and $24 billion. If Circle's integration goes live and Ant wins the licenses it's chasing, that could reshape how investors view both the company's blockchain monetization strategy and the broader adoption arc for regulated crypto assets.

With many altcoins competing for attention, it's easy to miss the ones actually gaining real progress. But if you're searching for the top altcoins to buy now, a few clearly stand apart. These are not just trending names, but projects showing steady development, future launches, growing networks, and well-structured presales. From new technical models to builder tools and updated staking options, each is showing clear movement forward.

Whether your focus is on technology, timing, or potential growth, the four mentioned here are worth a detailed look. BlockDAG comes first with a growing presale and new mining tools. Following that, Arbitrum, Sui, and Aave bring their own strong features to the table. Here's how they compare.

BlockDAG is gaining traction through a unique Layer 1 design that uses both Proof-of-Work and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) models. This lets many blocks be built and confirmed at the same time, helping the system move faster without losing its core structure.

Its PHANTOM and GHOSTDAG systems manage consensus in a way that handles more transactions than older chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It also works fully with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, so developers can bring over their dApps or create new ones. For users without coding skills, a no-code tool helps them launch NFTs or tokens. This system is already active on the testnet.

Right now, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gearing up for its GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. Until then, the price has been locked at $0.0016. So far, more than $335 million has been raised across 29 batches, and over 23.7 billion BDAG have been sold. The expected listing price is $0.05, which suggests a gain of more than 3,025% from today's rate.

With over 2 million mobile users mining through the X1 app and deliveries of the X30 and X100 miner kits already started, BlockDAG has built a network that is wide and reward-focused. For those searching for the top altcoin to buy now, BlockDAG stands out for its low entry point, growing reach, and use across the board.

Arbitrum is quietly building its role as a leading Layer 2 project. Its recent growth reflects this progress, with total value locked rising by 60% this quarter and nearly 2.4 million active DeFi users now on the network. In addition, Robinhood is adding Arbitrum to power 24/7 tokenized stock trading in Europe, and Gemini is offering MicroStrategy shares on-chain through Arbitrum. This kind of real-world link remains rare.

ARB trades near $0.33 and shows space to shift. Its RSI sits near 48, meaning it's neither overbought nor oversold. CoinCodex and Changelly suggest a possible short-term range of $0.32 to $0.50, depending on how it performs against the 50-day moving average. With both fast transaction scaling and growing real-world adoption, ARB stands as a strong option among the top altcoins to buy now.

Sui has bounced back this month after falling below $2.70 in early June. It now trades near $2.92 following Lion Group's $600 million treasury backing, which helped the price climb 15% in under a week. Even more notable is the rise in project activity, with developer growth up 54% over the past two years and aggregator traffic up 19% in June.

Sui has also released new NFT and GameFi protocols, which are attracting more user activity. Unlocks are being phased in, with 44 million SUI released on July 1, helping to limit impact on price. Analysts expect a short-term range of $3.10 to $3.50, with longer-term targets close to $7. Whether the focus is on digital assets, builder tools, or steady returns, Sui is gaining traction again and is a key pick among the top altcoins to buy now.

Aave is gaining attention again with the rollout of its V4 update. The improvements include a shared liquidity model, better liquidation methods, flexible risk settings, and stronger support for the GHO stablecoin. It also brings multichain growth and lower gas fees to help keep Aave ahead in the DeFi space.

AAVE trades around $277.94 after hitting $311 in mid-June. Though still below recent highs, it has room to grow as development moves forward. DAO activity, including a proposed Chaos Labs extension and a planned AAVE buyback, is also adding confidence. CoinCodex shows targets between $314 and $358 in July, with longer-term forecasts near $650. For those focused on DeFi and consistent upgrades, Aave remains a top choice in the list of top altcoins to buy now.

In today's fast-changing market, finding the top altcoins to buy now means focusing on actual use, clear growth, and strong entry prices. BlockDAG holds a $0.0016 presale price and a future listing at $0.05, while its upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release is drawing attention. 

Arbitrum is expanding with traditional finance while growing its DeFi base. Sui is building momentum following its treasury support. Aave is preparing for the next stage of DeFi growth with V4 updates.

Each coin here has clear strengths, whether in community reach, tech roadmap, or user growth. If you're planning your moves for late 2025, these four names offer focused paths worth tracking.

Bitcoin BTC$110,770.05 clinched a fresh record high above $113,000 on Thursday, attempting to break away from the range it has been trading in for months.

The largest and oldest cryptocurrency hit $113,313 during the U.S. session, CoinDesk price data shows. It was up 3.7% over the past 24 hours.

The new record comes less than a day after it briefly topped $112,000 on some exchanges, then retreated below $111,000 in the later hours. 

Bitcoin's rally to new highs was buoyed by strong inflows into ETFs, relentless corporate adoption by crypto treasury companies and an increasingly favorable regulatory climate, Gerry O'Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex, said in a note.

"While the macro environment will continue to remain uncertain, we believe the bull market is far from over and new catalysts, including more institutional platforms allowing access to bitcoin, may help drive the price of BTC to $140,000 or higher this year," he said.

The broader crypto market was also climbing higher on Thursday. Ethereum's ether ETH$2,782.62 topped $2,800 and was up more than 5%, while XRP XRP$2.4237 gained 3.5%. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index advanced 3.4% to its strongest level since May.

UPDATE (July 10, 17:15 UTC): Updates prices.

Jack Dorsey has launched the beta version of an app that is being seen as quite radical and (potentially) groundbreaking — Bitchat. It lets you send/receive Bitcoin and chat with other users entirely offline, without requiring an internet connection. This quick guide explores the new app, including its underlying technology, whether it packs enough punch to revolutionize crypto, potential vulnerabilities, and other key details.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
➤ Bitchat enables encrypted Bitcoin and message transfers using Bluetooth, with no internet or mobile network required.
➤ Messages relay across a Bluetooth mesh network with no central servers, accounts, or permanent identifiers involved.
➤ Reliability depends on user density, with no delivery confirmations or routing logic in the current beta version.
➤ However, Bitchat does not function as a wallet or signing tool, the transactions are only delivered if a relay device eventually connects to the internet and broadcasts them.

Bitchat is an offline, encrypted chat app that uses Bluetooth mesh networking to relay messages without internet, servers, accounts, emails, or phone numbers.

Under the hood, Bitchat creates a peer-to-peer Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh network among devices. Every smartphone running Bitchat acts as both a client and a relay node, and each passes along encrypted messages to extend beyond the usual 30-meter Bluetooth range.

In essence, your messages can hop from your phone to the next, and so on – automatically multi-hopping up to seven times – to reach a faraway recipient without requiring any internet infrastructure. This offline-first design directly addresses one of the oldest criticisms of Bitcoin.

“'What if the electricity goes out' is a common concern of Bitcoin skeptics. Jack Dorsey's Bitchat solves the problem with cheap, easily sourced mesh nets,” Bitcoin pioneer Max Keiser told BeInCrypto.

Dorsey likened the system to old-school IRC chatrooms, but with modern encryption and no central servers. You also do not need to create an account, and neither do you need cell network coverage.

my weekend project to learn about bluetooth mesh networks, relays and store and forward models, message encryption models, and a few other things.bitchat: bluetooth mesh chat…IRC vibes.TestFlight: https://t.co/P5zRRX0TB3GitHub: https://t.co/Yphb3Izm0P pic.twitter.com/yxZxiMfMH2

When you open the app, it generates an ephemeral ID for your device (which can even change each session for privacy). You can join chat “rooms” labeled with hashtags or message individuals directly. 

All messages are protected with end-to-end encryption so that only the intended recipients can read them. For instance, even if someone intercepts the Bluetooth signal, the content supposedly remains gibberish without the decryption key.

Bitchat also uses a “store-and-forward” feature to handle offline devices. For example, if your friend's phone is off or out of range, your message can be cached on an intermediate node and delivered once they come back online (within the mesh).

Bitchat supports relaying pre-signed Bitcoin transactions, but only as encrypted data packets. It does not generate or sign transactions, and it does not broadcast them to the Bitcoin network. Users must create and sign transactions using a separate Bitcoin wallet, then use Bitchat to pass the signed transaction data from device to device via Bluetooth.

The Bitcoin transaction is not finalized — and does not appear on the blockchain — until it is broadcast by a device with internet access and accepted into the Bitcoin mempool. 

Notably, BitChat keeps these messages only in device memory (no cloud storage), so once delivered or expired, they are permanently deleted. So, while this feature will definitely woo privacy-focused users, it can also be a double-edged sword if you were to retrieve an old message.

The app also features a few other useful additions. For instance, you can create password-protected group chats for sensitive discussions, with room names acting as access hashtags. 

The app utilizes broadcast beacons and temporary “mesh hubs” to detect nearby devices and coordinate message passing. There's even mention of a “panic mode” that could let you wipe all messages quickly (a nod to activists under threat). 

The protocol running at the core of Bitchat relies on a custom binary format over BLE advertisements and connections. It uses a compressed header structure, message deduplication, and fragmentation to handle short payloads efficiently. 

Devices scan for beacons and periodically establish encrypted connections to exchange queued messages. Each user is identified by a public key-derived ID that changes frequently to enhance anonymity. 

Bitchat uses end-to-end encryption using X25519 for key exchange and AES-GCM for message encryption. Message metadata (like sender/recipient IDs) is encrypted as well, meaning only the intended recipient can see who a message is from.

The Bitchat whitepaper underlines that the app supports dummy traffic — randomized, encrypted packets — to improve privacy. These dummy packets look identical to real messages, which makes it harder for anyone to distinguish real conversations from decoys. 

The app stores undelivered messages in memory (not disk) for up to 12 hours, or longer for marked “favorites.” Messages are deleted once delivered or expired. There's no global routing, which essentially means that delivery is probabilistic and relies on node density and movement.

Another crucial aspect is the app's impact on the host device's battery cycle. The Bitchat whitepaper assures users on that front, saying that battery consumption is minimized through duty cycling, adaptive scan intervals, and automatic power-saving during inactivity. The protocol supports both foreground and background operations on iOS and Android.

Bitchat's biggest limitation is its dependence on proximity. It works best when many users are nearby, like at protests or festivals. However, in remote or low-density areas, messages may never find a path out. Bluetooth range is short, and even with seven-hop relaying, the effective reach will likely stay very limited.

Another concern is reliability. At launch, Bitchat lacks delivery confirmations. So, if you send a message or Bitcoin transaction, you won't know if it was received unless the recipient replies through some other channel. And with no routing logic, the mesh can get flooded in dense environments, which would risk delays or message loss.

Security-wise, while encryption appears solid, Bluetooth itself can be jammed or spammed. Attackers, in theory, could flood the mesh with junk messages or block signals entirely. The app also relies on someone eventually having internet access to broadcast Bitcoin transactions. 

Put simply, without a connected node or satellite link, the transfer stays local and incomplete.

Bandwidth could be another substantial bottleneck to overcome — Bluetooth is fine for texts, not for anything heavier.

To cut a long story short, Bitchat will likely work best as a backup tool in edge cases in its early days instead of being a mainstream alternative to messaging or Bitcoin transfers.

In short, yes! 

While Bitchat's ability to relay Bitcoin transactions offline has grabbed headlines, its broader value lies in offline communication. 

For instance, in natural disasters, democratic protests, or internet shutdowns, you can use the app to share information with nearby devices without needing cell towers or Wi-Fi. This makes it a potential lifeline in emergencies — whether you are coordinating rescue efforts, sending location details, or simply staying in touch.

With some planning, Bitchat's design could potentially also benefit people in remote regions with weak infrastructure. For example, schools, field teams, or aid workers could use it to exchange messages without relying on costly or unreliable networks. And because it runs on everyday smartphones using Bluetooth, there's no need for special gear. 

So, all these factors considered, Bitchat can evolve with time to serve as a secure, local communication layer in places or situations where traditional networks break down.

The potential impact, in theory at least, is huge. Offline Bitcoin transfers could make crypto more usable during emergencies and major power outages. 

It could also push mainstream wallets and apps to consider offline-capable designs. While earlier projects like goTenna and LochaMesh explored similar ideas, Bitchat is one of the first, if not the first, to deliver this in a mobile app that can run on regular smartphones. And with Jack Dorsey behind it, Bitchat will likely draw far more credibility and visibility (as we are already witnessing). 

So, even though it might not bring a radical change overnight, Bitchat could mark the early stages of a shift where your ability to use crypto no longer depends on centralized infrastructure. And more importantly, where you stay in control, even when the internet isn't.

Bitchat is a peer-to-peer messaging app that operates entirely offline using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It creates a mesh network where each device acts as a relay and forwards encrypted messages up to seven hops. There are no servers, accounts, or internet connections involved. The app uses strong encryption and ephemeral IDs for privacy and security.

Yes, Bitchat allows you to transfer signed Bitcoin transactions over Bluetooth to nearby devices in its mesh. Once the transaction reaches a phone with internet access, it can be broadcast to the Bitcoin network. This method doesn't require cell service or Wi-Fi, making it ideal for emergencies or regions with poor connectivity. However, delivery is not guaranteed unless a relay eventually connects to the internet. The app doesn't yet support native Bitcoin wallet functions at launch — it simply transports raw data.

Bitchat uses end-to-end encryption with X25519 key exchange and AES-GCM for message confidentiality and integrity. Message metadata, such as sender and recipient IDs, is also encrypted. The app supports dummy traffic to mask real communication patterns. However, it lacks delivery confirmations as of early-July 2025 and is still in beta. Users should treat it as a privacy-focused tool, but not yet a fail-safe system for critical transfers.

Bitchat's effectiveness depends on local user density since it relies on short-range Bluetooth and device-to-device relaying. In low-density areas, messages may not reach their destination. It also lacks routing optimization and delivery acknowledgments, which can affect reliability. Bluetooth bandwidth is limited, so the app is suitable only for text and small data payloads. An internet-connected device is still required to finalize Bitcoin transactions on-chain.

Oops, something went wrong

FRISCO, TX, United States of America, July 10th, 2025, Chainwire



1,818.84 Ethereum Acquired at a Weighted Average Price of $2,749 per Ethereum 

Over-Allotment Option Exercised, Bringing Total Gross Proceeds to $9.2 Million from Recent Offering

GameSquare Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: GAME) (the “Company” or “GameSquare”) a next-generation media, entertainment, and technology company, today announced it has completed a $5 million purchase of Ethereum (ETH), acquiring approximately 1,818.84 ETH at a weighted average price of $2,749 per ETH. This marks the first deployment under the Company's $100 million Ethereum treasury authorization, aimed at building a differentiated, crypto-native treasury management strategy.

“This marks an inflection point in GameSquare's strategic evolution as we activate our Ethereum-native treasury strategy,” said Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare. “In partnership with Dialectic and Ryan Zurrer, we are leveraging Medici, Dialectic's proprietary platform that combines machine learning, automated optimization, and multi-layered risk controls, to target best-in-class risk-adjusted yields of 8–14%, well above current staking benchmarks of 3–4%.”

The Company's ETH-focused treasury program is designed to generate sustainable, risk-adjusted yield through decentralized finance protocols and Ethereum ecosystem assets. Medici's platform is known for its advanced risk management and performance monitoring, making it a strong foundation for scalable treasury deployment.

In addition, GameSquare announced that Lucid Capital Markets, sole book-running manager for the Company's previously announced underwritten public offering, has exercised its full over-allotment option. Lucid purchased an additional 1,263,157 shares (or common stock equivalents) at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. This brings total gross proceeds from the offering to approximately $9.2 million, including $1.2 million from the over-allotment exercise, prior to deducting offering-related expenses.

“We're encouraged by the support from a high-caliber group of investors and decentralized finance leaders who share our long-term vision. With a $100 million ETH authorization in place and momentum building, we are committed to executing a disciplined, forward-looking strategy,” concluded Mr. Kenna.

Once fully implemented, GameSquare expects to allocate capital generated from this strategy to support additional ETH asset purchases, fund a potential share repurchase program or reinvest in the Company's growth initiatives.

German state-owned development bank NRW.BANK has issued a €100 million ($116.7m) blockchain-based bond, marking one of the largest public-sector moves yet into digital securities in Europe.

The two-year bond was issued on the Polygon blockchain and registered using the infrastructure of Cashlink Technologies, a BaFin-licensed crypto securities registrar. This is the first time NRW.BANK has issued a fully digital bond as a crypto security under Germany's Electronic Securities Act (eWpG), which allows bonds to exist entirely on blockchain networks without a physical certificate.

The issuance attracted participation from institutional investors, with Deutsche Bank, DZ BANK and DekaBank acting as joint lead managers. The strong demand highlights growing market appetite for tokenized financial instruments that promise faster settlement times, transparent recordkeeping and reduced administrative costs.

“This is more than a technical milestone. It's a signal that public financial institutions are ready to move beyond blockchain pilots and start integrating these systems at scale,” said Michael Duttlinger, CEO of Cashlink.

Germany's eWpG law, introduced in 2021, has paved the way for securities to be registered on distributed ledger technology systems, offering a legal framework for digital bond issuance in one of Europe's largest capital markets.

While blockchain bonds remain a small fraction of the overall bond market, recent moves by institutions like NRW.BANK suggest the infrastructure and regulatory frameworks are maturing. As more public issuers follow, it's a step toward reshaping how traditional capital markets operate in the digital era.

Shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the ether ETH$2,782.62 treasury strategy firm helmed by Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, slid 20% Thursday, extending a 40% drop from the previous day, as the company disclosed plans to raise up to $2 billion through a stock sale agreement.

The selloff comes on the heels of Bitmine closing a $250 million funding round and securing an at-the-market ATM$1.0085 stock offering deal with Cantor Fitzgerald and ThinkEquity, according to a Wednesday SEC filing. Cantor will act as the lead agent, selling shares directly into the market over time at the company's discretion.

The decline follows a parabolic run for Bitmine, which had surged 3,000% after announcing an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy and naming Fundstrat's Tom Lee as chairman of the board.

However, CoinDesk last week reported that the price action could mirror a similar arc seen with Sharplink Gaming (SBET), another ETH treasury play, whose stock skyrocketed then plunged 90% after early investors began selling.

BMNR is down 65% since the report.

 Ant Group is reportedly working with Circle to integrate USDC into its blockchain platform once the stablecoin achieves regulatory compliance. 

Jack Ma-backed Ant Group is reportedly working with USDC issuer Circle to bring the stablecoin to its blockchain, according to a Bloomberg report published Thursday, citing anonymous sources.

The report said Ant Group plans to incorporate USDC (USDC) into its blockchain after the stablecoin becomes compliant in the US. The timeline for the integration is unknown.

The news follows recent reports that Circle has applied to establish a national trust bank in the US that, among other responsibilities, would oversee the firm's USDC reserve on behalf of its US issuer. The US Senate also passed the stablecoin regulation bill, the GENIUS Act, in mid-June, which would provide legal clarity for stablecoin issuers.

Ant Group's interest in stablecoins is not new. Earlier this month, the firm collaborated with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com to lobby the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to approve Chinese yuan-based stablecoins.

Circle did not respond to a request for comment from Cointelegraph.

Ant Group — formerly Ant Financial and best known for operating the Alipay super-app — is the fintech affiliate of e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, backed by Jack Ma. The firm processes more than $1 trillion annually in payments and now operates treasury, cross-border settlement and tokenization services on its proprietary AntChain blockchain.

According to reports last month, Ant International plans to apply for stablecoin issuer licenses in Singapore and Hong Kong. At the end of last year, layer-1 blockchain Sui and Ant Digital were reported to be working together to tokenize real-world assets with a focus on assets in the environmental, social and governance space.

Circle has been expanding its global presence amid increasing regulatory clarity. With the GENIUS Act progressing through Congress and the rival STABLE Act reportedly sidelined, the company has launched several new initiatives.

On Tuesday, Circle partnered with major cryptocurrency exchange OKX to enhance liquidity for conversions of its USDC stablecoin to the US dollar with the launch of feeless conversions. Shares of Circle also became the largest weighting in VanEck's digital asset corporate index in late June.

In mid-June, Coinbase Derivatives partnered with clearinghouse Nodal Clear to bring Circle's USDC stablecoin into US futures markets as eligible collateral. 

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire also said last month that it won't be long before stablecoins reach the level of developer attraction that the iPhone achieved. “The highest utility form of money ever created,” he said, referring to stablecoins.

        NEUCHÂTEL, Switzerland, July 10, 2025 (Newswire.com)
        -
    ORIGYN, the leading Real-World Asset (RWA) protocol on the Internet Computer (ICP), is proud to announce the launch of its open-source implementation of the ICRC7/ICRC37 NFT standard , setting a new benchmark for certified digital ownership on-chain.

This release makes NFT creation, ownership, and verification easier, faster, and more secure bridging the gap between real-world assets and blockchain technology.

"What if certifying a luxury watch or an original painting was as easy as clicking a link? With ICRC7/ICRC37, we're not just imagining it, we're delivering it," said Karolina Głusek, President of the ORIGYN Foundation. "This is a critical milestone for the Internet Computer ecosystem and the broader Web3 movement."

Why This Matters

While many NFT solutions today suffer from limitations, high gas fees, central points of failure, or lack of real-world utility, ORIGYN's ICRC7/ICRC37 implementation introduces a modular, open-source NFT infrastructure designed for real-world use cases :

Certified transaction history : Every NFT on ORIGYN carries an immutable, verifiable on-chain history.

Tamper-proof ownership : Authenticity is guaranteed through certified responses and advanced access controls.

Instant minting and transfer : NFTs can now be distributed via simple QR codes or links: perfect for events, luxury retail, and art.

Key Features

The implementation consists of three core components:

Core NFT Canister : Full ICRC7/ICRC37 compliance, integrated with ICRC3 for traceable transaction history and certified operations.

Storage Canister : Optimized for performance with stable memory, asset caching, and certified file hosting.

Tools & Docs : A complete developer starter kit with command-line tools, example collections, and comprehensive documentation.

Everything is modular, developers and brands can use just what they need.

Real-World Applications

This new standard has been purpose-built for practical use cases:

Luxury Brands can issue tamper-proof certificates of authenticity for watches, jewelry, or collectibles.

Artists & Galleries can mint digital certificates tied to physical works, instantly, securely, and permanently.

Events & Festivals can issue NFT tickets that double as digital passes or exclusive access tokens.

Open to All

The implementation is fully open-source and community-driven. Developers are encouraged to fork, test, contribute, or build on top of the foundation ORIGYN has created.

Project Acacia is an Australian initiative to support the settlement of tokenized transactions using stablecoins, tokenized deposits or a pilot wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC). It was first announced in late 2024. As with previous digital currency pilots, it is a joint project between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC). The securities regulator ASIC has provided some regulatory exemptions during the six month span of the project.

One of the most notable aspects is that the wCBDC will be issued on a range of public and private blockchains and DLTs. For example, Australian Payments Plus is a participant on the Hedera public network. Apart from Hedera, the DLTs for the pilot include Redbelly Network, R3 Corda, Canvas Connect and other EVM-compatible networks.

Twenty-four use cases have been selected, with 19 of them planning to use real money. Fourteen companies will participate, including three of the big four Australian banks and Northern Trust. However, National Australia Bank is not one of the participants.

“Ensuring that Australia's payments and monetary arrangements are fit-for-purpose in the digital age is a strategic priority for the RBA and the Payments System Board,” said Brad Jones, Assistant Governor (Financial System) at the RBA. “The use cases selected in this project will help us to better understand how innovations in central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, might help to uplift the functioning of wholesale financial markets in Australia.”

As with some other explorations, a wide range of use cases are planned including various asset classes, such as fixed income, private markets, trade receivables and carbon credits.

There are several similar projects around the world, including Europe's recent wholesale DLT settlement trials, Hong Kong's Project Ensemble and Switzerland's Project Helvetia which is live in a production environment despite being in a two year pilot phase.

One can say that everything is about being recognized and known in the crypto market. But what if it isn't?

Different meme coins hope to attract attention with promises, viral marketing, and other strategies. However, many of them fail to sustain investor interest in the long term. Why? Because they are playing the game all wrong. They don't have what matters in today's market: utility. 

That's why Snorter ($SNORT) is taking a slightly different path in its business. While other presales have only moments of glory, Snorter presale has shown strong momentum, positioning itself among promising altcoin projects.

This meme coin has terrific momentum, with over $1.6 million raised in its presale. But, how is $SNORT positioned compared to its competitors? Why is it more than a meme coin?

Read the article to find out.

Foremost, Snorter is on Solana and Ethereum, offering investors multi-chain opportunities, unlike many other altcoins. Among notable altcoins, only Chainlink and NEAR Protocol offer cross-chain capabilities. Multi-chain is crucial in helping to minimize compatibility issues between different blockchains. It allows projects to develop without having to rebuild from scratch or wait for support from a specific blockchain. 

One of Snorter's core advantages is that it operates on Telegram. These trading bots are great because Telegram is where crypto communities live. It's trusted, widely used, and already the go-to platform for crypto chatter. Further, trading on Telegram requires the fastest execution times, especially for sniping and copy trading. Speed is where Snorter outperforms its competition, with lightning-fast execution times. 

Compared to other Telegram trading bots, Snorter also provides features that help investors discover the hot trading opportunities:

Unlike most meme coins, Snorter provides massive utility to investors. Its features make $SNORT one of the rare meme coin presales with real tech utility.

While most meme coins focus on hype and fun branding, Snorter combines that with top-notch features that promise its long reign on the market. The utility could help Snorter avoid Dogecoin's fate of becoming dependent on community and influencer mentions. Snorter secures long-term demand because token holders can employ $SNORT daily for their trading operations.

The Snorter presale has raised past $1.6 million, demonstrating momentum and capturing investor attention. A massive community around Snorter is present for several reasons: 

The next presale stage starts soon, so you should consider exploring this promising altcoin opportunity this year.



Snorter, as a platform, can offer a lot to the investors; it transforms ordinary Telegram chat into a trading suite. It is one of the notable meme coin presales offering real technological utility.

While branding is fun, the viral appeal of $SNORT is in its technology and comprehensive innovation, which offer real utility. In the competition between altcoins and meme coins this year, Snorter stands out with innovative features compared to many altcoins.

The Snorter stands out as a unique investment. It is attractive, especially for early buyers who want to buy a coin with a low entry price and earn passive income. 

With its successful presale, multi-chain technology, attractive staking, and strong community, Snorter is gaining recognition as a noteworthy meme coin in 2025.

Consider the opportunity to participate in this promising altcoin presale before the next stage.

The international arm of Ant Group, the company backed by Alibaba founder Jack Ma, plans to bring Circle's USDC stablecoin onto its proprietary blockchain.

The rollout will start once U.S. regulators certify the dollar-pegged token under the new federal rules, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the deal.

The move would give USDC a link to a network that processed more than $1 trillion in global payments last year, a third of them settled on-chain. That scale could make Ant the largest overseas corporate user of a U.S.-issued stablecoin.

Ant International is also applying for stablecoin licenses in Singapore, Hong Kong and Luxembourg, according to the report. The group wants regulated digital dollars, central bank digital currencies and tokenized bank deposits to sit side by side on its platform.

The company's blockchain currently supports tokenized assets from various financial institutions and has reportedly been working with the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on the country's central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan.

Circle shares rose nearly 3.8% in pre-market trading to $208.

Emirates has signed a preliminary agreement with cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com to enable digital asset payments across its services, as the airline looks to broaden its appeal to younger, tech-savvy customers.

The partnership, expected to take effect next year, would integrate Crypto.com Pay into Emirates' payment infrastructure, subject to regulatory approvals and compliance checks, the airline's parent company said in a statement on Wednesday.

“ This strategic move is in line with Dubai's vision to be at the forefront of financial innovation while at the same time providing our customers with greater flexibility and choice in how they transact with Emirates,” said Adnan Kazim, Emirates' Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer.

The MoU was signed in Dubai in the presence of Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive of Emirates Airline & Group. The two companies will also explore joint marketing campaigns to drive awareness and adoption of the new payment option.

The UAE has emerged as a growing hub for the global crypto industry, with regulators such as the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in Dubai overseeing the sector since 2022. Several use cases have already taken shape, including cryptocurrency payments for real estate, school fees and transportation.

One of the largest crypto ecosystems in the region is housed within Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), where more than 650 crypto firms are currently based.

Other regional carriers have also begun experimenting with digital currencies. In May, Dubai-listed Air Arabia announced it would accept AE Coin, a UAE dirham-backed stablecoin, for flight bookings.

Crypto.com's President and COO Eric Anziani said the agreement with Emirates would help accelerate the everyday use of digital assets and strengthen the company's presence across the Gulf region.

24 innovative use cases from a diverse range of organisations, ranging from local fintechs to major banks, have been conditionally selected for this next stage of the project. This will include 19 pilot use cases, which will involve real money and real asset transactions, and five proof-of-concept use cases involving simulated transactions.The use cases involve a range of asset classes, including fixed income, private markets, trade receivables and carbon credits.Proposed settlement assets for the use cases include stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, and pilot wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), as well as new ways of using banks' existing exchange settlement accounts at the RBA.Issuance of pilot wholesale CBDC for testing use cases will occur on a range of private and public-permissioned DLT platforms, including Hedera, Redbelly Network, R3 Corda, Canvas Connect and other EVM-compatible networks.Testing of use cases will occur over the next six months, with a report on the findings from the project expected to be published in the first quarter of 2026. Brad Jones, assistant governor at the RBA says: “Ensuring that Australia's payments and monetary arrangements are fit-for-purpose in the digital age is a strategic priority for the RBA and the Payments System Board. Project Acacia represents an opportunity for further collaborative exploration on tokenised asset markets and the future of money by the public and private sectors in Australia.“The use cases selected in this project will help us to better understand how innovations in central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, might help to uplift the functioning of wholesale financial markets in Australia.The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Asic) is providing regulatory relief to participants to support and streamline the pilot.Asic commissioner Kate O'Rourke says: "Asic sees useful applications for the technologies underlying digital assets in wholesale markets. The relief from regulatory requirements that we have announced today will allow these technologies to be sensibly tested—to explore opportunities and identify and tackle risks.“Importantly, Project Acacia will allow industry and regulators to work together to learn more about how these use cases may reshape the financial services industry, potentially boosting efficiency and foster economic growth.”

 The trial is part of Project Acacia, an initiative from the RBA exploring how digital money and tokenization could support financial markets in Australia. 

Australia's central bank said on Thursday it's moving to its next stage in exploring digital currencies, launching a trial on how digital money and tokenization can support wholesale financial markets. 

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said in a statement on Thursday that stablecoins, bank deposit tokens and a pilot wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be used by partners participating in the trial.

The trial is phase two of Project Acacia, a joint initiative from the RBA and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre announced in November last year.

A diverse range of organizations, from local fintech firms to major banks, have been selected to test 24 use cases, 19 of which will involve real money and five proofs-of-concept involving simulated transactions.

These tests would involve a range of asset classes, including fixed income, private markets, trade receivables, carbon credits and examining new ways of using bank accounts at the RBA. 

This phase is expected to take six months, with results published in the first quarter of 2026.

Three of the four major Australian banks are part of the pilot: the Commonwealth Bank (CBA), the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) and Westpac Banking Corporation.

CBA said it will work with JPMorgan to evaluate how digital currencies and collateral records could deliver greater efficiency and liquidity with lower risk in the repo market.

“The repo market, with its critical role in liquidity management and monetary policy implementation, represents an ideal starting point for this exploration,” Sophie Gilder, CBA's managing director of blockchain and digital assets, said in a statement. 

The repo market involves short-term borrowing and lending of funds, secured by government securities, where one party sells a security to another party and agrees to repurchase it later for a higher price.

ANZ is leading the testing of a use case for tokenized trade payables, which aims to address the challenges of working capital and cash flow faced by suppliers, the bank said in a statement.

It will also conduct a tokenized fixed-income use case exploring a wholesale CBDC as a tokenized money to facilitate risk-free credit and liquidity settlement. 

Australia's markets regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has given participants a reprieve from some regulations so they can trial assets that currently sit outside the law, according to the RBA.

ASIC Commissioner Kate O'Rourke said in a statement that the agency “sees useful applications for the technologies underlying digital assets in wholesale markets.”

Under its ruling center-left Labor Party, Australia's government proposed a new crypto framework regulating exchanges under existing financial services laws back in March.

The government has also promised to work with Australia's four largest banks to better understand the extent and nature of de-banking.

In August 2022, the government initiated a series of industry consultations to draft a crypto regulatory framework.

 Binance founder Changpeng Zhao's investment firm is backing the creation of a company that will buy and hold BNB with plans to go public in the US. 

Update (July 10, 2:35 am UTC): This article has been updated to add information on the BNB token and examples of companies buying crypto.

Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao's family office is set to back a new treasury firm that will offer investors exposure to BNB with the aim of going public in the US.

YZi Labs said on Wednesday it will support the investment firm 10X Capital in spinning up a BNB (BNB) treasury company that will pursue a listing on “a major US exchange,” according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph.

Mentioned only as the “BNB Treasury Company,” the firm will appoint David Namdar as CEO. He's a senior partner at 10X Capital and a co-founder of Galaxy Digital, where he was formerly co-head of trading.

10X Capital will serve as the asset manager of the planned BNB buying company.

The planned company is the latest in a trend of firms buying up large amounts of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), providing Wall Street a vehicle for exposure to digital assets.

BNB, formerly called Binance Coin, is a token created by the crypto exchange Binance, the world's largest by volume, which gives holders discounts on the platform and is used in products on the BNB Chain blockchain that Binance created in 2019.

“BNB Chain is one of the most widely adopted blockchain ecosystems,” said Ella Zhang, head of YZi Labs. “We believe expanding its institutional access can deliver meaningful benefits to the broader public.”

10X Capital founder and CEO Hans Thomas added that the BNB Chain “is one of the largest, highest performing digital assets ecosystems globally, powering hundreds of millions of users, however, institutional and retail investors in the US have limited exposure to the growth of BNB.”

The planned company expects to announce the closing of its related financing “in the coming weeks,” according to the statement.

Exchange-tied tokens are typically seen as a way to allow traders to support a crypto exchange and can be a major funding source for such platforms.

While Binance launched the BNB token and BNB Chain and offers perks for BNB holders on its platform, the exchange isn't involved in developing the token or the blockchain.

However, Zhao revealed in February that 98.5% of his crypto portfolio was BNB, without specifying the total value of his holdings.

Forbes reported in June 2024 that Zhao and Binance together control nearly 96% of the BNB tokens in circulation.

The report said Zhao owns 94 million BNB tokens, currently worth nearly $63 billion and accounts for over 64% of BNB's circulating supply, while Binance controls 31.5% of the supply.

Zhao is banned from managing Binance as part of a deal with the US to plead guilty to money laundering violations, but he is still the exchange's biggest shareholder.

BNB is up 1.3% in the past 24 hours to trade above $670, according to CoinGecko.

Many public companies have taken to stockpiling Bitcoin, but others have looked to buy and hold so-called altcoins such as BNB.

The Nasdaq-listed Chinese chip designer Nano Labs said late last month that it plans to buy up to $1 billion worth of BNB and made its first buy of $50 million earlier this month.

Others, including the Singapore Web3 firm Trident Digital and the Chinese auto firm Webus, have said they'll spend hundreds of millions buying up and holding XRP (XRP).

Zhao wrote to X on Wednesday that “there are over 30+ teams” that want to do a BNB treasury public company.

Prime Day is underway, and we're seeing sizeable deals on Apple tech.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Amazon is usually the best place to buy Apple products, both from a convenience and pricing standpoint, so it's no surprise that, once again, the online retailer is flaunting Apple Prime Day deals across the board. We're seeing massive price cuts on all sorts of Apple products, including AirPods, Beats headphones, iPads, and more. 

While this year's Prime Day spans four whole days—running today through July 11—we don't recommend waiting to shop if you spot a deal you love. In past years, popular items like AirPods and iPads have sold out almost immediately. 

And with the ongoing (and uneven) tariff situation looming over our heads, now is as good a time as ever to stock up on Apple essentials while they're below retail. Because, at this juncture, even retail might be a steal.  

Shop Prime Day Apple Deals

We're not seeing anything too out of the norm for Prime Day, but the sales are nonetheless pretty appealing. I'm particularly fond of the deals on audio: The Apple AirPod Pro 2s are already 40 percent off, which is $100 off their normal price. Not to mention $149 is the lowest price we've ever seen. If you're looking for earbuds with unmatched noise-cancellation, I couldn't recommend these more, especially if you're someone who likes to listen at work or in the gym. 

My go-to over-ear headphones, the Beats Solo 4, are now 51 percent off. I'm a huge fan of the UltraPlush adjustable cushioned design and the ergonomically angled flex grip headband. I can wear these all day long without even realizing they're on my head. 

One of my favorite Prime Day deals is $150 off the brand new Apple 2025 M4 MacBook Air. This laptop was just released back in April, and to get it $150 off within the first few months is an incredible deal. 

If you're in the market for an Apple Watch, well, there are deals to be had there as well. Save $120 on the latest Apple Watch Series 10, featuring a larger display, advanced health metrics, and enhanced durability. The simpler Apple Watch SE—a perfect starter smart watch—is currently also 32 percent off and under $200. 

Other noteworthy early deals include $70 off the latest, ultra-fast Apple iPad featuring a powerful A16 chip, $120 off the Apple iPad mini (also one of the lowest prices we've seen in a while), and 34 percent off a four-pack of the ultra-convenient Apple AirTags.

Their DNA holds clues to survival in one of the most toxic places on Earth.

Four decades after the world's worst nuclear disaster, something weird—but wonderful—is happening inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: the dogs that roam the radioactive area are rapidly evolving. 

And we don't exactly know why.

Watch Pop Mech editors Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick explore the strange case of the Chernobyl dogs, who descend from those canines abandoned during the April 26, 1986 evacuation. Despite dealing with extremely cold temperatures, food scarcity, and long-term radiation exposure, the Chernobyl dogs aren't just surviving—they're thriving. And recent studies suggest they're adapting in ways that challenge what we thought we knew about survival.

Andrew and John investigate how the dogs that live closest to the reactor have developed genetic traits distinct from other dogs in nearby regions. But the changes don't seem to come from radiation damage; instead, scientists say the animals are adapting through natural selection and sheer toughness passed down across generations. 

Could the Chernobyl dogs help humans adapt to harsh environments, like, say, the surface of Mars or deep space? Watch the full episode above, and find more installments of the Astounding Pop Mech Show on PopularMechanics.com.

Don't let these discounts fly away. Shop drones during Prime Day for close to half off.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

With warm weather and blue skies looking like they are here to stay (for a few months, at least), nab yourself a drone you can fly freely in the open air. Drones are great gadgets for both the casual flier who wants to capture a few fun videos and zoom around to their heart's content, as well as for videographers and filmmakers looking to capture aerial shots or high-speed action.

Drones, especially ones with strong wind resistance, high-quality cameras, and agile maneuverability, can be quite expensive. Even more affordable models cost a few hundred dollars. During Prime Day, you can grab a top-rated drone for hundreds of dollars off the original price.

Lasting from July 8 until July 11, this is the longest Prime Day ever, doubling the length of the shopping event. So, unlike previous years where sales come and go so quickly, you may miss out, this Prime Day gives you time to find the right product, compare it to a few others, and grab it when you've made your decision. 

That said, many of these drones are at the best price we've seen all year, so don't miss out on your chance to get a model you like before it reverts to full price. The drone sales listed below aren't just the lowest prices we found on Amazon. All options we add to this list are from brands we know and trust. In fact, some of the drones are ones we've tested out and reviewed ourselves.

Shop Prime Day Deals

Choosing the right drone is more than just about the sale price. We found drones that cater to needs across the spectrum, from beginners to nearly professional-grade.

DJI's Air 3 might be a little more expensive than other deals on this list, but the brand is no joke. DJI almost single-handedly swept our list of the best drones due to the consistently high quality of its cameras, motors, and controls. The Air 3 is definitely no exception, with this particular model actually coming with two different camera lenses. The medium tele camera is great for traditional shots and high-resolution close-ups, while the wide-angle camera captures massive landscapes and sweeping shots from a high vantage point. The drone is also capable of taking off at altitudes of up to 6,000 meters, allowing you to take it on hikes, through hills, and even on snowy slopes. During Prime Day, the Air 3 is over $150 off.

If you're looking for a beginner-focused model, we like the Ruko U11 Mini. This already more affordable model is on sale for nearly 50 percent off its original price, further reducing the cost. This model also weighs less than 250 grams, which means you don't need any FAA registration to operate it. The purchase also comes with a remote control, cables to connect your phone to the remote control, extra propellers, three rechargeable batteries, and a carrying case. 

If you're less interested in flying it around on your own and just want quality video, the HoverAir X1 offers numerous easy-to-use video and flying modes that help you record solid footage without requiring top-notch aerial control. We loved testing this one out and got tons of footage we loved, despite our relative novice flying skills. All we had to do was press which mode we wanted, and the drone would orbit us, follow us, or even zoom out. While the deal isn't directly listed on the page, the drone is currently on sale for 22 percent off, with the discount applied at checkout. 

Also on sale are quality options from both Potensic and Holy Stone, which both have models we recommend on our overall best drones list and best drones for beginners list, respectively. The deals for each are also well worth considering, with the Holy Stone on sale for $70 off.

For people with Type 1 diabetes, developing hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is an ever-present threat. When glucose levels become extremely low, it creates a life-threatening situation for which the standard treatment of care is injecting a hormone called glucagon.

As an emergency backup, for cases where patients may not realize that their blood sugar is dropping to dangerous levels, MIT engineers have designed an implantable reservoir that can remain under the skin and be triggered to release glucagon when blood sugar levels get too low.

This approach could also help in cases where hypoglycemia occurs during sleep, or for diabetic children who are unable to administer injections on their own.

"This is a small, emergency-event device that can be placed under the skin, where it is ready to act if the patient's blood sugar drops too low," says Daniel Anderson, a professor in MIT's Department of Chemical Engineering, a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), and the senior author of the study. "Our goal was to build a device that is always ready to protect patients from low blood sugar. We think this can also help relieve the fear of hypoglycemia that many patients, and their parents, suffer from."

The researchers showed that this device could also be used to deliver emergency doses of epinephrine, a drug that is used to treat heart attacks and can also prevent severe allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock.

Siddharth Krishnan, a former MIT research scientist who is now an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University, is the lead author of the study, which was published on July 9 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

Emergency response

Most patients with type 1 diabetes use daily insulin injections to help their body absorb sugar and prevent their blood sugar levels from getting too high. However, if their blood sugar levels get too low, they develop hypoglycemia, which can lead to confusion and seizures, and may be fatal if it goes untreated.

To combat hypoglycemia, some patients carry preloaded syringes of glucagon, a hormone that stimulates the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream. However, it isn't always easy for people, especially children, to know when they are becoming hypoglycemic.

"Some patients can sense when they're getting low blood sugar, and go eat something or give themselves glucagon," Anderson says. "But some are unaware that they're hypoglycemic, and they can just slip into confusion and coma. This is also a problem when patients sleep, as they are reliant on glucose sensor alarms to wake them when sugar drops dangerously low."

To make it easier to counteract hypoglycemia, the MIT team set out to design an emergency device that could be triggered either by the person using it, or automatically by a sensor.

The device, which is about the size of a quarter, contains a small drug reservoir made of a 3D-printed polymer. The reservoir is sealed with a special material known as a shape-memory alloy, which can be programmed to change its shape when heated. In this case, the researcher used a nickel-titanium alloy that is programmed to curl from a flat slab into a U-shape when heated to 40 degrees Celsius.

Like many other protein or peptide drugs, glucagon tends to break down quickly, so the liquid form can't be stored long-term in the body. Instead, the MIT team created a powdered version of the drug, which remains stable for much longer and stays in the reservoir until released.

Each device can carry either one or four doses of glucagon, and it also includes an antenna tuned to respond to a specific frequency in the radiofrequency range. That allows it to be remotely triggered to turn on a small electrical current, which is used to heat the shape-memory alloy. When the temperature reaches the 40-degree threshold, the slab bends into a U shape, releasing the contents of the reservoir.

Because the device can receive wireless signals, it could also be designed so that drug release is triggered by a glucose monitor when the wearer's blood sugar drops below a certain level.

"One of the key features of this type of digital drug delivery system is that you can have it talk to sensors," Krishnan says. "In this case, the continuous glucose-monitoring technology that a lot of patients use is something that would be easy for these types of devices to interface with."

Reversing hypoglycemia

After implanting the device in diabetic mice, the researchers used it to trigger glucagon release as the animals' blood sugar levels were dropping. Within less than 10 minutes of activating the drug release, blood sugar levels began to level off, allowing them to remain within the normal range and avert hypoglycemia.

The researchers also tested the device with a powdered version of epinephrine. They found that within 10 minutes of drug release, epinephrine levels in the bloodstream became elevated and heart rate increased.

In this study, the researchers kept the devices implanted for up to four weeks, but they now plan to see if they can extend that time up to at least a year.

"The idea is you would have enough doses that can provide this therapeutic rescue event over a significant period of time. We don't know exactly what that is -- maybe a year, maybe a few years, and we're currently working on establishing what the optimal lifetime is. But then after that, it would need to be replaced," Krishnan says.

Typically, when a medical device is implanted in the body, scar tissue develops around the device, which can interfere with its function. However, in this study, the researchers showed that even after fibrotic tissue formed around the implant, they were able to successfully trigger the drug release.

The researchers are now planning for additional animal studies and hope to begin testing the device in clinical trials within the next three years.

"It's really exciting to see our team accomplish this, which I hope will someday help diabetic patients and could more broadly provide a new paradigm for delivering any emergency medicine," says Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and an author of the paper.

Other authors of the paper include Laura O'Keeffe, Arnab Rudra, Derin Gumustop, Nima Khatib, Claudia Liu, Jiawei Yang, Athena Wang, Matthew Bochenek, Yen-Chun Lu, Suman Bose, and Kaelan Reed.

The research was funded by the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, the National Institutes of Health, a JDRF postdoctoral fellowship, and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

Efficient biomimetic reactions provide a powerful platform for producing bioactive chiral compounds. Chiral β-hydroxy-α-amino acids display exceptionally high bioactivity and are key functional components of many marketed drugs. However, the efficient synthesis of chiral β-hydroxy-α-amino acids remains a long-standing challenge for both chemical and biological syntheses. Chemical synthesis is problematic due to low step- and atom-efficiencies, high costs and environmental hazards. The enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine can make β-hydroxy-α-amino acids in one step, but it is constrained by issues such as limited substrate scope, unsatisfactory stereoselectivity and low conversion. Here we have successfully realized the biomimetic aldol reaction of glycinate with aldehydes, using 0.01–1.0 mol% of a chiral pyridoxal as the catalyst to produce a remarkably broad range of chiral β-hydroxy-α-amino esters. Moreover, a high-diversity parallel asymmetric synthesis has also been tested using over 1,100 aldehydes and it yielded over 1,700 chiral β-hydroxy-α-amino acid esters, demonstrating its important potential for drug innovation.

Borylation chemistry plays a crucial role in the development of new synthetic methodologies. However, the reactivity of zinc-boryl species has not been fully explored, particularly in relation to diverse reaction pathways. Here we show that a zinc-boryl species is successfully synthesized from bis(catecholato)diboron, exhibiting amphiphilic reactivity. This compound acts as a nucleophilic boron anion with methyl iodide and as an electrophile with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, facilitating zinc-boron bond dissociation and generating zinc-carbon and zinc-nitrogen bonds while cleaving carbon-nitrogen double bonds. The enhanced reactivity is likely due to the stronger covalency of the zinc-boron bond. Additionally, the zinc-boryl compound promotes the catalytic diborylation of azobenzene, underscoring its versatility as a reactive intermediate. Density functional theory studies illuminate the electronic structure and reactivity of the zinc-boron bond, providing insights into potential applications in synthetic chemistry.

Organozinc compounds have become ubiquitous and versatile intermediates, finding widespread applications in synthetic chemistry1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Common zinc-carbon bonded reagents, such as ZnEt₂, serve as mild carbon-centered nucleophiles in organic synthesis8,9,10,11. Recently, there has been a growing interest in a new class of heteroatom-zinc species, where the heteroatom introduces unique reactivity to the Zn-heteroatom bond12,13,14,15. Boron, with its empty 2p orbital when it is three-coordinated, presents a particularly attractive option16,17,18. The Zn-B bonds present in zinc-boryl compounds can potentially provide access to nucleophilic boryl anions and unlock new reactivity modes. However, structurally characterized zinc-boryl species are extremely rare.

Their synthesis has generally relied on nitrogen-stabilized bulky boryl frameworks, all of which utilized lithium boryl compounds as precursors. Furthermore, these zinc-boryl reagents have been demonstrated to show limited reactivity with small electrophiles, likely due to the presence of bulky groups on the boryl ligand. These groups can also hinder the reactivity of the empty p orbital at the boron atom. On the other hand, Zinc-boryl compounds prepared from diboron esters (such as B2pin2, B2cat2) have been proposed as catalytically active species for various borylation reactions22,23,24,25,26. Therefore, it is of great interest to synthesize such a zinc-boryl ester complex and further investigate its synthetic applications. (Fig. 1a)19,20,21

In the literature, stable metal-boryl bonds can also be achieved by installing bulky ligands at the metal sites27. Based on this, NHC-carbene stabilized copper- and gold-boryl complexes have been successfully isolated28,29,30,31. Previously, attempts to isolate Zn-boryl complexes derived from diboron esters with NHC carbene ligands resulted in decomposed zinc powder and a minor product involving a Zn-inserted NHC ring product32. Moreover, the bulky β-diketiminate species proved to be an ideal ligand for stabilizing low-valent metals, highly reactive low-coordinate species, and metal-boryl complexes33,34,35,36,37,38. Inspired by these achievements, we envisioned preparing a stable Zn-B bond by introducing a β-diketiminate-based ligand at the zinc site, thus enhancing the reactivity of the Zn-B bond. During the review process of this manuscript, the Aldridge group reported a Zn-Bpin bonded compound, and its DMAP adduct has been fully characterized (Fig. 1b)39.

In this work, we successfully synthesized a zinc-boryl compound 1 starting from the common diboron ester, B2cat2 (Fig. 1c). Compound 1 demonstrates the ability to act as a nucleophilic Bcat anion, engaging productively with an electrophilic partner. Furthermore, this zinc-boryl species exhibited a rich diverse reactivity profile, undergoing transformations with N-containing unsaturated substrates such as carbodiimide, azo benzenes, and isonitriles. Notably, compound 1 was also found to be a competent catalyst in diboration processes. Besides, DFT computation studies were carried out to understand the reaction mechanism.

The zinc amido compound 2 was chosen as the starting material12, as its reaction with B2cat2 generates stable B-N bonded products, which might be a driving force for the formation of the Zn-B bond. Indeed, treatment of compound 2 and B2cat2 at room temperature in toluene afforded the desired zinc boryl product 1 in a 53% isolated yield (Fig. 2a). The11B NMR of 1 shows a broad singlet at 39 ppm, indicating the presence of a three-coordinated boron moiety. Furthermore, the formation of the Zn-B bond was unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis (Fig. 2b). The crystals of 1 were obtained from a hexane solution, exhibiting a dimeric structure. The zinc atom exhibits a Zn-O interaction distance of 2.325(1) Å, which is notably longer than typical Zn–O coordination bonds (generally <2.15 Å)40,41. This extended bond arises from a weak coordination interaction involving the oxygen atom of the Bcat group, resulting in the formation of a six-membered ring structure that stabilizes the dimeric assembly. In contrast, in toluene solution, it forms a monomer, as supported by single-crystal X-ray analysis (see Supplementary Fig. S51). However, both crystals obtained from the hexane or toluene solutions show the same signal in1H NMR (see Supplementary Fig. S55). The DOSY NMR results confirm that compound 1 exists as a monomer in the C6D6 solution (see Supplementary Fig. S55). The Zn-B bond length of compound 1 (2.055(1) Å) is close to that of N-heterocyclic boryl zinc species (2.052, 2.075 Å)19,20,21, but the distance is slightly longer than the Cu-boryl complexes(average 1.990 Å)19,28,42,43,44,45,46.

Metal boryl complexes serve as essential reactive intermediates or catalysts in the formation of various borylated reagents used in organic synthesis47,48,49,50,51,52. The reactivity of the metal-boron bond is crucial for the further transformation. To gain deeper insights into the Zn-B bond in compound 1, DFT computation studies were carried out (Fig. 3) at the BP86 level of theory (see Supplementary information). The computed molecule is a simplified model of 1 by substituting dipp groups with 2,6-dimethyl phenyl moieties. Figure 3 shows the natural localized molecular orbital (NLMO) calculated for the Zn(II)-boryl complex 1, describing the Zn-B sigma bonding interaction. For comparison, Fig. 3 also presented the corresponding NLMO calculated for the closely related Mg(II)-boryl species, [HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2Mg(DMAP)(Bpin). The NLMO plots clearly indicated that when compared to the Mg-B sigma bond, the Zn-B sigma bond contains a greater orbital contribution from the metal center. Furthermore, the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis revealed that the boron atom carries a charge of +0.478, which is higher than that of magnesium (+0.382) and lithium boryl species (+0.072)3,52,53. Meanwhile, the zinc metal center in compound 1 carries a charge of 0.950, indicating a more covalent character of the Zn-B bond compared with the known magnesium and lithium boryl species. To further support the covalent nature of the Zn–B bonding interaction in 1, we performed Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Principal Interacting Orbital (PIO) analyses. Both the molecular graph from QTAIM and the PIO results indicate that the Zn–B bond exhibits covalent character. The results of these analyses are provided in the Supplementary Information.

The reaction of compound 1 with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) afforded a product, compound 3, where the DMAP unit was coordinated to the zinc atom, as confirmed by X-ray single-crystal analysis (Fig. 4a). This observation implies that the zinc metal center in compound 1 is more electrophilic compared to the boryl group, which is consistent with the DFT computational results discussed above.

The magnesium, lithium, and copper boryl compounds have demonstrated their reactivity of nucleophilic boryl anions in reactions with electrophiles33,45,53,54. The similar reactivity of zinc-boryl compound 1 was also examined (Fig. 4b). The reaction of compound 1 with MeI in C6D6 over 6 h resulted in a clear conversion, as indicated by a new 11B NMR signal at 35.2 ppm, suggesting the formation of the methyl-substituted boronic ester. The MeBcat could also be synthesized from Rh-Me complex with B2cat255, but our synthetic route indicates a clear nucleophilic Bcat- derived from the Zn-B σ−bond. Additionally, the zinc-I species 4 was identified by 1H NMR, which is consistent with the reported data (see Supplementary Fig. S31)56,57. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) further confirmed the identities of the generated compounds. This reaction demonstrated the nucleophilic activity of the Bcat- anion derived from compound 1.

To explore further the reactivity of the Zn-B bond in compound 1, we conducted a series of reactions with unsaturated N-containing substrates. The reaction of compound 1 and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) has been explored. Based on previous literature reports33, we expected that the borylation might occur at the C atom, forming a ZnN2C four-member ring. To our surprise, the reaction of compound 1 and DCC gave a clean conversion to compound 5 at 85 °C (Fig. 4c). X-ray crystallographic analysis confirmed the structure of this new compound as a zinc imide complex. In this case, DCC acted as an equivalent of Cy-nitrene, which was inserted into the Zn-B bond. This indicates a C=N bond cleavage event facilitated by the Zn-Bcat compound 1 that displays unusual reactivity. To elucidate the mechanism behind the unique bond cleavage process, we conducted a control experiment. Upon heating the reaction at 60 °C, a new 11B signal at 26.8 ppm was observed, and the 1H NMR spectrum also showed the appearance of a new set of signals, suggesting the presence of a stable transition intermediate. X-ray single crystal analysis confirmed the structure of this species, compound 6, as a 1,2-addition compound involving the Zn-B bond, where the zinc atom coordinates with the central carbon atom and the oxygen atom (O1), forming a five-membered ring. And the Bcat group is connected to the terminal N-Cy moiety. Continued heating of 6 at 85 °C led to a smooth transformation into the final product 5, proving it to be a key intermediate in this transformation. Attempts to isolate any other side products from these reactions were not successful. Similar results regarding the cleavage of the C=N double bond leading to imido species have also been reported for low-valent main group metals58,59 and transition metal borylenes60,61. In contrast to its nucleophilic reactivity with MeI, compound 1 acts as an electrophile toward DCC, demonstrating amphiphilic character within the Zn-B bond. In these reactions, it is interesting to find out whether the related transformations have been initiated by a highly reactive nucleophilic or electrophilic boron moiety. To understand the reaction mechanism for the formation of compounds 5 and 6, DFT computational studies have been conducted, and the results are summarized in the next section.

The reactivity of compound 1 towards isonitrile was also investigated. When an equimolar amount of tBuNC was added to a toluene solution of compound 1, an immediate color change from colorless to dark green was observed11.B NMR analysis revealed the formation of a new species with a signal at 17.2 ppm, along with the presence of unreacted compound 1. Upon the addition of another equivalent of tBuNC, a complete conversion of compound 1 was observed. The product, compound 7, was successfully isolated (Fig. 5a). X-ray single crystal analysis revealed the formation of a C-C coupled moiety derived from tBuNC, coordinated with the Bcat unit to generate a four-membered C2NB heterocycle (Fig. 5c). The C-N bond lengths of 1.280(4) and 1.301(4) Å, along with the terminal C-C bond length of 1.495(4) Å, suggest the formation of two N=C double bonds and a C-C single bond in the isonitrile-coupled moiety. This interesting C-C coupling pathway that gives a C=N-B-C 4-membered ring product was also observed when excess isonitrile reacted with the above-mentioned manganese-carbonyl boryl and low valent aluminum complexes62,63. However, unlike the Mn (I) carbene complex, 7 does not show carbene character judging from the planar C-N-B-C ring and its Zn-C bond length of 1.96 Å, which is the average bond length of a Zn-C single bond3,64. Regarding the reaction pathway, though mechanistic study is still underway, it is believed that there is an insertion of tBuNC into the Zn-B bond, followed by an attack of second tBuNC at the C centre that cleaves C-B bond. This is in contrast to the previously reported Au-B(o-tol)2 complex30, where the isocyanide was transformed into an azaallenylgold compound, implying distinct reaction pathways in the two systems.

(thermal ellipsoids are set at the 50% probability level, and the hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity); d Molecular structure of compound 8. (thermal ellipsoids are set at the 30% probability level, hydrogen atoms are omitted and the side Dipp parts are set as sticks model for clarity).

Additionally, compound 1 was found to react with azobenzene, forming a new zinc-imide product 8 (Fig. 5b). The structure of compound 8 was confirmed by X-ray single-crystal analysis, which revealed the formation of Zn-N and B-N bonds (Fig. 5d). The N-N bond length of 1.434(3) Å is within the expected range of a N-N single bond. The diborylation of azobenzene is a known transformation; however, it typically requires either stoichiometric amounts of highly electrophilic boron reagents or noble metal catalysts65,66,67. Based on the formation of 8, we hypothesized that compound 1 might promote the catalytic diborylation of azobenzenes, driven by the regeneration of a strong B-N bond. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the reaction of compound 8 with B2cat2, which led to the regeneration of compound 1, suggesting the establishment of a catalytic cycle. After screening various reaction conditions (see Supplementary information), we achieved the diboration of azobenzene with an isolated yield of 82% at 60 °C in toluene, using 10 mol% of catalyst 1. We evaluated substrates with substituents exhibiting different electronic effects in this system (Fig. 6). Complex 1 proved effective in catalyzing the diborylation of substrates containing electron-withdrawing groups. In contrast, it did not facilitate the reaction with substrates bearing electron-donating groups. The catalytic efficiency of the Zn-boryl complex for the diborylation of azobenzene and substrates with electron-withdrawing groups is comparable to that achieved with precious metal catalysts68, and this was accomplished without the addition of a base in the catalytic system to fully utilize the boron source69.

The reaction conditions and substrate scope are outlined.

To shed light on the reactivity of the Zn-B bond, DFT computations were conducted on the reaction of compound 1 with DCC shown in Fig. 7 at ωB97X-D level in toluene (see Supplementary information). We selected this reaction for DFT studies because the formation of 6 clearly signifies the potential electrophilic nature of the boryl ligand, allowing us to distinguish a Zn-B bond and an Mg-/Li-B bond. The formation of the final thermodynamically more stable product 5 occurs through two steps (Fig. 7). In the first step, the Zn-B bond reacts with one of the C=N bonds in DCC to yield the zincate-borylation intermediate INT1 (a model for compound 5). This step proceeds through transition structure TS1 with an overall barrier of 22.4 kcal/mol. In the second step, the nitrogen atom bonded to the boryl group further coordinates with the Zn metal center, resulting in the cleavage of the Zn-C bond and the release of Cy-NC through the transition structure TS2. The second step requires overcoming a barrier of 26.5 kcal/mol, which is higher than that of the first step. This elucidates the experimental observation of 6 (INT1 in Fig. 7) as a product at a lower temperature. These findings contrast sharply with the reaction of Mg-Bpin species with carbodiimide, where the boryl group attaches to the electrophilic carbon center in the final product[33]. Consequently, we also examined the hypothetical reaction pathway in which the Bcat acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon atom of DCC. However, such a reaction mechanism needs to overcome a much higher energy barrier of 32.3 kcal/mol (see Supplementary information). Based on these results, we can conclude that a unique concerted reactivity of the Zn-B bond contributes to such an interesting isonitrile elimination result observed in the reaction with DCC.

Relative Gibbs free energies and relative electronic energies (in parenthesis) are given in kcal/mol. DFT computations were conducted on the reaction of compound 1 with DCC shown in at B97X-D level in toluene.

In summary, we employed a straightforward metathesis strategy to synthesize a Zn-boryl complex from a Zn imide complex and B2Cat2. This Zn-Bcat complex exhibits a unique Zn-boron bond, displaying significant differences from Zn-boryl compounds derived from lithium-boryl precursors. The enhanced covalent character boosts its reactivity towards unsaturated nitrogen-containing bonds, enabling it to exhibit behavior akin to highly reactive diborane(4) species67,70,71. The Zn-Bcat complex can act as a typical nucleophile, reacting with CH3I to form C-B bonds. Additionally, it activates carbodiimide (DCC), facilitating the addition of C=N bonds and cleaving inert C=N double bonds through a unique concerted reactivity, leading to the generation of imide Zn complexes. It also activates NC triple bonds in isonitrile, converting them to double bonds while facilitating C-C single-bond coupling. Furthermore, the N=N double bond of azobenzene can be inserted into the Zn-B bond, resulting in borylated N-N bonded species, and it further functions as a catalyst in the diborylation of azobenzene. DFT computational results confirm the enhanced covalent character of the Zn-B bond, indicating that its reaction pathway differs from that of known nucleophilic boryl reagents. Ongoing studies in our laboratory focus on exploring the reactivity of zinc-boron bonded species with various unsaturated substrates and their catalytic applications in organic synthesis.

People's intuitive perception of biodiversity through visual and audio cues is remarkably accurate and aligns closely with scientific measures of biodiversity. This is according to new research published in the British Ecological Society journal, People and Nature.

In a new study led by researchers at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv), the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) and the Friedrich Schiller University Jena, participants with no ecological training were asked to sort images and audio recordings of forests based on perceived biodiversity.

The researchers found that the biodiversity levels that participants perceived from the images and audio recordings closely matched the actual biodiversity of the forests.

How we perceive the natural world has implications for our health. Previous research has suggested that it is perceived biodiversity, rather than measured biodiversity, that is linked to our well-being.

Lead author Kevin Rozario, iDiv, said: "Because it's suspected that perceived biodiversity translates into mental health benefits, it's important to identify what people perceive with regards to biodiversity, what the contribution of the different senses could be, and under which circumstances people's perception of biodiversity best aligns with what ecologists measure."

To understand what indicators of biodiversity people were perceiving, the researchers also asked the study participants to sort the images and audio recordings according to any criteria that stood out to them.

Visually, people noticed vegetation density, light conditions or color. Acoustically, people noticed birdsong characteristics, volume or emotions that the audio evoked.

"Not only are we experiencing an extinction of species, but also and extinction of biodiverse experiences." said Kevin Rozario.

"We recommend to conserve and restore diverse forests characterised by a variety of tree species and structures to also provide habitats for different vocalising bird species. These conservation measures will have the dual benefit of meeting conservation goals while also increasing people's experience of biodiversity and therefore likely increasing mental well-being."

In each of the two sorting studies, 48 participants were presented with 57 photographs or 16 audio recordings of forest patches throughout Germany, Belgium and Poland with varying levels of biodiversity.

The actual biodiversity of the forests in the photographs was assessed using a combination of four commonly used forest diversity indicators: tree species richness, forest structural diversity, understory structural diversity and understory abundance. Actual biodiversity in the audio files was measured via bird species richness.

In the study, the researchers asked participants to sort the images and audio recordings based on anything that stood out to them when looking at or listening to the forest stimuli and then sort them based on perceived visual or acoustic diversity, respectively.

The researchers caution that people's abilities to accurately perceive biodiversity may be reliant on them being able to directly compare environments with different biodiversity levels. They point to similar studies that found that participants could not easily perceive biodiversity when they were asked to rate one environment on its own.

The researchers also note that the majority of their study participants were university educated women and that future studies could look to replicate their methods with more representative samples of the general population.

The AI tools Gemini and DeepSeek came behind o3 in a league table of responses to scientific questions.Credit: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty

o3, an artificial intelligence (AI) model developed by the creators of ChatGPT, has been ranked the best AI tool for answering science questions in multiple fields, according to a benchmarking platform launched last week.

SciArena, developed by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2) in Seattle, Washington, ranked 23 large language models (LLMs) according to their answers to scientific questions. The quality of the answers was voted on by 102 researchers. o3, created by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, was ranked the best at answering questions on natural sciences, health care, engineering, and humanities and social science, after more than 13,000 votes.

DeepSeek-R1, built by DeepSeek in Hangzhou, China, came second on natural-sciences questions and fourth on engineering. Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro ranked third in natural sciences and fifth in engineering and health care.

Users' preference for o3 might stem from the model's tendency to give a lot of detail on the literature it cites and to produce technically nuanced responses, says Arman Cohan, a research scientist at Ai2. But explaining why models' performance varies is challenging because most are proprietary. Differences in training data and what the model has been optimized for, among other things, could partially explain it, he says.

SciArena is the latest platform developed to evaluate how AI models perform on certain tasks — and one of the first to rank performance on scientific tasks using crowdsourced feedback. “SciArena is a positive effort that motivates a careful evaluation of LLM-assisted literature tasks,” says Rahul Shome, a robotics and AI researcher at the Australian National University in Canberra.

To rank the 23 LLMs, SciArena asked researchers to submit scientific questions. They received answers from two randomly selected models, which supported their responses with references drawn from Semantic Scholar, an AI research tool also created by Ai2. Users then voted on whether one model provided the best answer, the two models were comparable or both performed badly.

The platform is now publicly available and lets users ask research questions for free. All users get answers from two models and can vote on their performance, but only votes from verified users who consent to the terms are included in the leaderboard, which the company says will be updated frequently.

The ability to question LLMs on science topics and have confidence in the answers will help researchers to keep up with the latest literature in their field, says AI researcher Jonathan Kummerfeld at the University of Sydney in Australia. “This will help researchers find work they may have otherwise missed.”

And the winners of the best budget 3D printers are....?

I've just spent nearly half a day going through all the 3D printer reviews that we have done, and I have chosen two that I consider to be the best budget 3D printers.

So lets start with the best budget printer for those new to 3D printing. That "award" goes to the Bambu Lab A1 Mini.

The Bambu Lab A1 Mini is phenomenal 3D printer for just over $200! It may have a smaller print volume (180 x 180 x 180mm), but other than that it is a simple to setup and use 3D printer for very little cash. It produces great prints and the frictionless process of assembly (there is very little) and setup (it guides you along the process via the touchscreen) means you get to printing in a very short space of time.The Bambu Lab A1 Mini can even be expanded with an AMS (Automatic Material System) that enables this little printer to print in multiple colors and filaments. So you can 3D print colorful projects, or objects with mixed filaments, all from the tiny printer.

We gave the Bambu Lab A1 Mini the Editor's Choice award back in 2023, so with that recommendation and $80 off the MSRP, you should really just buy it!

This popular compact printer is solidly built with a full-metal linear rail system and bearings, features full auto calibration, vibration and flow-rate compensation, and compatibility with multi-color AMS accessories. 

Work next to the printer without distraction, thanks to the low noise "silent mode" that lets the A1 print at under 48 decibels of noise.  

Check out our review of the Bambu Lab A1 mini.

Next, we have the best budget 3D printer for the more seasoned 3D printer user. This "award" goes to the Sovol SV06 ACE.

This printer is fast, cheap and has a generous 220 x 220 x 250 build volume. The Sovol SV06 ACE is an automated 3D printer. It levels itself before each print, so all we need to do is load filament and send our prints over the network. The print output is exceptional. So we have a fast, cheap 3D printer that has great quality and plenty of build volume. This would be an excellent printer for the jobbing maker / creator who needs reliability, quality and speed.

$100 off this great budget 3D printer!

The Sovol SV06 ACE is fast, easy to assemble and very easy to use. The 220 x 220 x 250 build volume is plenty to start your 3D printing adventures. The printer features automatic bed leveling, and a built-in camera to monitor your prints.

The excellent Lenovo Legion Go is now just $499 at Amazon, 30% off with $200 in savings. You get the Z1 Extreme chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It even has detachable controllers like a Nintendo Switch 2!

The Lenovo Legion Go handheld gaming console comes with an AMD Z1 Extreme chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Its massive 8.8-inch screen delivers a more immersive experience, and its detachable controllers let you play on a larger screen without needing to bring a separate controller.

We've seen this ever-so-slightly cheaper, but only by $17, and that was months ago, making this an excellent day three deal.

Deep discounts on Radeons are a rare sight this Prime Day season, but there are still deals to be found. Consider Sapphire's Pulse Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB, a compact and stealthy dual-fan implementation of this Editor's Choice-winning product. It's going for just $359 at Amazon and Newegg right now, or just $10 over MSRP.

The Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB hits a sweet spot for price-to-performance for value-minded enthusiasts. It's got enough power to game at 1080p and 1440p alike, and its 16GB of VRAM gives you plenty of headroom to max out settings in memory-hungry modern titles. Sapphire's handsome Pulse card has dual fans and a stealthy, compact design that will look good in any build. 

Price check: $359 at Newegg

Our tests showed that the RX 9060 XT 16GB is great for high-frame-rate gaming at 1080p or a solid 60-ish FPS at 1440p overall, even with demanding settings.

The RX 9060 XT also supports AMD's latest FSR 4 upscaler and its AI-enhanced image quality, meaning you have more freedom to tune performance to taste in the small but growing list of titles that support it.

The RDNA 4 architecture boasts better AI performance and ray-tracing prowess than its predecessors, too, making the RX 9060 XT 16GB a thoroughly modern and well-rounded graphics card. There's a good reason it took home our Editor's Choice award.

If you're looking for a graphics card upgrade and don't want to break the bank, this Sapphire Pulse RX 9060 XT 16GB should be at the top of your list.

If you want a straight shooting laptop from Microsoft on Prime Day, there is a decent number of deals on Arm-based laptops, all with excellent battery. In fact, you can expect savings of up to 36% off depending on which one you pick!

This configuration of the Surface Laptop utilizes a Snapdragon X Elite, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. 

The Surface Pro with an OLED display and Snapdragon X Elite, along with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, is at a good price, but you'll still have to buy a mouse and keyboard.

This Snapdragon X Elite-based laptop has a 2880 x 1800, 13.4-inch display, 512GB of SSD storage, and 16GB of memory.

This cheaper laptop uses an entry-level Snapdragon X chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. It has a 15.3-inch display with a 1920 x 1200 resolution.

For the size of the discount and that very cool form factor, my pick is the 13-inch Surface Pro!

This $11 100W flat charging cable is basically built for gaming handhelds, but I like it for other uses, too



We've all had handheld devices conk out while we'd still prefer to be using them, but it's no fun holding a device with a big cable poking out of the top, bottom, or side. Baseus' 100W charging cable makes that experience a little bit easier and a lot more comfortable, with its flat-topped, angled USB-C port, flat braided cable, and 100W, 5A charging capabilities.

Baseus MVP 3 flat-top USB-C charging cable: $11 on Amazon (was $15)Want to use your mobile device while it's charging without having to contort your fingers around the USB-C cable? Baseus has you covered with its angled, flat-topped braided charging cable. It supports up to 100W and is available in 3.3 or 6.6-foot lengths.

Available in both 3.3-foot and 6.6-foot lengths, it makes charging and gaming (or just scrolling on your phone) more comfortable. The shorter model is for charging off a battery pack, but I'd opt for the 6.6-foot model (which costs $4 more) if you're going to use the cable from a charger plugged into a wall. I also like this cable for charging my laptop on cramped flights and commutes, and its flat nature makes it easy to find in my cable drawer when I need it.

The large top of the USB-C plug will block adjacent ports or vents on some gaming handhelds, though, so it may not be ideal for your particular use case. Consider that before buying. Also, as with most charging-specific cables, this one isn't great for data, as it's capped at slow USB 2.0 speeds.

If you're anything like me, your keyboard is probably filthy. I'll spare you the details, as I'm sure you'd be happy to spare me. Our little secret, this Vichyie keyboard cleaning kit brush gets you a massive arsenal of tiny tools to clean your keyboard, all housed in a glorious multi-tool design. Oh, and it's only 11 bucks.

Remember, it's only a Vichyie keyboard cleaning kit if it comes from the Vichy region of France. Otherwise, it's just a sparkling keyboard brush.

We've just seen a discount on an RTX 5080 gaming laptop that signals they're finally getting a bit more affordable. This ROG Strix G16 is now $600, $2,399 instead of $2,899 for an RTX 5080 with 1TB SSD, Intel Ultra 9 275HX, and 32GB of DDR5 RAM.

Lowest-ever price

Naturally, the priciest model has the biggest discount, some $600 off the RTX 5080 version. This is otherwise the same as the 5070 Ti, so you're really paying for the GPU here. SSD, CPU, RAM, and display all match the cheaper 5070 Ti model. 

If you want to save a bit more, there's also a chunk off the 5070 Ti and 5060 versions

Prime Day is a great time to upgrade to USB4 cables, with prices starting at $8



USB4 has become an increasingly common part of my tech life, via my AMD-powered Asus Zenbook and because I test external drives like the Corsair EX400U. And considering the stagnation of Thunderbolt 5 outside of some high-end Apple products and a couple of gaming laptops, USB4 looks like it's going to be more or less the standard for fast data connectivity for most people going forward. So I picked up a couple of USB4 cables from Cable Matters early this year, which have worked well for me, as well as a cheaper model from a... less-known brand. And now they are on sale for Prime Day.

Cable Matters 40Gbps USB 4 Cable (6.6ft): now $18 at Amazon (was $22)These cables are certified by the USB-IF to meet USB4 standards, support 40Gbps data and up to 240W charging, and are compatible with Thunderbolt 4 (though they may run at slower speeds). The longer 6.6-foot length is good for running behind desks or keeping your high-speed data device or dock away from your desktop or laptop.

Cable Matters 40Gbps USB 4 Cable (3.3ft): now $12 at Amazon (was $15)These cables are certified by the USB-IF to meet USB4 standards, support 40Gbps data and up to 240W charging, and are compatible with Thunderbolt 4 (though they may run at slower speeds). The 3.3-foot length is good for a lot of use cases where you want to plug in something close by, but not right next to your PC or laptop.

These cables aren't the cheapest, but they are certified and from a known brand with a reputation to maintain, so they are worth paying extra for. That said, if you want to spend less, I picked up this 3.3ft braided USB4 cable a couple of months ago, and it's been working fine so far. It's currently on sale for $8. Just don't complain if it fails, gets hot, runs slower than it should, or even goes up in smoke eventually. When you buy cables from a brand called "gudxfj," you should be aware that you are taking a gamble. Again though, my gudxfj cable has been working fine so far.

Albo 50 Pcs Colorful Cable Ties: now $13 at Amazon (was $16)These reusable hook-and-loop cable ties come in five colors so you can keep your cables sorted, are six inches long so they should work with larger cables, and with 50 of them, you should be able to keep all your cables tidy. 

One other thing you might also want to consider if you're swimming in a sea of old and generic USB cables like me is how you're going to be able to find these faster cables when you need them. One easy way would be to pick up some colorful cable wraps and loop one onto the cables. This 50-pack is currently on sale for $12. That will help keep your cables tidy when not in use, and you'll probably be able to spot the blue or green wrap in your cable drawer when you need it.

With 40% off, this 64 piece electronics toolkit is an irresistible purchase

I recently wrote about the best PC tools that you can pick up during the Amazon Prime Day and it seems that this 64 piece electronics toolkit has become rather popular.

This small kit has all the tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx / Torx security and many others. You also get spudgers and pry tools, tweezers, brush, and a magnetizer / demagnetizer for your screwdriver bits.

This precision kit has pretty much every tool that you could need to maintain a PC, all in a handy case.

You also get spudgers and pry tools, tweezers, brush, and a magnetizer / demagnetizer for your screwdriver bits.

So whether you are building a new PC, repairing an old one, fixing a phone or taking apart an old games console, this sub $10 kit is an impulse purchase!

For as little as $15, you can say goodbye to your clunky laptop power brick forever



One of the best things about USB making its way into pretty much every laptop for the last several years is that, unless you have a gaming laptop, you can charge on the go without the bulky power brick that most manufacturers still ship with their laptops. And many gaming laptops will also charger over USB-C, just not at full power, so you can't charge and game at the same time. I've used several small GaN chargers over the years, at home and while traveling, and a few of my favorites are on sale for Prime Day. Just note that not all of these models include a fast-charge USB cable, so you may need to buy one of those as well, if you don't already have one.





XSufr 65W Flat USB C Wall Charger: now $15 at Amazon (was $30)This tiny, foldable charger is smaller than a deck of cards and has one USB-C and one USB-A port, with a max output of 65W and 45W max from the USB-C port. 

I know what you're thinking: XSufr? Really? Do I want to trust my laptop and potentially my life to a no-name brand that sounds like it's trying to inflict pain? That's fair. All I can say is that I've used this charger several times in the last six months and never had an issue. If you want more peace of mind, consider the next charger.

Baseus 65W Flat Wall Charger: $28 at Amazon(was $49)

This pocket-friendly charger is just 0.66 inches thick, with fold-down prongs and two USB ports. The USB-C tops out at 45W and the USB-A can deliver up to 20W.

Lots of people haven't heard of Baseus either, but it's a quickly rising competitor to brands like Anker, and I've been using this as my main laptop charger for about 10 months now with no issues and no complaints. It would be nice if it had a second USB-C port for my phone, though. And that brings me to the third option.

Anker Prime 67W USB-C Charger: now $35 at Amazon (was $60)This 67W charger is a little less travel-friendly than some others, but it's still tiny, and has three ports: two USB-C and one USB-A. 

SteelSeries' Aerox 3 wireless gaming mouse is perfect if you're looking for a stripped-down lightweight mouse — so long as you don't mind the holes — and it's currently just $59.98 at Amazon (down 50% from its retail price of $119.99).

SteelSeries Aerox 3 is a lightweight, wireless gaming mouse with bright RGB lighting and a hole-filled chassis, and it's currently 50% off.

The Aerox 3 Wireless is a 68g wireless gaming mouse with a perforated chassis — so it's not great if you have trypophobia. The interior parts are shielded and have an IP54 rating, so you don't have to worry too much about dust or liquid messing with the mouse (though you obviously shouldn't run it through a wash cycle). It features both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity, and offers up to 200 hours of battery life with the lighting off. We haven't reviewed this exact model, but you can take a look at our review of the wired SteelSeries Aerox 3 here.— Sarah



Our favorite wireless gaming keyboard, the Asus ROG Strix Scope II, is currently down to just $161.49 at Amazon, which is 23% off the current retail price of $209.99. This gaming keyboard features a 96-percent layout, which means it has a 10-key numberpad but isn't nearly as large as a typical full-size board.

This 96-percent keyboard features a hot-swappable PCB, a three-way knob and multifunction button for media controls, and comes with a perfectly sized wrist-rest. It also sounds great, thanks to sound-dampening foam in the case.

The ROG Strix Scope II is a hot-swappable mechanical keyboard that comes with Asus' ROG NX switches in either Snow (linear) or Storm (clicky). It features extra sound-dampening in the case, double-shot PCB keycaps with shine-through legends, customizable RGB, and a nearly-full-size layout in a much more compact form factor. It also offers up to 1,500 hours of battery life with the lighting turned off (this drops to 90 hours with the lighting turned on, which is decent but not nearly as good as 1,500 hours). It's one of our favorite keyboards because it sounds great and offers just about everything you need — including a 10-key numpad.

If you're a gamer with some upgrade cash burning a hole in your pocket, but you're not impressed with any of the graphics card deals out there right now, it might be time to take a long, hard look at your gaming monitor.

A 60 Hz display might not be showing you all the frames your powerful gaming PC can push, and if you're still playing at 1080p, you might not be seeing all the detail you can squeeze out of modern games.

Newegg has a couple good deals on high-resolution, high-refresh-rate displays we think are worth a look for a smoother, richer gaming experience.

First up, the Gigabyte M27Q X boasts a crisp 1440p resolution and a blistering 240 Hz refresh rate with AMD FreeSync VRR tech. All that is perfect for showing off every pixel and frame a powerful graphics card can push.

The Gigabyte M27Q X 27" monitor has it all: a blistering refresh rate with VRR support, a wide color gamut, and a crisp 1440p resolution. This display even has a built-in KVM switch for seamless usage across multiple devices, and it's at an all-time low price of $279.99 at Newegg right now, no gimmicks required.

If you'd rather step up to the extra eye candy only a 4K display can provide, Gigabyte's M28U can also get you there at a good price. Its 144Hz refresh rate will keep games smooth and fluid even with its exceedingly crisp resolution, and it has the same wide color support and AMD FreeSync VRR support as the M27Q X above.

Gigabyte's M28U packs a 4K resolution into a 28" diagonal for exceedingly crisp and colorful gaming. It has a wide color gamut, a fast 144Hz refresh rate, and AMD FreeSync VRR support to keep games fluid and smooth. At $329.99 at Newegg, it's at an all-time low price, no gimmicks required.

Gaming monitors can last over multiple PCs builds, so it's smart to get a good one like either of these Gigabyte displays while they're on deep discount. Your eyes will thank you, especially if your current display dates from last decade.

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage, and it is still going strong three days later.

This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also utilizes the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, rather than the performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology found on budget drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. -- Paul Alcorn

If you're looking for an RTX 4080 or RTX 4070 laptop, Dell's already strong Prime Day deals just got...Prime-ier. Dell just marked down three laptops even further, slashing off another $300 to $400 off laptops that were already selling at deep discounts. The following two Alienware x16 R2 (RTX 4080) laptops got another $300 price cut, bringing them down to $2,099 and $2,199, respectively (the first has a 1 GB SSD, the second has a 2 TB SSD).

This powerful Dell laptop packs in Nvidia's RTX 4080 mobile GPU. Accompanying the 4080 is Intel's Core Ultra 9 185H processor with 16 cores and a P-core boost speed up to 5.10GHz. Other hardware specifications include 32GB of 7467MHz DDR5 RAM and a 1TB NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD for storage. 

This Alienware laptop sports Nvidia's RTX 4080 8GB mobile GPU. Accompanying the 4080 is Intel's Core Ultra 9 185H processor with 16 cores and a P-core boost speed up to 5.10GHz. Other hardware specifications include 32GB of 7467MHz DDR5 RAM and a 1 TB NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD for storage. 

Get the 16-inch Dell XPS laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, and 2 TB M2 NVMe SSD. You can also play around with the config to get some extra upgrades in. 

Dell also just took another $400 off the XPS 16 Laptop (RTX 4060), bringing it down to $2,499. Honestly, we're surprised to see the deeper cuts on these models — they've been on sale already for several days. That means we might not see these deeper cuts last long.

If you're looking for a fast and affordable monitor at bargain basement pricing, but with good enough features, the Phantom PG27F15RS1A fits the bill at a mere $104, a savings of 54% over MSRP.

The Phantom PG27F15RS1A may "only" be a 1080p monitor, but it has a 1ms response time and an incredible 240 Hz refresh rate for just over $100.

The Phantom Gaming is one of the most affordable options we've encountered in its class, and while you're settling for a VA panel, at least it's a good one, offering 27 inches of real estate and a 240 Hz refresh rate with support for FreeSync. It also has a 1ms response time. This monitor also has a 1500R curve and offers solid connectivity options at this price point, including two HDMI 2.0 ports and one DisplayPort 2.1 port. That's all good enough if you're looking to get a solid monitor on the cheap, and you'd be hard pressed to find this type of value at any time other than Prime Day.

Gaming monitors with fast panels can be expensive. But for Prime Day, we found the Asus TUF Gaming VG27AQ with a 27-inch, 1440p screen and 165 Hz refresh rate that hit a new low price of $198.55.

New for day two, all-time low price!

This 27-inch TUF Gaming 27-inch monitor has an IPS panel and dropped to an all-time low price. This QHD monitor features a 165 Hz refresh rate, 1 ms response time, and is VESA mountable. It also has both DisplayPort and HDMI input options. 

The TUF Gaming monitor also boasts an IPS display with a 1ms response time, Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, and is VESA mountable. Like many monitors, you'll get your choice of either DisplayPort or HDMI. (HDMI 2.0, however, isn't the latest standard.)Asus also has its own "Extreme Low Motion Blur", or ELMB, to help reduce tearing during game play. This can be run at the same time as Nvidia G-Sync. There are also a handful of HDR modes to choose from.

LG's Gram Pro 16, among the company's line of ultra-thin, extremely light notebooks, often come at a price premium. For Prime Day, it's on sale for $1,684.99, it's lowest price ever.

LG's Gram Pro 16 is 0.5 inches thick and 2.73 pounds. The system includes a second-gen Intel Core Ultra processor, 32GB of RAM, a 2TB SSD, and a 16-inch, 2560 x 1600 display.

The Gram Pro 16 is half an inch thin and weighs 2.73 pounds. The system is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor along with a roomy 2TB SSD and 32GB of RAM.LG's 16-inch screen has a 2560 x 1600 resolution and has a variable refresh rate between 31 Hz and 144 Hz. Other specs include a 77 WHr battery and a nice mix of ports, including a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI output, two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. We haven't had the chance to test this system ourselves, but for those who value thinnness and lightness above all else and are willing to pay a premium for it, that premium is a bit less today than usual.

If you have headphones (and come on, most of us do) for your PC, you know how much desk space they can take up. And most headphone stands only make the problem worse by adding their footprint to your table.

A few years ago, I solved the headphone problem by purchasing this EURPMASK rotating headphone stand. It clips onto the side of my desk and rotates 180 degrees so I can hang my headphones under the desk or facing outward.

Now, the EURPMASK is on sale for just $7.69, which is such a good deal compared to its $12.99 list.

EURPMASK Rotating Headphone Stand: was $12.99, now $7.69 at AmazonThis headphone stand clips on to your desk so your headphones can hang off of the side rather than taking up valuable table real estate.

One thing I've noticed about the EURPMASK is that it is long enough to hold not one, but two headsets. So I can hang a couple of pairs there and really keep my desk neat.



The Lian Li DK-07X is a motorized standing desk that features support for dual E-ATX PC systems. That means you can house up to two full PC builds inside of it, with room for two E-ATX motherboards, two graphics cards, 12 fans, 14 drives, and two PSUs. Or, naturally, if you only need one PC in your desk, you can have more fans and drives in a single configuration.

Other features include built-in cable organization, wireless charging pads, and multiple USB ports. Now $200 off at Amazon during Prime Day.

Of course, this desk also works as a sit-stand desk with adjustable height, powered by a motor. 

There are only four of these Samsung 49-inch Odyssey OLED G9 curved monitors, down to their lowest ever price of $879, 37% off and a new saving for the second day of Prime Day.

Banish wires, hide mess, gain clarity

I've recently moved house and my first thought for the new office was "I need to work on my cable management", seriously it was!

I love a messy desk, it shows the thought process of a hundred projects and it makes me feel happy. But I also don't want to trash my new home. I have some pride! So how can I have all my 3D printers, PCs, lights, audio / video equipment etc but minimize the clutter?I needed some help and these three products did indeed help me.

We kick off with the ubiquitous cable / cord management kits. These kits come with adhesive holders for all manner of wires. Some clamp down, others grip using friction. A few more lock the cable / wire in place. There are also some connectors for cable ties, wire wrapping and sleeves to group wires together so they look less messy.

Everything you need to tame the mess of wires that lurks behind your desk.

Cable ties are great but the problem is that they are disposable. We have to cut them loose when we need to move or remove a cable. Instead of these, I use reusable cable ties and Amazon has a load on sale for Prime Day.

These hook and loop cable ties will hold up to six inch thicknesses of cables and we get a pack of 60 to tidy up our lives!

Sixty reusable cable ties for under $6 is a great deal. They hold firm and are easy to remove when we need to.

Running cables around the perimeter of the office, I want them to be invisible, but accessible, and these conduits are just the thing!

This kit contains six, 15.7 inch lengths that are self-adhesive and can be used on walls, under desks and behind cabinets.

Stick it to the wall, under your desk and tidy those cables. They are self-adhesive and hide the cables from sight, but the open side makes it easy to gain access to a cable when you need to

We've picked up all the best 2TB models and listed them based on price and performance. Turns out you can get a smaller 2TB driver for less than half the price, making buying two more cost-effective than buying one 4TB drive, if you have the space, of course.

The 16-inch Alienware X16 R2 gaming laptop is now at all-time low pricing. This laptop comes packing a 16-core Intel Core 7 155H CPU and last-gen RTX 4070 GPU with 8GB of VRAM, but that's a solid amount of horsepower considering this price point.

All-time low price!

The 16-inch Alienware X16 R2 gaming laptop features a 16-core Core Ultra 7 155H processor, an RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of memory, and a 1TB SSD. The QHD+ panel has a blazing 240 Hz refresh rate and 3ms latency. 

This laptop is all about gaming, with a 16" QHD+ display (2560 x 1600) that runs at a speedy 240 Hz and sports a 3ms refresh rate. The system also comes with 16GB of DDR5-7467 memory and a 1 TB SSD. Other amenities include two USB-C ports (3.2 Gen 2 and DisplayPort), an HDMI 2.1 port, a Type-A USB port (3.2 Gen 1), a headphone jack, and a MicroSD card reader.

Yes, this laptop has a previous-gen GPU, but it is more than worth the asking price, so we expect these to fly off the shelves in short order.

This tiny magnetic, USB-charging flashlight is great for PC building and other everyday tasks – and it's on sale for just $14



I picked up the OLIGHT IMINI 2 mini flashlight a few months ago on impulse, because it looked well designed and cost around $20, but now it's down to just below $14, and I'm tempted to pick up a couple as gifts. The simplicity of its design and its built-in USB-A plug for charging makes it fun to use – just pull the back off and it turns on, and the magnet lets you easily mount it anywhere you need a little extra light, like inside a steel PC case while you're fiddling with fan or RGB wires or looking for that screw you dropped.

The OLIGHT IMINI 2 EDC Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight: now $14 at Amazon (was $20)At just 2.17 inches long, this flashlight is rated to 50 lumens, and it sports a magnetic back with a USB-A plug for charging. Pulling the back off turns on the flashlight, and the magnetic back makes it easy to mount the light on anything with ferrous metal.

The OLIGHT IMINI 2 is also small enough for your keychain, is designed to live with your keys, and includes two silicone covers for the USB port and a little carabiner clip. But the flashlight portion is only held to the charging port via a magnet, and I feel like (for me, at least) it would fall off and get lost before too long. It sticks to the metal support strip on a shelf near my front door, so I keep it there and frequently find myself making excuses to use it. It's a fun little flashlight that kicks out a surprising amount of light, considering it's about the size of a stubby pinky finger. It's not going to replace a full-sized flashlight, but it's very handy when you need something more fun and convenient (at least in some ways) than your smartphone's flashlight.

If you're on the hunt for a great SSD, this Samsung 990 EVO Plus SSD 2TB is down to its lowest-ever price, just $113 thanks to a massive 36% discount. That makes it better value than the 4TB model at $0.05 per GB. With speeds of 7,250MB/s (read) and 6,300MB/s (write), it's also very snappy compared to cheaper 2TB alternatives.

Get a 2TB EVO Plus for the lowest-ever price of $113, with PCIe Gen 5 technology, HMB, and Turbowrite 2.0. 

Undecided on a 2TB SSD? We've got a run down of every drive on the market with a breakdown of speeds, price, and cost per GB.

Hoto's snap-together tool kits are great for keeping cramped workspaces tidy, and they're nearly 30% off



The USB-C-charging SNAPBLOQ R-A04 Mini Cordless Rotary Tool, D-A03 Electric Mini Drill Pen, and S-A01 3.7V Mini Electric Screwdriver from Hoto are compact and color-coded tool sets that snap together via magnets. They let you keep a surprising amount of tools in a small space, perfect for cramped project spaces. The SNAPBLOQ kits typically sell for $100 each, which makes the trio quite expensive, despite their smart design. During Prime Day, though, all three kits are on sale for $20 off, plus an additional "brand promotion" coupon of 10%, taking them down to $71 each. That's still expensive, but significantly less so, especially if you plan to pick up two or three of these kits rather than just one.

Hoto's slim rotary tool sports a 4V brushless motor, variable speed up to 22000 RPM, and 38 accessories to compete with your old Dremel. Like the other kits, it also comes in a magnetic snap-together shell that keeps your accessories all together and connects to the other tool kits. 

With three speeds, a built-in light, and 20 bits, the Hoto Drill Pen is built for working with 3D Prints, wood, acrylic, and even metal. It's not going to replace a much larger drill, but for precise hobby tasks, it should serve you well.

The Hoto mini electric screwdriver has 56 bits for just about any small project or repair, and a maximum torque rating of 0.5 N⋅m at 250 RPM. It's good for working with small electronics, servicing laptops, and building PCs, but you may want something larger with a bit more power for tough-to-loosen thumb screws.

If you're wondering what the difference is between the three devices, other than their bits, it comes down to torque and RPM. The screwdriver tops out at a rated 250 RPM; the mini drill has 600, 900, and 1200RPM settings; and the rotary tool has a stepless range between 1500 and 2200 RPM. Not everyone will need all three, but they're designed for very different tasks.

Good morning! If you're in the UK looking for a Prime Day deal on a graphics card, well, the RTX 5070 has just fallen below £500, thanks to this 5% saving on the MSI RTX 5070 Shadow 2X, dubbed as such because it comes with two fans, now just £499 at Amazon.

The GeForce RTX 5070 offers potent baseline performance for 1080p and 1440p gaming, plus support for Nvidia's DLSS 4 tech. This two-fan card from MSI will fit in pretty much any build thanks to its compact size.

I've been furiously printing with the Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 combo, and it's currently $100 off, just $399



If you're curious about 3D printing or you want to step up to something that can handle multi-color prints, you might want to consider Anycubic's Kobra 3 V2 combo – especially now that it's down to just $399 at Amazon. That's just $110 more than the typical cost of the four-color AMS / filament heater that comes with it. I've been using this printer for a couple of months now, and I've been very happy with it as my first 3D printer, so much so that I ordered the larger Kobra 3 Max, which is also on sale for $449 without the multi-color AMS module.





The Anycubic Kobra 3 V2: now $399 at Amazon (was $499)The Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 combo is a bed-slinging 3D printer with a 255×255×260 mm (10x10x10.2 inches) build volume and print speeds up to 600 mm/s. It also comes with an AMS (automatic material system), a box that holds four spools of filament that are automatically fed to the printer. The AMS is also capable of heating / drying the filament, which is important because humidity is the enemy of successful prints.



My experience with the Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 as a 3D printing novice has been solidly positive. The automatic bed leveling has worked every time for me. And while I have had a few failed prints here and there, as well as some lifting at the corners, I put most of that down to inexperience (and the fact that my air conditioner blows across the outer edge of my printer bed). There are some basic things to consider with this (and basically any) multi-color printer with a single extruder. Switching colors during a print wastes a fair amount of filament, as the extruder needs to purge the nozzle area. So prints with lots of colors in different layers will create a lot of printer "poop" and also be significantly slower. Still, if you're really excited about complex multi-color prints, you can pick up a second AMS from Anycubic and connect two to the Kobra V3, for 8-color printing. But personally, I have yet to use more than two or three colors in a print.



If you're looking for a great gaming headset that both sounds good and will make you sound good, our favorite wireless headset is currently on sale at 25% off. The Xbox and PS5 versions of Razer's BlackShark V2 Pro wireless headset are currently priced at $149.99 at Amazon — down $50 from the retail price of $199.99.

Razer's BlackShark V2 Pro wireless headset is comfortable and lightweight, sounds good for both music and gaming, and has one of the best on-headset boom microphones we've ever tested.

The BlackShark V2 Pro is a wireless over-ear gaming headset with both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity (though, not simultaneous audio-mixing), 50mm titanium dynamic drivers, and a comfortable, lightweight build that you can wear all day. While the EQ needs a little tuning out of the box, once you've done some tweaking the headset sounds great for both music and gaming, and it also comes with several pro-tuned game presets for popular titles such as Fortnite and Apex Legends. All EQ tuning saves directly to the headset, so your sound tweaks will be available whether you're listening on your PC, console, or phone.

The standout feature on the BlackShark V2 Pro is its detachable "HyperClear Super Wideband" mic, which is a 9.9mm condenser mic that will make you sound fantastic. As my colleague, Andrew, once (famously) said, "That mic makes you sound better than you do in real life." No need to pick up a standalone gaming mic with this headset!

It may have been released three years ago, but Razer's DeathAdder V3 Pro is still one of my favorite mice — and my favorite Razer mouse — ever. And it's currently on sale for just $86.44 at Amazon (in black), down 42% from its retail price of $149.99.

The DeathAdder V3 Pro is a lightweight wireless gaming mouse with a fantastic shape, Razer's Focus Pro 30K optical sensor, and up to 90 hours of battery life. It weighs just 63g and is perfect for a range of gamers. 

The DeathAdder V3 Pro is a lightweight wireless gaming mouse with one of the best shapes we've ever tested — a right-handed ergonomic shape that makes the mouse feel like an extension of your arm. It features Razer's Focus Pro 30K optical sensor, which has a maximum resolution of 30,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 750 IPS, and can handle up to 70 G's of force. It's a fairly simple, stripped down mouse otherwise, with five programmable buttons, a notched scroll wheel, and two forms of connectivity: 2.4GHz wireless and wired (USB-C). It has none of the extra frills you'll see in other gaming mice, such as customizable RGB lighting or Bluetooth, because it's designed for performance — and it's a fantastic performer. It fits perfectly in your hand and weighs just 2.22 ounces (63g — 64g in white), has tactile, clicky optical switches, and gets up to 90 hours of battery life.

If you're looking for the ultimate in PC gaming performance, it's hard to beat the Alienware Area-51 with RTX 5090 GPU and Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU. Right now, Dell has this configuration of the Area-51, which includes 64GB of RAM, a 4TB SSD and a 1,500W power supply for just $5,199, a $900 discount off of its $6,099 list.

Alienware Area-51 (RTX 5090, Core Ultra 9 285K): was $6099, now $5199 at DellThis tricked-out configuration of the Alienware Area-51 sports an RTX 5090 GPU, Core Ultra 9 285K CPU, 64GB of RAM, a 4TB SSD, and a 1,500W power supply.

We reviewed a similar configuration of the Alienware Area-51 (but with a 2TB SSD) back in April and were blown away by its performance. For example, you can see how it fared in Cyberpunk 2077 at both 1080p and 4K with ray tracing and Ultra settings.



The desktop was smooth as butter even at 4K with the settings turned up. So, if you're looking for the ultimate in PC performance, this deal is hard to beat.

We haven't seen many graphics card deals from Amazon itself this Prime Day, but Newegg has a couple aggressive discounts on a pair of RTX 50-series graphics cards. As long as you're OK getting your savings back as a Newegg gift card, you can get an RTX 5060 or an RTX 5070 for less than MSRP—a rare event in today's graphics card market.

First up, Newegg will give you $50 back on one of Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5060 cards, taking it from $339.99 to an effective $289.99. This is among the lowest prices we've seen on an RTX 5060 card so far, and it's a solid pick for 1080p gaming so long as you can live within its 8GB of VRAM. The RTX 5060 already has modest power requirements, so Asus' triple-fan cooler should keep this card plenty cool and quiet.

The GeForce RTX 5060 8GB is a solid graphics card for 1080p gaming, and its Blackwell architecture gives gamers access to Nvdia's full range of DLSS 4 upscaling and framegen features. 

ASUS' Prime card has a nice triple-fan cooler that's rarely seen in cards around Nvidia's $300 MSRP, and this Newegg deal goes $10 lower than that.

If you have a higher-resolution, higher-refresh-rate monitor and you're looking for a Blackwell upgrade, it's worth checking out MSI's Ventus 3X OC take on the GeForce RTX 5070 12GB.

The GeForce RTX 5070 offers potent baseline performance for 1080p and 1440p gaming plus support for Nvidia's DLSS 4 tech. MSI's triple-fan Ventus 3X OC version of this card should keep things cool and quiet. Stack a $20 rebate and $70 back on a Newegg gift card, and this card comes out to $20 under Nvidia's $550 MSRP for this card, making it one of the cheapest RTX 5070s we've seen so far.  

The RTX 5070 brings a strong triple threat to the midrange of the GPU market: enough raster and ray-tracing performance at 1440p to natively push high-resolution monitors, plus Nvidia's superior DLSS 4 upscaling and unique multi-frame generation capability.

This MSI Ventus card is a good catch if you can grab MSI's own rebate and don't mind spending $70 of Newegg bucks at some point in the future.

The Dell S3222DGM has long sat atop our list of best gaming monitors. This 32-inch, 2560 x 1440 display has an epic contrast ratio of 3,700:1 and a speedy, 165 Hz refresh rate. It also has excellent build quality and vibrant color.

Now, the Dell S3222DGM is on sale for $263 at Best Buy, down from $329. That's not the cheapest it has ever been, but it's the least expensive it has been in a while and the cheapest it's likely to be for a while still.

Dell S3222DGM, 32-inch 2K 165 Hz Monitor: now $263 at Best Buy (was $329)This is the lowest price we've seen in a while. The S3222DGM has an epic contrast ratio, speedy 165 Hz refresh rate, a curved panel and a 2560 x 1440 resolution. 

According to our colorimeter, the Dell S3222DGM can show 122.6 percent of the sRGB gamut and 85.9 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut. The color quality also stands out because of the high contrast ratio. Those bright colors will look extra bright when the dark pixels next to them look really dark.



Overall, this is a great combination of price, performance and quality. At this low price, it may be time to buy.



My Sabrent HB-BU10 is one of my favorite accessories and one I could not do without. This powered, USB 3.0 hub has a whopping 10 Type-A ports, each with its own toggle switch. It's also extremely well-built with attractive blue power lights and toggle switches that have a sturdy, clicky feel.

For Prime Day, the HB-BU10 is now $37.99, reduced from $44.99 at Amazon. At that price, it's quite a bargain and well worth the spend.

Sabrent 10-port USB Hub: was $44.99, now $37.99 at AmazonThis 10-port, USB 3.0 hub has durable, on-off switches for each of its connectors. That allows you to disable peripherals as needed.

Using the HB-BU10, I can connect every peripheral on my desk and then-sone, including my webcam, external SSDs, USB speaker, microSD card reader and Yubikey security key. But the toggle switches are what make this hub really stand out.

Using the switches, I can easily toggle between my headset and my USB speaker. I just turn off the speaker and turn on the wireless dongle for my wireless headset, no going into Windows settings to switch audio devices.

I can also use the toggle switches with microcontrollers such as a Raspberry Pi Pico that normally need to be unplugged and replugged to reboot. However, I need only press the toggle switch twice and I've rebooted.

Gaming laptops are usually the stars of the show, but there are plenty of productivity-focused laptops on offer during Prime Day.

OLED monitors are gaining popularity due to their perfect blacks and superior contrast, so we've rounded up the best OLED panels we've seen so far for Prime Day, and of the six, we've chosen the Alienware AW3423DWF to highlight as a lower-cost option.

The Alienware AW3423DWF is getting up there in age, but it's still a highly desirable QD-OLED monitor that strikes a sweet spot with its 34-inch WQHD panel and a 165 Hz refresh rate.

The Alienware AW3423DWF is a great panel that continues to impress despite its age, and it's $100 off for Prime Day. The 34-inch monitor sports a QD-OLED panel with a 3440 x 1440 resolution that blasts along at a 165 Hz refresh rate.



We tested this panel thoroughly in our in-depth review, finding it to have wonderful motion processing and SDR and HDR color performance, ultimately awarding it five stars.

--Paul Alcorn

If you want an OLED monitor with almost no downsides, this might be the ultimate Prime Day deal. We've clocked our five-star rated, "near-perfect" Alienware 360Hz 1440p QD-OLED AW2725DF at $300 off, making it just $599 and a steal this Prime Day.

Incredible savings on a top-of-the-line OLED monitor.

Alienware's AW2725DF is a beast of a gaming monitor with its 1440p resolution paired with a 360Hz refresh rate, all powered by a stunning QD-OLED panel. It delivers knockout HDR performance for movies and games alike, features 0.03ms response times, and rocks a futuristic design on the back. This is already an easy recommendation, now at its reduced price, we're almost begging you not to miss it.

As you can see from our testing, this monitor shines in benchmarking; the only downsides we could find were no internal speakers and no 3.5mm headphone jack. But at $300 off, we're quite happy to put those quibbles aside.

You can get a super fast external storage device sale this Prime Day, but for that you'll have to opt for an SSD. You can also get a slower yet more capacious and affordable hard drive that hits the spot at a sweet deal, too, bringing us to your two options.

This drive features 5TB of spacious storage, a two-year warranty, and communicates via a USB-A connection at 5Gbps (USB 3.2 Gen 1). The drive is 4.35 x 3.23 x 0.83" as well, so it's a nice compact form factor that weighs in at a mere half a pound. It comes wiht a two-year warranty. 

The WD 5TB Elements portable external HDD hits the spot with 5TB of storage for a mere $115, a nice savings for Prime Day. This svelte device weighs in at a mere half of a pound and connects to PCs or Macs via a standard USB 3.2 Gen 1 connection. Naturally this won't be the fastest drive out there due to its spinning platters, but it'll get the job done for bulk storage.

The SteelSeries Arena 9 are our top pick for best PC speakers when it comes to surround sound. With 5.1 configuration and 300 watts of power they are a truly wall-shaking solution to your gaming setup.

Right now they're 34% off at Amazon thanks to Prime Day, now just $449 instead of $679. We've seen them for less, but it's unlikely this price will be beaten during the Prime Day week.

Get 5.1 surround sound and 20000Hz frequency response and RGB illumination. 

We loved these speakers in our Arena 9 review, specifically because they're very powerful and offer fantastic audio with true surround sound. Aside from how much space any 5.1 system takes up, our only ever gripe has been the price, which makes this 34% saving all the more alluring.

It's tough these days to find a GPU at even close to reasonable pricing, so gamers often have to opt to buy a full gaming PC to get a decent deal. That's definitely the case with this gaming PC from CyberPowerPC, which is one of the cheapest ways to get your hands on an RTX 5070. This system is currently 15% off for Prime Day, saving you $300.

The CyberPowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC features an RTX 5070 and an Intel Core i9-14900KF, paired with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. This is enough power to let you play the latest titles at 1440p and enjoy your favorite VR games.

For $1,680, the Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC comes armed with an RTX 5070 paired with Intel's fastest gaming chip, the Core i9-14900KF. The system is also equipped with 32GB of RAM that will keep things snappy even during multi-tasking, and a 2TB SSD.

Considering an RTX 5070 costs $600, the 14900KF is ~$400, and the motherboard, RAM, PSU, case, and SSD total around $640, this is as close to paying just the cost of the components as you'll often get when buying a gaming PC. I have a feeling this one will sell out quickly.

At least two Tom's Hardware editors own the HOTO NEX 01 Pro screwdriver which has 33% off for Amazon Prime Day

HOTO NEX 01 Pro is one of those products that you don't know that you need, until you are building a PC case / IKEA furniture / 3D Printer. It has great torque, looks great and it charges via USB-C. No wonder two members of the team bought one.

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.

The kit comes with a selection of Phillips, Hex, Slot, Torx, and Pozidrive 1/4 inch bits and a stand to keep the screwdriver and bits on your desk. Torque control is via a control ring, and a rocker power button controls forward and reverse rotation.

Charging is via USB-C and from each full charge you get around 1000 screws.

I am one of the staff members who owns this screwdriver, and I've built many IKEA cabinets and recently built an arcade cabinet using this great screwdriver.

I own these Hollyland Lark M2 wireless lavalier microphones and they are awesome, and now cheaper for Amazon Prime Day!

This is a deal that I can personally stand behind, because I bought the Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphone back in December 2024, and it wasn't this cheap!

With noise cancelation, long-range Hollyland Lark M2 microphones are an excellent choice for conference calls, content creation, and interviews.

The kit comes in a charging case, with two microphones and a receiver. You can get versions with Apple's lightning connector, as well as a shoe connector for DSLRs. For me, I chose the USB Type-C version for use with my Android phone, and via a USB Type-C to USB Type-A adapter into my PC I use it for team meetings and for presenting our show, The Pi Cast. I just clip the microphone to my shirt using the magnetic back and I am ready to go. All the while resisting the urge to tap the microphone like a communicator from Star Trek: The Next Generation.

To control the microphones, there is a single button that turns on / off noise cancellation. A long press will mute / unmute your microphone. For more features there is an accompanying Android / iOS app that enables individual control of audio levels, and noise cancellation.

The Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphones come with a kit bag full of extras. Lanyards to hold the microphone magnetically, wind muffs (also known as dead cats) to block wind noise, magnetic lapel clips, and weirdly some colorful stickers to hide the microphones. When not in use, the two microphones and the receiver are contained in a plastic case with onboard LiPo battery charging, just like Airpods. When you are done with them, throw them in the charging case and they will charge ready for the next interview.

Paired with a good set of headphones, you have an excellent platform for content creation.

I genuinely love these microphones, they are much easier to use than clunky wired mics, and I can use them across many different devices without the need for drivers.

Amazon Prime Day has brought us a massive sale on the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD range. These snappy drives boast read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s and write speeds of 13,400MB/s. Ideal for gaming, computing, or workstations, they're some of the most premium hard drives around.

Ideal for gaming or workstations, this 9100 Pro from Samsung has read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s and is a hefty $150 off, down to its lowest-ever price of $399. 

Get a massive 33% off the 2TB version, now just $199 instead of $299, but boasting all the same specs as the 4TB model. 

The cheapest model, naturally, is the 1TB model, now just $149 instead of $199, again boasting those excellent read and write speeds. 

For a small amount extra on each model you can also get one with a heatsink if you want to optimize your cooling. As noted, these 9100 Pro drives are some of the fastest we've ever tested. Take a look at our benchmarks below.

High resolution resin 3D printing without breaking the bank

Elegoo's Saturn 3 12K resin 3D printer is a great way to start resin 3D printing.

A 10 inch 12K mono LCD ensures that your resin prints come out crisp and perfect.

In the box you get a super high resolution (12K!) resin 3D printer with a generous 218.88x122.88x250 mm build volume. The build plate is laser-carved for excellent bed adhesion and the Fresnel Collimating Light Source emits a uniform beam of light for better print accuracy.

Elegoo are experts in resin 3D printers, and we've tested the older Saturn 2 8K and awarded it the Editor's Choice award back in 2022. The Saturn 3 is a solid choice for those who want to dip their toe into resin printing, or for those who need a reliable workhorse for their print farms.

Grab yourself a bargain gaming laptop with this ROG Strix G16, down to its lowest-ever price of $1,359. For that you get a GeForce RTX 4060, Intel Core i9-14900HX, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB PCIe SSD.

Lowest-ever price

This Strix G16 comes with GeForce RTX 4060, Intel Core i9-14900HX, 16GB DDR5-5600, 1TB PCIe SSD, Wi-Fi 6E, and Windows 11. Now 20% off, this is the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. 

Now Prime Day has started there are laptops galore, so it really pays to peruse for a bargain if you've got the time.

With the stroke of midnight PT, Amazon Prime Day has now gone live in the U.S., stay tuned as we start tracking deals across PC hardware, components, and beyond.

I've been eyeing an OLED gaming monitor for years, and Samsung now has two great options with hefty savings for Amazon Prime Day. Its new OLED G8 is now almost a third off in the UK. You can score the 27-inch model for £799 instead of £1,099, a 27% saving, or grab the larger 32-inch model for £849 instead of £1,199.

This £300 discount brings this monitor £100 below the previous lowest-ever price on this model. Get 4K resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, and 0.03ms response.

If you want a bit more monitor for your money, there's an even bigger saving on the larger 32-inch model.

Get £350 off the larger 32-inch model, the first saving we've ever seen on this monitor, and a great one to boot. Otherwise, the specs are identical to the smaller 27-inch model, making this a purely size and costing choice. 

There are definitely still some cheaper 4K OLED monitors in the UK, but this is the best price we've seen yet on Samsung's premium offerings.

The RTX 5070 has fallen below MSRP in the UK, now a solid £500. That gets you a Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 WINDFORCE OC SFF 12G Graphics Card, which is discounted by 19% from its usual price of £619. That's the lowest price we've seen on this specific model and lower than the £529 MSRP of the Founders Edition Card.

For the first time ever, get an RTX 5070 in the UK for below MSRP thanks to this deal. Comes with the customary 12GB of VRAM and slightly overclocked GPU speeds over the Founders Edition. 

You can also save big on this MSI RTX 5070 Ti. This deal, which gets you £160 off, brings the card within £10 of MSRP.

Get a beefier RTX 5070 Ti with 16GB of VRAM and 2.48GHz clock speeds, cooled by a triple-fan design from MSI. 

This AMD Ryzen 9 9900X is now down to just £277 on Amazon UK, a saving of 26% on the £376 list price. For that, you get 12 cores and 24 threads with base and boost clocks of 4.4GHz and 5.6GHz, respectively. You also get the 76MB L3 cache and support for DDR5 memory.

This Zen 5 processor has 12 cores for a total of 24 threads. It can reach speeds as high as 5.6 GHz and has integrated graphics. An unlocked multiplier means you can manually overclock the chip.

As you can see, it stacks up very well in our CPU testing hierarchy, check out the benchmarks below:

Good morning, sports fans, and welcome to the start of Amazon Prime Day in the UK - deals switched over at midnight, and there are some handsome hardware savings to be had in the early running. Stephen here to take you through some of the early savings. Stay tuned!



It's a great time to pick up an all-purpose gaming mouse — Razer's Basilisk V3 Pro is currently on sale for $91.63 at Amazon (was $159.99). This wireless gaming mouse features an ergonomic, contoured right-handed shape, 11 programmable buttons, and a dual-mode tilt wheel (though, unlike the tilt wheel on the Logitech G502 X Plus, the Basilisk V3 Pro's is software- and not hardware-based). It sports Razer's FocusPro 30K optical sensor, which has a maximum resolution of 30,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 750 IPS, and can handle up to 70 G's of force.

$2 away from its lowest price ever.

The Basilisk V3 Pro is an ergonomically-shaped all-purpose wireless gaming mouse with 11 programmable buttons, a dual-mode tilt wheel, and Razer's FocusPro 30K optical sensor. 

While there's a newer version of the Basilisk V3 Pro out — the Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, which features Razer's newest FocusPro 35K optical sensor — this is still a fantastic deal. The mouse features tri-mode connectivity (2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired via USB-C), up to 90 hours of battery life, and supports up to an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate via Razer's HyperPolling Wireless Dongle (sold separately). It's on the larger side, but it's still a very comfortable mouse, with textured, grippy sides, a well-placed buttons, and tactile, clicky optical switches.

Apple has an entire stable of AirPods products ranging from entry-level to high-end to cater to a wide variety of customers. Given the popularity of the AirPods, we often see some steep discounts from time to time, especially on the AirPods Pro 2. However, this Prime Day has seen even deeper cuts — in fact, these are the lowest prices we've ever seen for the current family of AirPods.



All the above prices are the lowest ever for the AirPods family, but they likely won't last long, so strike while the iron is hot. At $89, the AirPods 4 are entering impulse buy territory, and they are great-sounding earbuds for people who don't need a lot of fancy features to enjoy their music.

Apple's entry-level Bluetooth earbuds have 5 hours of runtime, which can be boosted by another 30 hours with the included USB-C charging case.

The AirPods 4 with ANC bring Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, Transparency Mode, and a Qi Wireless charging case.

The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple's flagship earbuds, supporting the whole gamut of noise-cancelling technologies. They can also be used as hearing aids.

The AirPods Max are at the top of the totem pole for Apple earphones and support lossless audio over USB-C.

Out of the entire group, I'd say that the AirPods 4 with ANC is probably the absolute best bargain. For $119, you get Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and a USB-C charging case that also supports Qi wireless charging. This should be the go-to option for people who don't need the touch-sensitive controls or hearing aid capabilities of the pricier AirPods Pro 2.

Logitech's G735 wireless gaming headset isn't the only lightweight white wireless headset on the market, but it is exceptionally comfortable and very pretty. The G735 is part of Logitech's Aurora line, which launched in 2022 at a premium price — the G735 retailed for $229 at launch and currently retails for $259.99, but it's currently on sale for just $129.99 at Amazon.

Within $5 of lowest price ever

Logitech's G735 is a lightweight, comfortable wireless gaming headset with a detachable boom mic, dual wireless audio mixing, and pretty pastel dual-zone RGB lighting.  

The G735 is a wireless gaming headset with 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired (aux) connectivity. It features simultaneous dual wireless connections, which means you can listen to and mix audio input from both a 2.4GHz wireless and a Bluetooth source at the same time. It also comes with a detachable boom mic and features replaceable earpads (Logitech sells different colors, for those who want to mix it up). It's an extremely lightweight headset, weighing just 9.6 ounces (273g), and offers up to 56 hours of battery life with the lighting turned off. Inside, it sports 40mm dynamic drivers with a frequency response range of 20 - 20,000 Hz.

If you're looking for a gorgeous and responsive all-around gaming mouse, Logitech's G502 X Plus is currently on sale for just $114.99 at Amazon — down 36% from its current retail price of $179.99 (though it was $159.99 at launch), and close to the lowest price we've ever seen it at. The flagship gaming mouse features Logitech's Hero 25K optical sensor, 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel that switches easily between tactile and free-scrolling modes, and an eight-zone LED strip that makes it one of the prettiest mice we've ever tested.

The Logitech G502 X Plus gaming mouse is close to its lowest price ever — this comfortable, all-purpose gaming mouse features 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel, Logitech's Hero 25K sensor, and an attractive, customizable RGB lighting strip with 8 seamlessly blended zones. 

The G502 X Plus is a large, comfortable gaming mouse with an ergonomically contoured right-handed shape. It features three extra buttons in addition to the primary mouse buttons and standard thumb buttons — two buttons along the side of the primary left-click button, and a sniper button along the thumb rest, so that should be plenty of buttons for the average non-MMO player. The Hero 25K sensor is speedy and responsive, with a maximum resolution of 25,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 400 IPS, and it can handle up to 40 G's of force. This isn't an ultra-lightweight mouse, as it weighs 3.74 ounces (106g), but it's comfortable and speedy enough that it'll work for a variety of games.

We have a much larger list of both 4TB and 8TB SSDs over in our tracking deals post, which you can view here. 

Our resident Wi-Fi expert, Brandon Hill, has dug up several great Prime Day deals that will enable you to upgrade your wireless network to either Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7, depending on your budget.

The TP-Link Archer AXE75 combines excellent performance and value in a Wi-Fi 6E router. You get four GbE ports, a USB 3.0 port for external storage, and OneMesh compliance for just over $100.

The AXE75 Wi-Fi 6E router is now at $120, a nice savings of $30. This router blasts out up to 574 Mbps of bandwidth on the 2.4 GHz band and 2,402 Mbps on the 5 and 6 GHz bands. It also features four Gigabit LAN ports and a USB 3.0 port, allowing you to connect a shared storage device to the network. It also supports the OneMesh standard, which makes expanding your network with satellite devices to extend range a snap. It really doesn't get much easier than OneMesh, where you can simply plug in a networking device and get it working with zero networking hassle.

The TP-Link Deco BE23 is a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 router that features three nodes and covers up to 6,500 square feet. Each node features 2.5 GbE ports and supports wired backhaul.

If you want to take the step up to Wi-Fi 7, the Deco BE23 system is 22% off, with the full three-device system now available for only $180 during the sale. This entry-level Wi-Fi mesh setup includes three devices that support MLO, just not on the 6 GHz band. Each node has dual 2.5 GbE ports, while the routers offer up to 688 Mbps for the 2.4 GHz band and 2,882 Mbps for the 5 GHz band. You can check out Brandon's in-depth analysis of these deals here.

Whether you're looking for an upgrade, a back-to-school purchase, or to get away from Windows, you may want to look to Apple's M4 Macs for speedy, efficient computing. Many of the company's MacBook laptops, as well as its excellent Mac Mini desktop, are on sale.

For students, the MacBook Air (read our review) offers a slim profile, battery life so good you won't need to charge between classes, and strong performance without a fan, so your machine stays silent.

This 13-inch MacBook Air uses Apple's latest chip, M4, without a fan for silent operation. It comes with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and is available in the new "sky blue" color.

Price Check: $849 at Best Buy

If you prefer a larger display, the 15-inch Air has a 15.3 screen along with a more powerful speaker system. Otherwise, though, this is largely the same as the 13-inch MacBook Air.

Price Check: $1,049 at Best Buy

Both MacBook Airs come in the same silver, starlight, midnight, or new sky blue colors.While Apple Intelligence isn't the most useful tool yet, at least it means these laptops start with 16GB of RAM alongside 256GB of storage. Check out some of our benchmarks for examples of M4's power and longevity:

For those looking for a desktop, the Mac Mini offers a bit more power with the same M4 chip thanks to an active cooling fan. It's got a tiny form factor, though Apple did move the power button to the bottom of the chassis. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation.

For those looking for a desktop, the Mac Mini offers a bit more power with the same M4 chip thanks to an active cooling fan. It's got a tiny form factor, though Apple did move the power button to the bottom of the chassis. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation.

The Mac Mini is a desktop with a small footprint, plenty of ports, and Apple's latest M4 processor. This system also has 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. On Amazon, be sure to clip the coupon in order to get the full discount.

If you're buying the Mac Mini on Amazon, remember to clip the coupon, as that's where the majority of the savings come in.For even more Mac savings, keep an eye on this post. — Andrew E. Freedman

If you're looking for an expansive panel that's good for gaming on a budget, this Samsung Odyssey G3 27-inch gaming monitor at an all-time low $130 is the deal for you.

The Odyssey G2 sports a 1920x1080 panel with a robust 180Hz refresh rate, considering its price point. It also sports a fast 1ms response time and AMD FreeSync tech.

An all-time low price for this mid-range gaming monitor.

The 27-inch Samsung Odyssey G3 G30 is a 1080p FHD gaming monitor that delivers a 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. It also comes with AMD FreeSync and several other features designed to give you an advantage over your opponents in every match.

Looking to stack up some affordable, large monitors to make a massive battlestation? This monitor is also built for use with other monitors — the three-sided borderless design eliminates the thick bezels found on many panels, thus allowing you to stack up side-by-side displays so you can use up to three panels with minimal bezel nastiness to distort your view.

You also get a movable stand that allows you to adjust rotation, height, swivel, and tilt, and it connects via either HDMI or DisplayPort, giving you plenty of options. This monitor is at an all-time low pricing, and we don't know how long the deal will last.

While not quite the best price we've ever seen on it, this Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360L Core 360mm cooler is 15% off and now just $85 at Amazon. If you're looking for a great CPU cooler that can shift heat from your processor, then this is a great bet. We absolutely loved its top-tier cooling performance when we reviewed it. While it's a little louder than some rivals, at this price, it's a no-brainer.

This is a great price on a really excellent all-in-one CPU cooler that will fit AMD Ryzen AM5/AM4 and Intel's LGA 1700/1200 sockets. Just remember, with a 360mm radiator, you'll need a case to match. 

Don't just take our word for it though. Here's our thermal cooling performance testing data from our Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360L review:



We're continuing to see good deals (and perhaps even better deals) at Amazon rivals like Newegg, including these Samsung EVO Plus SSD's, available in 2TB and 4TB models with hefty savings on both.

The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB is now available at an all-time low price, boasting speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s, a five-year warranty that covers an impressive 2,400 TB of writes, and PCIe Gen 5x2/4x4 hybrid functionality.

Save even more money with Samsung's 2TB version of the 990 EVO Plus, with the same 7,250 MB/s speeds and a saving of $37. 

Did you know? The latest Steam hardware survey indicates most players only have between 100GB to 249GB of free storage space on their hard drives, barely enough for a couple of AAA games in 2025. Now's the perfect time to upgrade your storage.

Amazon Prime Day hasn't even started yet, but it's already proving enormously fruitful for CPU savings from both AMD and Intel. We're tracking discounts of up to 58% on some models, with prices starting at just $66.

But if you want the best AMD has to offer, this AMD Ryzen 9 9950X is something to behold. With 16 cores and 32 threads, it's a massive 33% off and down an all-time low price. If you want to save even more money, there's a fantastic Ryzen 5 9600X that's 41% off, now just $165.

All-time low price.

The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X has 16 cores and 32 threads, and can hit a maximum of 5.7 GHz and a 64MB L3 cache. This is the perfect processor for those building a powerful workstation.

All-time low price.

The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X comes with six cores and 12 threads, with a maximum boost speed of 5.4GHz and 32 MB of L3 cache.

Curious as to how these stack up to other great CPUs on the market, here's our extensive testing data from years of CPU benchmarking.

We've been hungry for some RTX 50-series laptop deals in the run-up to Amazon Prime Day, and we finally have our first one, and it's a great one at that! Strangely, it's not at Amazon either.

Right now, you can grab $400 off the list price of this Alienware Aurora 16-inch 120Hz Gaming Laptop. You get a Core 7 240H CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD to complement that RTX 5060.

Get a whopping $400 off this Aurora 16-inch laptop with a 120Hz display. Under the hood, you get a Core 7 240H CPU, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 5060, plus a 1TB SSD. 

Best Buy is hosting it's own Black Friday in July sale to rival Prime Day, and has stolen a march on Amazon with this an other laptop deals that are really quite excellent.

Speedy SSDs get all the flashbulbs and attention, but the humble hard drive continues to chug along today in an untold number of desktop PCs, NAS, and various other bulk storage applications. That's because you simply can't beat the pricing for the sheer amount of capacity that you get for an HDD.

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage.

This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is geared specifically for desktop HDD use, so its tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also uses the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, and not that cheap, performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) tech found on bargain basement drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. -- Paul Alcorn

This Fnirsi soldering iron deal brings the heat!

Cards on the table. I own this exact soldering setup. I wasn't sent it for review, I was sent the Fnirsi HS-02 though. The HS-01 has become my go-to smart soldering iron, and for good reason.

Its not compact, but it is designed for travel thanks to an aluminum chassis and protective lid that keeps the soldering tip free from damage or debris. The handle keeps the buttons, used to change temperatures on the fly, away from the user. So no accidental keypresses when you are concentrating on soldering. The bright OLED screen has the clarity necessary for quick glances at the soldering temperature. A rubber sleeve keeps your hand away from the heat of the "business end" of the soldering iron.

The soldering iron heats up in seconds, and it can hit 420C (788F) with ease. You have complete control of the temperature thanks to the intuitive user interface.

I've soldered up countless projects with it, including a full Zilog Z80 computer kit, and a hexagon shaped PCB with slow color-changing LEDs. The HS-01 didn't skip a beat, it just worked.

Clip the coupon to save $15 at checkout.

The Fnirsi HS-01 is a great soldering iron and well worth the money for those of us who solder in our workshop or in the field.

The HS-01 kit on offer at Amazon comes with a USB-C PD power supply, a quality USB-C cable, and a stand to rest the hot soldering iron. But Fnirsi has also given us a selection of six soldering iron tips that slot into the HS-01. From fine needle points used in surface mount soldering, to much broader tips used to lay vast amounts of heat into large ground planes or for speaker wires that greedily wick away heat.

Bambu Lab has some great deals on the A1 3D printer for UK readers!



Bambu Lab has made some excellent 3D printers, and while they may be expensive, they are worth the money. But what if you don't want or need such an expensive and quite rightly one of the best 3D printers? Perhaps you are starting out or gifting a 3D printer to a child? This is where the Bambu Lab A1 comes into the story.

We highly rated the Bambu Lab A1, and the smaller A1 mini. We gave the A1 4.5 stars and an Editor's choice award because it was fast, intuitive, inexpensive and it comes with a direct drive extruder, useful for flexible filaments like TPU. The PEI coated build plate keeps your prints stuck firm, and the auto-bed leveling means that you won't be stuck twiddling knobs to get the perfect first layer.

Saving £130 on this great 3D printer is a really good deal. It may look simple, but this printer packs every automation necessary to plug in and print. A great purchase for those starting off with 3D printing, and for children eager to become makers.

But wait! There's more!

The Bambu Lab A1 Combo is £359! Typically it retails for £509, so you're getting a £150 saving on this great printer and a four-color multi-color/material system. The system feeds four different filaments into the A1, enabling you to print in multi-color or multi-materials. Setting up the system in software is easy, and the slicing software (which converts the models into something the printer can print) will handle when and where to change the filament.

This is the same Bambu Lab A1, but you also get a multi-color/material printing system for more advanced prints.

If you're looking for a new internal SSD for a build, upgrade, or even a games console, M2 NVMe is the only way to go these days. Amazon has a couple of excellent UK deals on Crucial's P310 right now. You can score a 1TB drive with up to 7,100MB/s speeds for just £59, a 2TB model with heatsink for £111, or a 4TB model for £244 (25% off), the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model.

Get a 1TB Crucial P310 for less than £60. With speeds of up to 7,100MB/s, it's perfect for running as your OS boot drive, the foundation of a budget build, or as a handy storage expansion/upgrade for your existing PC. 

To save on the 2TB model, you want to buy the Heatsink version that can be used with the PS5. This gets you 25% off, the same price as the regular drive without heatsink, and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this listing. 

With a whopping 21% off, the 4TB model is a great saving and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Otherwise, you get the same Gen 4 speeds as the other models, up to 7,100MB/s.

Gaming laptop deals on Amazon UK are fairly scarce right now, but I have found this rather nifty Acer Nitro V16, now 17% off and £829 instead of £999.

This laptop comes with an AMD Ryzen 5 8645HS processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050. The display onboard is a 165Hz refresh rate 16-inch IPS display, and you get Windows 11 installed by default.

A similar spec Dell G15 5530 will set you back £1,049 on Amazon, as will the HP Victus 15-inch, both of which come with the same RTX 4050.

The lowest-ever price we've seen on this model, get a Ryzen 5-powered gaming laptop with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for £829, a full £170 (17% off). There's also a 4060 option, but you won't find any savings on that right now, so it's much more expensive. 

We reviewed this laptop's forebear, the Acer Nitro 16, back in 2023. We loved it for its entry-level excellence in the gaming market, even at its $999.99 price tag. Since then, Acer has updated it with the aforementioned 8040 series Ryzen processors. With the uprated processor and this excellent deal, it's a pretty handy gaming laptop if you want to beat the Prime Day rush.

I've been thinking about making the jump to OLED for gaming and everyday work for some time. While not totally solved, OLED burn-in concerns are minimal these days, and Samsung's OLED G6 is an alluring 25% off at Amazon right now, less than £600 for a 27-inch display.

This QHD monitor features a massive 360Hz refresh rate, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, USB 3.0, and a 0.03ms response time (GtG).

This deal is so good that it actually makes that 360Hz refresh rate option cheaper than the same resolution screen with just 240Hz, which you can still expect to pay £680 for.

Lowest-ever price

The lowest-ever price we've seen ahead of Prime Day, save some £200 (25%) on this Odyssey OLED G6 replete with HDMI 2.1, 360Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, and more. 

If you want to save even more money, Philips' excellent gaming offshoot Evnia is flogging its own 27-inch QHD OLED monitor for just £499. The saving percentage is less than the Samsung, but our price tracking confirms this is the lowest-ever price on this model, and it's still £100 cheaper.

You'll get the same 1440p resolution, 360Hz refresh rate, response time, and connectivity. The styling is a little less crisp, but the price is not to be sniffed at.

Lowest-ever price

While the savings might not be as juicy as the Samsung, you'll save another £100 for a monitor with ostensibly the same spec sheet, only with a slightly less appealing brand and less eye-catching design. 

Prime Day doesn't officially kick off until midnight, but there are already some good early deals. This NZXT H6 Flow mid-tower PC case with panoramic class and 3 x 120mm fans (included) just hit its lowest ever price, a full 24% off and now just £76.44 instead of £99.99. Per price tracking, the previous lowest price was £79.99 in March, so this is our best price to date.

We reviewed NZXT H6 Flow RGB and loved its impressive thermal results and the fact that it's very easy to build in. The only quirk is that drive support is limited, with just two 2.5-inch bays and one 3.5-inch bay. While that's modest for a case of this size, it's not a huge issue in the age of the M2 VNMe.

This excellent mid-tower case comes with a panoramic glass panel and three 120mm fans. The dual chamber design makes for excellent thermal performance and there's optimized airflow all-round, as well as intuitive cable management. A four-star Tom's Hardware pick at full price, it's now fully 24%/£23 off for a limited time, the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Move fast, it's a limited run deal with constrained stock. 

Check out some of the benchmarks from our H6 Flow testing, including thermal and acoustic performance. As you can see, it's a little louder than some alternatives from Hyte under load, but outperformed both cases significantly in terms of thermal performance, with notable GPU cooling and a rather spiffy average.



And on to the thermals...



Good morning, everyone! Stephen here to kick off your Prime Day shopping here at Tom's Hardware. I'll be scouring all the best deals across Amazon Prime Day here in the UK and in the U.S. as things start to wake up on the other side of the pond, so stay tuned!

It has a dense resolution that measures in at 5120 x 1440px and a refresh rate that can get as high as 240Hz. This is paired with a short response time of just 0.03ms, making for a noticeably snappy experience.

Dark days ahead, or perhaps already here.

Intel has been in a dire state these past few years, with seemingly nothing going right. Its attempt to modernize x86 with a hybrid big.LITTLE architecture, à la ARM, failed to make a meaningful impact in terms of market share gains, only made worse by last-gen's Arrow Lake chips barely registering a response against AMD's lineup. On the GPU front, the Blue Team served an undercooked product far too late that, while not entirely hopeless, was nowhere near enough to challenge the industry's dominant players. All of this compounds into a grim reality, seemingly confirmed by new CEO Lip-Bu Tan in a leaked internal conversation today.

According to OregonTech, it's borderline a fight for survival for the once-great American innovation powerhouse as it struggles to even acknowledge being among the top contenders anymore. Despite Tan's insistence, Intel would still rank fairly well given its extensive legacy. While companies like AMD, Nvidia, Apple, TSMC, and even Samsung might be more successful today, smaller chipmakers like Broadcom, MediaTek, Micron, and SK Hynix are not above the Blue Team in terms of sheer impact. Regardless, talking to employees around the world in a Q&A session, Intel's CEO allegedly shared these bleak words: "Twenty, 30 years ago, we were really the leader. Now I think the world has changed. We are not in the top 10 semiconductor companies."

As evident from the quote, this is a far cry from a few decades ago when Intel essentially held a monopoly over the CPU market, making barely perceptible upgrades each generation in order to sustain its dominance. At one time, Intel was so powerful that it considered acquiring Nvidia for $20 billion. The GPU maker is now worth $4 trillion.

It never saw AMD as an honorable competitor until it was too late, and Ryzen pulled the carpet from underneath the Blue Team's feet. Now, more people choose to build an AMD system than ever before. Not only that, but AMD also powers your favorite handhelds like the Steam Deck and Rog Ally X, alongside the biggest consoles: Xbox Series and PlayStation 5. AMD works closely with TSMC, another one of Intel's competitors, as the company makes its own chips in-house.

This vertical alignment was once a core strength for the firm, but it has turned into more of a liability these days. Faltering nodes that can't quite match the prowess of Taiwan have arguably held back Intel's processors from reaching their full potential. In fact, starting in 2023, the company tasked TSMC with manufacturing the GPU tile on its Meteor Lake chips. This partnership extended to TSMC, essentially making the entire compute tile for Lunar Lake—and now, in 2025, roughly 30% of fabrication has been outsourced to TSMC. A long-overdue admission of failure that could've been prevented had Intel been allowed to make its leading-edge CPUs with external manufacturing in mind from the start. Ultimately its own foundry was the limiting factor.

As such, Intel has been laying off thousands across the world in a bid to cut costs. Costs have skyrocketed due to high R&D spending for future nodes, and the company faces a $16 billion loss in Q3 last year. Intel's resurrection has to be a "marathon," said Tan, as he hopes to turn around the company culture and "be humble" in listening to shifting demands of the industry. Intel wants to be more like AMD and NVIDIA, who are faster, meaner, and more ruthless competitors these days, especially with the advent of AI. Of course, artificial intelligence has been around for a while, but it wasn't until OpenAI's ChatGPT that a second big bang occurred, ushering in a new era of machine learning. An era almost entirely powered by Nvidia's data center GPUs, highlighting another sector where Intel failed to capitalize on its position.

On training I think it is too late for us.

Intel instead plans to shift its focus toward edge AI, aiming to bring AI processing directly to devices like PCs rather than relying on cloud-based compute. Tan also highlighted agentic AI—an emerging field where AI systems can act autonomously without constant human input—as a key growth area. He expressed optimism that recent high-level hires could help steer Intel back into relevance in AI, hinting that more talent acquisitions are on the way. “Stay tuned. A few more people are coming on board,” said Tan. At this point, Nvidia is simply too far ahead to catch up to, so it's almost exciting to see Intel change gears and look to close the gap in a different way.

That being said, Intel now lags behind in data center CPUs, too, where AMD's EPYC lineup has overtaken them in the past year, further dwindling the company's confidence. Additionally, last year, Intel's board forced former CEO Pat Gelsinger out of the company and replaced him with Lip-Bu Tan, who appears to have a distinctly different, more streamlined vision for the company. Instead of focusing on several different facets, such as CPU, GPU, foundry, and more, at once, Lip wants to hone in on what the company can do well at one time.

This development follows long-standing rumors of Intel splitting in two and forming a new foundry division that would act as an independent subsidiary, turning the main Intel into a fabless chipmaker. Both AMD and Apple, Intel's rivals in the CPU market, operate like this, and Nvidia has also always used TSMC or Samsung to build its graphics cards. It would be interesting to see the Blue Team shed off weight and move like a free animal in the biome. However, it's too early to speculate given that 18A, Intel's proposed savior, is still a year away.

Google on Thursday announced the second cohort to take part in its AI Academy: American Infrastructure, which seeks to support companies using AI to address issues such as cybersecurity, education, and transportation. 

The four-month program is designed for companies at a seed to Series A stage and provides equity-free support and resources like leadership coaching and sales training. It's primarily virtual, but founders will convene for an in-person summit at Google. Applications opened in late April of this year and closed mid-May; companies selected had to pass competitive criteria, including having at least six months of runway and having proof of traction. 

Google has a pretty good track record so far of identifying notable AI startups. Alumni from American Infrastructure's first cohort last year include the government contractor company Cloverleaf AI, which went on to raise a $2.8 million seed round, and Zordi, an autonomous agtech that had already raised $20 million from Khosla Ventures. 

And it partners with some of the most significant AI companies that use its cloud.

Here are the companies selected for this latest batch: 

This is just one of a number of programs where Google invests in AI startups and research. TechCrunch reported a few months ago that it launched its inaugural AI Futures Fund initiative to back startups building with the latest AI tools from DeepMind. 

Last year, Google's charitable wing announced a $20 million commitment to researchers and scientists in AI and an AI accelerator program to give $20 million to nonprofits developing AI technology. Sundar Pichai also said the company would create a $120 million Global AI Opportunity Fund to help make AI education more accessible to people throughout the world. 

Aside from this, Google has a few other notable Academies seeking to help founders, including its Founders Academy and Growth Academy. A Google spokesperson told us earlier this year that its Google for Startups Founders Fund would also look to start backing AI-focused startups as of this year.

Every year, Prime Day is the perfect opportunity for everyday users to score premium electronics at record low prices. If you've been waiting for the right moment to upgrade your desktop computer, now is the time to act: Amazon features some of the year's best deals and it is especially the case with mini PCs that compete with Apple's top-of-the-line products such as the Mac Mini.

The GMKtec mini PC (512GB storage, 12GB DDR5 RAM, Intel N150 chip), now available for as low as $158, down from $229, is a good example. At this price, you're getting a fully capable desktop computer for less than a third of what you'd pay for a Mac Mini.

See at Amazon

The GMKtec mini PC is powered by the latest 2025 Intel Twin Lake N150 processor which is a quad-core chip with four threads and a 6MB cache. With a burst rate of up to 3.6GHz, this CPU provides a good increase in performance compared to its predecessor, boasting a 6-10% upgrade from the Alder Lake N100 and a 15% upgrade over the N95. The N150 chip itself is designed to be power-friendly so you can just leave your PC running for hours at a time without worrying about taking up too much power.

You are provided with 12GB of DDR5 RAM which supports faster speeds and better multitasking than any DDR4 configurations before. With an onboard 512GB M.2 SSD, this mini PC boasts speedy bootup times, lets you launch multiple applications at the same time and gives you generous space for files.

This mini PC also supports an incredibly wide range of devices thanks to the three USB 3.2 ports with a maximum rate of 5Gbps, two HDMI 2.0 ports, a DisplayPort 1.4, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Two Gigabit Ethernet ports support fast and error-free wired internet connectivity alongside WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for the latest wireless connection.

For those using multiple monitors, the GMKtec mini PC is a game changer: With onboard Intel UHD Graphics (up to 1000MHz), it has 4K video playback and AV1 decoding support, meaning you can enjoy crisp images for streaming and gaming.

Amidst unprecedented budget cuts and looming layoffs, U.S. President Donald Trump has appointed Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy as acting NASA Administrator.

The appointment is temporary, and Duffy will continue leading the Department of Transportation while assuming the NASA role, Trump said in a post on his social media site, Truth Social.

“Sean is doing a TREMENDOUS job in handling our Country's Transportation Affairs, including creating a state-of-the-art Air Traffic Control systems, while at the same time rebuilding our roads and bridges, making them efficient, and beautiful, again,” Trump said.

The appointment is highly unusual. There is no precedent for an acting DOT chief also leading NASA, even on an interim basis. Historically, NASA Administrators have generally been former astronauts, long-time NASA bureaucrats, former congresspeople or military veterans. 

Duffy has no formal background in science or space, though the DOT does oversee the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees commercial space transportation and air traffic control. As he will perform both leadership roles simultaneously, it's likely that his NASA tenure will be focused on implementing Trump's near-term policy goals.

Those goals include wide-ranging cuts to NASA's budget that will likely slash many science initiatives and steeply reduce its workforce. The cuts, as spelled out in the White House's “One Big Beautiful Bill,” would reduce the agency's funding by 25% and decrease headcount by 5,000.

Duffy's appointment comes just weeks after Trump abruptly withdrew his nomination of billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to NASA Administrator. Isaacman, who made his fortune from his company Shift4 Payments, has flown to space twice on private SpaceX missions. Trump said he rescinded support following a “thorough review of prior associations,” citing Isaacman's donations to Democratic candidates and the billionaire's close ties to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

Trump's reversal on Isaacman reportedly led to the souring of relations between the president and Musk.

“I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life,” Trump said in a separate Truth Social post.

Duffy replaces Kennedy Space Center director Janet Petro, a long-time NASA bureaucrat. It's unclear how long he will remain in the position.

28 fabs later

China's aggressive push to develop a domestic semiconductor industry has largely been successful. The country now has fairly advanced fabs that can produce logic chips using 7nm-class process technologies as well as world-class 3D NAND and DRAM memory devices. However, there are numerous high-profile failures due to missed investments, technical shortcomings, and unsustainable business plans. This has resulted in numerous empty fab shells — zombie fabs — around the country, according to DigiTimes.

As of early 2024, China had 44 wafer semiconductor production facilities, including 25 300-mm fabs, five 200-mm wafers, four 150-mm wafers, and seven inactive ones, according to TrendForce. At the time, 32 additional semiconductor fabrication plans were being constructed in the country as part of the Made in China 2025 initiative, including 24 300-mm fabs and nine 200-mm fabs. Companies like SMIC, HuaHong, Nexchip, CXMT, and Silan planned to start production at 10 new fabs, including nine 300-mm fabs and one 200-mm facility by the end of 2024.

However, while China continues to lead in terms of new fabs coming online, the country also leads in terms of fab shells that never got equipped or put to work, thus becoming zombie fabs. Over the past several years, around a dozen high-profile fab projects, which cost investors between $50 billion and $100 billion, went bust.

Many Chinese semiconductor fab projects failed due to a lack of technical expertise amid overambitious goals: some startups aimed at advanced nodes like 14nm and 7nm without having experienced R&D teams or access to necessary wafer fab equipment. These efforts were often heavily reliant on provincial government funding, with little oversight or industry knowledge, which lead to collapse when finances dried up or scandals emerged. Some fab ventures were plagued by fraud or mismanagement, with executives vanishing or being arrested, sometimes with local officials involved.

To add to problems, U.S. export restrictions since 2019 blocked access of Chinese entities to critical chipmaking equipment required to make chips at 10nm-class nodes and below, effectively halting progress on advanced fabs. In addition, worsening U.S.-China tensions and global market shifts further undercut the viability of many of these projects.

So, let's go over some of China's most ambitious fab projects, many of which have fallen into oblivion, or have become a dreaded zombie fab.

Leading chipmakers, such as Intel, TSMC, Samsung, or SMIC have spent decades developing their production technologies and gain experience in chips on their leading-edge nodes. But Chinese chipmakers Wuhan Hongxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (HSMC) and Quanxin Integrated Circuit Manufacturing (QXIC) attempted to take a shortcut and jump straight to 14nm and, eventually, to 7nm-class nodes by hiring executives and hundreds of engineers from TSMC in 2017 – 2019.

HSMC was founded in late 2017 with a plan to build 14nm and 7nm-capable logic fabs in Wuhan with an initial investment of around $19 billion. However, a land-use dispute halted construction in November 2019, and by mid‑2020, it suffered severe underfunding of billions of dollars. By March 2021, the local government seized the project, fired all employees, and confirmed no chip production had ever occurred.

QXIC similarly aimed at 14nm-class production when it was founded in 2019 as a sister venture to HSMC in Jinan, Shandong. The company was born after issues with HSMC occurred. Despite government backing, the project never progressed beyond hype: there were no equipment orders, no factory construction, and by 2021, operations were suspended. Interestingly, Cao Shan, who served as chief executive of QXIC, was also a former board member of HSMC.

Perhaps, the most notorious China fab venture failure — the first of many — is GlobalFoundries' project in Chengdu. GlobalFoundries unveiled plans in May 2017 to build an advanced fabs in Chengdu in two phases: Phase 1 for 130nm/180nm-class nodes and Phase 2 for 22FDX FD-SOI node. The company committed to invest $10 billion in the project, with about a billion invested in the shell alone.

Financial troubles forced GlobalFoundries to abandon the project in 2018 (the same year it ceased to develop leading-edge process technologies) and refocus to specialty production technologies. By early 2019, the site was cleared of equipment and personnel, and notices were issued in May 2020 to formally suspend operations.

The site and unfinished building remained uninhabited for five years before Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corp. (HLMC), controlled by the Hua Hong Group, announced it would take over the dormant site in mid-2023. HLMC is one of a few Chinese companies that intend to develop a sub-10nm-class fabrication process. However, it is unclear whether the Chengdu fab will be used as its flagship facility. GlobalFoundries' Chengdu project serves as a rare example of a recovery among China's stalled semiconductor projects. A rare exception to the numerous failures that China has encountered thus far.

Dehuai Semiconductor, an analog and mixed signal IDM startup, was not so lucky. The company was launched in 2019 with the help of local authorities. Dehuai did not present a clear roadmap, and made false claims about how its project was proceeding. By mid-2021, local anti-corruption authorities arrested key executives after investigations revealed that no fab had been built: only initial site preparation had begun. The project was one of the most notorious examples of fraud and mismanagement among China's failed semiconductor ventures.

The fate of Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit (JHICC) is a bit different. Formally, this is not a failed project, but it is not a living one either. JHICC was launched with an ambition to build China's first large-scale DRAM fab in 2016. The company magically began trial production about two years after its inception, but it was soon discovered that it had stolen process technology from Micron using the help of UMC. Eventually, the U.S. Commerce Department put Fujian Jinhua into its Entity List, cutting its access to any American technology. This essentially stops the development of new process technologies and bans the procurement of any advanced tools. As a result, while JHICC has formally survived and exists on paper, it is a spectre of its former ambitions.

Another memory project that has failed in China is Jiangsu Advanced Memory Semiconductor (AMS). The company was established in 2016 with the plan to lead China's efforts in phase-change memory (PCM) technology. The company aimed to produce 100,000 300-mm wafers annually and attracted an initial investment of approximately $1.8 billion. Despite developing its first in-house PCM chips by 2019, AMS ran into financial trouble by 2020 and could no longer pay for equipment or employee salaries. It entered bankruptcy proceedings in 2023, and while a rescue plan by Huaxin Jiechuang was approved in 2024, the deal collapsed in 2025 due to unmet funding commitments.

Producing commodity types of memory is a challenging business. Tsinghua Unigroup was instrumental in developing Yangtze Memory Technology Co. and making it a world-class maker of 3D NAND. However, subsequent 3D NAND and DRAM projects were scrapped in 2022, after the company faced financial difficulties one year prior.Tsinghua Unigroup's second 3D NAND project aimed to mirror YMTC's model. But, at the time, even YMTC itself was still far from challenging multinational 3D NAND makers. So, the logic of building another costly fab (potentially reaching $24 billion) and possibly developing a new 3D NAND process technology was questionable.

For its DRAM efforts, Tsinghua brought in former Elpida CEO Yukio Sakamoto, who had experience competing with Samsung and Micron. However, he left in 2021 as Tsinghua approached bankruptcy, before he could contribute. Given the years and billions needed to develop DRAM technology — compounded by tool supply risks — Tsinghua scrapped its DRAM ambitions.

Logic and memory require rather sophisticated process technologies, and fabs that cost billions. By contrast, CMOS image sensors (CIS) are produced using fairly basic production nodes and on relatively inexpensive (yet very large) fabs. Nonetheless, this did not stop Jiangsu Zhongjing Aerospace, Huaian Imaging Device Manufacturer (HiDM), and Tacoma Semiconductor from failing. None of their fabs have been completed, and none of their process technologies have been developed.

China's wave of semiconductor production companies' failures highlights a fundamental reality about the chip industry: large-scale manufacturing requires more than capital and ambition. Without sustained expertise, supply chain depth, and long-term planning, even the best-funded initiatives can quickly fall apart. These deep structural issues in the People's Republic's semiconductor strategy will continue to hamper its progress for years to come before the fundamental issues will be solved.

Or who will, at most, provide small amounts of support to US efforts. I'd say this describes 80% of the EU, Canada, Switzerland, a few others. And of course, very publicly, it describes Israel. Israel definitely used to be in group 1, making significantly more than token efforts to support the UN, despite having no power in the security council.

This describes 20% of the EU (e.g. Hungary, Serbia, ...) and essentially everyone else (including security council members Russia and China, all muslim countries.

But many people would consider that offensive.More general I would say it's the evolution we're seeing towards war. 5 years ago there were 3 active conflicts, and 100 "frozen" ones. 2 years ago there were 10 active conflicts. Now there are at least 30 active wars and increasing. Sadly, it isn't as simple as this being Trump's administration or any individual government's doing, in fact I am of the opinion that Trump's administration is trying to stop it, and on the other side Russia and China definitely deserve to be called out as a major cause. A lot of countries now sabotage international cooperation for political and ideological reasons rather than cooperate, with China's actions against shipping in the pacific (Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, even Australia at times) as currently as the worst example, but far from the only one (Russia, boycotts against Israel, ...), and it certainly seems like it's still getting worse. For 3 years now we're doing about 1 new armed conflict breaking out every 2 months.It reminds me a lot of the pre-WW1 situation. Plenty of groups of countries that are belligerent as groups. EU/Turkey/Israel vs Russia/North Korea/Iran/"the non-aligned movement" who are doing trench warfare. US/Taiwan/Phillippines/Indonesia/Australia vs China. India vs Pakistan/Iran/Afghanistan.

Sadly, it isn't as simple as this being Trump's administration or any individual government's doing, in fact I am of the opinion that Trump's administration is trying to stop it, and on the other side Russia and China definitely deserve to be called out as a major cause. A lot of countries now sabotage international cooperation for political and ideological reasons rather than cooperate, with China's actions against shipping in the pacific (Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, even Australia at times) as currently as the worst example, but far from the only one (Russia, boycotts against Israel, ...), and it certainly seems like it's still getting worse. For 3 years now we're doing about 1 new armed conflict breaking out every 2 months.It reminds me a lot of the pre-WW1 situation. Plenty of groups of countries that are belligerent as groups. EU/Turkey/Israel vs Russia/North Korea/Iran/"the non-aligned movement" who are doing trench warfare. US/Taiwan/Phillippines/Indonesia/Australia vs China. India vs Pakistan/Iran/Afghanistan. Muslim countries vs Africa. All of these groups have either constant naval warfare or entrenched warfare.

3) countries who actively oppose UN principles, at the UN, in word and deed. This describes 20% of the EU (e.g. Hungary, Serbia, ...) and essentially everyone else (including security council members Russia and China, all muslim countries. Turkey used to be the exception, more in group 2, but not anymore, under Erdogan)So you could as well say it's more of a case of the US joining the EU's style of politics.

Abandoning the law because your counterpart did so isn't the morally correct thing to do. Our democracies are built on the principle that we have due process for people that were not upholding the law. That's literally how criminal courts work.This is not the case in the US anymore. The people in those concentration camps did not have due process. No defense lawyer, no legal process, not even a judicative order by judges were upheld. Not by ICE, not by the people governing those camps.If the legal process is abandoned, it's by definition an absolutist executive power.The alien invasion excuse will only go so far. Maybe you should think about what happens when you run out of Latinos to blame, because nations that are built on fascist principles will need further demographics to blame, that's how they work. And we have a lot of historic evidence on what happens once those demographics run out.

Whoever was in charge over the past N years did not uphold the rule of law with respect to humans moving across the border. I don't really care what party they were from, it's not relevant.So whoever cares about fixing the problem is now more constrained in the fix than the people who allowed it to happen in the first place. That is kind of interesting, and I could understand how some people would feel justified in bending the rules to fix the problem.

Portable power stations are among the best-sellers of this Prime Day, and Amazon is pushing prices lower than ever. If you're looking for a robust model, the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is the most affordable option in its class, dropping below the $400 mark for the first time. This is the only power station in this class that has a 1500W AC output that costs under $400, yet the competition is still $430 to $500 even with a sale.

For Prime Day, Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is currently available at $399, a discount from its original price of $799 which is an astounding 50% off. For the price, you get a portable power station that you can bring along on camping trips, road trips, or backup use at home. The unit has a capacity to deliver a 1,500W AC output with a 3,000W surge peak which means it can easily power heavy appliances like air conditioners, refrigerators or electric cookers.

See at Amazon

With advanced ChargeShield 2.0 technology, the Explorer 1000 v2 will achieve a full charge from 0% within an hour with emergency charging mode activated via the Jackery app. The unit also charges at 1.7 hours as an option to ensure battery longevity but being able to charge up quickly in emergency situations is a major advantage. The battery itself is a LiFePO4 heavy-duty one that will retain over 70% of its initial capacity even after 4,000 charging cycles which translates to over 10 years of usage for the average user.

It contains two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, DC car port, and three pure sine wave AC ports, thereby enabling you to power or charge multiple devices at once. The 100W USB-C port offers fast charging of laptops, tablets and other devices even without an adapter. There are integrated LED lights for yet another convenience level while used outside or during emergencies. The Jackery app lets you track and control the power station remotely, switch charging modes and even initiate a quiet overnight charging mode at just 30 dB.

The device is made safe for prolonged use, with devices protecting the battery as well as your devices. It's also solar panel compatible so you can charge using solar power in off-grid use or extended camping excursions.

As part of Prime Day, this is the all-time lowest price on a power station of these specs.

The Night at the Museum film franchise is getting another go at 20th Century Studios under Disney to mine more historical hijinks. It's been 20 years (a shocking number, yes) since the release of the first film starring Ben Stiller (Severance) as a museum night watch guard who goes on adventures when the exhibits come to life at night. The concept spawned several sequels, which featured stars like Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Rami Malek, and Dan Stevens as legendary figures.

Deadline reports that the reboot is being produced by 21 Laps' Dan Levine and Shawn Levy (Deadpool & Wolverine), who helmed the previous iteration of the franchise. Writer Tripper Clancy (Die Hart) has been tapped as the reboot's scribe. There's no word yet if Levy will take the filmmaking reins again, but it was specified that the new movies will take place in a new museum with new characters. It would be fun to see Stiller possibly make a return as a director instead of a star.

It's interesting to note the Disney connection here; over the years while the franchise went on, Disney and Jon Favreau had Magic Kingdom, a similar concept, in the works with Disney Parks as the museum stand-in. It was floated that the ride characters would come to life after dark. But now with both universes in the Mouse House, perhaps the Disneyland version of the concept could become an official spin-off to this planned Night at the Museum reboot.

Follow me here: the Imagineering arm of the parks industry, for example, has made historical figures into animatronics and will be adding one based on Walt Disney himself come Disneyland's 70th birthday, right? So maybe this time around, instead of these figures coming to life because of pure magic, perhaps the figures in the museum exhibits might be animatronics-based. It would be really unhinged to go with that thread and make this some sci-fi fare. Then we'd really want Stiller to come back and direct.

A research team led by Prof. Hai Li from the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has become the first to systematically explore how large language models (LLMs) can assist in predicting liver cancer treatment responses-offering a new path toward AI-powered precision medicine.

The study was published in the Journal of Medical Systems.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide. For patients with advanced HCC, combination therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted treatments offer some hope, but only around 30% of patients respond effectively. This makes accurate prediction of treatment response a critical unmet need in personalized oncology.

In this study, the team evaluated the performance of leading LLMs-GPT-4, GPT-4o, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek-in predicting treatment outcomes using zero-shot learning. This means the models were not specifically trained on liver cancer data beforehand. The dataset included clinical and imaging information from 186 inoperable HCC patients.

To enhance performance, the researchers tested various decision-making strategies, such as voting rules and logical combinations, and created a hybrid model named Gemini-GPT.

The Gemini-GPT model demonstrated predictive accuracy on par with senior doctors (15+ years of experience), while outperforming junior and mid-level clinicians in both speed and accuracy. It consistently produced stable results across various treatment types and disease stages, and proved especially reliable in identifying patients likely to benefit from therapy-often showing greater consistency than human doctors.

Applying simple logical strategies further improved its practical utility in clinical settings.

This research shows how AI can help doctors make better decisions and offer more personalized treatment for cancer patients."

Prof. Hai Li, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences

The study marks an important step toward trustworthy AI integration in real-world oncology, demonstrating that LLMs can do more than language-they can reason, predict, and support critical medical decisions.

This new article publication from Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B, discusses how a psychological stress-activated NR3C1/NUPR1 axis promotes ovarian tumor metastasis.

Ovarian tumor (OT) is the most lethal form of gynecologic malignancy, with minimal improvements in patient outcomes over the past several decades. Metastasis is the leading cause of ovarian cancer-related deaths, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Psychological stress is known to activate the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), a factor associated with poor prognosis in OT patients. However, the precise mechanisms linking NR3C1 signaling and metastasis have yet to be fully elucidated.

The authors of this article demonstrate that chronic restraint stress accelerates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in OT through an NR3C1-dependent mechanism involving nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1). Mechanistically, NR3C1 directly regulates the transcription of NUPR1, which in turn increases the expression of snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2), a key driver of EMT. Clinically, elevated NR3C1 positively correlates with NUPR1 expression in OT patients, and both are positively associated with poorer prognosis.

Overall, this study identified the NR3C1/NUPR1 axis as a critical regulatory pathway in psychological stress-induced OT metastasis, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for intervention in OT metastasis.

A new process could help to treat liver disease without needing an organ transplant, a new study reveals.

Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) can help to repair the liver, but they often don't stick well to the existing tissue, making treatment less effective.

Scientists at the University of Birmingham have now developed a method to coat HPCs with natural sugars (polysaccharides) – such as hyaluronic acid and alginate – making the cells 'stickier'.

The coated cells showed a significant increase in their ability to stick to liver tissues and other cells - meaning the cells are more likely to stay in place and help repair the liver. The coating does not harm the cells or stop them from working properly. Coated HPCs can still turn into liver cells and perform their functions, like producing important proteins.

Publishing their findings today (10 July) in Communications Biology, scientists from the University of Birmingham and InSphero AG (Switzerland) outline how the HPCs are coated with polysaccharides using a special technique that doesn't require modifying their genes.

Liver transplants are the only option for many severe liver diseases, but there aren't enough donor livers available. This new method could provide an alternative by making cell therapy more effective, potentially helping many people with liver disease."

Dr. Maria Chiara Arno, Lead Author from the University of Birmingham

Researchers used a technique called metabolic oligosaccharide engineering (MOE) to coat the cells, which were tested - in lab conditions mimicking the human body - on various surfaces, including liver microtissues and endothelial cells, which line blood vessels. The coated HPCs demonstrated a much higher adhesion rate to liver microtissues and other cells compared to uncoated cells.

This study reveals that hyaluronic acid -coated cells spread out more and formed structures that help them stick. Moreover, coating cells increased their levels of certain proteins (integrins) that help cells attach and sense their environment. Importantly, these coatings were temporary, lasting just long enough to help the cells settle in after transplantation, without interfering with their normal functions.

"Our approach avoids genetic modification, making it easier to use in the clinic," added Dr Arno. "We believe this method could be adapted for other cell types and are planning further studies explore its impact on cell health and immune responses."

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have discovered a previously unknown molecule that may explain why people with type 2 diabetes often suffer from muscle weakness and muscle loss - a condition that has a major impact on quality of life and overall health.

In the new study, published in Sciences Advances, researchers have identified a previously unknown molecule, TMEM9B-AS1, which may explain why people with type 2 diabetes often suffer from muscle weakness and loss of muscle mass. The molecule is a long non-coding RNA that plays an important role in regulating cellular functions.

The researchers discovered that TMEM9B-AS1 is significantly reduced in skeletal muscles in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and its absence disrupts the machinery needed to build new muscle proteins.

Our study shows that TMEM9B-AS1 supports the stability of MYC, a key gene that drives the production of ribosomes - the factories that manufacture proteins. Without this RNA molecule, MYC becomes unstable, and muscle cells lose their ability to maintain normal protein production. This may help explain the muscle deterioration we often see in people with metabolic diseases."

The study was conducted in collaboration with researchers from the Mondor Institute for Biomedical Research in Paris, France, and the University of Innlandet, Lillehammer, Norway.

Metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is an advanced and progressive liver disease that potentially causes cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Exercise is a crucial and effective intervention for ameliorating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of MASH, which benefit a broad spectrum of MASH patients, including those who have difficulty engaging in physical activity.

We established a mouse model of MASH and selectively knocked down L-type amino acid transporter 1 and alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2. Mice were fed a high-fat high-cholesterol diet and subjected to either short- or long-term exercise regimens. We assessed the phosphorylation and activity of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) as well as branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) content in skeletal muscle following exercise.

Short-term exercise significantly reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation without causing notable changes in body weight. It also enhanced BCKDH activity in skeletal muscle and decreased hepatic BCAA accumulation. Muscle-specific overexpression of BCKDH further promoted BCAA catabolism and significantly attenuated hepatic steatosis and inflammation in high-fat high-cholesterol-fed mice. In contrast, muscle-specific L-type amino acid transporter 1 knockdown, which suppresses BCAA uptake, markedly abolished these beneficial effects. Interestingly, BCKDH overexpression in muscle increased glutamine levels in both the blood and liver. Hepatic alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2 knockdown, which inhibited glutamine uptake, lessened the protective effect of exercise on MASH. Further in vitro study revealed that glutamine derived from myocytes improved redox homeostasis and inhibited lipid accumulation in hepatocytes.

In our study, enhanced BCAA oxidation in skeletal muscle following short-term exercise increased glutamine production, which circulated to the liver and helped ameliorate MASH by promoting redox balance. This mechanism offers a novel perspective and a promising therapeutic target for MASH treatment, with significant implications for future clinical interventions and drug development.

An alternative diagnostic method could improve early detection and treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD), according to a new study from the University of Surrey. PAD is a common condition affecting up to a quarter of adults that causes poor blood circulation to the legs and feet, which may result in pain, ulcers, and, most dangerously, in amputation. Often PAD is diagnosed too late.

The study, published in European Heart Journal - Imaging Methods and Practice, looked at finding a more accurate diagnostic measure to what is usually used to diagnose PAD in particular in people with diabetes, the toe brachial index (TBI).

TBI is a simple, painless test, in which patients' blood pressure in their arms is compared to the blood pressure in their toes. By doing this, doctors can tell whether the feet and toes of the patients are getting enough blood flow - however, the test can be unreliable in some patients, especially those with diabetes.

Researchers worked with 155 limbs in patients who were undergoing treatment for PAD. The study used a Doppler ultrasound waveform to estimate TBI (eTBI), which provided a faster, more accurate, reproducible, and accessible alternative to the current PAD test. eTBI was found to be more consistent than standard TBI, with different health professionals getting similar results even on different ultrasound machines. The novel method was as good as the standard test at detecting the effectiveness of treatments to improve blood flow.

This research could lead to earlier diagnosis and more effective management of PAD, especially for people with diabetes and those at higher risk of heart diseases, which could result in preventing serious complications like foot ulcers and amputations."

Kelli Reardon undergoes an MRI twice a year to screen for breast cancer, a measure she said she must take to protect her health. Her mother died of the disease at age 48, putting Reardon at higher risk, and Reardon has dense breast tissue, which makes it harder to detect a growth through a mammogram.

When Reardon moved from Alabama to North Carolina, she had little choice but to switch from having the screening done at an imaging center to having it done at a hospital.

Then she saw how much higher the charges were. At first, Reardon thought it was an error: "They made a mistake with billing," she said. "They accidentally added a zero."

It wasn't a mistake.

In this installment of InvestigateTV and KFF Health News' "Costly Care" series, Caresse Jackman, InvestigateTV's national consumer investigative reporter, and Jamie Grey, director of investigations, explore how the type of medical facility where a patient seeks care can affect the cost of that care — particularly when that facility is a hospital.

This article was reprinted from khn.org, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF - the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

In a new burden of proof study published in Nature Medicine, researchers analyzed data from over 60 previous studies investigating how processed meats, sugary beverages, and trans fatty acids in the diet relate to the risk of developing a range of conditions.

After completing their analysis, the researchers concluded that regularly consuming even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and colorectal cancer.

The data showed that people who ate just one hot dog per day had an 11% greater risk of type 2 diabetes and a 7% higher risk of colorectal cancer compared to those who did not eat processed meat.

In addition, drinking about a 12-ounce soda daily was linked to an 8% increased risk of type 2 diabetes and a 2% higher risk of ischemic heart disease.

This study supports previous findings that suggest that eating red meat and sugar may contribute to colorectal cancer among young people.

Based on the findings, experts continue to recommend that it is best to avoid or minimise the regular consumption of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and industrially produced trans fats in order to improve health outcomes.

The risk was found to rise with higher levels of intake, and for processed meats, the data indicated there is no safe level of consumption.

First author Demewoz Haile, PhD, a research scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, explained the key findings to Medical News Today.

Haile told us that:

“Habitual consumption of even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and colorectal cancer. Processed meats include items such as bacon, sausage, and ham, which typically involve preservatives like salting, curing, or smoking. In our conservative analysis, a daily intake of up to 57 grams—roughly the size of one hot dog—was associated with at least an 11% increased risk of type 2 diabetes and a 7% increased risk of colorectal cancer compared to no consumption.”

“Similarly, consuming sugary drinks, such as sodas, was linked to adverse health outcomes,” he added.

Haile kept emphasizing that his and his colleagues' study provided a “conservative analysis” of the health risks associated with processed meat consumption.

Even so, he said, the “analysis showed that commonly observed levels of sugary drink consumption, a daily intake of up to 390 grams (equivalent to 12 ounces), were associated with at least an 8% increased risk of type 2 diabetes and a 2% increased risk of ischemic heart disease.”

“Industrially produced trans fatty acids were also shown to increase health risks. In this analysis, we focused on trans fats commonly found in processed foods and baked goods such as doughnuts, cookies, pastries, fried foods, and chips.”

Demewoz Haile, PhD

Regular consumption of these foods, even in small amounts, was associated with at least a 3% increased risk of ischemic heart disease.

Individuals who habitually consume these foods should be aware of the increased risk of developing chronic diseases linked to their intake, even in moderate quantities.

It is important to note, however, that the studies included in the analysis were observational, meaning they can only show an association between diet and disease risk rather than directly prove cause and effect.

In addition, the findings relied on participants' self-reported eating habits, which can introduce inaccuracies due to memory errors or misreporting.

Even with advanced analytical methods, the researchers highlighted that diet data remains limited, which is a common challenge in nutritional research.

Two nutrition experts, not involved in the study, also spoke to MNT about its findings.

Haley Bishoff, RDN, LD, a registered dietitian at Rutsu Nutrition, said that “one of the most notable takeaways was the relative risk between developing type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer with such small serving sizes of processed meat, indicating that no real amount of processed meat is considered safe.”

“The equivalent of one hot dog (50 g) per day showed an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 30%, and a 26% increased risk of colorectal cancer. A 50 g [gram] serving is roughly 1.8 oz [ounces] of meat, which many Americans consume much more on a daily basis,” Bishoff explained.

Destini Moody, RD, CSSD, LD, registered dietitian at Top Nutrition Coaching, agreed, telling MNT that she “would strongly caution against patients and the public taking away that the risk of chronic disease is small when consuming these foods.”

“It's been well-established by prominent entities such as the American Heart Association and WHO [World Health Organization] that trans fats, processed meats, and refined sugars increase risk of chronic disease across the board,” Moody added.

“This isn't just because they lead to chronic inflammation, but these foods typically offer little nutrition in terms of micronutrients and antioxidants. Thus, filling one's diet with them displaces foods that promote a longer life and better health, such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and unsaturated fatty acids. I urge the public to focus on these foods while only occasionally indulging in the aforementioned products that can cause harm in excess and provide very little benefits to human health.”

Speaking of ways in which people can make their diets healthier, Bishoff said “there are always healthier options that taste great, so don't be afraid to try new products and recipes.”

She advised that:

“Instead of eliminating foods from your diet, the best approach is to find healthy swaps. For example, many ultra-processed peanut butters and tortillas contain partially hydrogenated oils, which are considered a type of trans fat. Trans fats have been shown to increase the risk of heart disease.”

Bishoff recommended switch to a natural peanut butter or whole-food based tortillas, for instance, that do not contain hydrogenated oils. 

Or, “if you enjoy soda, there are many healthier soda alternatives that contain less than 3–5 g of added sugar and still provide a refreshing and crisp taste without sacrificing your health,” she explained.

“[Instead] grilling hot dogs and other processed meats this summer, make vegetable kabobs with a lean or plant-based protein, like tofu,” Bishoff suggested.

Haile also noted that “while dietary choices are personal and often influenced by individual and environmental factors, the implications of our findings suggest that people should aim to minimize their consumption of these foods as much as practicable.”

“Our findings align with widely recognized recommendations, including those made by the WHO and CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]: Avoid or reduce the consumption of processed meats, sugary drinks, and artificial trans fats to the lowest possible level,” the researcher emphasized.

The candles on your birthday cake don't tell the whole story. As anyone who ever attended a high-school reunion can tell you, some people age faster than others.

Whoever put the candles on your cake probably didn't have to guess your chronological age. But research has shown that we also have what's called a "biological age," a cryptic but more accurate measure of our physiological condition and likelihood of developing aging-associated disorders from heart trouble to Alzheimer's disease.

We all guess people's actual ages, almost unconsciously, by scanning their faces for wrinkles, baggy eyes and other telltale signs. But figuring out how old someone's brain, arteries or kidneys are is another matter. The organs tucked inside our bodies are aging at different speeds, too, according to a new study by Stanford Medicine investigators.

We've developed a blood-based indicator of the age of your organs. With this indicator, we can assess the age of an organ today and predict the odds of your getting a disease associated with that organ 10 years later."

Tony Wyss-Coray, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences and director of the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience

They can even predict who is most likely to die from medical conditions associated with one or more of the 11 separate organ systems the researchers looked at: brain, muscle, heart, lung, arteries, liver, kidneys, pancreas, immune system, intestine and fat.

The biological age of one organ - the brain - plays an outsized role in determining how long you have left to live, Wyss-Coray said.

"The brain is the gatekeeper of longevity," he said. "If you've got an old brain, you have an increased likelihood of mortality. If you've got a young brain, you're probably going to live longer."

Wyss-Coray, the D. H. Chen Professor II, is the senior author of the study, to be published online July 9 in Nature Medicine. The lead author is Hamilton Oh, PhD, a former graduate student in Wyss-Coray's group.

The scientists zeroed in on 44,498 randomly selected participants, ages 40 to 70, who were drawn from a longitudinal data-gathering endeavor called UK Biobank. This ongoing effort has collected multiple blood samples and updated medical reports from some 600,000 individuals over several years. These participants were monitored for up to 17 years for changes in their health status.

Wyss-Coray's team made use of an advanced commercially available laboratory technology that counted the amounts of nearly 3,000 proteins in each participant's blood. Some 15% of these proteins can be traced to single-organ origins, and many of the others to multiple-organ generation.

The researchers fed everybody's blood-borne protein levels into a computer and determined the average levels of each of those organ-specific proteins in the blood of those people's bodies, adjusted for age. From this, the scientists generated an algorithm that found how much the composite protein "signature" for each organ being assessed differed from the overall average for people of that age.

Based on the differences between individuals' and age-adjusted average organ-assigned protein levels, the algorithm assigned a biological age to each of the 11 distinct organs or organ systems assessed for each subject. And it measured how far each organ's multiprotein signature in any given individual deviated in either direction from the average for people of the same chronological age. These protein signatures served as proxies for individual organs' relative biological condition. A greater than 1.5 standard deviation from the average put a person's organ in the "extremely aged" or "extremely youthful" category.

One-third of the individuals in the study had at least one organ with a 1.5-or-greater standard deviation from the average, with the investigators designating any such organ as "extremely aged" or "extremely youthful." One in four participants had multiple extremely aged or youthful organs.

For the brain, "extremely aged" translated to being among the 6% to 7% of study participants' brains whose protein signatures fell at one end of the biological-age distribution. "Extremely youthful" brains fell into the 6% to 7% at the opposite end.

The algorithm also predicted people's future health, organ by organ, based on their current organs' biological age. Wyss-Coray and his colleagues checked for associations between extremely aged organs and any of 15 different disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, chronic liver or kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes, two different heart conditions and two different lung diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and more.

Risks for several of those diseases were affected by numerous different organs' biological age. But the strongest associations were between an individual's biologically aged organ and the chance that this individual would develop a disease associated with that organ. For example, having an extremely aged heart predicted higher risk of atrial fibrillation or heart failure, having aged lungs predicted heightened chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk, and having an old brain predicted higher risk for Alzheimer's disease.

The association between having an extremely aged brain and developing Alzheimer's disease was particularly powerful - 3.1 times that of a person with a normally aging brain. Meanwhile having an extremely youthful brain was especially protective against Alzheimer's - barely one-fourth that of a person with a normally aged brain.

In other words, someone with a biologically old brain is approximately 12 times as likely to receive a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease over the next decade or so as someone the same age with a biologically young brain.

In addition, Wyss-Coray said, brain age was the best single predictor of overall mortality. Having an extremely aged brain increased subjects' risk of dying by 182% over a roughly 15-year period, while individuals with extremely youthful brains had an overall 40% reduction in their risk of dying over the same duration.

"This approach could lead to human experiments testing new longevity interventions for their effects on the biological ages of individual organs in individual people," Wyss-Coray said.

Medical researchers may, for example, be able to use extreme brain age as a proxy for impending Alzheimer's disease and intervene before the onset of outward symptoms, when there's still time to arrest it, he said.

Careful collection of lifestyle, diet and prescribed- or supplemental-substance intake in clinical trials, combined with organ-age assessments, could throw light on the medical value of those factors' contributions to the aging of various organs, as well as on whether existing, approved drugs can restore organ youth before people develop a disease for which an organ's advanced biological age puts them at high risk, Wyss-Coray added.

"This is, ideally, the future of medicine," he said. "Today, you go to the doctor because something aches, and they take a look to see what's broken. We're trying to shift from sick care to health care and intervene before people get organ-specific disease."

Although the analytical tool is available only for research purposes now, Wyss-Coray has plans to commercialize it. He is a co-founder and scientific officer of Teal Omics and Vero Bioscience, two companies to whom Stanford University's Office of Technology Licensing has licensed technology developed in this and related research for commercializing, respectively, screens for new drug targets and a consumer product.

The test could be available in the next two to three years, Wyss-Coray said. "The cost will come down as we focus on fewer key organs, such as the brain, heart and immune system, to get more resolution and stronger links to specific diseases."

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grants P50AG047366 and P30AG066515), the Milky Way Foundation, the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience and the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.

Why do rural adults and racial and ethnic minorities with vascular disease get major leg amputations more often? A new study out today in Epidemiology uses AI to solve the mystery, finding an unaccounted-for factor that researchers think points to implicit bias in the clinical decision-making process.

The AI model allowed us to distinguish among the many reasons behind these much higher rates of amputation among certain groups of people with vascular disease. We found that, after accounting for everything else, people's unconscious biases are likely behind why some groups receive amputation instead of alternative treatment that preserves their limb." 

We hope our results will be a catalyst to create evidence-based guidelines that help vascular surgeons and other providers who make this life-changing decision do so objectively." 

Paula Strassle, lead author and assistant professor of epidemiology at UMD's School of Public Health

More than 12 million adults in the US live with a vascular disease called Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), a chronic circulation condition that restricts blood flow to the limbs. It results in leg pain, numbness and in severe cases, limb loss. About 10% of people with PAD develop Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia (CLTI) at which point either they receive a procedure to restore blood flow to their lower leg or their limb must be amputated. Revascularization is a surgical procedure that can save the limb, but it also requires intensive follow-up and is a relatively expensive surgical procedure. Vascular surgeons are also in short supply. 

After accounting for known differences in clinical presentation, the study found higher rates of amputation among Black, Hispanic, Native American, and white people in rural areas as well as among Black and Native American people in urban areas. After further accounting for differences in hospital and neighborhood resources, higher amputation rates persisted among Black, Hispanic, and Native American people in rural areas, and Black and Native American people in urban areas.

"We found a substantial unexplained portion that would suggest an implicit bias in clinical decision-making occurring at the physician and hospital level," Strassle said. 

The study examined hospitalizations between 2017 and 2019 of people under 40 with PAD or CLTI, across five states (Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi and New York) using State Inpatient Databases from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. 

Researchers programmed an AI model to consider a huge number of variables (70+) that contribute to known reasons for differences in leg amputations of people with PAD. Variables included clinical factors such as age and other health conditions, healthcare system capacity to perform revascularization and limb amputations, legal and regulatory climate, and the physical environment such as a person's distance to the nearest emergency room and ZIP code median income. 

"This AI model will allow us to easily assess intersectionality across race, sex, income and rurality, and offers us the ability to indirectly study hard-to-measure causes of disparities, like implicit bias and stereotyping," said Strassle. 

Limb-threatening conditions are often the result of decades of difficult-to-control diseases like diabetes, high cholesterol and nicotine dependence. For surgeons, who know these conditions lead to worse surgical outcomes, this can make the decision to pursue a complex limb-saving surgery even trickier. 

"As vascular surgeons we have surgical guidelines, but we don't have detailed guidelines to help us make the decision between amputating someone's leg and limb-saving surgery in patients who are not medically ready. Given the number and complexity of variables involved, we need more information describing the optimal treatment for each person in different conditions. We need to know we can perform a successful vascular operation, and also not increase the risk of dying," said Katharine McGinigle, a vascular surgeon, associate professor of surgery at the University of North Carolina and senior author of the paper. 

"There are so many medical, surgical, and social factors that contribute to disease progression, limb-loss and even death. Surgeons and others making treatment recommendations deserve evidence-based guidance that will help us avoid unconscious biases and make the right decision at the right time for each person based on their unique clinical and social needs. AI methods, similar to the one used in this research, can help us achieve that goal," said McGinigle.

Strassle and McGinigle hope that their findings will inform comprehensive guidelines and health policies that help clinicians avoid unconscious bias and other unjustified differences in the quality of care provided, to safely save limbs of people living with advanced vascular disease.

A study led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai shows that exposure to lead during pregnancy and early childhood may accelerate the rate at which children forget information-a critical marker of memory impairment that may have implications for learning and development.

Using delayed matching-to-sample task (DMTS)-a cognitive task that can be used to evaluate underlying neurobehavioral functions, such as attention and working memory, and has been demonstrated to be sensitive to metal neurotoxicants-the study examined how both prenatal and early childhood blood lead levels affect working memory in children ages 6 to 8. In this task, the children were presented a picture, and then had to select that same picture from three choices presented after a brief delay. The study was published in Science Advances on July 9, 2025.

Researchers applied an innovative statistical approach known as a nonlinear modified power function to model memory decay, uncovering a measurable link between higher childhood lead levels and faster forgetting rates.

The findings showed that higher lead exposure at ages 4–6 was significantly associated with a faster rate of forgetting-even at low median blood lead levels (~1.7 µg/dL). Additionally, older children and those whose mother's IQ was higher were more likely to show better memory retention.

The nonlinear modified power function has been validated in previous animal and human studies but is now applied in the field of environmental health. This new usage is important because children are exposed to many environmental chemicals, and this model provides a validated method to further assess the effect of additional environmental exposures, such as heavy metals, air pollution, or endocrine disruptors, on children's working memory."

Katherine Svensson, PhD, MS, postdoctoral fellow in Environmental Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and co-first author of the study

This study also validates a method for assessing neurobehavioral function, paving the way for translational research that can bridge human data with mechanistic insights from laboratory studies.

"Our work advances the current literature by incorporating operant tests-specifically the DMTS-which are commonly used in animal toxicology studies but sparse in human studies. This translational approach is a key innovation of our work," said Jamil M. Lane, PhD, MPH, Instructor, Environmental Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and co-first author.

The implications are clear: even low-level lead exposure can undermine key cognitive functions in young children. As memory and attention are foundational for academic and social success, this research underscores the urgent need for continued investment in lead prevention efforts-especially in historically overburdened communities.

"There may be no more important a trait than the ability to form memories. Memories define who we are and how we learn," said Robert Wright, MD, MPH, Ethel H. Wise Chair of the Department of Environmental Medicine and Co-Director of the Institute for Exposomic Research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. "This paper breaks new ground by showing how environmental chemicals can interfere with the rate of memory formation. Children with higher levels of blood lead forgot the test stimulus faster than those with low blood lead levels."

This study opens the door for future work to explore how environmental exposures like lead intersect with other cognitive domains such as attention, executive function, and reward processing. It also strengthens the case for policy interventions that protect children's developing brains before irreversible harm occurs.

Despite their popularity and promises, commercial baby foods are often packed with sugar and lack the diversity infants need, raising concerns for parents who trust the packaging over public health advice.

Commercial Baby Foods: Nutrition, Marketing and Motivations for Use—A Narrative Review. Image Credit: Kichigin / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Maternal & Child Nutrition, a group of researchers assessed the nutritional adequacy, marketing claims, and parental motivations associated with commercial baby foods (CBFs) in high-income countries from 2019 to 2024.

Purées dominate, delaying texture progression: Over half (56%) of all products were smooth purées, often sold in pouches. This format means babies skip crucial chewing practice needed for speech and muscle development.

What if the bright pouch marketed as your baby's “first tastes” actually packs more sugar than a doughnut? Pressed for time and swayed by advertising, parents increasingly grab purées and finger snacks that promise nutrition, safety, and smiles. CBFs can help, but they are often sweet, smooth, and sometimes low in energy density, especially for older infants, contrary to the assumption that all are energy-dense, which can steer taste preferences toward sugar and limit chewing practice.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends home-prepared, varied foods after six months, and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) and Public Health England (PHE) call CBFs unnecessary. Yet, a market worth USD 53.7 billion in 2024 continues to expand; thus, clear evidence is needed to guide policy and parental choice.

In January 2025, the researchers conducted a narrative systematic review by searching PubMed and Web of Science for studies on CBFs, their nutritional composition, labeling practices, and factors influencing parental choice. Eligible studies were English language, published 2019-2024, and examined products for children aged 0-36 months in the United Kingdom (UK), Europe, Australia, or New Zealand. Studies outside these regions or focused solely on allergens, contaminants, or sustainability were excluded. Titles and abstracts (n = 3,434) were screened independently; disagreements were resolved, and 31 full-text papers met criteria.

Data on design, country, sample size, product category, nutrient composition, marketing claims, and caregiver motivations were extracted into evidence tables. Quality was assessed using the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS), and 27 studies scored 100%. Findings were synthesized under three topics: nutritional composition, flavor profile and texture; marketing and labeling; and parental choice. Medians and ranges illustrated patterns in sugar content, product type, and claim prevalence. The status of ultra-processed food (UPF) and its alignment with the WHO Nutrient Profiling and Promotional Model (NPPM) were also documented. Where data were missing, authors were contacted for clarification; 10 responded, improving completeness.

Snacks break the rules: Experts agree babies under one don't need snacks between meals. Yet snacks made up nearly 1 in 5 products (18%) overall, surging to over 30% in countries like Iceland and Australia.

Across the 31 studies, with the most extensive single study covering 3,427 unique products, CBFs were dominated by squeeze pouches and purees. The median market share was 56%, reaching 70-80% in Denmark, Norway, and Australia. Snacks, often branded as “first finger foods,” accounted for another 18% but rose to 38% in Australia and exceeded 30% in Iceland.

Nutritionally, sweetness prevailed, with pooled medians indicating 10.4 grams of total sugars per 100 grams in purees, 20.3 grams in snacks, and 14.7 grams in cereals, which is well above the National Health Service (NHS) “low-sugar” threshold of 5 grams. Nearly half of all sampled items contained added or free sugars such as fruit-juice concentrates; the rate climbed to 62% for snacks and to 90% for infant cereals in one Australian survey. Only 45% of UK products satisfied every threshold in the WHO NPPM; comparable compliance ranged from 22% to 36% in four Australian datasets. Salt, iron, and protein were inconsistently reported; however, when benchmarked, three-quarters of German cereals lacked iron fortification, and in some cases, energy density fell below the SACN guidance for growing toddlers.

Texture analysis revealed that 50-80% of products were smooth or pureed, limiting opportunities for infants to learn chewing. Bitter vegetables appeared in fewer than one in ten pouches; instead, sweet root vegetables or fruit purées dominated ingredient lists. Snack textures were equally monotonous, with extruded puffs, rice crackers, and yogurt-coated melts comprising half of the savory lines, raising concerns about satiation and dental exposure.

Marketing tugs heartstrings, not just minds: Beyond "no added sugar" labels, researchers found brands heavily use emotional phrases like "smile from the inside" and "happy tummies" – appearing on a third of UK products to trigger parental affection.

Marketing audits mapped an ecosystem of health halos. “No added sugar” banners adorned up to 70% of Portuguese packs, 60% of Australian and UK packs, and often masked high free-sugar levels. Health or developmental claims like “supports immunity” and “strong bones” featured on 17-91% of labels, while nearly one-third of UK products carried emotionally charged phrases like “happy tummies.” A single product might host six distinct claims. Parental surveys mirrored these tactics: caregivers were 13.7 times more likely to choose a snack displaying a “no added sugar or salt” label. Many cited trust in familiar brands, convenience during travel, and a fear of choking as purchase drivers.

Together, the evidence paints a consistent picture: commercial baby foods remain high in sugars, low in textural and flavor diversity, saturated with persuasive marketing, and are positioned as indispensable, despite public health advice that homemade alternatives are sufficient. These deficits persist across brands and retail outlets.

To summarize, CBFs have not kept pace with modern public-health guidance, as most products reviewed between 2019 and 2024 were sugar-dense, often texturally unchallenging or lacking in variety, and marketed with feel-good slogans that obscure their shortcomings.

Parents purchase them for convenience, safety, and perceived health, yet evidence shows limited alignment with the WHO NPPM. Mandatory standards, enforcement, and clear NHS messaging are necessary, alongside industry reformulation that reduces free sugars and broadens flavor and texture options. Empowering caregivers with transparent labeling and affordable, nutrient-rich options could lead to healthier palates and a reduced future burden of obesity.

A research group led by Dr. Keisuke Obara, Dr. Kento Yoshioka, and Professor Yoshio Tanaka from the Department of Chemical Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toho University, has uncovered important details about how platelet-activating factor (PAF)-a powerful molecule involved in inflammation and allergic reactions-triggers contractions in the smooth muscles of the esophagus. Their findings could pave the way for new treatments targeting gastrointestinal symptoms associated with allergies, asthma, and anaphylaxis.

PAF (platelet-activating factor) is a bioactive lipid molecule produced by various cells in the body, including immune cells, during inflammatory responses. It plays a major role in processes such as blood clotting, immune cell recruitment, and the onset of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, by making blood vessels more permeable and stimulating smooth muscle contraction in tissues like the lungs, intestines, and esophagus.

Although PAF is essential for immune defense, excessive or misdirected PAF activity is linked to pathological conditions such as asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and allergic reactions that affect breathing and digestion.

In their study, the researchers investigated how PAF causes contractions in the esophageal smooth muscle of rats-a process that contributes to symptoms like chest tightness and difficulty swallowing during allergic episodes.

They discovered that PAF triggers calcium entry into muscle cells through three distinct types of calcium channels:

Importantly, the study revealed that non-VDCC channels-particularly a protein called Orai1 that forms SOCCs-are the main drivers of PAF-induced muscle contraction in the esophagus. This challenges the traditional focus on VDCCs in smooth muscle pharmacology.

Our findings suggest that targeting these non-traditional calcium channels could offer more effective treatments for esophageal and gastrointestinal symptoms seen in allergic conditions."

Dr. Keisuke Obara, lead researcher

By better understanding which calcium channels PAF uses to trigger muscle contraction, the study lays the groundwork for developing new drugs that can more precisely block unwanted muscle activity without affecting normal muscle function elsewhere.

A research team led by Eske Willerslev, professor at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Cambridge, has recovered ancient DNA from 214 known human pathogens in prehistoric humans from Eurasia.

The study shows, among other things, that the earliest known evidence of zoonotic diseases – illnesses transmitted from animals to humans, like COVID in recent times – dates back to around 6,500 years ago, with such diseases becoming more widespread approximately 5,000 years ago. It is the largest study to date on the history of infectious diseases and has just been published in the scientific journal Nature.

The researchers analyzed DNA from over 1,300 prehistoric individuals, some up to 37,000 years old. The ancient bones and teeth have provided a unique insight into the development of diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites.

The results suggest that humans' close cohabitation with domesticated animals – and large-scale migrations of pastoralist from the Pontic Steppe – played a decisive role in the spread of these diseases.

We've long suspected that the transition to farming and animal husbandry opened the door to a new era of disease – now DNA shows us that it happened at least 6,500 years ago. These infections didn't just cause illness – they may have contributed to population collapse, migration, and genetic adaptation."

Professor Eske Willerslev

The findings could be significant for the development of vaccines and for understanding how diseases arise and mutate over time.

"If we understand what happened in the past, it can help us prepare for the future, where many of the newly emerging infectious diseases are predicted to originate from animals," says Associate Professor Martin Sikora, the study's first author.

"Mutations that were successful in the past are likely to reappear. This knowledge is important for future vaccines, as it allows us to test whether current vaccines provide sufficient coverage or whether new ones need to be developed due to mutations," adds Eske Willerslev.

The study was made possible by funding from the Lundbeck Foundation.

Creatine is popularly known as a muscle-building supplement, but its influence on human muscle function can be a matter of life or death.

Creatine is very crucial for energy-consuming cells in skeletal muscle throughout the body, but also in the brain and in the heart."

Chin-Yi Chen, research scientist at Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC

Chen is part of a research team working to develop a technique that uses focused ultrasound to deliver creatine directly to the brain. The work, being conducted in the lab of Fralin Biomedical Research Institute Assistant Professor Cheng-Chia "Fred" Wu, will be supported by a $30,000 grant from the Association for Creatine Deficiencies.

Creatine plays a vital role in the brain, where it interacts with phosphoric acid to help create adenosine triphosphate, a molecule essential for energy production in living cells. In addition to its role in energy production, creatine also influences neurotransmitter systems.

For example, creatine influences the brain's major inhibitory pathways that use the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, which limits neuronal excitability in the central nervous system. It may play a role in a variety of functions, including seizure control, learning, memory, and brain development.

A growing body of research suggests that creatine may itself function as neurotransmitter, as it is delivered to neurons from glial cells in the brain and can influence signaling processes between other neurons. While creatine deficiency disorders can weaken the skeletal muscle and the heart, they can also severely affect the brain. Many patients see increased muscle mass and body weight with creatine supplements, but they often continue to face neurodevelopmental challenges that can hinder their ability to speak, read, or write.

This is largely caused by the brain's protective blood-brain barrier. This selective shield blocks harmful substances like toxins and pathogens from entering brain tissue, but it can also prevent beneficial compounds like creatine from reaching the brain when levels are low.

Wu studies therapeutic focused ultrasound, which precisely directs sound waves to areas of the brain to which access has been opened temporarily. The process allows drugs to reach diseased tissue without harming surrounding healthy cells. While Wu is investigating this method as a potential treatment for pediatric brain cancer, he also sees potential in applying it to creatine deficiency.

"Through the partnership between Virginia Tech and Children's National Hospital, I was able to present our work in focused ultrasound at the Children's National Research & Innovation Campus," Wu said. "There, I met Dr. Seth Berger, a medical geneticist, who introduced me to creatine transporter deficiency. Together, we saw the promise that focused ultrasound had to offer."

The Focused Ultrasound Foundation has recognized Virginia Tech and Children's National as Centers of Excellence. Wu said the two organizations bring together clinical specialists, trial experts, and research scientists who can design experiments that could inform future clinical trials.

"It was a moment that made me really excited - that I had found a lab where I could move from basic research to something that could help patients," Chen said. "When Fred asked me, 'Are you interested in this project?' I said, 'Yes, of course.'"

Because creatine deficiencies can impair brain development, the early stages of Chen's project will concentrate on using focused ultrasound to deliver creatine across the blood-brain barrier. Chen hopes the technique will restore normal brain mass in models of creatine deficiency.

Chelsea midfielder Moises Caicedo resumed full training on Thursday in a bid to recover in time for the Club World Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain this weekend. The Ecuadorian international picked up a knock late in Tuesday night's semi-final clash against Fluminense, casting doubt over his availability for the much-anticipated final in New Jersey.

After facing hostile crowds at home in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, Tyler Adams says U.S. players hope to be better prepared in case American supporters are outnumbered at World Cup matches next year.

Sellout crowds of 22,423 at St. Louis' Energizer Park and 70,925 at Houston's NRG Stadium overwhelmingly and loudly supported the visiting team during the U.S.'s 2-1 win over Guatemala in last week's semifinals and 2-1 loss to Mexico in Sunday's final.

"That's an experience that they're going to have because who knows what the World Cup landscape is going to look like in terms of fans and the turnout?" Adams said. "To play in a home tournament and have — feel like it's an away game in a hostile environment, that's such a good experience for every single player."

First-round World Cup matches for the Americans are scheduled for Inglewood, California, and Seattle.

Adams, the U.S. captain at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, spoke Tuesday from Wappinger, New York, where he worked with the lawn-care products firm Scotts to dedicate the Tyler Adams Soccer Pitch at Martz Field Recreation Facility.

Six of the American starters in the three Gold Cup knockout matches didn't play in World Cup qualifiers, where opponents often find difficult field conditions and loud fans.

"Giving ourselves an opportunity to play in a final is progress in and of itself," Adams said. "So many guys gained experiences throughout the tournament: first time in crazy atmospheres, first time against Mexico in the final, so many firsts for so many players. That is going to be hugely valuable to the group in general."

Adams said the five-week training camp was integral in getting to know coach Mauricio Pochettino, hired last year to replace Gregg Berhalter after the team's first-round exit at the Copa América. Adams introduced the coach to his family members.

"It creates a bond and a sense of the culture that he's trying to build within our team," Adams said. "He sat down after the game and he kind of spoke to us, and it really sparked a lot of emotions for him in that final because he knows how hard we worked over the past five weeks and how much more we were hoping to accomplish with winning the trophy. But he couldn't have been more proud and I felt exactly the same way of the whole group."

Many regulars missed the tournament and some young players emerged. The first sign of how Pochettino reevaluates his player pool will be when he selects his roster for friendlies against South Korea on Sept. 6 at Harrison, New Jersey, and Japan three days later at Columbus, Ohio.

"Their job just got a whole lot harder," Adams said of Pochettino and his assistants. "I think he saw a lot of guys grow and grow into big roles and guys that can play future big roles. And, of course, the next year obviously proves a lot, as well. You know, guys have to go back and perform and show that they're at the level to be there."

Adams will report to Bournemouth on July 26 or 27 during its U.S. preseason tour ahead of its Premier League opener at defending champion Liverpool on Aug. 15.

In the meantime, he gets a few weeks off. Scotts approached him about restoring a field, and on Thursday he and the company launched a "Keep It Real" sweepstakes open through July 24 in which five youth sports organizations will be picked to have Scotts refurbish grass fields with the company's products.

"I mentioned doing something in my hometown where I grew up," he said. " They jumped at the idea. I'm having the opportunity to sit on a field where I grew up, came to camp to."

Adams would like to restore more fields.

"I would do 100 if I could," he said.

Tobin Heath, a member of the U.S. women's national team's 2015 and 2019 Women's World Cup-winning squads, officially announced her retirement on Thursday, marking the end of a decorated career.

Heath played the final match of her career in August 2022 with the Seattle Reign, who beat the North Carolina Courage 4-1 that day, while her final appearance for the national team was in a friendly win against South Korea in October 2021. The 37-year-old spent the final years of her career battling a serious left knee injury that she was ultimately unable to come back from.

"Over New Year's, I actually came to the full acceptance that I wasn't going to be playing, which was like a two-year, some might say three-year process of acceptance," Heath said on Thursday's episode of The RE-CAP Show, a podcast she co-hosts with her former USWNT teammate and partner Christen Press. "I tried f---ing everything to get back, I spent tens of thousands of dollars and [had] two surgeries, one crazy surgery. And the whole time I believed I was going to get back. The writing was definitely on the wall, I just couldn't accept I think that that was my ending."

Heath was amongst the most impactful players of her generation, notching 181 appearances for the USWNT, winning the World Cup and Olympic gold twice, as well as the U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year award in 2016. Heath is one of four USWNT players to make an appearance in three World Cup finals, including the 2011 final the U.S. lost to Japan following a penalty shootout. She also collected accolades at the club level, winning two NWSL Championships with the Portland Thorns and two NWSL Shields, one with the Thorns and the other with the Reign. Her club career also included stints with Manchester United, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain.

More notably, though, Heath was easily amongst the most technically gifted players on the USWNT. She was a must-watch star at her best, notching goals and assists while mixing in highlight-reel worthy moments on the regular. The list includes 36 goals and 42 assists for the national team, including one in the 2015 World Cup final in Vancouver, where the USWNT beat Japan 5-2.

Heath has assumed a handful of roles off the pitch in the last several years. In addition to her podcast with Press, she is the only woman on FIFA's technical study group for the men's Club World Cup, which concludes on Sunday.

Gamechanger. Ankle-breaker. Team-player.

These are just a few words to describe the great Tobin Heath. The 37-year-old former US Women's National Team (USWNT) player announced her retirement Thursday on her podcast, "The Re-Cap Show."

"And Tobin Heath will never play soccer again," she said after a three-minute-long compilation video played with relatives, former teammates, and friends thanking Heath for her dedication to the game.

Heath made her USWNT debut in January 2008 and was named to the Beijing Olympics roster later that year, where the team won gold. She went on to appear in three Women's World Cups, winning back-to-back in 2015 and 2019. She also won gold with the team at the London 2012 Olympics.

In total, Heath has made 181 appearances with the USWNT, scoring 36 goals and providing 42 assists.

The actual news of Heath's retirement comes less as a shock and more as a heartbreak to fans. Heath had suffered a knee injury three years ago and has since detailed her struggle with recovery.

"I tried f—  everything to get back. I spent tens of thousands of dollars and like two surgeries, one crazy surgery, like...the whole time I believed I was gonna get back," Heath said on the podcast episode titled "Your Favorite Player's Favorite Player."

Heath's longtime girlfriend, former teammate, and podcast co-host Christen Press, also suffered a knee injury in 2022. She made her return to her club team, Angel City FC, in 2024.

Heath has not only had a tremendous impact on women's soccer on the field; her style of play can be seen in current players like Rose Lavelle and Alyssa Thompson. Her impact on women's sports even off the field might be even greater. Heath was on the frontline of the equal pay fight and is one of the founders of RE-INC, a company that strives to make sports an inclusive space for everyone.

In her post-professional career, she has become the first woman appointed to FIFA's Technical Study Group to analyze the men's tournament.

Her presence on the field will be greatly missed. There will never be another Tobin Heath. But the legacy she leaves behind and the work she continues to do will last for generations.

Tobin Heath, No. 17, bows out to many thanks.

Here's a soccer story via the Associated Press:

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Wearing their blue, red and white jerseys, Paris Saint-Germain supporters were surrounded by white shirts.

Real Madrid fans were 95% of the crowd at MetLife Stadium for Wednesday's Club World Cup semifinal, the shirts of Los Blancos radiant in the harsh summer sun. Yet, it was PSG fans in a couple sections behind one goal who cheered virtually from start to finish as their team moved within one win of a historic quadruple.

A 4-0 rout of Real Madrid in a Club World Cup semifinal following a 5-0 wipeout of Inter Milan in the Champions League final reinforced that PSG may be the dominant soccer team of the mid-2020s.

“We have always said that the collective work by the players is what's helping us,” said Fabián Ruiz, who scored twice as PSG built a three-goal lead in the first 24 minutes. “We are a great group, a young group that is working well.”

PSG moved on to Sunday's final against Chelsea in the first expanded Club World Cup with a chance to win its fourth major title of the season exactly 100 days after it clinched Ligue 1 on April 5. It added the Coupe de France by beating Reims 3-0 on May 24, then romped over Inter seven days later.

PSG's blue, red and white jerseys don't have glamorous names pressed across the back, and they may not be as ubiquitous as the the red shirts of Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, Manchester City's light blue or Chelsea's royal blue, but the team is filling up the trophy display at Parc des Princes, its cramped, outdated stadium not far from Roland-Garros and the Bois de Boulogne.

On May 31 at Munich, Achraf Hakimi got the first goal 12 minutes in, Désiré Doué scored the next two and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Senny Mayulu added one goal each.

This time, Ruiz scored in the sixth minute and Ousmane Dembélé in the ninth following glaring mistakes by defenders Raúl Asencio and Antonio Rüdiger, and Ruiz made it 3-0 to cap a counter. Gonçalo Ramos added a goal in the 87th.

Dembélé, this year's Ligue 1 Golden Boot winner with 21 goals, started for the first time since straining his left quadriceps with France on June 5. He missed the Club World Cup group stage and was a substitute in PSG's first two knockout matches, scoring in second-half injury time during Saturday's 2-0 quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich.

“This is the first match in this World Cup that we can use Usman as a normal player,” PSG coach Luis Enrique said. “I think he is the best player this season by a long term and I think he deserves to win everything because he gave everything to the team and the team is going to achieve trophies, which is the most important thing for a club.”

Real Madrid has 15 European and five world titles, a modern global superpower brand established two decades ago in the Galacticos era of David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo, then lifted loftier by Cristiano Ronaldo from 2009-18 and the rise of social media.

PSG hadn't won a Ligue 1 title since 1995 when Qatar Sports Investments took over in 2011. Paris has won 11 of 13 French championships since 2013 but until May failed to become Europe's best, despite emulating Madrid's star collection when its lineup included Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappé.

A group achieved more than the star system.

“We've all made history, that is, the players, the staff, the sports director, the managers, the fans, we've all made history,” Enrique, hired in July 2023, said through an interpreter.

PSG dominated every aspect with a 631-255 advantage in completed passes and 67% possession, including 76.5% in the first half.

“It's a painful defeat. We were not up to standard today,” Real coach Xabi Alonso through an interpreter.

PSG has outscored opponents 16-1 in six matches, getting three goals from Ruiz, two each from Dembele, Hakimi and João Neves, and one apiece from Doué, Lee Kang-in, Kvaratskhelia, Mayulu, Ramos and Vitinha. It hasn't allowed a goal since a 1-0 loss to Botofogo in its second group-stage match.

“We're truly happy to be in another final. Now we have to enjoy it because we're doing something historic,” Ruiz said. “It's very difficult to reach every final this season, and now we're one step away.”

Player was in pain after victory over Fluminense

Maresca will have selection headache if midfielder out

Chelsea have been handed a major boost by Moisés Caicedo returning to training before the Club World Cup final, raising hopes that the midfielder will recover from an ankle injury in time to face Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday.

Enzo Maresca was left sweating over the availability of one of his most important players after Caicedo took a blow at the end of his side's 2-0 victory over Fluminense in their semi-final on Tuesday. The Ecuador international tried to play on but complained of pain as the game drew to a close.

Chelsea will not want to be without Caicedo when they face PSG at the MetLife Stadium. Maresca depends on the £115m Ecuadorean's authority and will need the former Brighton & Hove Albion player to be at his best if PSG's exceptional midfield trio of João Neves, Fabián Ruiz and Vitinha are to be stopped.

Encouragingly for Chelsea, Caicedo has not missed a game through injury or illness since a 2-1 defeat to Wolves on Christmas Eve in 2023. Caicedo has developed an indestructible reputation and looks likely to start against the European champions after training in New York on Thursday morning.

Being without Caicedo would be a major complication for Maresca given that Roméo Lavia has been absent for two games through injury and Dário Essugo was unavailable against Fluminense after suffering an injury in training. Lavia was not pictured in training on Thursday. Chelsea's other options in midfield are Enzo Fernández and Andrey Santos. Reece James can also move over from right-back.

Caicedo's performances have seen him hailed as one of the best midfielders in the world but he believes that he is not at that level yet.

“I am working on that,” he said. “I want to become one of the best midfielders in the world but I am too far right now. I am working hard every day and want to show it on the pitch. People always talk when you are doing well. Even when they say bad things, I don't care because I just want to help my team. I focus on that.”

Former U.S. women's national team star Tobin Heath announced her retirement from professional soccer on her podcast, The RE-CAP Show, Thursday afternoon.

Heath, a two-time Olympic gold medalist (2008, '12) and two-time Women's World Cup champion (2015, '19), is hanging up her cleats three years after her last appearance in professional soccer on the NWSL's Seattle Reign in 2022. The 37-year-old previously played for the Portland Thorns from 2013 to '19, where she won two NWSL titles, and spent a brief stint in England playing for Manchester United and Arsenal.

Heath's retirement comes as little surprise, as the midfielder has been rehabbing a serious left knee injury dating back to 2021 that required multiple surgeries and an eventual cartilage replacement. Her last appearance for the USWNT was in October '21.

Heath ends her storied career as one of the most technically skilled and dynamic women's soccer players in the modern era. Heath earned 181 caps for the USWNT from 2008 to '22 and tallied 36 goals along with 42 assists. The once-fearsome No. 17 also helped the national team win a silver medal at the 2011 World Cup and a bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Games.

Since stepping away from soccer, Heath has started a podcast with former teammate and current partner Christen Press. She also recently made history as the only woman in FIFA's technical study group for the men's Club World Cup this summer.

FIFA has released its latest Men's World Rankings, and while Argentina continues to dominate at No. 1, the United States remains a notable presence, maintaining 16th place . With CONCACAF Gold Cup champions Mexico moving ahead to 13th and Canada rising to 28th, the U.S. stands as the top-ranked CONCACAF nation—just one spot above Mexico.

Despite a mixed recent run—with a disappointing Nations League exit in April—the U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) remains steadfast at 16th, according to FIFA's Elo-style rating system which dampens the impact of knockout losses. 

Under coach Mauricio Pochettino, the team has also secured three Gold Cup titles (2019-20, 2022-23, 2023-24) and three Nations League trophies, solidifying its regional dominance.

With the 2026 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, a strong ranking could lead to a seeded spot—ensuring an easier group stage draw Stars and Stripes FC. Pochettino's side is determined to break into the top 10 before the tournament, continuing the upward momentum seen at the end of 2024, when the U.S. climbed from 18th to 16th following Nations League and Gold Cup performances.

To improve their current standing, the USMNT must deliver strong results in upcoming friendlies—including matches against Turkey and Switzerland in June—and the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, where they aim to defend their regional title. Consistency will be key: fewer costly group-stage exits and more high-profile wins can help elevate the U.S. into the global top 15—or even the top 10.

As FIFA's next update approaches in September, the eyes of American soccer fans will be firmly fixed on results that could boost the USMNT on the road to hosting history.

Paris Saint-Germain eliminated Real Madrid from the Club World Cup by defeating the Spanish giants in the semifinal on July 9.

The Parisians found the back of the net four times against Los Blancos, who were unable to open their scoring in the clash.

Fabian Ruiz scored a brace for PSG while Ousmane Dembele and Goncalo Ramos registered the other two goals to seal the victory over Real Madrid.

Speaking after the stellar win, PSG head coach Luis Enrique revealed the surge of support he has received from the fans of one of his former clubs, Barcelona, pointing out the significance of the match.

Enrique was appointed as the head coach of Barcelona in 2014, and the Spaniard led the club to win nine trophies, including two La Liga titles and a Champions League title in his three-season tenure at Camp Nou.

While addressing the press in his post-match conference, Enrique mentioned that his phone is filled with messages from Barcelona supporters and said,

"My phone is full of messages from Barcelona fans, which tells you about how big this game was. You go at 100% for everything this shirt represents and we know what Real Madrid are, what they were and what they will always be, how great they are," as per The Guardian.

Enrique clarified that PSG did not 'put the brakes on' or tone down their stride against Real Madrid at any point in the game, and added,

"We didn't put the brakes on but of course with the heat, with the final in three days' time, with cramp and the risk of tiredness, you act. The first thing is the objective, which is to reach the final and compete. But at no point do you put the brakes on."

Barcelona were not among the participants of this year's Club World Cup, making Real Madrid's run in the competition a point of the historic Spanish rivalry for the Catalans.

PSG are now headed to the Club World Cup final, where they will face Chelsea on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

NWSL

Former U.S. women's national team midfielder Tobin Heath has retired from professional soccer, the player announced Thursday. The news comes three years after her final professional appearance and a serious left knee injury that required multiple surgeries.

She leaves the game — on the field, at least — as a two-time World Cup winner and two-time Olympics gold medalist with the U.S. women, a two-time NWSL champion with Portland Thorns FC and a three-time NCAA champion with the University of North Carolina.

But for Heath, the news of her official retirement is almost secondary as she grapples with the long-term impact of her knee injury. She's lost the ability to play the game at even a casual level and with it a part of who she was.

“I had a personal journey back in January that I came to my own acceptance of not playing anymore,” Heath told The Athletic on Wednesday. “It was me grieving not being able to play soccer anymore. For me, that was the greatest gift that had ever been given to me and such a core part of my identity and how I express myself and know myself to be.”

Heath said she struggles even with running in a straight line. She described the heartbreak of having a ball roll up to her, knowing her ability isn't there anymore — that the way she previously expressed herself in the world was no longer available to her.

“Football is a 360-degree sport, and I can't do it. If I ever would try to do it, it's really sad. So that part is the hardest part,” she said. “The actual playing of soccer is gone, not even the professional or playing in a World Cup and stuff like that. The actual gift that was given to me when I first started. That gift is gone.”

What started as a feeling of a pinch in her knee during preparations for the 2020 Olympics (held in 2021) turned into something much more: the discovery of a hole in her knee cartilage and two surgeries, including an eventual cartilage replacement. While Heath was able to play in the Tokyo Olympics, earning a bronze medal with the USWNT in her final major tournament, the rest of her soccer career was hampered by the injury including brief stints at Manchester United and Arsenal, before returning to the NWSL and a handful of final matches with the Seattle Reign.

Her final NWSL appearance was August 14, 2022, a 4-1 win over Gotham FC. Heath's USWNT career ends with 181 appearances, 36 goals, 42 assists and 10,171 minutes played.

She described an emotional conversation she had with her wife and former teammate, Christen Press, earlier this year. She said she had forgotten how she was as a soccer player, not just in terms of playing ability, but also her personality and competitiveness.

“There was a long period of time where I knew that she would not be signing another professional contract,” Press said in a phone call with The Athletic on Wednesday. “It was my job to leave space for her to find that out on her own.”

For the last three years, Heath always thought she would come back. She had a plan to retire after a lengthy career. She had a plan to evolve as an older player, a desire to mentor the next generation in the locker room. She never expected the 2019 World Cup to be her last one.

“I thought I was literally going to be peeled off the field,” Heath said.

Even with months of coming to terms with who she was without kicking a ball, Heath never intended to announce her retirement. It has been three years since her last appearance; she's been plenty busy co-hosting the RE-CAP show with Press, their other endeavors through RE, helping start World Sevens Football and serving as the only woman in FIFA's technical study group for the men's Club World Cup this summer.



The absence from playing will also make her eligible for the National Soccer Hall of Fame in the upcoming voting cycle. The USWNT Players' Association informed Heath they wanted to honor her alongside other retired players at their upcoming Players Ball event. These two external prompts, along with some prodding from Press, helped her realize she hadn't actually taken time to close the door to playing.

In a recording of Thursday's episode of The RE-CAP Show, Heath's emotions are on display as she describes coming to terms with her injury and retirement. Press jokes that if it weren't for her, the retirement celebration wouldn't have come together, while fondly acknowledging that Heath “really has evolved” by allowing herself this moment.

Press adds a brief imitation of Heath: “I'm a purist. I'm a footballer. I just play to play.” But, as Press reminds Heath, a moment like this is also for her family, for the fans, and most importantly for Heath herself.

“You can see how emotional she is in the episode. She's having this cathartic moment that she didn't want to have because she hates feelings, but she needed to have in order to really have closure,” Press said.

“I was four years old, and I just immediately felt a click as soon as I touched the soccer ball. It was like destiny,” Heath said of her childhood in New Jersey.

“Everything that I was obsessed with in football, I had to go out and seek and crave, and create my own pathways,” Heath said.

Her parents weren't soccer people; she didn't have a sibling who played. It was something entirely of her own.

“I'm lucky because Jersey is a hotbed for soccer,” she said. “I was extremely fortunate where I was born, but this was just self-motivated destiny, something inside me, knowing I was supposed to play soccer.”

Heath found her way to the University of North Carolina, winning three national championships in her four years, and making her USWNT debut in 2008 while still in college. She nutmegged a Finnish player in one of the first touches of her debut. That same year, Heath earned her first gold medal with the USWNT as the youngest player on the Olympic roster, making three appearances off the bench.

Heath was drafted first in the 2010 WPS draft, a precursor to the NWSL, by the Atlanta Beat. Her rookie season was mostly a wash after an ankle injury kept her out for most of the season. She was traded to Sky Blue FC for her second season, but by the end of the 2011 season, the league shuttered. She played a single game for the New York Fury in the gap year of 2012 in WPSL Elite, the same summer she and the USWNT picked up a gold medal at the London Olympics.

Her next move changed everything.

“That was another click-destiny moment, because I don't know how I ended up in Portland,” Heath said.

Ahead of the NWSL's first season, every national team player was given the option to rank their top three preferred teams. As an East Coaster, Heath hadn't even ranked Portland, assuming there was no way she'd be sent there. Instead, U.S. Soccer allocated her to the Thorns, alongside forward Alex Morgan and defender Rachel Buehler. Though she detoured through Paris on a six-month contract with Paris Saint-Germain, she made it to Oregon for the back half of the 2013 season.

Heath scored the winning goal for the Thorns in the inaugural championship while playing on a broken foot. Thinking back on her career, she focused less on the results of her tenure and more on what her time in Portland revealed.

“It showed what women's sports could be, and that was the beginning of it all. I felt like I was dreaming when I was in Portland. I was dreaming of the world that I wanted to create,” she said. “It was such a gift to be seen as a professional, to be valued in the craft that I had dedicated my life to.”

That level of appreciation and support unlocked something for Heath over a decade ago.

“It pushed me on the path of believing what I think women's sports could be,” she said. “They showed me a value and a worth that I never knew could exist in women's sports, and made me want to fight for it.”

On the field, Heath is the player the current generation unanimously crowns the most technical the U.S. has had. She had creativity, a silky touch, an ability to break a defender's ankles and endless nutmegs.

Clips of a signature Tobin move went viral after USWNT games. Sometimes that desire to create would get in the way of making the right call on the ball, as coach after coach drilled into her that the willingness to try things didn't have to be abandoned, but harnessed. It wasn't just being able to dribble at players, but serve up a cross or get on the end of one too.

Heath scored the final goal in the USWNT's 5-2 romp over Japan in the 2015 World Cup final, adding the final exclamation point in the team's ascension back to the top of the world.

The memory of who she was as a player was central to Heath's journey to this moment, but Press has also been reflecting on decades of memories over the past few months. She noticed how their memories sometimes differ.

“When (Heath) talks about scoring in a World Cup final, she talks about it from the perspective of dreaming of scoring a World Cup final more than actually having done it,” Press said. “I think the intensity of professional sports means sometimes that you can't remember. It's been challenging and beautiful and emotional for me to be by her side throughout this process, and try and leave her space to grieve and to refuse to grieve and to be stuck and to have movement, and be supportive of wherever she is on the journey.”

The memories of the 2019 World Cup are clearer, though her initial description of how she remembered the USWNT's back-to-back World Cup wins was surprising.

“It was horrible in a lot of ways. It was so much pressure, so many expectations on the footballing side, the pay equity side, so much tension politically,” Heath said. “If any of us pretended we were in control, we were completely out of control. For me personally, going into that World Cup, I was playing some of the best football of my life. I was poised to have an incredible World Cup. Obviously, contributing to us winning was incredible, and to have it culminate in how it did was beyond control and was complete destiny.”

The small moments offered a reprieve from the mounting pressure on the team.

“One time, we were eating a salad at a meal,” Press said, barely holding in her laughter as she told the story. She described a moment during the preparations for 2019 when the team trained at Tottenham Hotspur's facilities. “Everything was grown on the campus, and there was a big slug in her lettuce. Everyone else would have been like, ‘This is disgusting!' And she was like, ‘This is amazing! So organic!'”

The silly moments, the human moments, the surreal moments of that summer all helped keep that team of destiny on track for a win in front of 50,000-plus delirious fans in the Lyon heat, all chanting for equal pay as the USWNT lifted the trophy. That tournament has shaped Heath, and the rest of her teammates forever.

“That's why the whole team is doing what they're doing now,” Heath said. “You can't feel what we felt leading up to that tournament, during that tournament, when we won. You can't feel that and not believe that you're doing something so f—king important for the world.

“You feel that responsibility — and that's what it is — and you want to keep carrying that responsibility as far forward as you can.”

When players retire, the first question is, “What's next?”

For Tobin Heath, that question has already been answered in a myriad of ways, but probably not definitively. Not yet.

“We deserve the right to explore because we started this job when we were three years old. We didn't choose, it chose us,” Press said. “Now, she gets to choose what she does next, whether it's coach, whether it's to be an entrepreneur, whether it's one of the millions of things she wants to do. She's an artist, she's a world builder. What I'm most excited for is to see her try things.”

That's where projects like World Sevens and the technical study group for the Club World Cup come into play — they're likely not permanent career paths, but explorations of options.

Though Heath had to accept that nothing would take the place of football.

“The point is, that space is never going to be filled. I'll have more space for things, but nothing will ever fill that void. I got into cycling, and I'm a maniac, and I crush myself,” she said.

“I don't know if she told you, but she's riding a stage in the Tour de France,” Press said. Heath will ride it a few hours before the pros, a 60-mile stint with plenty of incline. “She's training for it. And to see her — she can barely run — but to see her using her physicality and trying new things and learning and being at the bottom of something, it's really beautiful.”

Instead of trying to replace soccer, Heath said she is “acknowledging and celebrating how awesome and how deeply meaningful that gift was to me, and being able to mourn it.”

Thursday marks an ending for Heath, a complicated one. Still, there's a freedom to that door having fully shut behind her, even if she didn't realize it three years ago.

The catalyst of 2019 still drives her, as does the dream she saw in Portland. There are other ways to create.

“Right now,” Heath said with her usual smile, “I feel like I have an abundance of time and energy to really build lots of worlds.”

NWSL

Midfielder Evelyn Shores made headlines with her million-dollar goal at The Soccer Tournament (TST) this year in Cary, North Carolina, and her last-minute winner for the under-23 U.S. women's national team in Germany two weeks earlier.

Now, the 20-year-old is choosing to leave the University of North Carolina early to join Angel City FC in Los Angeles. After speaking with multiple teams, the young midfielder visited Angel City three weeks ago, toured the facilities, attended a match at the club's BMO Stadium and knew LA was where she wanted to begin her professional career.

“Everyone was super welcoming,” Shores tells The Athletic. “It felt like home away from home. It just made me really want to be a part of what's going on here.”

Shores joins a club in transition. Since arriving in January, sporting director Mark Parsons has laid out a three-year roadmap for the evolution of a team that's only in its fourth season of NWSL play: excitement and promise by the end of 2025, trophy contention by 2026 and titles in hand by 2027 — in perpetuity, of course.

“Evelyn had a lot of options,” Parsons tells The Athletic. “But she saw what we're building here, what's still underground, and decided to start her career with us. And not in January, like we expected, but six months earlier.”

Her choice to join the club this summer rather than wait until after the 2025 NCAA season concludes in December was unexpected but not surprising. “I had a great conversation with (Angel City head coach) Alex (Straus),” she explained. “He's super-knowledgeable, and he seems like he is going in a great direction with the club, so I'm really excited to get on the field and play for him.”

Growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, Shores played both midfield and full-back at youth national team level and impressed coaches with her game-reading ability, positional awareness and confidence in high-pressure moments. Her standout performance in last year's NCAA tournament, which culminated in the 23rd College Cup title for the North Carolina program, caught the attention of long-time USWNT midfielder Heather O'Reilly, who invited her to join the U.S. women's team at this summer's TST.

“Her ability to receive the ball and know where she wants to go, to be able to link play with passes, be able to break lines with passes, to be able to break lines on the dribble and get into areas too, where she's gone from building the attack to creating opportunities,” Parsons says of Shores' strengths. “And most importantly, she plays with purpose.”

Leaving college early was not an easy decision. “But at the end of the day, I wanted to be a part of what they have going on here in LA, and that was the best decision for me at the time,” Shores says. She is planning to finish her degree by taking online classes.

Shores is the latest addition to Angel City's youth-focused rebuild.

This year, the club has also brought in standout rookie forward Riley Tiernan, Brazilian midfielder Maiara Niehues and defender Savy King — all are 22 or under. Angel City leads the 2025 NWSL in minutes given to players in that age bracket. The young core is led by sisters Gisele (aged 19) and Alyssa Thompson (20), both LA natives.

Shores doesn't hide her excitement about joining Angel City. Her former North Carolina teammate King and fellow under-23 national team players in the Thompson sisters and Tiernan all add a sense of familiarity to the move. She's also excited to share a locker room with one of her longtime idols, Christen Press.

“It's not just about getting younger for the sake of it,” Parsons says. “We need balance — veterans who've seen everything and kids who don't even notice pressure. But we've cut our average roster age down to around 25, and we're giving our young players real, meaningful minutes.”

Parsons sees every appearance by Tiernan or King as an investment not just in their own development as players, but in the club's long-term value creation strategy: “If we're doing this right, when a player does eventually move on, it's not for less than we brought them in for. That's how smart clubs operate globally.”

At the midway point of the regular season, Angel City's growing pains have been visible, especially after losing key players King and Claire Emslie to injuries. Though the team currently sits 11th (of 14) in the table, three points outside of the eight playoff spots, Parsons is unfazed.

“Yeah, we've taken some hits, but that's the cost of building something real,” he says.

If that sounds like someone playing a long game, it's because he is: “I told the staff that we're in the tunnel, digging. Not much oxygen, no sunlight, but we're getting close. And when we break through, it's going to be spectacular.”

Shores agrees.

Her early arrival signals not just her ambition, but a belief that Angel City's future is worth betting on.

Jeff Kassouf breaks down his top candidates to win NWSL MVP, with San Diego's Delphine Cascarino taking the top spot. (3:20)

It is impossible to ignore the parallels between expansion in the NWSL and MLS. The NWSL's rising valuations, growing demand and increased emphasis on building new facilities look like the MLS playbook on repeat.

NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman, however, has recently focused on another league as her comparative benchmark: the NFL.

Berman has said multiple times in various settings that she believes the NWSL, which will expand to 16 teams next year, can support 30 to 32 franchises like the NFL. The comparison has raised a few eyebrows and several basic questions: Is the idea genuine, or a moonshot meant to generate buzz? What would a 32-team NWSL even look like? And is bigger actually better?

ESPN spoke with over half a dozen club owners and executives, as well as executives in the branding and sports banking world, to understand how the league's future growth might develop. Most of them asked to be granted anonymity to speak more freely.

One thing is obvious: There is a significant demand to invest in the NWSL, and women's sports at large.

"The interest in the NWSL is tangible and you can see it," Sean Clemens, managing director of sports investment bank Park Lane -- which has worked on deals and valuations across major sports -- told ESPN.

"We certainly see it only continuing. We take a lot of calls from interested investors that are trying to find ways to get involved in NWSL. The story is resonating with investors, and we really don't see that changing anytime soon."

The NWSL's task is to convert that demand into growth. Multiple NWSL board members told ESPN that they can see the league doubling in size eventually, but that Berman's benchmark is a long way off -- long enough that they wouldn't even hazard a guess on a timeline.

For all the times that Berman has mentioned the idea, she has never said how long it could take. A 30- or 32-team league right now seems ludicrous, but it sounds more achievable as a goal that is decades in the distance.

Another NWSL board member said they see a pathway to 20 teams through more rounds of expansion. After that, they said, it is difficult to see the league getting bigger -- but they conceded that "the economics keep pushing you forward," as was the case for MLS, which took 16 years to double in size from 15 teams to 30 this season. (The NWSL has already doubled in size since launching in 2013 with eight teams.)

"Our board believes that we can be the size of the NFL, there is nothing that stands in the way of us doing that, other than having access to top talent," Berman said on stage at a U.S. Soccer event in Los Angeles in April. "There's certainly not a problem with the supply, given the size of our country and the level of talent that exists, we just need to figure out how to develop them strategically and intentionally."

Those views are not unanimous, however. One team owner told ESPN that the 32-team idea publicly specified by Berman is "very much her vision," and that the board has not discussed a specific number of teams as a target. The same person conceded, however, that there is a strong overall desire among the board to keep expanding.

Others interviewed by ESPN drew a harder line in the sand against the idea of further expansion. One source called it a "crazy" idea to expand so much, while another said it would be "dangerous" for the product. Each referenced the need to improve talent development -- not just players, but staff, too.

Jeff Kassouf and Ali Krieger talk about the impact ex-USWNT star Alex Morgan will have at NWSL side San Diego Wave after becoming the newest minority investor at the club.

Still, even the dissenting crowd recognizes the demand and concedes the economics of expansion. The two most recent rounds of NWSL expansion were semi-public bidding processes that drove up the cost to a $110 million fee for Denver, which will begin play next year. Dozens of serious groups, including several well-qualified finalists in Cincinnati and Cleveland, were left on the sidelines during bidding processes that took place in 2022 and 2024.

One source with knowledge of expansion discussions told ESPN that the next additions to the league could happen more privately through direct conversations. The NWSL's recent bidding processes left both the league and prospective groups with an understanding of what to expect from each other, meaning they don't need to start from the beginning again.

There are also markets that rank high on the NWSL's priority list, cities that several board members view as a matter of "when" not "if" they will join the league. Berman has publicly stated the key criteria that everyone has echoed privately: investment groups need the combination of the right market, ownership backing and facilities plans. None of those criteria will soon change; the only thing that will fluctuate is the cost of entry.

Why keep expanding? Like most things, money is a big part of the answer.

Denver's $110 million expansion fee is over twice as much as Boston Legacy FC paid ($53 million) to join the NWSL. Both teams will begin playing next year, but Boston was awarded the franchise two years earlier, in 2023. Five years ago, ownership groups were paying around $2 million to join the NWSL. The asking price is only going to keep going up.

This is where the NWSL's parallels with MLS continue. MLS expansion fees ballooned from the mid-eight figures just over a decade ago to $500 million for San Diego FC, which began playing this year. One NWSL owner said they firmly believe the NWSL will reach that $500 million expansion fee benchmark in the future as well.

The reality for the NWSL is that it is still a league that loses money, a point made by multiple sources while reporting this story. Expansion fees in any league help current owners offset operating costs and avoid making cash calls to other investors. Those hundreds of millions of dollars are recycled back into the league office and pay off debt.

Almost everyone inside the NWSL who was interviewed for this story spoke about the importance of the next media rights deal and how it is intertwined with expansion. The NWSL's current media rights deals with ESPN, Amazon, CBS and Scripps Sports bring in $60 million annually combined. Those contracts all conclude at the end of 2027. The NWSL is also shopping its unsold games (which currently air on the league's in-house platform) to create more revenue.

Michele Kang tells Jeff Kassouf why she's a fan of promotion and relegation and that she thinks it's "exciting."

Team owners and executives are determined to achieve greater scale for sponsors, and that means they need more visibility on TV and wider reach in more markets across the United States -- a.k.a., they need to expand.

Geographically, the NWSL finally addressed a major hole by adding three teams in California (Angel City FC and San Diego Wave in 2022, Bay FC in 2024) over the past four seasons, but there are still swaths of the country without a team in the league, including in the Southeast and in several big cities between the coasts.

Counting the additions of Boston and Denver, the NWSL is in seven of the top 10 media markets,but only 10 of the top 20, per Nielsen rankings. Some of the NWSL's glaring market absences are Dallas-Fort Worth (No. 4), Atlanta (No. 7) and Miami (No. 18). Atlanta has been in and out of NWSL discussions for nearly a decade. A group in Tampa (the 11th biggest media market) was a finalist in the 2023 expansion process.

But growth is about more than increasing scale of teams and media rights partners. Both a sports banking investor and a global branding expert who has worked with some of the top soccer clubs in the world told ESPN that the NWSL needs a multi-faceted approach to scaling up.

What happens if the NWSL falls short of its lofty goal for media rights valuations in upcoming negotiations? And what good are more games on TV without regular content surrounding them to feed fandom?

The NFL dominates the content cycle every day of the year by making news and storylines. The NWSL, by comparison, falls short in this respect, often disappearing from news cycles in the offseason. Berman & Co. have openly discussed the need for better storytelling around the league, a process that has only recently begun in earnest.

NWSL expansion makes financial sense for the league, and it helps address the historical shortage of professional opportunities for women's soccer players where two previous U.S. leagues have failed. The NWSL's growth to 16 teams next year will bring it to around 400 rostered players.

Every major American men's league has at least 30 teams, and they all utilize conferences and divisions to create rivalries and mitigate travel. The NWSL currently uses a balanced schedule with a single table, a global standard that will become increasingly hard to maintain as the league grows.

The NWSL has also previously compared itself to the global market and other top women's leagues like England's Women's Super League, which just voted to expand from 12 to 14 teams. Thirty-team leagues in a single division are unheard of globally.

Several NWSL general managers expressed concerns about the quality of the league's player pool if expansion continues, with only one out of 14 saying they think 30 teams is a good idea.

The NWSL appears to be mindful of those concerns about compromising the product, and a second division could launch as early as next year for franchises to field reserve teams. Several executives with NWSL connections are also on a recently formed committee tasked with overhauling college soccer. Each solution could allow for more professional development of young players.

"Our strategy is really clear," Berman told ESPN recently about the league's area of focus. "We know that we want to transcend cultural relevance from a business perspective. We want to ensure that people know of the NWSL and want to watch our games and want to attend our games and know the stories of our players.

"On the sporting side, we need to make sure that we have the best product, best players in the world, and that we're developing systems and practices to cultivate the path to pro so that we can continue to scale and grow from an expansion perspective in order for us to capitalize on the incredible demand that exists across the country from an expansion perspective and to be a 30-team league, we have to make sure that we have the ability to source talent domestically and proactively develop that talent."

The NWSL's prospective second division league could also feature non-NWSL members -- which is an expansion strategy, too. One team owner noted that the second division could be seen as a testing ground for NWSL expansion markets. Successful USL markets, for example, have made the move to MLS in the past.

Outside factors will also influence the future of NWSL expansion. The USL Super League just completed its first season as a sanctioned first-division league and while it lacks the star power and visibility of the NWSL that appeals to many investors, the entry costs are a fraction of those in the NWSL. There is an overlap in markets -- some direct, like Washington, D.C., teams in each league playing in the same stadium, and some indirect. Tampa Bay Sun FC, playing in a market the NWSL recently looked at in depth, just won the inaugural USL Super League title.

The WNBA is also expanding, and some investors might chase teams in that league as their entry point into the women's sports boom. The same sports branding expert speaking with ESPN said that the WNBA has a stronger league brand than the NWSL.

Internally, the NWSL still has several clubs underperforming as businesses. Berman has previously shut down the idea that the NWSL would relocate a struggling franchise, but one league source said they feel there is anecdotally less resistance to the idea than there has been in the past.

It is possible that an investment group interested in entering the NWSL will view the acquisition of an existing team as a better investment than starting from scratch, although those opinions vary by investor and team. What is clear is that investors are still hungry to get into women's sports and the NWSL specifically even as valuations rise to $250 million, nearly a hundred times more than some team valuations just five years ago.

Berman believes the NWSL can support 30 teams and that there are enough players to fill those rosters. Will the appetite among investors to join the NWSL remain even as prices continue to rise?

As one sports banking executive put it, market valuation is like a work of art: A team is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it. Right now and for the foreseeable future, the NWSL appears to have a full gallery.

American midfielder Tyler Adams grew up roughly 76 miles from where he made his professional soccer debut, and after growing into one of the leading role models for the U.S. men's national team, the New York native was honored in his hometown. 

Adams was in Wappinger Falls on Tuesday as Martz Field Recreation Facility honored the midfielder with the newly named Tyler Adams Soccer Pitch. A former High School graduate of local Roy C. Ketcham High School, Adams helped led drills with youth soccer players as part of his partnership with Scotts lawn care products to help raise awareness about the expansion of youth access to natural-turf sports fields.  

Fresh from his busy USMNT involvement this summer, Adams shared his enjoyment in giving back to his community and expects the interest in soccer to continue growing. 

“No, I definitely never dreamed of that,” Adams said in an exclusive interview with SBI when asked if he ever thought of a local field being named after him. “It's a huge honor that it happened. I'm really thankful to not only Scotts and my partnership with them, but also to the people in my community that helped really make this possible. Coming back here now and play a part in something that I grew up in playing with my friends and family, and seeing young kids playing soccer is really special.

“You've seen the success of the [U.S.] women's national team and the effect that has on so many young girls around the country,” Adams added. “I think as our U.S. national team gets better and better, that support is going to change for so many young kids. I've seen it grow tremendously in just the past eight years since I've been playing for the national team, so after the World Cup on home soil and so many other tournaments, I can only imagine what it will do.”

Adams made his USMNT debut back in 2017 and has quickly become a leading face of the program, on and off the field. He recently made his 50th cap, while serving as captain throughout the summer in Mauricio Pochettino's squad. 

Now at 26-years-old and in the prime of his club and international career, Adams voiced his excitement for 2026 and also credited the growing changes in the program compared to when he began with the USMNT.

“Having the luxury of playing a World Cup on home soil is amazing,” Adams said. “Not many players in their lifetime get an opportunity to play in a World Cup, let alone on home soil, so for me, I'm going to take that in full swing. I am really enjoying the fact of playing in front of so many friends and family.” 

 “When I first started with the national team, it was probably not as focused on the development of players as it is now,” Adams said. “You have Mauricio and his assistant coaches going to clubs, meeting the coaches and players, seeing how they fit into these teams and helping have these conversations. It's a huge privilege to see the growth of U.S. Soccer and I can only imagine that in another eight years time, it's going to be even better. I take huge pride in being an experienced player now and helping those young players reach their maximum potential.”

Adams will now have a short break from action before beginning preseason camp with English Premier League club Bournemouth ahead of the PL Summer Series in the U.S. Adams most recently completed his second season with the Cherries, delivering a sensational individual campaign of 32 appearances and three assists. 

The South Coast club finished ninth in EPL play, missing out on European qualification by nine points. Andoni Iraola's men also reached the FA Cup quarterfinals while watching international stars like Adams, Justin Kluivert, Antoine Semenyo, and many others shine during the 2024-25 campaign.  

Despite the losses of Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez to Real Madrid and Liverpool respectively this summer, Adams credited Bournemouth's impact on helping those players earn monumental moves in their careers. 

“The growth of the club is reflected by some players going to play at big clubs like Real Madrid Liverpool, that only happens with team success,” Adams said. “Obviously, they're incredible individuals and individual players, but those moves happen when you have a good, successful campaign as a team.”

The Cherries will face off with fellow EPL clubs Everton, West Ham United, and Manchester United during an eight-day period before returning to England for the final matches of their preseason schedule. It will mark the second PL Summer Series in the last three years in North America, which has led to many international stars showing off their talents across several future World Cup venues. 

With Adams serving as the lone American on the first-team squad, he is already planning to be a tour guide for the rest of the group.

“Another honor for me to be able to play with my club, being stateside, and really being able to grow Bournemouth, but also grow myself as well,” Adams said. “I'm sure guys are going to be asking me about different places, where to go, where to eat and shop. Hopefully I can be a tour guide for them.”

European powerhouses Chelsea (England) and Paris Saint-Germain (France) clash Sunday in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final, determining the champion of the prestigious tournament.

This summer's expanded Club World Cup began with 32 teams from six confederations, and two of the sport's most recognizable sides are left vying for the trophy.

The also match features the FIFA Club World Cup Halftime Show headlined by musical artists J Balvin, Doja Cat and Tems.

Chelsea rolled to a 2-0 semifinal win over Fluminense, courtesy of a João Pedro brace against his boyhood club.

The Brazilian striker was recently acquired from fellow English Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion. He joins an attack led by midfielder Cole Palmer, who posted 29 goal contributions (16g/13a) last season.

The Blues are chasing their second-ever Club World Cup title, having won the competition in 2021. Should head coach Enzo Maresca's side prevail, it would mark their second trophy in six weeks after winning the UEFA Conference League in May.

PSG are one game away from yet another title, having won Ligue 1 and the UEFA Champions League during the 2024-25 campaign. They were also crowned Coupe de France and Trophée des Champions winners.

Head coach Luis Enrique's side has outscored their opponents 10-0 in the knockout stages, most recently rolling to a 4-0 semifinal victory over LaLiga giants Real Madrid. Fabián Ruiz netted a brace alongside goals from Ousmane Dembélé and Gonçalo Ramos.

This is PSG's first-ever Club World Cup final appearance.

USA captain Tyler Adams believes his country's summer of soccer has been a 'wake up call' ahead of the World Cup next year.

Both the expanded Club World Cup and Gold Cup have been hosted in the United States this summer, and Adams believes organizers will have their hands full when 48 nations descend upon the USA, Mexico and Canada in 2026.

'I think that it's a learning experience and learning curve that they've needed to take. And I'm honestly very thankful that they're having the Club World Cup and Gold Cup there, and all these tournaments there right now, because I think it's a big wake up call for what they need to prepare for,' Adams said, while promoting his partnership with lawncare company Scotts.

'In terms of, stadiums weren't even necessarily all full for these Club World Cup games, and they're going to be completely full for World Cup games. So how you deal with capacities, how you deal with weather, all these things can change. 

'I think it was the Chelsea game that gets delayed for two hours, stuff like that. You need to prepare for these kinds of things when they happen, and make sure teams are prepared for them as well.'

While the Club World Cup has gathered momentum in the latter stages of the tournament, there have been issues such as slow ticket sales, empty seats and complaints about the playing surface at MetLife Stadium (where the World Cup Final will be held).

Some games earlier in the tournament struggled for crowds, though it has gained momentum

The home of the New York Giants and Jets in East Rutherford, New Jersey is notoriously inconvenient to get to, and Adams is already wary of the challenges that could present fans next year.

'Travel is a big one, isn't it? It's not the normal Premier League where you can take a bus. You know what I mean? It's going to be not easy,' he said from his hometown of Wappingers Falls, New York on Tuesday.

'But listen, also, we're getting escorted in police escorts and all this stuff. So we have a luxury of being there, but for fans and stuff like that, it could prove to be difficult at times.'

The midfielder's comments from the newly-named Tyler Adams Soccer Pitch came not even two full days removed from the USA's Gold Cup Final loss to Mexico.

While Adams hailed the 'experience' that much of the new-look, essentially B-team USA squad got in the 2-1 loss to El Tri, much of the discussion during the tournament focused on who wasn't in the camp.

Christian Pulisic, most notably, earned plenty of criticism for taking a summer break to recharge his batteries, while Antonee Robinson, Sergino Dest and Folarin Balogun all took time away as well for injury maintenance.

Regardless, Adams has his teammates' backs and believes the Gold Cup absentees will have big roles to play in the future.

'I support whatever the player needs. People are talking about the culture of our team, and guys that want to be there. The guys that weren't there have helped build the culture of our team as well. They're significant in every single part of US Soccer,' he said.

'So if people need a rest and people don't need to be there, that's obviously a personal decision and a decision that they need to make, and whenever they start to funnel back in now, we know that we have something to build off of with the players that were there.

Christian Pulisic was criticized by some for his decision to skip the Gold Cup and rest up

The USA were also without star Fulham left-back Antonee Robinson in the tournament

'So again, they're gonna have a significant role to play with the national team, no matter the circumstances, but we are building something special under Mauricio and he's done a really good job.'

Pochettino has had a choppy start with the United States, as his side have struggled against top competition, including a 4-0 friendly loss to Switzerland - admittedly without his top players.

There has also been a perception in certain corners that the Argentine, 53, is not fully committed to the job, and it didn't help his reputation when a report from Irish outlet The42.ie claimed that he had interviewed for the Brentford job.

He later denied the report while speaking to Fox Sports, and Adams wasn't overly concerned with hearing his coach's name next to a big opening.

'This guy's going to get linked to any job that's available,' he said. 'I mean, he's coached PSG, Chelsea, Southampton, Tottenham, those are all massive jobs. So I'm not surprised by it at all, and I can guarantee mid-season in the Premier League, there will be coaches that are getting sacked, and he'll be linked to a job in the Premier League.

'That's just the nature of being a coach, and it works both ways. And he's even said this before. It's like, anything can change in a blink of an eye. So you obviously always have to be on your toes. But we're very fortunate to have him.' 

Adams didn't play under Pochettino until March following the coach's appointment to the role in September, but came away hugely impressed by what he saw during a nearly 40-day stretch of working together this summer.

Pochettino was unable to lead the USA to the Gold Cup crown but Adams is impressed with him

'He taught me a lot about the game, just in terms of being difficult on me, making sure I'm doing the little things to improve, understanding that when we're on the field, it's time to work for the team, and when we're off on the field, take a step away,' Adams began. 'You need to see your family, go ahead. You need to do like, whatever.   

'He's such an open person, and he's very transparent in the way that he works, which is great, because I think in the beginning people were obviously nervous. It was like, "Oh, we don't want to step on eggshells" and got to be careful around him. 

'But he's so transparent, he wants you to come and have a conversation with him, sit down for five, 10 minutes, understand what you need, what he needs. And I think we're on that page now with every single player, which I think is important.'

While Pochettino insisted that the roster at his disposal this summer was the one that 'deserved to be here', his squad at the World Cup will surely include bigger names such as Pulisic. The likes of MLS' Diego Luna and Sebastian Berhalter, meanwhile, also made a case for themselves in recent weeks.

What's for sure is that Adams views this summer in a positive light.

'From a perspective of "Is our team in a better spot now?" I think 100 per cent, because you gave guys experiences that didn't have experiences in tournaments before with the national team, and they're gonna be able to use those experiences moving forward,' he said.

'So now, the next time we play Mexico, and there's 80,000 people in the stands screaming for goals and whatever, it's nothing new to us. It's now an experience that we've had, and we can move on grow from that.'

Adams teamed up with Scotts to launch the 'Keep It Real' sweepstakes, which will see five youth sports nonprofits get their grass fields upgraded by the company.

What's the best type of pitch to play soccer on?

While the answers may vary per person, FIFA has three types of pitch surfaces that are most commonly used: 100% natural grass, hybrid pitches, which use some synthetic fibers to reinforce the natural grass, and 100% synthetic (artificial) fibers.

In the U.S., there has been several criticisms of the pitches used for major tournaments, such as the 2024 Copa America and 2025 Club World Cup. 

"You're playing on a football field, with laid grass that's all patchy and it breaks up every step you take. It's frustrating," U.S. midfielder Weston McKennie said after a Copa America game in Atlanta.

“The pitches aren't great at all. It holds up the ball, the ball barely bounces,” Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham said after their win in Charlotte against Pachuca in the Club World Cup. “It's tough on the knees as well. Hopefully, there's someone who will look at that going into the World Cup next year.”

That's where U.S. men's national team star Tyler Adams comes in. Adams, who captained the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, is partnering with Scotts to improve the quality of turf for youth and set a new standard. 

Adams is helping initiate the “Keep It Real” Sweepstakes from July 10 to July 24, which will give five youth sports organizations across the country the chance to win a complete refurbishment for their natural turf playing field with Scotts products.

So, where did Adams choose to launch the sweepstakes and provide a field makeover? Wappinger, N.Y.

"I picked my hometown, a park that's a short walk away from where my grandmother lives and a place that I grew up walking to as a kid and coming to camp here as a kid," Adams told NBCUniversal Local. "It holds a special place in my heart so to be able to now make it an even better environment for young kids just like I was growing up here, it's really, really nice."

Adams explained the advantages of natural turf over artificial, which has a higher injury risk for players of any age.

"Playing on grass for kids is just so much better. Not only for a young, developing physical body, but for their joints, knees," Adams said. "It keeps you outdoors, the smell of fresh-cut grass is one of the reasons you grow up loving to play soccer...It keeps them cool during the hot days. If this was a turf field right now and it's hot outside, you're burning up, you're overheating."

On the field, Adams and the USMNT are coming off a Gold Cup final loss to Mexico, where they fell 2-1 to El Tri's A team despite missing numerous key players themselves.

How does Adams feel just a few days removed from missing out on a major trophy? He offered a positive outlook on what's to come.

"I think there was so much talk about the expectations on the team going into this tournament with a fairly unexperienced team. To give ourselves an opportunity to play in a final with so much outside noise and so many what ifs...the guys did really well embracing it and taking their opportunity," Adams said. "Every single player that was in that camp deserves to be representing the national team at the highest level and every single player made their mark. 

"We all bought into the process of the collective success shows how good individuals are, not the other way around."

It was also the first major tournament for head coach Mauricio Pochettino, an experienced manager who was brought in to close the gap against the elite nations. 

Adams enjoys what Pochettino brings to the table due to the Argentine's resume and how Adams himself is still developing at 26 years old.

"When you have a coach of that caliber come in it obviously excites you because he's had the opportunity to coach so many amazing players and build so many amazing teams," Adams said. "For me as a young player who's still developing, to work alongside someone with those experiences is really, really cool." 

Adams added that the 40 days spent together in the tournament helped him learn more about Pochettino through more authentic conversations, especially ones outside of soccer that made their coach-to-player relationship more relatable.

After captaining the U.S. in Qatar at a young age, Adams is now establishing similar relationships with his younger teammates. Players like Diego Luna and Malik Tillman are among the fresh American prospects who demonstrated the potential to represent the U.S. in the biggest atmospheres. 

Though 37-year-old center-back Tim Ream captained the U.S. at the Gold Cup, Adams explained how he's helping the younger talent who don't have as much experience on the international stage.

"I was once in their shoes at some point and I had leaders and experienced players that helped guide me through the stages whether it was Michael Bradley or Alejandro Bedoya, big players," Adams said. "Now that I'm kind of in that role, I want to make sure that they have as much success as possible. I'm doing everything I can to put them in positions to succeed, whether it's on the field and giving them good passes and putting them in positions to score goals and have an assist or if it's off the field if they need a shoulder to lean on or have a conversation, help them through those things. 



"They did a great job throughout this tournament and have grown a lot now into themselves. They're going to be important players for us moving forward."

With the Gold Cup in the rearview, the U.S. has just eight-plus games spread out over the course of a year until the 2026 World Cup.

In Qatar, Adams and Co. advanced from the group stage on the final matchday but fell to the Netherlands 3-1 in the round of 16. In 2026, Adams wants to put the world on notice when the U.S. welcomes 47 other countries for the quadrennial tournament.

"The expectation has to be to leave our mark," Adams said. "Leaving our mark is going even further than what we did in the past World Cup, showing that we developed, showing that there's such a big ambition of how we want to improve soccer in the U.S." 

Going a step further, Adams is amped to have the opportunity to play in a home World Cup given that not many will experience the feeling. Understanding the need to embrace the pressure, Adams kept it straightforward on why the country needs a commendable performance with millions across the world watching.

"The success that we have is going to directly affect the growth of soccer in the U.S.," he said.

Premier League bosses are refusing to shift Chelsea's opening fixture - even after the Blues reached the Club World Cup final.

Chelsea are scheduled to face Crystal Palace on Sunday, August 17, which comes just 34 days after the Blues play against Paris Saint-Germain in the final in New York's MetLife Stadium this Sunday.

That leaves Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca's plans in tatters, as they will have just over a month for both a holiday for the players and then straight into pre-season training ahead of the kick-off.

It will put immense pressure on Chelsea's squad and also leave them facing potential exhaustion after their impressive run to the Club World Cup final.

Chelsea stand to win £97million in prize money if they can win the trophy, but the downside is the daunting schedule for the players and the club.

The Blues are understood to have asked for help from the Premier League, but their chief football officer Tony Scholes insisted that there could be no special favours for either Chelsea or Manchester City following their participation in the States.

That has been reiterated by the Premier League as Chelsea are in the Club World Cup right until the end. The Premier League feel it is an example of the challenges faces by domestic leagues after FIFA expanded their calendar.

But they feel that FIFA should have considered this aspect before putting another major club competition into the football calendar. Chelsea viewed the 2024/25 season and 2025/26 as a “rolled into one” campaign because of the overlap but that will not ease the pressure on Maresca's squad.

City boss pep Guardiola admitted during the tournament that it could be a “disaster” for their forthcoming season. They ended up going home on June 30 after losing to Al-Hilal so will get an extra two weeks on Chelsea.

But Guardiola said: “I try not to think about it, otherwise I will be so anxious. Maybe in November, December, January, ask me, Pep. I may say: ‘So listen, we are a disaster. We are exhausted. The World Cup destroyed us.' We will see.”

Speaking back in May, ahead of the Club World Cup, Maresca admitted he would have to be careful with managing the burden placed on his players. “For sure, there is a chance we have players who because of the amount of games they can get injured or be tired. Then we see how we need to be," he said.

“Is it an added challenge for the players to think they have to play so many games? For me, it's not normal and it is not correct. I can understand people thinking ‘yeah but they earn (so) much money, that it's not a problem' but it's about health, protecting players.”

Unexpectedly cheap tickets gave my boy an overwhelming soccer experience, and me a jolt of faith in a flawed tournament

My son had never been to a professional soccer game.

Soccer is, shall we say, not really his thing. It's also never been particularly important to me that he likes soccer, that he likes what I like. Our sons will be their own men, come what may.

But the sport has brought me untold joy, not to mention paid a good chunk of our mortgage. So I have tried to gently expose him to it here and there. He played a single season of low-stakes rec soccer. I must confess that I lightly bribed him into that by letting him pick out his own cleats – he chose neon green ones, for his favorite color then, even though I warned he wouldn't be able to see his own feet in the grass. He made a gamely effort every week. On the drive home after the final session, he announced his retirement as a player. Literally. “Mama, Papa, I'm retired from soccer.” Oh well.

Lukie, who turns nine in two weeks, is kind, social and bright. He possesses a soaring curiosity and creativity. He is neurodivergent, too – ADHD. When he was younger, loud noises spooked him. A train pulling into a station. A solid round of applause. Loud music. Thunder. But he seemed to have grown out of that, although he still hates hand dryers in public bathrooms.

I'd been toying with the idea of taking my family to a Club World Cup game. I am on the record with my skepticism of this steroidal, money-munching monstrosity, while I have also acknowledged that the soccer on show – and the fans, perhaps more pertinently – have been redeeming.

But there was nonetheless an appeal in the chance to see some of the world's biggest clubs playing for something competitive, and so close to home. So I looked for tickets and discovered that the dynamic prices for Tuesday's semi-final between Chelsea and Fluminense had utterly collapsed from nearly $500 a few days earlier, just to get into New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, to as little as $13. At those prices, who could resist?

I snagged three tickets in the lower bowl for a comical $40 apiece for Lukie, myself and my wife. Lukie was excited about going to see a high-stakes game in good seats at the big stadium. We'd go right after he finished his morning robotics camp. We were entrusting Lukie's maiden experience of the sport at the highest level to Fifa president Gianni Infantino and his fever dream for what he thinks soccer should be.

On the drive down, I expounded on the virtues of soccer, on the magic of not knowing whether the theater you had bought a ticket to would give you nine goals or none. There was no plot; certainly no script.

“Oh, listen to Mr. Soccer Man,” Lukie said, teasing me. “Bragging about soccer.” Then he put on his headphones and streamed a dino show on his Kindle. (Lukie, who has read and approved this column, wants you to know he is “deeply into dinosaurs right now.”)

We paid the extortionate parking fee of $65, which was apparently not prone to market fluctuations and, in fact, has risen by $5 for each subsequent round of Club World Cup games held at MetLife. I checked my phone. 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36C). Feels like 98.

Lukie was charmed by the competing music and scents of grilling meats around the parking lot, as other children doused themselves with water. He stood and watched the dancing and singing Fluminense fans for a while. We weaved through the various human funnels of the security checks and exclusion zones.

Once inside, he got to feel the child's awe at walking into a mega stadium for the first time, laying eyes on the colossal rings of stands framing the verdant field. His mouth fell open.

After that, it was just too much of everything. A DJ blasted the same old stadium tunes, suggesting there was no need for a DJ at all (Except to occasionally shout “Fifa Club World Cup 2025, here we gooo!”) Michael Buffer, better known as the “let's-get-ready-to-ruuumbleee” guy from boxing, was there doing his thing for some reason. Flames burst skyward, sparks shot into the air, fireworks boomed. Players ambled into the broiling heat amid overcooked introductions. Explosions of smoke in the clubs' colors wafted through the air.

All of it assaulted Lukie's senses at once. In his seat, he tucked his legs into his chest and covered his ears. João Pedro's first Chelsea goal, and the ensuing roar from the crowd, finally fried his circuits. He burst into tears.

My wife took him out on to the concourse for an $11 ice cream and found MetLife Stadium staff. Peter and Christine, American heroes both, convinced Lukie to give the game another try, handing him noise-canceling headphones, some sunglasses, and all of us new seats up on a platform in a quieter and roomier area for people with disabilities.

These MetLife Stadium workers spoke to a child with empathy and enthusiasm, even as madness swirled all about them. Among the 70,556 fans – the ticket price dump had evidently worked – they managed to make one scared boy feel seen and heard. Humanity shone through in amid the artifice and the avarice.

When João Pedro scored again, sealing Chelsea's place in the Club World Cup final against PSG on Sunday, Lukie saw it clearly. But the goal entered his consciousness without the same noise or brightness. His brain got a chance to process what it had seen, without getting drowned out by sound and sight. He cracked a smile.

Soccer, in the end, was still not for him. That's OK. He got to try it, on his terms.

To me, someone who tends to observe the sport from up in the press box, away from the maelstrom of the masses, it was a helpful reminder of what soccer feels like on the ground level. And that for all the commercialism and corporatism we rightly cover and criticize in the media, even sport at the highest level is still played by people, attended by people and put on by people who are trying their best.

FIFA has opened an office in Trump Tower in New York City, the organization's president Gianna Infantino announced this week, in the latest sign of deepening ties between soccer's governing body and President Trump before the U.S. hosts next year's World Cup.

Infantino announced the decision in a presentation at the Trump Organization's Manhattan headquarters Monday, where he was joined by the president's son Eric Trump and former Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo, a two-time World Cup winner.

"So today, we are opening an office of FIFA here in Trump Tower," Infantino said. 

The FIFA president added that soccer's governing body has "received such a big support" from the Trump White House and its World Cup task force. That government task force is chaired by Mr. Trump, whom Infantino called "a big fan of soccer."

He also thanked Eric Trump and the Trump Organization for their support. "Our success is your success," the FIFA president said. Eric Trump, executive vice president at the Trump Organization, praised the FIFA president for "bringing the tournament" to the U.S.

CBS News has reached out to FIFA and the Trump Organization for comment.

The FIFA president has built close ties with Mr. Trump since he returned to office in January. 

Infantino has made several appearances alongside the U.S. leader: He attended the president's inauguration, has visited the Oval Office at least twice and met Mr. Trump during his overseas trip to the Middle East in May, during which the FIFA leader received a standing ovation. 

"Great job, Gianni," Mr. Trump said at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum.

Infantino was late to FIFA's annual congress held in Paraguay after joining Mr. Trump in Saudi Arabia and Qatar in May. In protest, delegates from FIFA's European confederation, UEFA, walked out of that session.

In a statement to CBS News, UEFA called Infantino's delay "deeply regrettable" and backed its representatives, saying that the "last minute" request by FIFA to "accommodate private political interests does the game no service."

Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters this week he plans to attend the final of the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday.

The Club World Cup trophy was also revealed to the public at Trump Tower earlier this week. It was first displayed in the Oval Office in March and will now stay in Mr. Trump's New York property until Sunday's finals, in which French champions and UEFA Champions League winners Paris Saint Germain will face English Premier League team Chelsea.

The Club World Cup brings individual clubs from all six continental confederations of FIFA. Under the new format, 32 teams were selected for this year's tournament based on their domestic and international achievements. Although similar in name, the better-known World Cup features national teams only.

The opening of an office in Trump Tower is another move to expand FIFA's presence in the United States ahead of the World Cup. Last summer, it opened a legal and compliance division office in Miami.

The United States, Canada, and Mexico are set to co-host the World Cup next year. Two Canadian, three Mexican, and 11 American cities will welcome 48 nations to the iconic competition, up from 32, its first increase since 1998.

Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a massive spending law that passed both chambers of Congress last week, allocates $625 million for World Cup security funding. It also offers $1 billion for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

Mr. Trump's interest in the World Cup dates back to his first term, when FIFA awarded the event to the U.S. and its neighbors. The president urged other FIFA members to support the U.S. bid ahead of FIFA's 2018 decision.

Hosting the World Cup has become as sought-after as the Olympics for nations around the world. The event attracts a massive television audience, with some 570 million viewers tuning into the 2022 Finals match, according to figures from FIFA.

But the selection process has increasingly attracted controversy, with FIFA facing allegations of corruption and bribery in the way it has managed past contests to secure hosting and media rights. Federal officials in the U.S. have prosecuted the heads of various regional soccer bodies for taking bribes and kickbacks. The organization denies the accusations of widespread bribery and says the game is for everyone.

"We want to make football truly global and in order for football to become truly global, we need to embrace the entire globe," Infantino said in the draw ceremony of the 2023 Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia.

Soccer fans couldn't contain their excitement as international star Lionel Messi and Inter Miami took on the New England Revolution in an MLS match at Gillette Stadium Wednesday night. 

The match took place just one year before Gillette is set to host seven matches in the FIFA World Cup tournament next summer. 

Messi fans packed the stadium on Wednesday, taking over the home of the Revolution. 

"Really looking forward to seeing Messi play," fan Lucy Pulcifer said, "The move to Miami, I was like amazing, maybe I'll see him here cause I'll never get to go to Europe."

Local hotels near Foxborough say they will open up rooms for World Cup dates in January, and that the rooms will go fast.

On Airbnb, some hosts are seeing a major spike in revenue, with one home going for $15,000 for the duration of the tournament compared to $4,000 in April and May.

Inter Miami beat the Revolution 2-1 on Wednesday night behind two goals from Messi.

Shades of David Luiz's hamstring in the 2012 Champions League final?

It was almost a perfect win on Tuesday against Fluminense in the Club World Cup semifinals, but then just a few minutes from time, Moisés Caicedo appeared to twist his ankle in an otherwise fairly innocuous and routine play.

He tried to play on after hobbling off initially, but would end up watching the final few seconds from the touchline anyway, with Enzo Maresca urging him to take it easy lest he aggravate things unnecessarily.

Afterwards, the head coach revealed some worry over Caicedo's status for Sunday's final. Coaches tend to be optimistic over injuries, so this is a definite concern.

“Moi twisted his ankle. When it happened I told him that we could play with 10 players and hope it doesn't get worse. He felt he could try (to play on) which he did and he felt pain. Hopefully he can be fit for Sunday.”

-Enzo Maresca; source: AFP

Caicedo made no mention of the injury in is post-match Instagram post, but as per a fan video on Twitter, he didn't exactly look too comfortable coming off the team bus.  Twisted ankles don't just go away in a few days unfortunately.

With Dário Essugo and Roméo Lavia already out with injuries as well, it would be either Reece James or Andrey Santos to deputize for Moi.  James was set to start in that role in the quarterfinals when Caicedo was suspended, until his own pre-match injury forced him out.  Santos, who probably should've started anyway, did quite well unsurprisingly — and, as a bonus, he already has direct knowledge of PSG, too!  In fact, he played a key role in Strasbourg beating them, 2-1, just a couple months ago, in early May.

Which way shall the stars align?

LONDON (AP) — As if there were any doubt whether Aryna Sabalenka's loss in the Wimbledon semifinals on Thursday brought to mind her loss in the French Open final — and its aftermath — a month ago, she made it quite clear right away.

"Are you guys waiting for something? You're not going to see a 'Roland-Garros press conference,'" the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka said when she arrived for her question-and-answer session with reporters after being eliminated by Amanda Anisimova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 at Centre Court, "so anyone who was waiting for that, you can leave right now."

It was delivered as a punch line, knowing full well that the three-time Grand Slam champion was widely criticized for her words following a three-set loss to Coco Gauff with the trophy at stake in Paris.

There was plenty of online venom directed Sabalenka's way.

So much so, that Sabalenka first wrote a private apology to Gauff, then offered a public mea culpa, before the two patched things up by posting TikTok and Instagram videos together right before the start of competition at the All England Club.

"I just don't want to face that hate again," Sabalenka said Thursday. "We're all people. We all can lose control over our emotions. It's absolutely normal. Every time when I was really that close in that match today to completely lose it and start — I don't know — yelling, screaming, smashing the rackets, I keep reminding myself that's not an option."

After praising Anisimova — an American seeded 13th who will play in her first major final on Saturday against Iga Swiatek — as "the better player," Sabalenka spoke about the feelings she experiences following a setback.

"The first moment (is) always the worst one, because every time you compete at that tournament, and you get to the last stages, you think that you're getting close to your dream," said the 27-year-old from Belarus. "Then you lose the match, and you feel like, 'OK, this is the end.'"

Sabalenka was hoping to become the first woman in a decade to reach four major finals in a row after winning the U.S. Open last year, then finishing as the runner-up at the Australian Open and French Open in 2025.

She also was trying to get to her first title match at Wimbledon.

So used to overpowering opponents, Sabalenka ran into someone who hits as big a ball as she does.

"She was more brave today," Sabalenka said. "Maybe when I was just trying to stay in the point, she was going for all. She was playing more aggressive."

There were other things about Anisimova that Sabalenka acknowledged were irritating.

During one exchange, for example, Anisimova let out a shout before a point was over, and Sabalenka thought it was a premature celebration.

"I was, like, I mean, 'That's a bit too early.' Then she kind of (angered me), saying that, oh, that's what she does all the time," Sabalenka said. "I was grateful that she actually said that," because it helped bring out more fight.

Asked about that moment, Anisimova said: "I wasn't celebrating. It was just a long grunt, I guess. I don't really know what was the deal there, to be honest, because I didn't feel like it was that interfering. But I tried to not do it again."

During another point, Anisimova benefited from the ball trickling over the tape of the net and, instead of the usual "Sorry, not sorry" gesture players often use by raising a hand when that happens, seemed to be celebrating.

"I was like, 'You don't want to say sorry?' She just wanted, I guess, badly to win this match," Sabalenka said. "If she doesn't feel like saying sorry — she barely got that point and she didn't feel like saying sorry for that tricky situation? — that's on her."

As for what comes next for Sabalenka?

"I never give up," she said, "and I'm going to come back stronger, for sure."

Listen to Story

Aryna Sabalenka showed how much she has grown from her Roland Garros experience, saying that she won't do a repeat of the rant she had after losing the final to Coco Gauff. However, the World No.1 said she has a 'hate relationship' with Wimbledon now as she exited the competition with a semi-final loss to Amanda Anisimova on Thursday, July 10. 

Sabalenka lost the match against Anisimova 4-6, 6-4, 4-6 to exit Wimbledon for the third time in the final four stage. However, the World No.1 was gracious in defeat, unlike the time she went on a rant after the French Open final loss. Sabalenka courted controversy that time when she said that Gauff won the title in Paris as she wasn't playing at her best on the day and was faced backlash for it. This time around, Sabalenka started her presser by saying that people expecting a similar rant should leave the press room. 

“You're not gonna see a Roland Garros press conference. Anyone who was waiting for that, you can leave right now,” said Sabalenka. 

When asked about her learning from the French Open experience, the World No.1 said that she didn't want to face hate again for her comments and also revealed how she showed restraint during the frustrating moments in the match. Sabalenka also said she took more time in the press room as she wanted everyone to see the real version of her and not the one they saw at Roland Garros. 

“I just don't want to face that hate again (laughing). No, I mean, we're all people. We all can lose control of our emotions. It's absolutely normal. Every time when I was really that close today in this match to completely losing it and start yelling, screaming, smashing racquets, I kept reminding myself that that's not an option and it's not gonna help me stay in the match and fight for my dream. Even right now I took a bit more time before doing my media. Just so I can be Aryna, not that crazy person that was at that media day at Roland Garros,” said Sabalenka. Sabalenka's hate relationship with Wimbledon

After losing three semis and having her fair share of misfortunes as well, Sabalenka said she is hoping that her relationship with Wimbledon will become better in the future. 

"I lost three semis, three tough ones. Then I was banned from playing. Then I was injured," Sabalenka said. "So I have really more of a hate relationship right now with Wimbledon, but I really hope that one day I will, yeah, turn it around and have love relationship."Of course, if one day I'm going to be able to win it, of course, I'm going to look back on all of these tough losses and think that I still did it. Yeah, now it's tough, but I never give up, and I'm going to come back stronger, for sure," said Sabalenka. - EndsPublished By: alan johnPublished On: Jul 10, 2025Read More: |  Wimbledon: Iga Swiatek ends agonising wait for final, sets up clash with Anisimova

WIMBLEDON -- As the baking temperatures of Wimbledon's first two days returned, No. 13 seed Amanda Anisimova kept a cool head to reach the first Grand Slam final of her career, defeating No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 37 minutes.

Stats corner: The result is Anisimova's sixth career Top 5 win, and first over a reigning World No. 1. Four of those Top 5 wins have come over Sabalenka, against whom she now holds a 6-3 head-to-head record with wins on every surface. Anisimova now has a 12-2 record on grass this year, having reached the Queen's final four weeks ago and followed it by making the Berlin quarterfinals.

The 23-year-old American became the first player born in the 21st century to reach the Wimbledon final; shortly afterward, Iga Swiatek became the second after defeating Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0. Anisimova is the seventh player born in the 21st century to reach any major final, following Bianca Andreescu, Swiatek, Emma Raducanu, Leylah Fernandez, Coco Gauff and Zheng Qinwen.

Anisimova and Swiatek, both born in 2001 have never met at pro level, and just once in juniors -- a 6-4, 6-2 win for Swiatek on clay in the 2016 Junior Billie Jean King Cup final. The Wimbledon final will be the 10th Grand Slam final of the Open Era contested by players born in the same year, and second in a row at SW19 following Barbora Krejcikova's 2024 defeat of Jasmine Paolini.

"You can get back to the top if you prioritize yourself": A star junior who quickly brought her prodigious talent to the Hologic WTA Tour, reaching the 2019 Roland Garros semifinals as a 17-year-old, Anisimova's path to this moment has not been straightforward. In 2023, she took a seven-month mental health break from tennis. This time last year, she was on the comeback trail, but at No. 189 was ranked too low to get into the Wimbledon main draw; she fell in qualifying to Eva Lys.

But since then, Anisimova has rocketed into the Top 20 following her first WTA 1000 final in Toronto last August, then her first WTA 1000 title in Doha this February. She is guaranteed to make her Top 10 debut next Monday. She also becomes just the second player in the Open Era to reach a major final after losing in the previous year's qualifying event, following Andreescu at the 2019 US Open.

"I think it goes to show that it is possible," Anisimova said afterward. "I think that's a really special message that I think I've been able to show because when I took my break, a lot of people told me that you would never make it to the top again if you take so much time away from the game. That was a little hard to digest, because I did want to come back and still achieve a lot and win a Grand Slam one day. Just being able to prove that you can get back to the top if you prioritize yourself. That's been incredibly special to me."

Match moments: The two players finished the match with similar top-line numbers -- indeed, they favored Sabalenka, who hit more winners (31 to 30) and committed fewer unforced errors (37 to 42) overall. As ever, those stats only told part of the story.

The first two sets were mostly characterized by straightforward holds (and two medical emergencies in the crowd, Sabalenka earning Centre Court's approval for taking water over each time). Consecutive games midway through the opener saw both players face multiple break points, and both came through unscathed. In the end, there was only one service break in each of the first two sets -- both conceded on a double fault. Sabalenka's came down set point in the last game of the opener; Anisimova repaid the favor in the seventh game of the second set, which saw her first-serve percentage drop from 67% to 54%.

In the penultimate game of the second set, the match delivered its first edge-of-your-seat game as Anisimova boldly fended off four set points -- despite Sabalenka striking one of the best shots of the match, a backhand pass following a scrambling rally that highlighted just how much her defense has improved over the years.

Despite Sabalenka closing out the set on serve, then immediately breaking Anisimova to open the decider, it was this grit that the World No. 12 took through the rest of the match. She broke back immediately, then moved up 3-1 as Sabalenka sent a forehand sitter just over the baseline.

The remainder of the match pivoted on whether Anisimova could protect her lead. She passed her first test, saving two break-back points in the subsequent game then coming up with a superb winning pass that landed on the outside of the line en route to holding. A breathtaking redirected winner, bold volleys and a fortuitous net cord enabled her to advance to 5-2.

As Anisimova came to the line to serve for the match, Sabalenka stepped up, piling on the pressure and refusing to miss in high-octane rallies. Anisimova's backhand began to let her down for the first time in the match, going wide on her first match point then long down break point.

But with the match back on serve, Sabalenka couldn't maintain the momentum. Cheap errors handed Anisimova triple match point in the subsequent game, and Anisimova found a forehand winner to convert her fourth.

"I was trying to really stay on top of my serve, was struggling a bit there," Anisimova said. "Holding serve was just going to be super important. In the third set I knew that I was going to really have to go for it. Her level just kept increasing and getting better and better throughout the match. So to be able to come on top, I knew that I wasn't just going to win off her mistakes. I really had to bring my game and do as much as I could, especially when it came to being aggressive."

"Next year I'm only hungrier and angrier": Sabalenka falls to 0-3 in Wimbledon semifinals, following her losses to Karolina Pliskova in 2021 and Ons Jabeur in 2023. Her 12 career major semifinals are the most of any player since Maria Sharapova, and she has converted three of those into titles.

Despite her three-set losses in Grand Slams this year, and in all her Wimbledon semifinals, Sabalenka was able to take positives from her results.

"I think even though I lost a lot of finals, I lost tough matches at the Slams this year, I still think that the consistency I was able to bring till this moment, it's impressive," she said. "Still a lot of things to be proud of. This experience shows that next year I'm only hungrier and angrier. These tough defeats help me to come back much stronger. I have huge hopes for the next year.

"I think I just have to constantly in those matches remind myself, like, how strong I am and remember I have to be the brave one, I have to go for my shots. I don't have to stop my arms. I have to be confident in my shots, in my decisions, just trust myself. It seems like in all of these three, three tough defeats on the Slams, for me it seems like I wasn't trusting myself. Every time when I remind myself you have to trust, you can do literally anything on the court, every time I show my best tennis.

"I think maybe US Open left, I have to just trust myself and go for it."

Remember her name.

American tennis sensation Amanda Anisimova upset top seed Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon on July 10, 2025, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, to reach the ladies' singles final.

It has been an incredible journey for Anisimova from reaching the French Open semifinal as a 17-year-old from a recent mental health break to now reaching the precipice of tennis immortality on the grass courts on the All England Club.

The 23-year-old, who hails from Colts Neck, N.J., now becomes the youngest American woman to reach the Wimbledon singles final since Serena Williams in 2004.

Anisimova, the tournament's 13th seed, will face Iga Swiatek in the final on July 12, 2025, where she will look to become the first American to win Wimbledon since Williams, her tennis idol, in 2016.

Anisimova was in disbelief at what she accomplished in the Wimbledon semifinal in July 2025.

“It doesn't feel real right now,” she said during her post-match interview, gushing that she was happy her sister, Maria Anisimova-Egee, nephew, brother-in-law and best friend were all in London supporting her.

“To be honest, if you told me I'd be in the final at Wimbledon, I would not believe you, at least not this soon.”

Anisimova will move into the WTA Top 10 rankings for the first time in her career on July 14, 2025.

It's been a memorable 2025 thus far as she reached the Round of 16 at the French Open, was a Queen's Club finalist and was crowned the Doha champion.

In 2022, Anisimova ousted fellow American Coco Gauff in the third round at Wimbledon. 

Anisimova took a break from tennis from May 2023 until January 2024 after her first-round loss to qualifier Arantxa Rus in the Madrid Open that April.

“I've really been struggling with my mental health and burnout since the summer of 2022,” the then-21-year-old wrote on Instagram. “It's become unbearable being at tennis tournaments. At this point, my priority is my mental well-being and taking a break for some time. I've worked as hard as I could to push through it. I will miss being out there, and I appreciate all the continuous support.”

After returning to tennis, Anisimova lost in the qualifying for Wimbledon in June 2024 and was a Canadian Open Finalist that August.

Anisimova, who was born in New Jersey and moved to Miami at age 3, climbed the tennis ranks early on. 

She was the 2017 U.S. Open junior champion.

Anisimova rose to fame when she reached the 2019 French Open semifinals after beating reigning champion Simona Halep at age 17.

She became the youngest American woman to reach a Grand Slam semifinal since Venus Williams at the 1997 U.S. Open.

She finished 2019 ranked No.24, the youngest of three teenagers in the Top 50 at the time.

Anisimova's parents, Olga and Konstantin, immigrated from Russia to the United States in 1998 with their eldest daughter, Maria.

Anisimova withdrew from the 2019 U.S. Open after her father and longtime coach died of a heart attack.

Her sister Maria played college tennis for the University of Pennsylvania

Keen to avoid repeating a past mistake, Aryna Sabalenka struck a diplomatic tone immediately after her three-set defeat to Amanda Anisimova in the Wimbledon semifinals.

"You're not going to see a Roland-Garros press conference," the No. 1 seed told reporters while arriving for her presser.

Sabalenka garnered some criticism for what many perceived to be the dismissive way she described Coco Gauff's performance in the Roland-Garros women's final in June.

"It was honestly the worst tennis I've played in I don't know how many months," she said at the time. "Conditions were terrible, and she simply was better in these conditions than me. … I think she won the match not because she played incredible, just because I made all of those mistakes from, if you look from the outside, easy balls."

Sabalenka apologized in a subsequent interview with Eurosport Germany (via Charlie Eccleshare of The Athletic) and called her remarks "unprofessional."

On Thursday, the three-time major Grand Slam champion did provide one notable soundbite when discussing a contentious moment in the second set against Anisimova.

Anisimova started to celebrate before a point ended, which clearly didn't sit well with Sabalenka.

She said in her press conference the American "kind of pissed me off."

"But I was grateful and thankful that she said that because I was like, it actually helped me to keep fighting," Sabalenka told reporters. "I was like ok, now I'm gonna show you the tennis. I came back because I got really angry in that moment."

The three-time Wimbledon semifinalist didn't want to create another Roland-Garros moment, but she may once again garner the wrong kind of headlines thanks to her London presser.

Tennis

THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON — Iga Świątek is not messing around as she moves into her first Wimbledon final.

She dominated Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0 Thursday to set up a meeting with Amanda Anisimova of the U.S., with the controlled, clinical aggression on both serve and return that has defined her tennis the past fortnight.

Advertisement

Neither Świątek nor Anisimova has reached this stage before, but the Pole is the vastly more experienced player. She is a five-time Grand Slam champion who has spent 125 weeks as the world No. 1, even if by her own extremely high standards, she has fallen on harder times of late. The win makes Swiatek the only active WTA Tour player to reach a Grand Slam final on all three surfaces and a victory on Saturday would be Świątek's first title anywhere since winning a fourth Roland Garros title in June 2024, in what will be only her second final in that time.

She still looks like a different player to the one who struggled throughout stretches of the last year. Her ability to ride out difficult moments has been a particular feature of this Wimbledon run, in contrast to the way in which she had started letting tight matches run away from her, by overhitting when things got tight and sending herself into a doom loop of mistakes. It happened in her shock defeat to a redlining Yulia Putintseva, who made one unforced error in a 13-game stretch of their third-round meeting here last year.

Świątek was so good against Bencic that there weren't too many tight moments. It briefly looked like things might get interesting when consecutive double faults helped give Bencic a couple of break points at the start of the second set, but Świątek quickly closed the door and got back to serving efficiently and returning with devastating aggression.

She won 83 percent of first-serve points and made 90 percent of returns.

Those strong foundations gave Świątek the platform to produce the kind of masterclass that brought back memories of the 2022 version of her who won two Grand Slams and won 37 matches in a row. She played with variety when needed, volleying with confidence for instance, but she barely needed to veer from her Plan A because it was working so well.

After winning the first three games of the match, confidence was coursing through Świątek. Bencic took a little while to settle, not helped by a nasty-looking fall in the second set. Play was paused after a spectator required medical assistance in the crowd, but Świątek did not let up.

In the final game of the first set, she chased down a drop shot and flicked away a forehand passing-shot winner; In the first point of the second, she crunched a forehand winner down the line to send the message that there was going to be no quarter.

At the start of the next game she middled a crosscourt backhand return winner past her demoralised opponent. “She's in the zone,” nine-time Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova said in commentary for the BBC.

A feature of watching Świątek during 2022, and whenever she's been at her best, is wondering not whether she will lose, but how many games her opponent will win. She streaked away to a 5-0 lead in the second set, before crunching a backhand return to bring up a first match point.

Bencic saved it, but Świątek secured a trademark bagel set a couple of points later with another backhand winner, after 71 minutes on court. A statement victory, for a first Grand Slam final on grass.

Novak Djokovic has canceled his Thursday afternoon practice at Wimbledon, the All England Club confirmed, one day after taking a scary fall in the final game of his win over No. 22 Flavio Cobolli (6-7, 6-2, 7-5, 6-4). Djokovic is set to face No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the semifinals Friday and originally had a practice scheduled for 1-3 p.m. Thursday in preparation.

The 38-year-old can reschedule the practice to later, if he chooses.

Djokovic slipped on the grass Wednesday after a forehand attempt led to a return from Cobolli that hit the net cord and made Djokovic lean to his left. His leg then bent awkwardly on the turf at the All England Lawn and Tennis Club.

Djokovic laid on the turf for a few seconds face down as the crowd at Centre Court was silent while Cobolli went to his opponent's side and picked up his racket. Djokovic got back up on his own power, wiped his brow and finished out the final two points of the quarterfinal.

"Well, I finished the match" Djokovic said of his injury scare. "Nasty slip, but that's what happens when you play on grass. I didn't fall so far this year, and it's a bit surprising because of the way I move on the grass. And with aggressive movement, you're expected to fall. It did come at an awkward moment, but I managed to find a good serve and close it out. 

"Obviously, I'll visit this subject now with my physio and will play in a few days."

Djokovic is targeting his 25th Grand Slam this week and needs two more wins to get there. Djokovic (+650) had the third-best odds to win behind French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz (+110) and Sinner (+190) according to FanDuel Sportsbook at the start of the tournament.

"Whether it could be my 'last dance,' I'm not sure ... as I'm not sure about Roland Garros or any other Slam that I play next," Djokovic said before his first-round match last week. "My wish is to play for several more years. I would love to be healthy physically and also mentally motivated to keep on playing at the highest level. That's the goal. But you never know at this stage."

Djokovic lost to Alcaraz in straight sets during last year's Wimbledon final and last won the event in 2022.

"These tournaments give me the biggest drive, still," Djokovic said. "I like the way I feel right now, physically. Tennis-wise, I've been playing good on the practice sessions. Obviously completely different when you start a tournament. I'll try to have a very good tournament and go as far as I can."

Djokovic lost to Sinner in the French Open semifinals earlier this summer and has not won a major since 2023. He now gets an opportunity to return the favor on grass.

"[It] was a straight-set loss, but I feel like I did give him a run for his money, so to say," Djokovic said at Roland-Garros after falling to the 23-year-old Italian. "I tried to make him work till the last shot. I did what I could. This is sport. You have to just shake the hand of the better player and move on."

Rinky Hijikata ripped a forehand winner and celebrated in raucous fashion on Thursday after securing a spot in the Wimbledon men's doubles final on Saturday with a clutch performance to continue what has been a miracle run.

The Australian, who delivered at the death in superb fashion when partnering Dutchman David Pel to a nailbiting 6-7 (2) 7-6 (5) 7-6 (9) triumph over the top-seeded combination Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic on Thursday, is now on the brink of a unique double.

Two years after clinching Australian Open as a wildcard entrant alongside compatriot Jason Kubler, the Sydneysider and his partner Pel only secured a slot in the Wimbledon draw as an alternate entry, their spot opening after other combinations withdrew.

His share of the prize if successful would be A$700,000. Even a loss will earn the world No. 87 a healthy A$356,ooo. The Aussie has already pocketed A$205,000 after reaching the second round in singles, where he was beaten by American star Ben Shelton.

Once again, Hijikata is within range of pulling off another grand slam surprise, this time courtesy of the excellence with which he held his nerve in what was a compelling doubles semi-final on Court 1 at the All England Lawn Tennis Club.

Hijikata, who had “barely spoken” to Pel before the pair entered the doubles at Wimbledon in the hope they might secure a start, finished with a flourish in the deciding super tiebreaker in what proved a matchwinning performance.

After conceding a 4-o advantage in the tiebreaker, the Aussie-Dutch combination faced two break points at 7-9. 

But Hijikata was able to whip a backhand crosscourt that drew an error to save the first in a beautiful demonstration of quick hands and touch. On the second, he made a crisp backhand return and then rocketed a forehand to draw an error at the net from their rival.

On their first match point, his partner failed to put away a short volley, but Hijikata was able to chase down the response and respond by whipping a forehand crosscourt into the corner to secure a dream slot on the championship weekend at Wimbledon.











The pair, who serve as a tennis version of The Long and The Short of it given their disparity in height, only learned they had a slot the day prior to playing but have combined under pressure as though they have paired with each other for years.

The semi-final triumph was the third time they had saved match points in a match to progress.

They survived a super tiebreaker in their opening round encounter against 14th seeds Andre Goransson and Sem Verbeek. It was a similar case in the second round, with the pair again edging their way through in a super tiebreaker against Robert Cash and JJ Tracy.

Their third round on paper was a test against third seeds Tim Puetz and Kevin Krawietz, but that proved a straight sets breeze, and they were able to win their quarterfinal in straight sets as well against Rafael Matos and Marcelo Melo.

The key, Hijikata said earlier in the week, was that they were treating every outing as a bonus given they were fortunate to earn a start.

“Honestly, I feel like we're just enjoying ourselves out there,” Hijikata told Stan Sports.

“We're not putting too much pressure on ourselves. I feel like we've got no expectations and we're just going out there trying to swing away and whatever happens happens. 

“We're just trying to enjoy every moment as much as we can, and just back ourselves to play some big tennis. It's worked so far, and hopefully we can keep going.”

A finalist in the girls' singles last year, Australia's world No.1 ranked junior Emerson Jones's hopes of clinching the title this year where dashed when she was beaten 6-2 6-2 in a quarterfinal on Court 18 by Mia Pohankova on Thursday.

Novak Djokovic cancelled his practice session on Thursday afternoon at Wimbledon.

The seven-time champion was scheduled to hit from 1-3 p.m. BST on site at Aorangi Park, but the All England Club confirmed that the session had been cancelled. Djokovic, who is set to face World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals on Friday, suffered a fall during the final game of his quarter-final win against Flavio Cobolli on Wednesday.

“It was a nasty fall. It was very awkward,” Djokovic said on Wednesday evening. “Obviously, my body is not the same today like it was before, so I guess the real impact or effect of what happened I will feel tomorrow. I'm hoping the next 24, 48 hours that the severity of what was happening on the court and what happened is not too bad, that I'll be able to play at my best and free of pain in two days.”

The New Jersey native notched her best Grand Slam finish to date.

American tennis star Amanda Anisimova has advanced to The Wimbledon Championships final after defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

The 23-year-old New Jersey native won 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 37 minutes on Centre Court Thursday to reach the first Grand Slam final of her career.

"It's so incredibly special," the No. 13 seed said, adding "this doesn't feel real right now."

Now, she is the youngest American woman to advance to the Wimbledon finals since Serena Williams in 2004. Williams was also the last American woman to play in The Championships final in 2019.

"I know she's No. 1, but a lot of people were out cheering for me, so I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone," Anisimova said moments after the hard-fought three-set match, referring to her opponent.

"It's been a year turnaround since coming back, so to be in this spot, it's not easy," she continued. "It's been such a privilege to compete here, and to be in the final is just indescribable, honestly."

Tennis expert and New York Times sports writer Christopher Clarey pointed out an impressive stat, that Anisimova has won 28 consecutive matches when she has won the opening set.

On Thursday, that became 29 after the American singles star won the first set against Sabalenka in the Wimbledon semifinals.

Anisimova will go on to face Belinda Bencic or Iga Swiatek in the women's final on Saturday.

This matched Anisimova's best-ever Grand Slam singles result, having previously made it to the 2019 French Open semifinals at Roland-Garros.

As a result, next week, Anisimova will jump into the Top 10 of the PIF WTA Rankings for the first time in her career.

The 23-year-old took a break from tennis from May 2023 to January 2024 to focus on her mental health.

Since her return, Anisimova has reached the Canadian Open finals in August 2024, won the ATP Qatar Open in Doha in February, reached the French Open round of 16 and was a Queen's Club finalist in June.

Djokovic is due to play Jannik Sinner on Friday, after Iga Swiatek and Amanda Anisimova won their semi-finals

Day 11 at Wimbledon 2025 saw the semi-finals take place in the women's draw, with Iga Swiatek booking her place in the final after a shock defeat for Aryna Sabalenka.

An outstanding Amanda Anisimova surged into her first grand-slam final as she knocked out the world No 1 on Centre Court, the American continuing a dream fortnight on the SW19 grass on the back of a runner-up finish at Queen's. Sabalenka had looked short of her supreme best at times during the tournament, and she was visibly frustrated against Anisimova, in a match disrupted by two fainting fans in the crowd.

Meanwhile, Swiatek was in imperious form against Belinda Bencic, thrashing the Swiss to reach the final of Wimbledon for the first time. The five-time major winner needed just one hour and 12 minutes to beat Bencic, winning the second set 6-0 as the clay specialist showed off further improvements on grass.

Men's semi-final action will follow on Friday, but Novak Djokovic is an injury doubt for his clash with Jannik Sinner after cancelling a practice on Thursday, while Carlos Alcaraz aims for a third straight Wimbledon final – and title – as he plays Taylor Fritz.

Follow all the latest tennis updates, scores and results from Wimbledon below.

Doubt surrounded the fitness of Novak Djokovic ahead of Friday's blockbuster Wimbledon semi-final against Jannik Sinner.

The 38-year-old suffered an awkward fall very late on in his quarter-final victory over Flavio Cobolli on Wednesday.

He picked himself up to finish off the four-set victory but admitted afterwards he would likely not know the full effect until Thursday, and the signs did not appear positive when Djokovic first delayed and then cancelled his scheduled practice session at the All England Club.

More below: 

Swiatek: “I don't think I played Amanda on WTA, we played in juniors, and I mean, she can play amazing tennis and she loves fast surfaces ‘cause she has a flat game – and fast.

“So, you'll have to be ready for fast shots, for her being proactive, but I'm just gonna kind of focus on myself, and I'll prepare tactically tomorrow.

“We never played a match [on the WTA tour]... but I don't have good memory, so...”

She's right! No meetings between them at a pro level.

Swiatek: “Same as every time, I like to keep my routines, so there's some AC/DC, Guns ‘N' Roses, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones.

“Yeah, I mean, before the match [I like rock music]. Everybody's asking me if I listen to that all the time, they keep buying me vinyl records and everything.

“And I'm like, ‘Guys, if I would listen to that all the time, I wouldn't be able to sleep,' so it's just pre-match, just to pump myself up.

“But off the court, when I don't compete, I'm more of a pop, jazzy, something, I don't know...”

Swiatek: “Honestly, I never even dreamt that it's gonna be possible for me to play in the final.

“So, I'm just super excited and just proud of myself, and I don't know... Tennis keeps surprising me.

“I thought I lived through everything, even though I'm young. I thought I'd experience everything on the court, but I didn't experience playing well on grass, so that's the first time, so I'm just enjoying it.

“Every opponent is different, so every match I also need to adjust my game, but for sure I feel like I improved my movement, and I'm serving really well. 

“And I feel really confident, so I'm just going for it – and for sure it's working, so I'll keep doing that.”

Bencic gets ahead at 15-0, but Swiatek turns the game around for 15-30.

The former world No 1 then drags a forehand into the net, 30-30.

But she brings up match point on the next go...

Saved! Credit to Bencic, who bravely takes on a forehand. Somehow, Swiatek gets it back, and the next shot, but Bencic eventually slams home a smash. Deuce.

A slight slip from Bencic, and she nets a backhand. Another match point for Swiatek...

TAKEN! A winner, past a stranded Bencic, and Swiatek reaches her first Wimbledon final! 

She bagels Bencic in the second set, wow.

Swiatek 6-2, 6-0 Bencic

Bencic fights, taking Swiatek to deuce, but the Pole eventually holds. She's one game away from the final.

Swiatek 6-2, 5-0 Bencic*

Swiatek races up to the net, then pings a forehand just inside the baseline. Bencic's return effort is valiant, but the ball floats narrowly long. 0-15.

Bencic with a better serve this time, and Swiatek's return is nowhere. 15-15. Same again! 30-15. 

The pair exchange backhands on the next point, before Swiatek puts a forehand near Bencic in the corner. Although it's close to her, it slightly wrongfoots her, and Bencic bows her head as she's beaten. 30-30.

Swiatek's next return fails to beat the net, though. 40-30.

Swiatek saves one game point by pushing Bencic into the corner, where the Swiss stretches and can't get much on her backhand. Deuce.

Double fault, and Swiatek has a break point on advantage... Saved! Swiatek's forehand in the corner is just wide. 

But more poor serving gives Swiatek a break point again, which she takes with a powerful forehand in the corner. Again, Bencic just can't get anything on it.

*Swiatek 6-2, 4-0 Bencic

For the second set in a row, Swiatek rushes to 3-0.

It would take a tennis miracle for Bencic to pull this one back.

But stranger things have happened, it's why we love this sport.

Swiatek 6-2, 3-0 Bencic*

Poor Bencic, she can't buy a hold right now.

She falls behind, 0-30. 

Big forehand into the ad court, however, and she forces Swiatek into a lob that lands long.

Swiatek with her own big forehand, though, a piston shot into the corner for a winner. 15-40.

Two break points... but Swiatek frames a forehand return! 30-40.

But the second break point is converted! Swiatek is racing into the final at this rate.

*Swiatek 6-2, 2-0 Bencic

A big moment for Bencic!

Can she put the first set behind her? Maybe, judging by her ability to bring up two break points here...

But with a pair of big serves, Swiatek is able to erase them both!

She then brings up advantage, where she apologises twice for failing to complete her serve. She was stopping mid-ball toss, perhaps looking right into the sun?

Once she does get going, she strikes a crouching forehand long. Deuce. But Bencic nets a backhand. Advantage Swiatek again.

A fist pump from Swiatek now, as she flings an inside-out forehand into the corner for a winner – and the hold.

Swiatek 6-2, 1-0 Bencic*

When the draw was made, Jannik Sinner knew that his bid for a first Wimbledon title might hinge on a blockbuster semi-final with seven-time champion Novak Djokovic.

Fast forward two weeks, and the stars will meet in the last four at a Grand Slam tournament for the second time in as many months when they take to Centre Court. Their clash is the second match from 1.30 p.m. BST/8.30 a.m. EDT. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner defeated Djokovic in straight sets in the Roland Garros semi-finals last month, but the 38-year-old Serbian will be hungry for some quick revenge as he eyes a record-tying eighth Wimbledon title.



After suffering a scary fall in the opening game of his fourth-round match with Grigor Dimitrov, Sinner brushed aside any lingering injury concerns with a clinical quarter-final victory over Ben Shelton. The Italian had limited preparation — only 20 minutes with no serves — but showed few signs of discomfort during his authoritative win over Shelton.

“Yesterday I played 20 minutes without serving and not hitting 100 per cent,” Sinner said after his two-hour, 19-minute victory. “But in the other way, I always try to put myself in the position to at least go out there and try. I had quite good feelings in the warm-up today, so I put into my mind that I'm going to play today. The concerns were not that big if I would play or not. It was just a matter of what my percentage [was].”

Sinner has swept the past three hard-court majors, winning twice at the Australian Open and claiming his maiden US Open trophy last year, but he is yet to taste success at the All England Club. He stands across the net from Djokovic, a seven-time Wimbledon champion who owns a standout 102-12 record at the event, having reached the championship match in the past six editions.

While Sinner has defeated Djokovic in their past four meetings and now holds a 5-4 edge in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, the Serbian has won each of their two battles at Wimbledon, in their 2022 quarter-final and 2023 semi-final.



Interestingly, Djokovic altered his usual playbook in their Roland Garros showdown. Rather than relying on his trademark baseline consistency, he surprised Sinner with a barrage of drop shots and greater variety. This was potentially a sign of uncertainty about whether his standard game could prevail.

That tactical wrinkle also offered a glimpse into Djokovic's willingness to deviate from his norm and attempt to disrupt Sinner's rhythm. Yet as he continues to defy the aging curve with his achievements, Djokovic relishes the opportunity to compete among the game's elite.

“That motivates me to see how much I can still keep going with these guys toe to toe,” Djokovic said. “I lost in straight sets to Jannik in the semis of Roland Garros. I think I played a solid match. I could have played better, but he was just a better player when the moments were important. So I get another opportunity. Him next to [Carlos] Alcaraz are the leaders of tennis today, men's tennis. I couldn't ask for a bigger challenge for myself. I look forward to it.”

Whether or not Djokovic is fully fit — he suffered a nasty fall in his quarter-final win against Flavio Cobolli and cancelled his on-site practice on Thursday — the sixth seed will likely mix things up. During his campaign at SW19, Djokovic has enjoyed significant success at the net, winning 67 per cent of points when at the forecourt against Alex de Minaur in the fourth round (35/52) and Cobolli in the quarters (24/36).

That determination to take control of proceedings and rush Sinner at the baseline may prove pivotal in their 10th meeting. But the 23-year-old Italian has shown he can handle the pressure and respond with guile of his own, reading Djokovic's drop shots effectively and engaging in cat-and-mouse exchanges with confidence in Paris.

This time, something will have to give. For Sinner, it's a chance to advance to his first Wimbledon final and make pace in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, in which he is currently 2,240 points adrift of first-placed Carlos Alcaraz, who plays Taylor Fritz in the second semi-final. Djokovic is chasing a 103rd win at Wimbledon to move within one victory of tying Roger Federer's all-time record of eight crowns at the All England Club.

The New Jersey native notched her best Grand Slam finish to date.

Amanda Anisimova has advanced to The Wimbledon Championships final after defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

The 23-year-old New Jersey native won 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in 2 hours and 37 minutes on Centre Court Thursday.

Tennis expert and New York Times sports writer Christopher Clarey pointed out an impressive stat, that Anisimova has won 28 consecutive matches when she has won the opening set.

On Thursday, that became 29 after the American singles star won the first set against Sabalenka in the Wimbledon semifinals.

This matched Anisimova's best-ever Grand Slam singles result, having previously made it to the 2019 French Open semifinals at Roland-Garros.

As a result, next week, Anisimova will jump into the Top 10 of the PIF WTA Rankings for the first time in her career.

After losing the second set, Anisimosa had her serve broken at love to begin the third set by Sabalenka and momentum seemed to be slipping away. But the American persevered and rallied to win the next three games and go 3-1. 

Sabalenka fell down 5-2 in the third set, but won the next two games to bring it back to 5-4, but Anisimova held on to secure the win. 

The only other time Anisimova had played in a Grand Slam semifinal prior to her win over Sabalenka was at the 2019 French Open, when she lost as a 17-year-old.

The loss for Sabalenka was the third loss she has sustained in the Wimbledon semifinal in her career, with the other two coming in 2021 and 2023. 

Sabalenka had been outstanding at rallying back after dropping the first set in major tournaments as the world No. 1 ranked player was 11-2 in major tournaments when losing the first set going into this match.  

Prior to this match, Sabalenka had only lost one set in the entire tournament.

Mirra Andreeva's impressive run at Wimbledon came to an end in the quarterfinals, losing out to her more experienced opponent.

The Russian star had looked dominant during her opening four matches, defeating Mayar Sherif, Lucia Bronzetti, Hailey Baptiste, and Emma Navarro in straight sets.

Qualifying for her first Wimbledon quarterfinal, Andreeva took on Switzerland's Belinda Bencic, a former Olympic gold medallist.

Falling short in two tiebreakers, 6-7 [3-7], 6-7 [2-7], Andreeva was beaten by Bencic, failing in her bid to reach the last four.

Reacting to the 18-year-old's Wimbledon exit, a former champion suggested her team need to ask her some serious questions.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live after the match, 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash gave his verdict on Andreeva's quarterfinal defeat.

“[Mirra] Andreeva, she's still young, got plenty of years left ahead of her, but that's a great learning lesson there on how to play on grass courts, how to deal with pressure,” he said.

“The team and the stats team have got to sit down with her, and go, what were you doing? What were the tactics there? Why didn't you follow the instructions?

“I'm assuming she got the instructions, a good lesson to be learned.

“You can't give the best players in the world their favorite shots time and time again, you're going to walk off the court a loser.”

Andreeva targeted Bencic's backhand throughout, and the Swiss star was happy to engage in those exchanges, coming out on top most of the time.

It's hard to imagine that coach Conchita Martinez would have instructed Andreeva to play into Bencic's hands as much as she did.

Perhaps Martinez and the rest of the team will now address the tactical errors made, as they look ahead to the North American hard-court season.

Andreeva has been considered a future Grand Slam winner for quite some time now, but can she get the job done in 2025?

At just 18 years of age, there's no rush, but the youngster will no doubt be targeting major glory at Flushing Meadows in a few months' time.

The US Open is, however, Andreeva's least successful Grand Slam, as the Russian has only won two career matches at the event.

Competing in New York twice previously, Andreeva won two of her four matches, losing her second-round match on both occasions.

She may not have enjoyed much success in the past, but it's important to note the improvements Andreeva has made over the past 12 months.

In 2025, Andreeva has won two ‘big' hard-court titles and is the only player on the WTA Tour to have done so.

Winning the Dubai Tennis Championships and Indian Wells, Andreeva established herself as one of the best hard-court players in the women's game.

Improving every time she steps on the court, there's truly no limit to what Andreeva can achieve.

The Russian is currently scheduled to return to action at the Canadian Open, where she will look to pick up her third WTA 1000 title of the year.

A trip to Cincinnati will follow before Andreeva makes her third US Open appearance when the tournament begins on Sunday, August 24.

Hugh Grant saw an opportunity for a snooze and he took it.

While attending the 2025 Wimbledon Championships on Wednesday, the British actor - who was accompanied by his wife, Anna Eberstein - seemingly took a nap during the men's singles quarter-final match between Novak Djokovic and Flavio Cobolli, according to multiple videos and photos shared on X.

The moment quickly went viral as Grant - who was donning a stylish pair of shades and wearing a dark blue suit - was seated directly behind Queen Camilla.

The stars are known to show up for the prestigious tennis event every year.

Olivia Rodrigo, John Cena, Dave Grohl, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have been spotted sitting in the Royal Box at this year's event.

"It's so special in the Royal Box to have those kind of people in there. It definitely adds a bit of pressure, I guess, if you look up and you kind of recognize (them)," 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu of Britain said, via the Associated Press. "That's why I try and stay with my eyes on the court as much as possible. Only after, you kind of look up and take it all in, if they're still there."

The seats in the Royal Box behind one of the baselines are by invitation only.

A look at the winners and losers from this year's Roland-Garros, where Carlos Alcaraz was once again crowned the King of Paris

From May 25 to June 8, the 124th French Open, the second Grand Slam tournament this year, was held on the courts of the Roland Garros sports complex. The MelBet official website, the best platform for tennis betting, sums up the results of the most prestigious clay competition. 

The tournament's first landmark achievement was set long before the qualifying round began. This season, the total prize pool of the French major reached a record €56.352 million, 5.21% more than in 2024.

From a sporting perspective, the French Open 2025 will be remembered for the qualification of the first and second-ranked players in the men's and women's finals. Nothing like this has happened at Grand Slam tournaments since the US Open 2013, and on the Parisian courts, since 1984. 

Men's singles final 

The struggle between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz is already being called a new tennis classic. The next 8-10 years will probably be dominated by the 23-year-old Italian and the 22-year-old Spaniard. 

The head-to-head clashes between Jannik and Carlos are a topic for a separate review. Before the decisive match in Paris, the H2H statistics stood at 8-5 in favor of Alcaraz. On May 18, these tennis players faced off in the Rome Masters final, where Sinner lost to his main competitor (6-7 and 1-6). Three weeks later, the ATP ranking leader desperately wanted to avenge the unfortunate defeat. 

The MelBet official website analysts estimated the opponents' chances to be almost equal. In the pre-match, Sinner's potential success was quoted at 1.94, while a possible victory for Alcaraz was given the odds of 1.89.

Despite a three-month absence from game practice due to disqualification, Jannik won the first two sets in a tough fight (6-4, 7-6) and had already imagined raising the prestigious trophy above his head. However, men's singles in Grand Slam tournaments are played to three victories, while the spectators on the Philippe Chatrier court and fans in front of their screens wanted to enjoy a tense five-set match. 

In the third set, Alcaraz managed to turn the tide of the clash (6-4), and the saving lifeline no longer seemed so thin. In the fourth set, the Spanish tennis player won the tie-break (7-3), not only tying the overall score but also gaining a psychological advantage before the decisive set. During the third tie-break, upset Sinner was losing with a score of 0-7 and ultimately won only two rallies. Alcaraz defended his Roland-Garros title with a fantastic comeback victory but remained the world's No. 2.  

Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff reached the Roland-Garros final for the first time in their careers. Despite being tied (5-5) in their head-to-head matchups, the Belarusian was considered the clear favorite for the decisive clash, with odds of 1.42. In the first set, Sabalenka narrowly defeated her opponent in the tie-break (7-5). In the following two sets, the American proved that pre-match odds mean nothing in sports. Aryna once again lacked psychological stability, which was reflected in the number of unforced errors — 70 compared to her competitor's 30.  

The 21-year-old American secured a comeback victory with a total score of 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 and earned €2,550M in prize money. The defeat did not affect Sabalenka's top position in the WTA rankings, and her lead over second-place Gauff is still impressive – almost 3,500 points.

Marcel Granollers and Horacio Ceballos specialize in doubles. These tennis players have collectively lost seven Grand Slam finals. On June 7, quantity finally turned into quality – the Spaniard and Argentinean won a major for the first time in their careers, predictably beating the British duo Joe Salisbury / Neal Skupski in the final (6-0, 6-7, 7-5). 

Last year, Jasmine Paolini reached the Roland-Garros and Wimbledon finals but did not become a champion. This season, the 29-year-old Italian decided to win the Grand Slam alongside her 38-year-old compatriot Sara Errani and achieved her goal. Jasmine and Sara defeated the pair Anna Danilina (Kazakhstan) / Aleksandra Krunic (Serbia) in three sets (6-4, 2-6, 6-1). It is worth noting that the highly experienced Errani took home two trophies from Paris, winning the mixed doubles with Andrea Vavassori. 

The relative sensation at Roland-Garros can be considered the elimination of the Queen of Clay, Iga Świątek, in the semifinals. The Polish tennis player has not performed at her best and currently ranks only seventh in the ATP standings. The appearances of the world's No. 1 and No. 2 in the most prestigious finals suggest one thing: the French Open 2025 did not reveal any new stars. 

Novak Djokovic graced the tournament with his presence but lost to Sinner in the semifinals. The Serb's time is over, and his dream of winning the 25th Grand Slam remains unfulfilled. Alexander Zverev crashed out in the quarterfinal stage, and last year's lost final remains the German's highest achievement at a clay major. 

In June, the Grand Slam tournament series crossed the equator. Next on the schedule are Wimbledon and the US Open. The MelBet official website will provide a wide line and favorable odds for matches featuring the world's best tennis players, as well as a promo with top prizes.

LONDON – Wishing that one of the sweetest moments of your career had never happened. Chile's Cristian Garin sometimes thinks it would've been better never to win the Roland Garros junior title.

“Looking back, it all felt like madness. The pressure that was put on me for free… it was too much,” said the former world No. 17 in an interview with CLAY and RG Media in London.

During Wimbledon 2025, the five-time ATP titles opened up about the expectations placed on him in his home country.

“I wish I could've played a bit more calmly, without so much tension,” he confessed.

In 2013, Chilean tennis had already spent a few years out of the spotlight after the retirements of Fernando González and Nicolás Massú. So Garín's win over Alexander Zverev in the boys' final in Paris triggered huge — and unrealistic — hopes: “It was almost a problem playing juniors, because that's where a lot of people got to know me.”

Garin, 29, reflected on the sacrifice of spending so much time away from his family and friends: “Sometimes you wonder, ‘Is it really worth the effort to be away your whole life?'”

Interview with Cristian Garin

– You made a change, and it showed. Once you started embracing the Challenger circuit, you began winning matches. You seem to be enjoying it now.

– Yes, it was hard, especially at first. I went from playing top-level tournaments for five or six years to having to drop down to the Challengers — and some of those aren't the best events to compete in. The conditions were tough. People think Challengers are easy to win. They expect you to win everything. I went into a negative spiral, I wasn't motivated, I didn't feel right on court. I fell into a bad place mentally because I was confused.

– The second tier of the tour is becoming more and more competitive and demanding.

– Exactly. Challengers are super competitive, everyone plays at a high level, so you have to go in ultra humble. You're going to fight every opponent, you might run for three hours just to earn 10 or 15 points. That made it hard for me, because getting back to where I wanted to be — where I still want to be — felt so far away. I changed my mindset, started focusing on other things, and I started playing better very quickly.

– What kind of things did you start focusing on?

– On myself. On my body. I was in pain after every match. Physically I didn't feel fast or explosive. The years go by and you have to improve in every area, because you start to recover a bit more slowly. Reinvention is the only option. I've been a professional for 12 or 13 years now. At this stage, I started taking better care of myself and doing things that directly help me perform better. Sometimes you fall into a negative loop and think there's no way out.

– What helps you perform better?

– Doing other sports, going for a jog or a walk. Clearing my mind. I also hired Guillermo, my new fitness trainer. He's helped me a lot in shaking off bad thoughts through physical work. And I'm still with Cristián Madariaga, who's been with me my entire career. The people around me are helping me stay focused on what I have to do.

– What do you think you need to get back to the top 20? Is that the place you're aiming for?

– I feel like I need to keep doing what I'm doing and stick to it for a full year. To be honest, I'm not thinking about returning to the top 20 yet. Of course I want it — I'm desperate to get there — but I haven't set it as a goal because I've only been working properly for two months. I'm just being real. I can't expect to be top 20 after only two months of good work. It has to be step by step. I'm close to the top 100, I want to be playing ATP events again — I'm dying to get back to ATP tournaments and main draws of Slams. I know I can compete well there.

– Do you see the opportunity?

– Every week I see the chance to get into the tournaments I want to play. Everything is very competitive, but also wide open. Today there are 200 players who could potentially break into the top 20 or 30. It's that tough. You have to be mentally sharp every week, take care of your body, and be ready. Tennis is open right now. That gives me hope. But I'm also aware that I'm world No. 110 right now, and that's the reality I have to live with. It's a lot better than it was two months ago, and I'm grateful for that — but I want to keep working like this and see where I am a year from now.

– Did you watch the 2025 Roland Garros final?

– Yes, I did.

– And what did you feel watching that level of tennis?

– It had been a long time since I got nervous watching other people play tennis, and honestly I was blown away by the level. I loved seeing how the match made headlines around the world — not just among tennis fans. The buzz around that final was incredible, and the level those two guys reached was insane.

– Do you want to play against Alcaraz and Sinner?

– Of course. But I know this is a new beginning for me. I need to be consistent for at least a year and then see what happens. I know them — Alcaraz and Sinner have been working incredibly for four or five years. Their discipline is out of this world. Even at such a young age, they inspire my whole generation. Just look at how they work, how they make decisions, how they build their teams. I pay attention to that and take a lot from both of them. They're true sporting role models in every sense.

– A few weeks ago, you spoke on a podcast about the pressure you felt in the months and years following your junior title at Roland Garros. You were champion competing against players like Alexander Zverev, Nick Kyrgios and Borna Coric. It's been 12 years since that title. How do you look back on that stage now?

– I look back and feel like it was all madness. All that tension, all the unnecessary pressure I was put under… it was a lot. I think it was a stage that taught me a lot over time, but back then I wish I could have played a bit more calmly, with less tension. You're there without financial support, paying for everything yourself, my parents helping me out. They didn't have any experience in the sports world, so it was like adding another problem to the situation. It was tough, I learned a lot, but I don't feel like I made the most of that situation.

– People were paying close attention to you from a very young age.

– I've always been grateful for the support I've received. I love playing here in the Wimbledon qualies and having 50 people cheering for me. No matter the tournament, even the Challengers, there's always someone supporting me. It has its positives. But back then, it was strange to feel the negativity, the harsh criticism, especially for a 17-year-old.

– Did you ever say to yourself, “I wish I had never won Roland Garros”?

– Yes, I did think that a few times.

– Tell me more.

– It's something I thought about. I told myself that maybe playing juniors had actually been a problem, because that's where a lot of people got to know me. I was already ranked 350 in the world at 17, I was a real prospect, I had the level. I think I finished that year around 250. I had—how do you say it?—I don't know if it was the potential to become a superstar, but definitely to be top 20, to win titles, which is what I eventually did. My family isn't from the sporting world, they never put pressure on me, they supported me in everything. So I didn't really have a guide at the time, and maybe that made things harder. The junior circuit is strange, because it guarantees you nothing. And being South American makes it even tougher.

– When you look back on your career, are there mistakes you wish you hadn't made?

– Yes, millions. I think the difference I see between players like me and those who have been more consistent with a similar level comes down to decision-making. Many of them made better choices than I did or had better people around them from an early age, and that makes a huge difference. I wish I'd had the support of someone I fully trusted, someone with experience in tennis. And in Chile or South America, that's not easy to find. No one sacrifices themselves for you or guides you. But I learned from every mistake. Better to realise it now at 29 than at 40.

– What are you thankful to tennis for?

– I'm grateful that it taught me to reinvent myself in very difficult moments. Obviously, there have been things in my career that I've never talked about—and I don't feel like talking about them now. Maybe one day. But tennis has always taught me that it's possible to move forward, that the effort is worth it, and that bad times don't last forever. That's something I've really learned.

– Do you feel tennis owes you something?

– I don't know. I hope it does.

– Where do you see yourself in 20 years?

– Honestly, right now I have no idea. I'm just trying to live day by day and let things happen as they will.

– What's your relationship status? Are you single?

– Yes, I'm single.

– And are you enjoying single life?

– I've gone through some tough personal times recently in parallel with tennis. So I've been very focused on bouncing back and figuring out how to get back up. I've put a lot of time into that. And if you're with someone, things have to be flowing. There have to be good things happening. In this sport, you never know how long you'll be playing, so you have to stay focused. And I think if you're in a relationship, you need to give and receive things that help you grow. That's normal. Everyone's different, and you just have to learn how to manage it—like everything in life.

– Carlos Alcaraz made headlines by talking about how important going out and partying can be. How do you feel about that? Do you need a good party every now and then to clear your head?

– Yeah, I like going out. Not all the time. I used to go out more when I was 23 or 24. I really miss my friends, so whenever I can, I try to organise a get-together. I really enjoy being with them. As athletes, we miss birthdays and so many events. And sometimes you ask yourself: is it really worth being away all the time? It's been years on the road, travelling. So, when I get the chance to go out, I do. It helps. Obviously with some control, always remembering I'm a tennis player. But I think it's fine if there's balance—you have to know when to do it, and it helps to unwind. Some people don't like it, they don't even drink alcohol, and of course I respect that. But for me, going out, being with friends, disconnecting a bit—it helps take off some of that constant pressure. That's how I do it, and I enjoy it.

Lindsay Davenport has emerged to laud Iga Swiatek for the tweak she's made at Wimbledon this year.

After all, returning to the All-England Club, everyone knew something had to change.

Despite being a junior champion at this event, the grass had inexplicably not been working for her, routinely failing to translate her form from a French Open title, usually, to this new surface.

And yet, the one year where she exited early in Paris is the one where she has recorded her best-ever run at Wimbledon, now handed a fine opportunity to reach the final too.

In Davenport's eyes, the bulk of this success can be attributed to one key alteration.

Speaking on Tennis Channel Live, the panel was asked to explain Iga Swiatek's sudden surge towards the latter stages of Wimbledon.

Davenport led the praise, offering one potential reason for this upturn in form.

She admitted: “It's interesting, because I actually thought she was going to go into Wimbledon really down, based on not winning Roland Garros again. Maybe those couple of extra days help settle her down, maybe the post-winning a major, where there is a lot of media that goes into play and a couple more days. 

“I'm not really sure because, down to number eight, started to play better grass-court tennis in Bad Homberg, got all the way to the final, lost to Pegula, but at least came into this tournament with those wins under her belt. 

“She's liked her draw here, but honestly, she's been more aggressive this year than we've ever seen her be at Wimbledon. Something has clicked and maybe that was her coach Wim kind of encouraging her, Hey, if you're gonna go down, you gotta go down swinging and trying to take balls early. You can't keep playing the same way on the surface and expect things to change.”

Swiatek captured a new record in reaching the semi-finals, and could extend that with another win to reach the final.

Realistically, a player of Swiatek's calibre should always have the capabilities to perform on any surface.

Her relentless running and bruising hitting would trouble most on grass, hard or clay courts, and yet the former has always been the one that got away.

If anything, this year's Wimbledon run only reinforces the suggestion that the only thing holding her back was her own mindset.

Speaking after one win, she admitted: “Honestly, it is much more fun [on the grass] this year.

”The ball is listening to me. When it listens to me, I don't need to do much. It is pretty smooth.”

It really feels like since then, Swiatek actually believes in herself not just to perform on this surface, but to genuinely challenge for the Wimbledon title.

Go ahead, Nole fan. Pick up that trading card packed safely in its slim and durable transparent case. Note that it is from 2007, the year of your idol's breakthrough, and that it depicts Djokovic lunging for a backhand—what would soon be celebrated as his trademark aggression.Note, too, that the card is autographed by Novak himself. It's certified authentic by PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator). And then there's this: embedded in this card is a swatch of pale blue cloth, part of a shirt that Djokovic wore in combat. Like the religious article the presentation calls to mind, the swatch is called a “relic.”This graded card, eBay tells you, can be yours for a mere $999.99 (or best offer).

From packs of cigarettes to wax packs to packs that cost hundreds of dollars, tennis cards have a fascinating history—and a future ripe for speculation. For more on the “moment” they're experiencing, watch our special feature on tennis cards, shot at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I. (3:25, produced by Chris Enriquez) ⬇️

Welcome to the world of sports cards, a hobby that has evolved from humble origins into a sophisticated, multi-billion dollar global enterprise which has spawned its own ecosystem, complete with hierarchical product lines and its own esoteric language—attributes that are appealing to the collector's mentality, as well as ambrosia for profit hunters.If you're a Boomer, you may fondly remember the thrill of walking down to the corner candy store, allowance money jingling in your pockets, to purchase a wax pack of Topps baseball or football cards, containing stiff cardboard pictures and a bonus panel of deliciously scented pink bubble gum. These days, the only resemblance to that experience is the exquisite curiosity and hope you might feel as you tear open the wrapping (now shiny foil) covering for a pack of cards that came in a “blaster box.”Eric Winston, the president of Winner's Alliance—the Name, Image and Likeness licensor for cards produced by Topps (including tennis cards)—told me, “Topps and Fanatics aren't just doing the old, ‘Hey, let's put a picture on a piece of cardboard' and give them a little bio and stats on the back. They're really selling a story. They're selling a piece of history. Some of the cards we used to collect as kids are becoming pieces of art.”

There you can learn the meaning of words and terms like “Liquid Silver,” “Refractor,” “breaking,” “low numbers/low series,” “patch cards” and “slabbing.” They are becoming more vital, for better or worse, to today's trading card experience.The trading card industry came to tennis late, and in its mature phase. Although tennis cards have been offered by some operators for years (mainly NetPro and Ace Authentic), it wasn't until 2021, when Fanatics/Topps jumped into the fray, that the number of players who signed up to be part of the program—now roughly 300—achieved critical mass to claim equal footing with sports that have a rich history in cards.“This is kind of the first time it's been done, like, ‘the right way,'” says Ryan Olli, the senior manager of licensing at Winner's Alliance. “We were like, ‘Okay, we're going to get a list of players that is 200, 300, whatever amount of players they want access to.'”

This is as good a time as any to pause and let the uninitiated know that the trading card industry is so terminology-driven that major players like Topps (owned by Fanatics, the sports business giant) publish tutorials and a glossary, in this case at the Topps Ripped website.

Topps, best known for producing baseball cards, recently entered the tennis card market. Its high-end products include ultra-limited rookie, autographed and memorabilia cards, and have excited the market worldwide.

According to one industry official, the Covid pandemic “supercharged” the trading-card business. Former collectors dusted off and re-engaged with their wares during the long lockdown, while sports fans looking for a new hobby helped breathe new life into the sector—and not just in its traditional American base. Global interest in trading cards has taken off, boosted by the expansion of the hobby into sports that are even more popular abroad than, including Formula 1, soccer and tennis. In Europe, Italy has the most active trading card market, while Asian nations are catching up.For the players, the tennis card business is a windfall. They reap 70 percent of the profit in royalties, but it's distributed equally among all players who signed up to participate in the program, regardless of status, or even how many cards bear their likeness. The pull for the stars who might consider a standard royalty chump change is the additional money they earn for autographing cards, donating memorabilia and even making appearances. The process is surprisingly simple: Winner's Alliance teams go out to tournaments to secure autographs from players and/or to offer them related income opportunities.This is now a multi-billion dollar industry. So in addition to those 9 through 13-year-olds that love to collect, you have some adults who really seek higher-end cards. . .and they like to trade those at a higher price point. Eric WinstonThe learning curve in the trading card game is flat, with a lot of terminology and seemingly arbitrary distinctions to wade through. But the basic premises that ruled back in the bubble-gum days still dominate. Different products are produced in different print runs, some mass-produced and some extremely limited. The most highly-prized cards are called “chase” cards. That includes “rookie” cards—a player's cards produced during or near his or her first season—as well as cards featuring established players. There are numerous variations, or “parallels,” in the look and composition of those cards, in addition to features like autographs or relics (match-worn garments, or pieces of racquets or other gear).The industry has expanded its palette of sports and athletes. There have also been seismic changes in how the cards are produced (using cutting-edge materials and prism or holograph-like effects), distributed (on-line or in hobby shops in various packaging configurations), and traded (on-line, although a friend's basement rec room or garage still works).

Djokovic is due to play Jannik Sinner on Friday, after Iga Swiatek and Amanda Anisimova won their semi-finals

Day 11 at Wimbledon 2025 saw the semi-finals take place in the women's draw, with Iga Swiatek booking her place in the final after a shock defeat for Aryna Sabalenka.

An outstanding Amanda Anisimova surged into her first grand-slam final as she knocked out the world No 1 on Centre Court, the American continuing a dream fortnight on the SW19 grass on the back of a runner-up finish at Queen's. Sabalenka had looked short of her supreme best at times during the tournament, and she was visibly frustrated against Anisimova, in a match disrupted by two fainting fans in the crowd.

Meanwhile, Swiatek was in imperious form against Belinda Bencic, thrashing the Swiss to reach the final of Wimbledon for the first time. The five-time major winner needed just one hour and 12 minutes to beat Bencic, winning the second set 6-0 as the clay specialist showed off further improvements on grass.

Men's semi-final action will follow on Friday, but Novak Djokovic is an injury doubt for his clash with Jannik Sinner after cancelling a practice on Thursday, while Carlos Alcaraz aims for a third straight Wimbledon final – and title – as he plays Taylor Fritz.

Follow all the latest tennis updates, scores and results from Wimbledon below.

Doubt surrounded the fitness of Novak Djokovic ahead of Friday's blockbuster Wimbledon semi-final against Jannik Sinner.

The 38-year-old suffered an awkward fall very late on in his quarter-final victory over Flavio Cobolli on Wednesday.

He picked himself up to finish off the four-set victory but admitted afterwards he would likely not know the full effect until Thursday, and the signs did not appear positive when Djokovic first delayed and then cancelled his scheduled practice session at the All England Club.

More below: 

If Djokovic is healthy to compete...

Report from Centre Court:

Swiatek: “I don't think I played Amanda on WTA, we played in juniors, and I mean, she can play amazing tennis and she loves fast surfaces ‘cause she has a flat game – and fast.

“So, you'll have to be ready for fast shots, for her being proactive, but I'm just gonna kind of focus on myself, and I'll prepare tactically tomorrow.

“We never played a match [on the WTA tour]... but I don't have good memory, so...”

She's right! No meetings between them at a pro level.

Swiatek: “Same as every time, I like to keep my routines, so there's some AC/DC, Guns ‘N' Roses, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones.

“Yeah, I mean, before the match [I like rock music]. Everybody's asking me if I listen to that all the time, they keep buying me vinyl records and everything.

“And I'm like, ‘Guys, if I would listen to that all the time, I wouldn't be able to sleep,' so it's just pre-match, just to pump myself up.

“But off the court, when I don't compete, I'm more of a pop, jazzy, something, I don't know...”

Swiatek: “Honestly, I never even dreamt that it's gonna be possible for me to play in the final.

“So, I'm just super excited and just proud of myself, and I don't know... Tennis keeps surprising me.

“I thought I lived through everything, even though I'm young. I thought I'd experience everything on the court, but I didn't experience playing well on grass, so that's the first time, so I'm just enjoying it.

“Every opponent is different, so every match I also need to adjust my game, but for sure I feel like I improved my movement, and I'm serving really well. 

“And I feel really confident, so I'm just going for it – and for sure it's working, so I'll keep doing that.”

Bencic gets ahead at 15-0, but Swiatek turns the game around for 15-30.

The former world No 1 then drags a forehand into the net, 30-30.

But she brings up match point on the next go...

Saved! Credit to Bencic, who bravely takes on a forehand. Somehow, Swiatek gets it back, and the next shot, but Bencic eventually slams home a smash. Deuce.

A slight slip from Bencic, and she nets a backhand. Another match point for Swiatek...

TAKEN! A winner, past a stranded Bencic, and Swiatek reaches her first Wimbledon final! 

She bagels Bencic in the second set, wow.

Swiatek 6-2, 6-0 Bencic

How should you be betting these matches?ByZachary CohenPublished Jul 10, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 10, 2025

On Thursday, July 10th, we'll find out who will be meeting in the 2025 Wimbledon final. In the first semifinal, Amanda Anisimova will look to upset Aryna Sabalenka. In the second, it'll be Belinda Bencic hoping to knock off Iga Swiatek. Keep reading for some thoughts on how these matches at the All England Club could play out, and the best bets on the board.Amanda Anisimova vs. Aryna SabalenkaWhile Sabalenka is one of the most dominant players on the WTA Tour, we've seen a notable gap between her performances on grass and elsewhere. While she remains the top grass-court player by Tennis Abstract's Elo rating, her play on the surface is less convincing, as shown in recent matches where she was tested by Emma Raducanu, Elise Mertens and Laura Siegemund. All of them were wins, but none of them were easy for the world No. 1.Anisimova holds a 5-3 career record against Sabalenka, including a straight-set win in Toronto in 2024. Their matches are often tightly contested, and Anisimova's aggressive baseline game allows her to match Sabalenka's power. If Anisimova serves well and limits her unforced errors, she has a real shot at taking a set or more.

Aryna Sabalenka will need to conqure Amanda Anisimova, who leads their head-to-head 5-3, to make her third Grand Slam final of the season 🫳 🏆Can she do it? Read our semifinal preview below.#Wimbledon https://t.co/tQYeOpNku7

Both players are known for their heavy hitting, but Anisimova's backhand stands out as a major weapon, capable of dictating rallies and exploiting openings. But the mental aspect will be crucial here, as both players have shown tendencies to lose focus under pressure. If Anisimova maintains her composure, she could capitalize on Sabalenka's lapses and make this another close contest.Given their history and current form, backing Anisimova to win at least a set seems like a strong play, and an upset isn't out of the question if she does a good job of attacking Sabalenka's second serves. So, if you're feeling bold, sprinkle the +220 moneyline as well.Pick: Anisimova +1.5 Sets (-139)

Swiatek's impressive Wimbledon campaign has been a little surprising considering her history on faster surfaces. Previously, grass was her least successful surface, but she has found a rhythm on the green stuff this season. A strong showing at Bad Homburg gave her some momentum, and dominant wins over Danielle Collins, Clara Tauson and Liudmila Samsonova in her past three matches in SW19 show that she's a different player now on turf.Swiatek's ability to handle big hitters and dictate play from the baseline has been tremendous, and it's a notable improvement from past matches where she was bullied around by some of the WTA's alphas. Her serve has also been a major weapon, as she's leading the field in first-serve points won—an impressive feat over five matches.

By contrast, Bencic, while a smart and versatile player, shouldn't pose too many problems for Swiatek. The Pole holds a 3-1 head-to-head advantage, including a hard-fought win at Wimbledon in 2023, when the Swiss was the more reliable grass-courter. Bencic does have some punch, and she's an aggresive player in her own right. But she's not the same type of "see ball, hit ball" player that Swiatek has been losing to.It's just hard to imagine Bencic getting to Swiatek, as the Pole has more firepower, moves better and has been serving better. Swiatek has also won six sets in this tournament by a score of 6-2 or better. So, even if Bencic does manage to win a set, Swiatek can cover a 3.5-game spread.Pick: Swiatek -3.5 Games (-161)

Christian Horner's time with Red Bull comes to an end

Alex Albon was delighted to score points at the British Grand Prix, but it proved to be a frustrating day for his Williams team mate Carlos Sainz.

There were mixed emotions across the Williams garage after the British Grand Prix, with Alex Albon thrilled to return to the points in P8 following a string of retirements while Carlos Sainz was left “frustrated” by his continued run of “bad luck”.

After lining up in P13 amid mixed conditions, Albon found himself running in third place at one stage of the race due to being one of the last to switch to fresh intermediate tyres when the rain became heavier.

While he then dropped down the order following his stop, the Thai driver displayed good pace on the slick tyres later on and ultimately crossed the line in eighth place, bringing an end to his three-race run of DNFs.

“[It was] a lot of fun, actually,” Albon said of his afternoon at Silverstone. “I think it was looking a little bit doom and gloom at some points of the race – we had some moments where we were looking out of the points.

“And then in a weird way Carlos and I were together on track, which was making it worse because the stop laps were always on one lap and we were always – as Carlos was in front of me for most of the race – we ended up being out of sync and pitting a lap later every time and losing some track position.

“But on that last set on the slick tyres the car came alive and it really got quick. We got Fernando [Alonso] on the last lap which was fun, had a good battle with him and, P8, I think after a few DNFs is… [I'm] very happy.”

Asked if the result had acted as a good boost for the team on home soil prior to the next round on the calendar in Belgium, Albon responded: “Yeah, I think so. I think we needed that, the momentum and the general direction of flow was not with us. It was nice to get a race back on the board and get the motivation back and get the vibes up for the next race.”

It proved to be a tougher day for Albon's Williams team mate Sainz. The Spaniard had started from P9 on the grid and looked to be having a decent race, but contact with the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc saw him slip backwards, meaning that he eventually ended the event in P12.

Sainz explained later on: “I had a good race, I was having a very solid race, staying out of trouble, survival mode, and then when we went onto the slicks I was P8, fighting for P7 I think.

“Charles was the car in Turn 15, and when he lost it he crashed into me and went backwards from there with damage.

“Story of my season, every time we're on to score good points and having a solid weekend, something out of our control happens and [I'm] getting a bit frustrated, tired with this season because every time there's something different when we're about to get good points.”

With a short break until F1 heads to Spa-Francorchamps on the weekend of July 25-27, Sainz is glad to have the chance to pause before hoping for better luck in the second half of the campaign.

“I'm driving well, doing everything I can,” the four-time race winner said. “But when there's so many things happening out of your control, it makes you want to have a bit of a break to see if this run of bad luck and things that keep happening to us stop somehow and we start having a cleaner second half of the season.

“I've never had such a run of so many bad things happening to you consecutively in a run of five, six, seven, eight races like we've been [experiencing]. It starts to be really frustrating.”

A managerial reshuffle is taking place at Red Bull, with Laurent Mekies replacing Christian Horner as CEO of the operation.

Red Bull Racing CEO and Team Principal Christian Horner is to exit the squad with immediate effect, with Racing Bulls team boss Laurent Mekies taking over, it was announced on Wednesday.

Horner has held the role for some 20 years – the Briton leading Red Bull through their first F1 season back in 2005 and playing a key role in turning them from points scorers into World Champions.

“Red Bull has released Christian Horner from his operational duties with effect from today (Wednesday 9 July 2025) and has appointed Laurent Mekies as CEO of Red Bull Racing,” said a Red Bull spokesperson.

“Oliver Mintzlaff, CEO Corporate Projects and Investments thanked Christian Horner for his exceptional work over the last 20 years.”

“We would like to thank Christian Horner for his exceptional work over the last 20 years,” added Mintzlaff.

“With his tireless commitment, experience, expertise and innovative thinking, he has been instrumental in establishing Red Bull Racing as one of the most successful and attractive teams in Formula 1.

“Thank you for everything, Christian, and you will forever remain an important part of our team history.”

As part of the managerial reshuffle, current Racing Bulls Racing Director Alan Permane will be promoted to Team Principal at the sister outfit.

“The last year and a half has been an absolute privilege to lead the team with Peter [Bayer, Racing Bulls CEO],” commented Mekies.

“It has been an amazing adventure to contribute to the birth of Racing Bulls together with all our talented people. The spirit of the whole team is incredible, and I strongly believe that this is just the beginning.

“Alan is the perfect man to take over now and continue our path. He knows the team inside out and has always been an important pillar of our early successes.”

Permane added: “I feel very honoured to take on the role as Team Principal and would like to thank Oliver and Helmut [Marko, Red Bull advisor] for the trust they have shown in me.

“I am looking forward to working with Peter to continue the good work that both him and Laurent have done in taking this team forward.

“This is a new challenge for me, but I know that I can count on the support of everyone within them.”

Ex-Renault F1 driver Jolyon Palmer takes a look at his former team mate's F1 journey, and how he finally sealed the podium finish that has eluded him for 15 years.

It was brilliant to finally see Nico Hulkenberg get that long-awaited podium at Silverstone. I know first-hand how talented he is, having been privy to a year's worth of data on the other side of the garage when we were team mates at Renault in 2017.

For someone as good as Nico to need 239 races to end up on the podium is staggering, but he used all of his speed and nouse to convert the unlikeliest of chances on Sunday.

Hulkenberg was a first-year GP2 champion, winning the feeder category in 2009, which launched him on the path into Formula 1. It seemed inevitable at some point he would end up in a top Formula 1 seat, but somehow that chance has never come.

On Wednesday night, July 9, British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan played their first show in England since their controversial set at Glastonbury where frontman Bobby Vylan led the crowd in a chant of “Death, death to the IDF.” The gig took place at the 100 Club, in the Soho neighborhood of London, and found Bobby Vylan acknowledging the controversy surrounding the band.

“I'm gonna try to keep my talkin' to a minimum today,” Vylan said, according to footage shared by The Standard, “'cause that's what got us in trouble in the first fuckin' place!” Members of the crowd then began chanting, “Death, death to the IDF,” at which point Vylan said, “No, no, no, no, no, you're gonna get me in trouble. You're gonna get me in trouble.”

“Apparently, every other chant is fine,” Bobby Vylan continued, “but you lot will get me in trouble.” He then led a chant of “Free, free Palestine,” and added, “We're gonna stick with the classics, all right?”

The Avon and Somerset Police has been investigating whether Bobby Vylan's comments at Glastonbury, aimed at the Israeli Defense Forces, constitute a criminal offense. As noted by The Guardian and The Independent, the Metropolitan Police is also investigating Vylan for allegedly saying, during a concert at London's Alexandra Palace, in May, “Death to every single IDF soldier out there as an agent of terror for Israel. Death to the IDF.”

Following their set at Glastonbury, Bob Vylan were dropped by United Talent Agency, had their U.S. visas revoked by the Trump administration, and were removed from the lineup of a Manchester music festival. Glastonbury organizers said they were “appalled” by the band's comments, and the BBC apologized for broadcasting the performance.

Bob Vylan defended themselves in a statement, writing, “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people. We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine. A machine whose own soldiers were told to use ‘unnecessary lethal force' against innocent civilians waiting for aid. A machine that has destroyed much of Gaza.”

When François Truffaut made his feature directorial debut with “The 400 Blows” in 1959, it quickly became an international sensation and the French New Wave's first smash hit. Along with Jean-Luc Godard‘s “Breathless,” it established many of the conventions for which the French New Wave would become known: documentary-style location shooting, playful experimentation with editing and film form, and most importantly, a direct connection between the filmmaker's personality and the action on screen.

Many of the New Wave directors aspired to theorist Alexandre Astruc's dream of using the film camera as intimately and personally as a writer uses a pen (the “caméra-stylo,” as Astruc dubbed it), but few realized that dream and its possibilities with as much artistic success as Truffaut. Anyone with even a cursory awareness of the director's biography can see the direct link between him and “The 400 Blows” hero Antoine Doinel, a 14-year old constantly at odds with a world of adults who don't understand him and don't care to — just as Truffaut was before he was taken under the wing of movie critic Andre Bazin and introduced to the cinephilia that would consume him until his premature death at the age of 52.

“The 400 Blows” is often given credit for kicking off the French New Wave — that glorious era that saw exciting work by Godard, Claude Chabrol, Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, Agnes Varda, and others exploding into theaters throughout the 1960s and beyond — but it kicked off something else too: a then unique experiment in world cinema in which Truffaut found an onscreen surrogate and tracked his journey from youth to adulthood over the course of five films and 20 years.

 










This wasn't Truffaut's original intention, and the fact that the Antoine Doinel cycle — which consists of “The 400 Blows,” “Antoine and Colette,” “Stolen Kisses,” “Bed and Board,” and “Love on the Run” — exists at all is largely a testament to the actor Truffaut cast as his alter ego, Jean-Pierre Léaud. “The 400 Blows” was designed as a self-contained feature, and it remains the only one of the five movies that really stands on its own apart from the others; its satisfactions don't require any knowledge that can't be acquired from within the film itself, whereas the sequels only fully resonate in relation to each other.

What turned Antoine Doinel into a recurring character was an offer for Truffaut to contribute to an omnibus film called “Love at 20” in 1962. Motivated primarily by a desire to work with Léaud again, Truffaut took the opportunity to check in with Doinel a few years after “The 400 Blows” left the character frozen in time after his escape from a juvenile detention facility. “Antoine and Colette,” the half-hour short Truffaut contributed to “Love at 20,” presents a now-17-year-old Doinel as he develops his first intense crush on a girl he meets at a concert.

While there are superficial substitutions — Doinel works for a record label and music occupies the same place in his life that cinema occupied for Truffaut — the basic trajectory of “Antoine and Doinel” follows that of Truffaut's real life, when as a young man he became obsessed with a beautiful young woman and moved into the building across the street from her family. Yet, already, the Antoine Doinel movies are moving away from straight autobiography and toward what they would ultimately become: a fusion of Truffaut and Léaud's personalities, as the movies become as much about capturing the actor at specific moments in time as they are about recreating the filmmaker's youthful experiences.

 










Truffaut once said of Antoine Doinel that “something about that character refuses to grow old,” and herein lies the fascinating paradox at the heart of the series. Like Richard Linklater's “Boyhood,” the Antoine Doinel movies serve as a kind of meditation on the passage of time and how well suited the cinema is to capture it; while we obviously watch many, many actors grow up on film, there's something about seeing the actor return to the same character over an extended duration that draws more focused attention to the delicate emotional and physical nuances of aging.

What makes the Antoine Doinel series interesting is that it uses such a static protagonist for its decades-long project of capturing what Jimmy Stewart called “pieces of time.” Doinel begins the cycle as a teenager in 1959 and ends it as a divorced 34-year-old in 1979's “Love on the Run,” but for most of his story's unfolding he changes surprisingly little — the world around him and Truffaut's filmmaking style evolve (the colorful but cramped 1.66:1 compositions of “Love on the Run” feel like the work of an entirely different director than the expansive widescreen vistas of “The 400 Blows”), but Doinel doesn't. He's as restless and unreflective at the end of the saga (in spite of having become a novelist) as he was at the beginning.

 










This is where Doinel most clearly departs from his creator, one of the most self-conscious, self-reflective filmmakers of his era; where Truffaut's life and work were intensely devoted to contemplating his own romantic neuroses and his role in perpetuating them, Doinel never matures — only his director's perspective on him does. Starting with 1968's “Stolen Kisses,” Truffaut becomes more detached from Doinel, his camera taking on an increasingly objective position and his perspective broadening beyond that of his solipsistic protagonist (an evolution that would reach its apex in “Love on the Run,” where for the first time Truffaut leaves Doinel behind entirely for an extended stretch of time to follow one of the women in his life independently of his observations).

Unlike Truffaut, Doinel does not seem particularly ambitious — in “Stolen Kisses,” he stumbles through a series of odd jobs (including, in a storyline that mixes whimsy and poignancy in a manner that Peter Bogdanovich might have had on his mind when he made “They All Laughed,” a stint as a private detective), and getting married in “Bed and Board” (1970) doesn't make him any more committal about a profession. It's not until the final “Love on the Run” that he makes good on his goal to become a novelist, and it's hard to get a sense of whether or not he's a particularly good or popular one.

 










Truffaut, on the other hand, was an internationally renowned director with eight features under his belt by the time he was Doinel's age in “Love on the Run,” so the one-to-one relationship between author and character that marked “The 400 Blows” has clearly eroded over time. Which isn't to say that the autobiographical impulse was entirely gone by the time Truffaut decided to end the series; in fact, the director brings his personal experience into the narrative in a way that beautifully connects the last film to the first and gives Doinel a long delayed moment of epiphany, albeit a subtle one.

While “Stolen Kisses” depicts Doinel's developing relationship with the woman he will eventually marry, and “Bed and Board” depicts his attempts to escape from that marriage — and further attempts to return to it — “Love on the Run” forces its restless hero and the audience watching him to slow down and take stock. It's filled with flashbacks to scenes from the other movies, and it's in these that the subtle power of Truffaut's experiment becomes most evident. As Doinel looks back on his life, his inability to appreciate what he has reveals itself to be the defining problem of his adulthood — and an ongoing source of pain for the women he professes to love.

 










The film's key flashback is prompted by the return of a peripheral character from “The 400 Blows,” the lover a young Antoine witnesses cavorting around Paris with his mother when he's ditching school with a friend. This lover character, Lucien, is only onscreen in “Blows” for a few minutes, and we've long forgotten about him by the time we get to his appearance in “Love on the Run.” Yet when Lucien tells Doinel that his mother truly loved him, it's the moment in the series where everything crystallizes — the effect this revelation has on Doinel, who finally, after five films, slows down for self-reflection, makes it clear that everything we've been watching has been connected to the character's search for the mother he never felt was there for him.

The scene with the lover is clearly informed by Truffaut's own discovery, after his mother's death, of papers left behind that proved she was more attached to her son than he ever perceived. In “Love on the Run,” it serves as the catalyst for Doinel's belated awareness of his own limitations as an artist, a husband, and a lover. Though in keeping with the series' overall tone, this awareness is only incremental. “I would be lying if I said Antoine Doinel succeeded in his transformation into an adult,” Truffaut said of the film, and the bittersweet aftertaste that lingers after the movie's conclusion comes from the open question of whether or not Doinel will really change his behavior at all.

 










For Truffaut, the character steadily became less a way of working out autobiographical impulses than an independent, organic creation that fused personal expression with a different set of desires: the desires Truffaut the Jean-Pierre Léaud fan had to see Jean-Pierre Léaud do certain things on camera that might or might not have been related to anything that had happened to him or Truffaut. The quality of summation that defines “Love on the Run” makes it clear that Truffaut thought the series had run its course, although one wonders if Doinel might have returned had a brain tumor not claimed the director's life in 1984.

“The Adventures of Antoine Doinel,” an indispensable new 4K UHD boxed set from Criterion, contextualizes all five films in Truffaut's filmography and reveals some surprising facts about the director's relationship to the series — archival interviews show, for example, that he doesn't seem to have cared much for “Love on the Run,” which is shocking given the emotional impact the movie has when watched as part of a marathon with the other films. If ever there was proof that directors are the least reliable commentators on their own movies (an observation made slightly ironic by Truffaut's own past as a critic), this is it.

There's never been a better way to consume all five movies together than the Criterion collection, which improves upon the label's earlier Doinel releases with new 4K restorations of the movies taken from their original negatives. The transfers are exquisite, the hours of supplements pure gold for Truffaut fans. And the movies themselves feel both like time capsules that couldn't have existed in any other era and like the timeless, enduring classics that they are. Doinel can be an exasperating identification figure — even Truffaut himself doesn't seem to have cared much for him once he became an adult — but as a vehicle for Truffaut's musings on love, art, freedom, confinement, work, and class, he's always riveting.

 










“The Adventures of Antoine Doinel” will be released on 4K UHD by Criterion on July 15.

EXCLUSIVE: After battling vampirism in the box office smash Sinners, Hailee Steinfeld now has her sights set on a gold medal for her follow-up project as sources tell Deadline she is set to star opposite Miles Teller in Paramount's Olympics film Winter Games. Paul Downs Colaizzo is directing. Pat Cunnane and Colaizzo penned the script. 


	Set in the high-stakes arena of the Winter Olympics, the film follows a perpetually overlooked skier (Steinfeld) and a self-sabotaging hockey legend (Teller) who collide at their breaking points. Their unexpected connection threatens her chance for a medal and his shot at a comeback as they navigate romance and redemption in the Olympic Village.

	











	Tim and Trevor White are producing on behalf of Star Thrower alongside Teller.

	Steinfeld is coming off one of the year's biggest hits with the Warner Bros horror thriller Sinners, where she stars opposite Michael B. Jordan. The film blew past expectations with $365 million to date at the global box office — which includes an astounding $278 million domestic — making it the top-grossing original movie of the past 15 years and the fifth-highest-grossing horror movie of all time. Following an almost two-year break, Steinfeld made her much anticipated return to music on the Sinners soundtrack with “Dangerous.” The song amassed over 4.7 million streams on Spotify in its first month.

	The film also earned rave reviews, putting it, Steinfeld and her co-stars in the mix for consideration this awards season. Following the film's success, Steinfeld saw a slew of offers come in but, after taking her time,  ultimately landed on Winter Games as her follow-up pic.


	In 2023, Steinfeld reprised her voice role as Spider-Gwen in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. The second film in the popular trilogy grossed over $690 million globally and received rave reviews. The first film, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2019. Spider-Gwen will make her return in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse on June 4, 2027.


	In 2021, Steinfeld made her Marvel debut as Kate Bishop in Disney+'s Hawkeye, starring alongside Jeremy Renner. She is repped by CAA and Howard Fishman.

Since at least 2022, Jason Momoa has been teasing his next Apple TV+ show Chief Of War, and his project is almost, finally out in the world. This morning, the streamer shared the first full trailer for the series, which depicts the series' main conflict in new detail. Colonists from the western world arrive in Hawaii and begin doing damage almost immediately, hacking the native flora with axes. Before Ka'iana (Momoa) can try to send them packing, however, he must unite the Hawaiian Islands into the Kingdom Of Hawaii. 



Momoa created the series with Thomas Pa‘a Sibbett, who, per a press release, also shares native Hawaiian heritage. The Aquaman star also wrote and produced the series, which marks a first for him on television. (Momoa has lent his pen to film projects like The Road To Paloma and Aquaman: The Last Kingdom.) The rest of the cast, which includes actors Temuera Morrison, Luciane Buchanan, Te Ao o Hinepehinga, Cliff Curtis, newcomer Kaina Makua, is predominantly Polynesian (excepting, most likely, the actors playing the colonists). 

The series will also feature a significant amount of dialogue spoken in the Hawaiian language, which Sibbett described as “something from the beginning that was really important for us” in an interview with GQ earlier this year. “We just didn't know if it was something that anybody would ever do. But the truth is, for us, even though this is a true story, it feels like a world-building show. It feels like we're presenting something that's been unseen, and people don't know much about it.” Learning the language, Momoa said, had the added benefit of making him realize he had been sort of mumbling his entire life. “It's so much more involved with the mouth,” he explained. “And Olelo Hawaiian is the most beautiful language, it was just really hard for my mouth to move that way. But I busted my ass.”

Chief Of War premieres on Apple TV+ on August 1. New episodes will arrive weekly through September 19.

MJ Lenderman, Sun June, Hand Habits, Advance Base, Friendship, Horse Jumper of Love, Runnner, and others are on a new album dedicated to the late Songs: Ohia and Magnolia Electric Co. singer-songwriter Jason Molina. The album, I Will Swim to You: A Tribute to Jason Molina, is out September 5, via Run for Cover, and it finds the artists covering songs from across the Molina discography. Below, listen to Lenderman's take on The Magnolia Electric Co.'s “Just Be Simple” and Sun June's cover of the Trials & Errors entry “Leave the City.”

The new compilation's title comes from a line on “Lioness,” which Hand Habits covered for the album. “Many try to walk the line between melancholic honesty and poetic affluence and fall short,” Hand Habits' Meg Duffy said in a press statement, “but Jason Molina's raw articulate devastation goes unparalleled.”

A portion of proceeds from I Will Swim to You: A Tribute to Jason Molina will benefit the nonprofit MusiCares.

Jens Lekman has announced a tour and his first solo album in eight years. Songs for Other People's Weddings, a companion LP to a book of the same name by Lekman and bestselling author David Levithan, arrives September 12 via Secretly Canadian, while the novel is due out August 5 via Abrams Books. Leading the record is the single “Candy From a Stranger,” which comes with a Rena Johnson–edited video. Watch below.

Songs for Other People's Weddings draws directly from Lekman's own pivot toward a side career as a wedding singer. The gigs started accumulating after he wrote the 2004 song “If You Ever Need a Stranger (To Sing at Your Wedding)” and fans reached out requesting to book him for their own nuptials. As if to prove his credentials, “Candy From a Stranger” documents his unlikely foray into marriage ceremonies by collaging clips from weddings at which he's performed for its music video.

The Swedish singer-songwriter's new LP follows his 2017 solo full-length, Life Will See You Now, as well as Correspondence, his 2019 collaborative album with Annika Norlin. Lekman also reissued his 2005 compilation Oh You're So Silent Jens and 2007 album Night Falls Over Kortedala with new redux versions of select tracks, previously unreleased songs, and cassette diaries from the albums' era.

Lekman will tour North America this autumn in support of Songs for Other People's Weddings. He's currently slated to start the tour on November 8 in Minneapolis. From there, he hits up cities like Chicago, Toronto, Atlanta, and Los Angeles, before concluding the run on December 3 in Seattle. Find Lekman's complete list of tour dates below.

Brazilian-born Alec Santos is a quickly rising Hallmark star, having just headlined two Hallmark Channel rom-coms on back-to-back weekends — “A Machu Picchu Proposal” opposite Rhiannon Fish on June 28, 2025, and “Unwrapping Christmas: Tina's Miracle,” which premiered the following weekend.

His ability to speak three languages and his worldly upbringing — including moving with his family to Chile at 13 and then to Florida for high school, per Hollywood North Magazine — not play a wide variety of characters but, he says, in the classroom as a substitute teacher. It's a job he says he continues to do, even as his fame keeps rising. 

A post shared by Alec Santos (@alecdavinsantos)

Santos told Woman's World on July 7 that his first teaching job was in northern India, “in a place where the Dalai Lama lives,” where he “taught science and English to Tibetan students.” 

But working on Hallmark movie sets or TV shows like “Virgin River” for weeks at a time doesn't align well with a full-time teaching gig, so Santos now works as a substitute teacher whenever — and wherever — he can. 

“I still work as a substitute teacher because anywhere in the world, they always need teachers,” he explained. “I'll probably keep doing that forever because I love it. I love being in front of a classroom and I have such a passion for science and science education, so I get really excited. Just last week, I did a squid dissection for a biology class!”

“Everyone's always surprised that I have a background in science,” Santos continued, “but these are my two passions, and they sometimes meld together. I think some teachers would benefit from a theater class, because you're performing in front of students, and they're the hardest audience in the world.”

“Teenagers can be apathetic,” he told Woman's World, “but if you can make them laugh and get them interested in the material, they'll remember your class, and performance certainly helps. I do believe acting comes in handy in the classroom.”

On the “Heart Full of Hallmark” podcast in early June, Santos said he “always loved school” when he was growing up, noting that “some of the most influential people in my life have always been teachers.” One — his 10th grade Spanish literature teacher — has even become his best friend later in life, he said. 

Santos said he thought he would see if he could find any success with acting, his other passion “for a few years” and if it didn't work, he'd go back to teaching full-time. not 

“I feel even as the ball is rolling now (with acting), I still I think I'll just substitute (teach) forever,” he said on the podcast. 

Ironically, though, Santos said on “Heart Full of Hallmark” that he hasn't been successful at landing any acting roles as a teacher. 

He laughed, “You know, the funny thing is I've auditioned for teacher roles many times, and like, (they say), ‘No you don't look like a teacher. I don't buy it.'”

As California fights to keep film and TV production from fleeing, the Garden State aims to lay claim to the “Hollywood East” title by both working with — and outflanking — New York. 


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	On May 13, as Netflix broke ground to redevelop 292 acres in Central New Jersey for a massive $848 million new film and TV production facility with 12 soundstages, Fort Monmouth County commissioner director Thomas Arnone made an offer to co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who was on hand. “We will make this easy for you,” Arnone said.


	That may well be the state's promise to Hollywood producers. Even as California Gov. Gavin Newsom managed to get his legislature to double its cap on incentives from $330 million to $750 million annually, he conceded on July 2 at a press conference that the state had taken its eye off the ball for years. “We put our feet up, we took things for granted,” Newsom said.

	The Garden State has been a big beneficiary of infrastructure projects, which once may have defaulted to Burbank, heading far outside of Hollywood's 30-mile zone. “New Jersey offers the best of both worlds: proximity to New York without the complexity, and a state government that's deeply invested in growing the industry the right way,” Gannon Murphy, co-founder and president of the state's film-industry advocacy group Screen Alliance New Jersey (SANJ), told The Hollywood Reporter. “Productions aren't just saving money here — they're finding purpose-built facilities, reliable crews, and a serious commitment to the work.”

	











	Murphy is also the operator of the Jersey City's Cinelease Studios, which for New Jersey was the first of those “purpose-built spaces” that he mentioned. It certainly was not the state's first space used as a studio, however. Cinelease has three soundstages (each with 40 feet of clearance height) totaling 67,600 sq. ft. It also has 8,100 sq. ft. of office space, plenty of power and more than 60 designated parking spots. It has hosted TV and film productions like Wild ‘N' Out season 17, Dumb Money, A Murder at the End of the World and American Horror Stories season three. Its Caven Point location has made Jersey City one of the state's production hotspots.


	Even where SANJ put on the NJ Film Expo — the mostly-shuttered Meadowlands sports arena — in May has been used as a TV production space. Since 2018, NBCUniversal has leased the venue to film primetime dramas like Lincoln Rhyme: Hunt for the Bone Collector and The Enemy Within; Tales of the Walking Dead and The Walking Dead: Dead City have also filmed there.


	Across the Newark Bay lies another destination for Hollywood productions.  Desireè Hadley, who manages the Newark Office of Film and TV, told THR it is Newark's “historic-looking buildings and architecture” that make it “desirable for period pieces.”


	“We are always one of the locations where folks come if they want to do something that's filmed in the ‘80s or the ‘70s, especially if it's like New York City 1980s,” Hadley said.

	











	Newark has undergone what Hadley called “an artistic explosion” ever since Ras J. Baraka, a poet and a former educator, became mayor. “Newark was made for the big screen, with every possible location and ambiance a director could ask for. Our sidewalks, alleys and park paths feature figures from central casting and our workforce is primed to cover every need from craft services, to camera crew, to feature length soundtracks,” Baraka told THR. “Most of all, Newark has a can-do vibe that is fresh and contagious, and sure to add extra magic to any set.”


	If you need an indoor location in Baraka's town, look no further than Newark Film Studios.


	Newark Film Studios occupies the former National Newark & Essex Banking Company headquarters, first built in 1930. The timeless space centers on a mezzanine featuring iconic gold doors and accents. It can easily be dressed up or down for everything from a Roaring Twenties feel to a midcentury-modern aesthetic or even present day. There, movies like West Side Story (2021) and A Complete Unknown filmed scenes, as did TV series like The Plot Against America (2020) and The Equalizer, among others. (Queen Latifah's The Equalizer, a spinoff of the Denzel Washington movies that aired on CBS from 2021-2025, is credited at basically every production space in New Jersey.)


	Like Cinealease, the old bank, which before this whole Hollywood East thing was occupied by Verizon, has generous ceiling heights throughout, on-site parking and office space used for film and post-production on various floors. It wasn't purpose-built, but it serves the purpose.

	











	The near-100-year-old building is “a blank canvas to meet [the] needs” of film productions, Newark Film Studios founder Joseph Dabbah told THR. “Whether that's a raw space for set construction or a period interior for a story setting, we try to make it work without overcomplicating things.”


	Crucially, Newark, like Jersey City, Montclair, Bayonne and Hoboken, lies within a 35-mile circle of Manhattan's Columbus Circle. That's not just for convenience, it circumvents union upcharges.


	The rule (basically) works like this: IATSE demands higher wages and hotel stays for its members on productions outside of the 35-mile radius. Inside is considered to be home base, a contractually-acceptable daily commute. Netflix's under-construction Fort Monmouth campus lies outside of that bubble.


	“Being 20 minutes from New York City by public transit and offering straightforward on-site parking makes a huge difference,” Dabbah said of Newark. “Productions avoid the logistical headaches and high costs of Manhattan while keeping access to talent and crew.”


	The train is great, sure — especially if you want to film some on this side of the NJ/NY border and some on the other side — but what Newark also has going for it is a true international airport.


	Importing New York talent to a place like Newark is simple. But you'd be making a mistake not to look more locally as well, Diane Raver, the executive director of the New Jersey Film Academy, and Patricia Piroh, the director of production and technology for broadcast and media operations at Montclair State University, both told THR (independently).

	











	“The best crews live here,” Raver said.


	Raver began her career in TV commercial production, and has filmed “all over the world,” she said, including 20 years in New York City — but she found that “the most diverse and easy place to shoot” was New Jersey. OK, so maybe she's a bit of a homer. “You can cheat almost any location here, since we have it all,” said Raver, who is from the beach town of Sea Girt, a pretty cool location itself.


	There's a ton of beach in New Jersey, something you can find in Los Angeles but not in Canada, another hotbed of Hollywood production flight. “Good luck filming a beach scene in Toronto,” Tim Sullivan, the CEO of New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA), quipped to THR.


	And it's not simply “urban” or “beach.” Go rewatch the Sopranos “Pine Barrens” episode, film in the dense woods of South Jersey. “Unless you're filming a moon landing or the Sahara, you could pretty much do it in New Jersey,” Sullivan said.


	You could probably pull those off too. New Jersey's “rich tapestry of locations…can stand in for other parts of the U.S. — and even the world,” Piroh told THR.


	But we've put the cart before the horse here, because New Jersey's real carrot is its tax-incentive program. It's show-business, right?


	The state's tax-credit program is among the most generous in the country. Qualifying productions can receive a credit for up to 35 percent of qualifying costs. The hoops to jump through aren't that huge either. They're: 1) the productions qualifying expenses must exceed $1 million in New Jersey spend, and 2) 60 percent of the total production expenses (exclusive of post-production costs) must be incurred for services and goods purchased through vendors authorized to do business in New Jersey.

	











	New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy told THR that the best thing about New Jersey's film tax incentive program isn't even about how much money they're willing to allocate, but rather for how long they're willing to allocate it. The New Jersey Film and Digital Media Tax Credit Program has already been extended through June 30, 2039. It's an “explicit statement that this is not about us,” Murphy said, “this is about generations to come.”


	Though Murphy is on his way out as governor, the program has bipartisan support, Sullivan said. Thus far, it has helped make New Jersey the sixth-largest state for film and TV productions, according to an April 8, 2025 study by ProdPro.


	“The state is clearly invested in building a real production ecosystem here,” Dabbah said. “They're not just talking about tax credits — they're actively helping productions find sites, navigate permitting, and plan out stages that are still under construction.”


	Minimizing red tape has been a major sales pitch beyond the boundaries of Los Angeles County. Elsewhere, places that want to attract film and TV production act like they actually want the business. Crazy we know. Look no further than the fact that it took until 2025 for “Stay in L.A.” to become a real rallying cry for California production insiders. 


	New Jersey is clearly thrilled to have Netflix, but officials are not yet satisfied. It wants others to set up shop here as well — and to never pack up and leave.

	











	“One of the knocks on some tax credit programs around the country is that [they are set up to] have a production blow through town. It's exciting for three or four weeks. Everyone's excited, and then they leave. That's fun to have that three or four weeks and it has real economic impact, but are you in the longterm, permanent-job creation [business]?” Sullivan said. “If you have a good film tax credit program, you should have production coming through town regularly. Three three-to-four-month assignments is a year's worth of work for a hair and makeup person, or a cater or whatever. What we're really trying to do is encourage brick-and-mortar construction for longterm job creation.”


	Well, the mortar is being applied to the bricks beyond Netflix's central-New Jersey former Army base location. For example, Lionsgate is in the process of building a 350,000 square foot studio in Newark. That sounds huge — and it is — until you consider what's going on in Bayonne.


	With up to $400 million of Sullivan's (organization's) money, 1888 Studios, a 23-soundstage, 58-acre production hub in Bayonne is in the works. It will be “the largest and first campus-style film and television studio facility in the Northeast,” per the NJEDA.


	Headed way down the New Jersey Turnpike to Atlantic City, which 15 years ago famously lost out on HBO's Boardwalk Empire (about Prohibition-era A.C.) to Brooklyn and Staten Island, ACX1 Films has proposed building over a massive pier on the Atlantic Ocean. The plan is for the facility to host “more ready-to-shoot films sets than any other studio on the east coast.”

	











	New Jersey, the 47th largest state in the United States by area, is thinking big. California, consider this your notice.

Sean O'Brien, the colorful and combative leader of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, is providing an unexpected line to the White House. But does Hollywood want him as its diplomat?



		By Steven Zeitchik, Katie Kilkenny 

	July 10, 2025	




	When he was a 19-year-old working any gig he could scrounge up around Boston, Sean O'Brien found himself driving on the set of Malice, the 1993 thriller starring Alec Baldwin and Nicole Kidman. A fourth-generation Teamster from Medford, O'Brien wasn't the type to sip white wine and nibble appetizers with big-time movie stars. But he struck up a relationship with Tom Cruise — then married to Kidman — who often was lingering on the sidelines on shooting days.


	“I was the youngest guy on the set,” O'Brien recalls, “and he was always coming up talking to me.” The two became so friendly that they even got a touch football game going with Baldwin and a group of Teamsters on an off day.

	The moment tells of more than just Cruise's working-man conviviality. It opens a window into the interest in entertainment industry relationships held by International Brotherhood of Teamsters general president O'Brien, who now seeks to bask in a Hollywood presence and further its priorities in a way that goes well beyond a weekend sandlot scrimmage. These days, following his controversial decision to speak at last summer's Republican National Convention, the 50-something union boss has become one of very few industry emissaries with real clout in the Trump White House, an awkward alignment that's stirred consternation among Hollywood's liberal establishment.


	Though industry outsiders might associate the Teamsters more with 18-wheelers than star trailers, the organization's members are an inescapable presence on film and TV sets. With Hollywood roots going back to the Great Depression, its 15,000 entertainment worker members of course drive (hauling everything from set dec to talent); cast those very stars to begin with (some 700 of Hollywood's casting directors are represented by the Teamsters); scout production locations; train set animals; and feed cast and crew.

	











	A brash blue-collar personality who can seem to enjoy provoking more effete Hollywood types — O'Brien has appeared on his podcast in a black veterans-group T-shirt that reveals his bicep tattoo as he tells saltily colorful stories about his Boston union days — the labor leader believes he can change the standing of the entertainment business in D.C. and, as a result, help ensure the survival of the industry. He is lobbying hard for a federal tax credit, has come out in support of Trump's 100 percent tariff on overseas productions and wants Apple and Amazon to be “put in check” for the harm he believes they're wreaking on the industry. But the contract is far from signed on whether the negotiator is the bridge to Washington that the industry has been waiting for, or an attention seeker more interested in viral video clips of himself than a healthier Hollywood.


	O'Brien's story isn't just about the emergence of a blue-collar power broker of showbiz policy — it's a tale of the braided knot between the gritty world of the Boston white working class and an entertainment business 3,000 miles away that just can't stop portraying it. At times, O'Brien can seem like a character in the latest Ben Affleck or Mark Wahlberg movie rather than a savvy political insider who happens to be a pal of both of them.


	His public persona merges an old-school toughness with a new-age media savvy — sometimes simultaneously. A few years ago, one of the most surreal sights the modern Congress has ever witnessed had O'Brien at its center when Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin challenged him to a fistfight during a hearing on unions' impact on working families — a challenge the labor leader seemed eager to accept until Sen. Bernie Sanders stepped in to (slightly) lower the temperature. The video went viral, and millions of people who'd never heard of Sean O'Brien suddenly knew his name.

	











	As he has staked out his turf, O'Brien has created something unique in the modern era of Republican and certainly Trumpian politics: a figure who can front Hollywood interests from right inside the White House. But a simple question remains unanswered: Does Hollywood actually want him there?


The floor of the Republican National Convention was abuzz. Sean O'Brien, the leader of one of the largest and arguably one of the most powerful labor unions in the land, had just broken with tradition and spoken at the GOP gathering. That had never happened before. Usually labor leaders turned up at the Democratic National Convention, which, possibly as a result of the RNC speech, O'Brien then wasn't invited to attend.


	The speech was a reversal for more than a union. O'Brien himself had dissed Trump during his own election campaign to lead the union, praising then-President Joe Biden and a Democratic-led Congress in 2021 for the COVID stimulus bill that bailed out a Teamster pension fund for nearly 400,000 members. The bill faced strong opposition on the Hill. Vice President Kamala Harris broke a Senate tie to advance it.


	“I want to commend everybody who worked hard on that,” O'Brien said at an election debate against his opponent, Steve Vairma, adding, “You know, it's unfortunate that a lot of our members voted for Trump.” (He also once described the National Labor Relations Board under Trump's first term as a “four-year reign of terror.”)


	Such comments made O'Brien's about-face in Milwaukee — he gave Trump the ultimate Teamster compliment by calling him “one tough SOB” — that much more striking.

	











	Pundits contorted themselves to figure out O'Brien's game. “Was he surreptitiously sticking it to the party of Big Business?” wondered The New York Times politics writer Jonathan Weisman. But a more straightforward explanation might have also applied: O'Brien was manifesting a move to working-class populism that was rippling through parts of the Republican coalition (a point that O'Brien would later bear out by aligning with Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has positioned himself accordingly). An internal poll conducted by the Teamsters ahead of the 2024 election found about 60 percent of members supporting Trump, O'Brien says.


	But the leader says one of the biggest reasons to swing to Trump is simple realpolitik. “We have never had access like this,” says O'Brien, who also visited Mar-a-Lago shortly before the inauguration but says he's still a Democrat. Now he talks with the president, he says, two to three times a month, far more than he ever talked to Biden. “Most of it's about what's going on,” O'Brien says of the conversations. “He's very sympathetic to our relationship and the relationship with working people.”


	Yet O'Brien is vague on what, exactly, all those phone commiserations have yielded. Asked for examples, he first notes the appointment of Lori Chavez-DeRemer as Labor secretary. The naming of the union-leaning former Oregon congresswoman to the post — seen in D.C. as a kind of return-the-favor for O'Brien's decision not to endorse Harris in front of his 1.3 million members — is no small thing given how many departments under Trump, from education to the environment, seem to be undermining their agency's very goals (though progressive stalwart The Nation has strongly criticized Chavez-DeRemer as anti-union). O'Brien is vague in describing other achievements, saying in an interview only that “we have been consulted with on many issues from the administration” and that “we've got full access and we've got credibility.”

	











	Such acceptance hasn't sat well with segments of the Teamsters' leadership. Richard Hooker Jr., secretary-treasurer of Local 623 in Philadelphia, believes the White House coziness has mortally damaged both the Teamsters' standing and its goals.


	“We are the laughingstock of the labor movement with the general president's flirtation with Trump,” Hooker tells THR. “When you are a labor leader, it's supposed to be, an injury to one is an injury to all. So when [nearly] 50,000 TSA workers lose their right to collectively bargain, and the strongest arm of the labor movement doesn't say anything, that sends a loud message to the employers that they can do whatever they want,” he adds, referring to O'Brien's silence in response to the administration's decision in March to neuter workers' rights at the Homeland Security agency.


	Instead of putting the White House on speed dial, Hooker says, the Teamsters “should be in the mud with everybody else fighting tooth and nail against Trump and his regime.” The Philadelphian is running against O'Brien in next year's union elections.


	To some critics, O'Brien's alignment with Trump goes beyond utilitarian benefit to a place of identifying with brawler white-male politics; like the president, O'Brien regards himself as a sharp negotiator and, more troublingly to many, has offered up anti-immigrant rhetoric. (“I think the biggest problem is people are trying to protect illegal aliens that come over here and commit crimes, and that's unacceptable,” he told Hawley on his podcast.)

	











	“Under the cover of being bipartisan, what Sean O'Brien has done is use the shortcomings of the Democrats to cozy up to the far right,” Joe Allen, a left-wing author and former Teamster who has been critical of O'Brien on the progressive site Counterpunch, tells THR. “To me, that's about his own politics. But whatever you believe, I don't think you can argue any of this is good for labor,” Allen says, noting that Trump has “a non-functioning NLRB, a non-functioning OSHA and ICE going after working people trying to raise a family.”


	Those critics may or may not prove to be a thorn in O'Brien's side. Even those who don't like O'Brien say he's a master politician, an instinctual learner who has no formal background in politics — he left the University of Massachusetts at Boston after one term to join his father's union as a heavy-equipment driver — but has learned how to strategically corral those once disdainful of him, as he did with left-of-center faction Teamsters for a Democratic Union before his 2021 election. O'Brien handily won that race (he ran on a reform platform promising tougher negotiations with UPS) even though his opponent had been handpicked by the incumbent, James P. Hoffa, generally a golden ticket. The upset surprised some members and observers. Once considered a watchdog for the excesses of union leadership, the Teamsters for a Democratic Union mostly now follows O'Brien.


Even casual users of social media might be struck by how often O'Brien seems to be meeting with Republican leaders on entertainment industry issues lately, then posing for a photograph to document his encounters. There goes the union boss talking to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott about film tax credits in the Lone Star State; here he is at the FCC with chair Brendan Carr gabbing about the Paramount-Skydance merger.

	











	O'Brien says he and Trump speak frequently about entertainment issues. Recently, the union boss has been bending the president's ear on the issue of the federal tax credit and overseas production tariffs. The Teamsters enthusiastically supported Trump's latter plan, which has seemingly fallen by the wayside since the president announced it in May.


	“We thank President Trump for boldly supporting good union jobs when others have turned their heads. This is a strong step toward finally reining in the studios' un-American addiction to outsourcing our members' work,” O'Brien and the head of the Teamsters' motion picture division, Lindsay Dougherty, said in a statement after the provocative May post on Truth Social. Other Hollywood labor guilds were more muted.


	O'Brien even went on Fox News to endorse the plan to the network's many Trump fans, giving it an air of Hollywood rank-and-file legitimacy. “Tariff them, make them work in the United States and take a little bit less off your bottom line,” he said.


	O'Brien says his affinity for Hollywood came early. His late father, Billy O'Brien, was a transportation coordinator with Boston's Local 25 for more than five decades. He would sit in their home and flip through the trades to see where his next gig was coming from, often landing big ones, such as on Clint Eastwood's 2003 opus Mystic River or the quintessential Boston movie Good Will Hunting. His fascination with a kind of cinematic toughness was honed early in life, too. O'Brien, now the father of two sons, loved the 1990 gangster movies Goodfellas and State of Grace and continues to watch them to this day (he has seen the former “thousands of times” and the latter “a hundred times”).

	











	The labor leader's fears for Hollywood are similar to what a lot of people in town quietly grumble about: a tech takeover. While studio bosses have historically been the enemy of organized labor, O'Brien sounds an almost wistful note in talking about their stewardship of a tradition he thinks Silicon Valley is now ruining.


	“They need to be put in check, not look to destroy an industry full of the most creative people for hundreds of years,” he tells THR of tech entertainment giants. “The United States of Amazon, they are only in the streaming industry because it's a marketing tool. What is their biggest business? Their biggest business is their cloud and Amazon Prime.”


	On that point, Hollywood labor leaders would likely not disagree. But they might note that Amazon and Apple also provide plenty of industry jobs. In a way, O'Brien is channeling the concern that even in 2025 can remain unusually unaired in industry circles: If entertainment is not these companies' core business, what happens when they get tired of the side hustle?


	The Teamsters leader also is worried about AI and has become an ally of anti-AI advocate Justine Bateman, who sings his praises and even recruited the Teamsters to sponsor her “No AI” film festival in Hollywood in March.


	“The AI threat, it's not looming. It's a clear and present danger,” O'Brien says. “You look at the appetite for convenience in society [not] realizing what the consequences are.” Driverless trucks are of course a bête noire, but O'Brien says he wants to be fighting equally hard against the tech on studio lots.

	











	“I mean, you can make a movie on an iPad and create Hollywood characters,” he says. “We've just got to be vigilant on making sure there's protections against AI and utilize AI where it's necessary and, where it's not necessary, mandate that it can't be used.”


	But Trump, who has signaled little interest so far in AI regulation — he gutted a Biden executive order that had modestly attempted that — is an unlikely ally in this regard. And it remains perplexing both inside and outside Hollywood how O'Brien's interest in human-centric labor squares with Trump's seeming apathy on the subject.


	Other Hollywood-affiliated unions are conspicuously chilly to Trump (SAG-AFTRA has barred the former Apprentice star from readmission, and IATSE has decried him for allegedly crossing its picket line). In response to requests for comment from major Hollywood unions about O'Brien's efforts with the White House, only the actors' union responded, with leader Duncan Crabtree-Ireland not mentioning Trump but praising the Teamsters as a “powerful labor ally” whose solidarity “helped maintain momentum” during its recent strike. The union added that O'Brien himself walked the picket lines and “inspired SAG-AFTRA members.”


	Still, there's a sense that some are desperate enough in a contracting production business to turn to Trump for help, even if they have to hold their noses. “We do have support from those other unions,” O'Brien says. “They're just not as vocal.”


	The Bostoner's uneasy relationship with the entertainment labor community over the Trump factor was exemplified by an episode of his podcast Better Bad Ideas released in March with comedian Adam Conover, who is a board member of the WGA West. As O'Brien wound down the congenial conversation, Conover buttonholed the host on White House actions that have alarmed labor leaders, such as federal layoffs, the shuttering of DEI programs and the firing of an NLRB board member. “I think we've got to be clear-eyed about when people in power currently are actively trying to make it harder for us to organize,” Conover confronted O'Brien.

	











	“People are going to blow things up and hopefully rebuild them,” O'Brien offered, and somewhat jarringly changed the subject to job losses caused by Biden actions on the Keystone Pipeline.


	Domestic productions offer O'Brien an opportunity to help Hollywood, particularly with the federal tax incentive that the industry hopes to convince Washington Republicans to support. Still, the jury is out on whether O'Brien or anyone else can persuade Trump to offer a perceived gift to an industry he wars with, based in a state whose governor he can't stand. (Some Hollywood labor figures have been privately skeptical that the shuttle diplomacy by either O'Brien or Trump pal and “special ambassador” Jon Voight will amount to much. But one insider maintains O'Brien's presidential access has, at least, been effective in keeping Hollywood issues top of mind with an easily distractible president.)


	O'Brien contends Trump is a new man. “When you're running on a platform of wanting to be the party or the president for working people, of course you're going to change your platform,” he says of the president. “I think he's got a lot better people around him making decisions.” O'Brien says that if the administration made what he felt were anti-labor moves, “obviously [we'd] hold them accountable,” even as his organization appears to have been largely silent on many issues that have alarmed other advocates.


	O'Brien says his critics might be confused because of the novelty of his approach. “We're doing something different that nobody else has done,” he says of the Trump relationship.

	











	A cozy or at least transactional relationship between a Teamsters boss and a controversial Republican president is actually not new. In the 1970s Jimmy Hoffa ally Frank Fitzsimmons had a strong in with Richard Nixon, which resulted in some benefits to the Teamsters on his watch. And IBT boss Jackie Presser helped Ronald Reagan get elected in 1980, leading to a place on Reagan's transition team. Teamsters have simply tended to avoid the political lockstep of other labor groups. 


	“They don't feel restrained historically,” says David Witwer, an American Studies professor at Penn State Harrisburg and author of Corruption and Reform in the Teamsters Union. “They wouldn't say, ‘well, we wouldn't want to do this because our colleagues in other unions aren't doing this.” 


	One big question is how the Trump dynamic affects O'Brien's relationship with motion picture division director Dougherty, who has shown more socially liberal colors than some previous Teamster leaders but also strong loyalty to her boss. She had the union participate in the Los Angeles Pride parade for the first time, added more diversity to her executive board and brought together Teamsters for a Martin Luther King Jr. celebration. The highest-ranking officers on O'Brien's general executive board are a diverse group, though he did get into hot water when his administration fired 20 people from the Teamsters' organizing department, the majority people of color, leading to a $2.9 million settlement in a racial discrimination lawsuit, with the Teamsters denying any wrongdoing, The Guardian has reported.

	











	Dougherty, a bold personality disposed to tattoos (including one of the elder Hoffa) and R-rated language (her catchphrase is internet favorite “fuck around and find out”), has proved to be both a strong ally and asset for O'Brien.


	A longtime Teamsters staffer and former transportation dispatcher on projects like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Dougherty has raised the profile of the 6,400-member Local 399 in North Hollywood.


	O'Brien, who met Dougherty during the 2000s through her father, the secretary-treasurer of a Detroit Teamsters Local, cannily asked her to join his political slate ahead of the union's 2021 election. He was looking to challenge the handpicked successor to 23-year incumbent James P. Hoffa, Jimmy's 80-year-old son, in coalition with the Teamsters for a Democratic Union, and as an outspoken millennial, Dougherty helped solidify his branding.


	In an interview, Dougherty said she was drawn to joining O'Brien's 2021 slate because he was “aggressive” and “forceful,” as opposed to a previous leadership that was “complacent.”


	O'Brien and Dougherty together have shaken up the Hollywood labor world with increasingly tough talk. O'Brien one-upped Dougherty's spicy rhetoric when he came to town in advance of Local 399's contract negotiations in 2024 and repeatedly called the studios a “white-collar crime syndicate.”


	The question, of course, is whether all the sound and fury produces anything. Critics say that the 2023 UPS fight didn't do as much good as O'Brien claimed, preceding a bloody period of tens of thousands of job cuts as automation takes hold amid facility closures. “The process for Sean,” says John Palmer, a vp at large for the Teamsters from San Antonio and prominent O'Brien critic, “is to talk tough and sell short.”

	











	The new UPS contract, ratified by 86 percent of voting members, was praised by some members at the time for raising wages and improving working conditions. “I mean, the UPS agreement speaks for itself,” O'Brien says of the deal.


Before he was whispering in Trump's ear about Hollywood, O'Brien was cupping his hand to Hollywood. Shortly after he became president of Local 25 in 2006 on a platform of de-criminalizing the chapter, O'Brien flew out from Boston to do a backlot tour and reassure studios that, contrary to (well-earned) perception, Boston was not a scary place to shoot and that the Teamsters didn't make negotiations difficult for producers. O'Brien's predecessor George Cashman pled guilty to extortion, following a series of troubling incidents that included a grand jury investigation into shakedowns of producers on reportedly such films as The Cider House Rules and The Perfect Storm. All of it had prompted a 2000s-era Hollywood abandonment of Massachusetts.


	O'Brien told Hollywood the union had been cleaned up and the industry wouldn't face that kind of bullying again. And while tax credits spearheaded by then-Gov. Deval Patrick probably had as much to do with it as anything that O'Brien said, Hollywood soon returned, shooting movies like the Bruce Willis starrer Surrogates, the Mel Gibson vehicle Edge of Darkness and Ben Affleck's The Town in the late 2000s. Affleck credits O'Brien with a Boston movie renaissance. “I believe Sean is meaningfully responsible for the amount of [Hollywood] work that came into Boston as a result [at the time],” the Oscar winner tells THR, adding that “he personally made sure that our movie company had a good experience.”

	











	But O'Brien's tenure didn't always go so smoothly on the Hollywood front. About five years after the Town shoot, a group of Teamsters picketed the Bravo hit Top Chef in an attempt to force the production to sign contracts with the union instead of local drivers and, according to allegations in an eventual trial, hurled misogynistic, homophobic and racist invective at cast, crew and a Bravo executive. Four Teamsters were indicted but acquitted. O'Brien was never indicted in the controversy, but his No. 2, Mark Harrington, pled guilty to attempted extortion and was sentenced to six months of home confinement. But O'Brien has had his own brushes with discipline over union activities. After he said in 2013 that members who didn't vote in a Rhode Island Teamsters election the way he wanted would be “punished,” an independent oversight board for the union suspended him on intimidation grounds.


	The time O'Brien spent around sets appears to have honed his showman instincts. He flies in to Southern California periodically to record celebrity episodes of his podcast in person at a studio in Burbank. On the show, O'Brien deploys his Boston brogue to offer a mix of wisecracks and humblebrags. One running theme is guests noting how tough he is, a fact O'Brien tends to laugh at while also pointedly not dissenting. Taking a page from early Joe Rogan, O'Brien brings on figures from across the political spectrum, everyone from Hasan Piker and Ro Khanna to Hawley and Chavez-DeRemer, along with subjects like Casey Affleck and Dana White.

	











	Even as he now jets around the country, O'Brien's Boston working-class roots are visible. He is said to have several plainclothes security guards. One is believed to be Daniel Risteen, a longtime Massachusetts state trooper who had a small role in The Departed. Risteen left the troopers in 2018 amid one controversy over an altered arrest report for a judge's daughter and another reportedly regarding Risteen's ex-girlfriend, a trooper who'd admitted to money laundering and drug dealing. Per the union's latest financial disclosure form, he made a $241,000 salary in 2024.


	O'Brien in fact nearly became a TV player years earlier, when friend Mark Wahlberg and the actor's manager Stephen Levinson pitched a Teamsters-themed unscripted show to A&E that would focus on Local 25. The pilot was shot in 2012, but the show was never picked up.


	O'Brien by his own admission spends more time on the road and less in D.C. than past Teamsters bosses, and while it no doubt has contributed to his profile, it also has made some critics grumble that he has larger media or political ambitions.


	For now, though, O'Brien appears to have his eye trained on a different vote: his Teamsters reelection bid in fall 2026. In April, O'Brien announced his slate, showing he again will be running alongside his current secretary-treasurer Fred Zuckerman and a list of candidates including Dougherty.


	The landscape of potential O'Brien challengers isn't yet clear, but Hooker, the Philadelphia Local official, is one of them. The Teamster leader says he wants to end a culture of “fear, intimidation, retaliation, autocracy and harassment in our organization” that he believes O'Brien, whom he calls a “bully ruler,” perpetuates. O'Brien may also have to answer for his associations with Trump, whose popularity among members could fluctuate over the next 15 months.

	











	Whatever happens in his campaign, O'Brien thinks history will bear out his move from the Democrats and prove the naysayers wrong.


	“It was like the definition of insanity, right? Let's keep supporting the people that aren't supporting us and get no return on our investment,” he says, referring to unnamed Democratic politicians. “A lot of Democrats, a lot of Democratic representatives, have shifted to big business, to corporations like Amazon, like the Apples of the world and the Ubers, the Lyfts. But we don't go along to get along. That's not the type of people we are.”

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” Season 17, Episode 1, “The Gang Fucks Up Abbott Elementary.”]

Back in January, when ABC premiered one of TV‘s most curious crossover events — pairing its family-friendly “Abbott Elementary” with FX's adults-only “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” — I couldn't shake two nagging issues with the pleasant-enough episode.

The first was that “Volunteers” feels way more like an “Abbott” episode than a “Sunny” episode. To begin with, Dennis (Glenn Howerton) is nowhere to be found. He spots the cameras, cites his thorough knowledge of “filming” and “consent,” and immediately bows out. It's a good joke that's true to Dennis' nature, but it also robs us of an elite comic character. Meanwhile, Mac (Rob Mac, né McElhenney) is very much out of character while sucking up to Ava (Janelle James), and Frank (Danny DeVito) gets into it with Mr. Johnson (William Stanford Davis) and Gregory (Tyler James Williams) in an atypically tame feud.

Obviously, the gang has to be on its best behavior to meet “Abbott's” broadcast standards, but their comportment in “Volunteers” never quite jells with the uncaring goons we've come to know and love.

 










Of course, crossover episodes aren't easy. Audiences can often sense the corporate overlords' gruff hands pushing these previously distinct programs together. Some efforts are smoother than others (like when Dick Wolf's “Chicago” shows combine into one cavernous deep dish) and that goes double if the episode is more of a character cameo than a full-on crossover (like when “E.R.'s” Dr. Ross and Dr. Carter took a shift on “Friends” to flirt with Monica and Rachel). But in general, crossovers tend to sacrifice more than they create and work better for the suits than the fans.

With “Abbott” and “Sunny,” the situation was slightly different. Yes, they're both successful sitcoms owned by Disney, and yes, they're both rooted in Philadelphia, so the financial and practical reasons for a crossover are clear enough. But they're also designed for polar opposite audiences. Does “Abbott” really want their innocent fans catching up on one of the most TV-MA sitcoms ever made? Does “Sunny” expect their sicko fans (complimentary) to fall for the earnest intentions and sweet central romance on “Abbott”? 

Who is this crossover for, exactly?

Which brings us to my second issue with “Volunteers” — an issue that's entirely my own, and an issue that nearly nullifies my previous issues: I didn't know “Sunny” was making an additional episode all its own.

 










Told from the gang's perspective and kicking off “It's Always Sunny's” 17th season, “The Gang Fucks Up Abbott Elementary” doesn't just fill in the gaps for “Sunny” fans who felt slighted by the initial crossover episode; it also solves the common conundrum of a crossover episode by rejecting its most basic premise. Rather than combine the two shows into a single ill-fitting story, it honors both “Abbott” and “Sunny's” distinct perspectives by giving them their own version of the same episode. 

Recognizing as much certainly makes “Volunteers” easier to digest (even if it doesn't elevate the episode among “Abbott's” finest). Everything shown in that half-hour is simply what's suitable for an all-ages documentary about the teachers at a public elementary school. Meanwhile, the extra footage Ava discovers to start “The Gang Fucks Up Abbott Elementary” holds all the disturbing ideas, racist language, and outlandish actions inherent to our favorite Philly heathens. And, as befits the group's longstanding M.O., it should come as no surprise that the Gang gets more out of “Abbott Elementary” than “Abbott” gets out of the Gang.

Season 17's premiere is an exceptional episode of “Sunny” and exceptional comedy, straight up. From the basic premise — the gang's court-ordered community service means they have to spend a week volunteering at a local grade school — to the individual plotlines (the boy band auditions, my god), “The Gang Fucks Up Abbott Elementary” feels right at home as an episode of “Sunny.” It's raucous, shocking, and immensely satisfying. It zigs when you expect it to zag, it's smart about laying the groundwork for future “Sunny” episodes (everyone should circle back to the premiere once they've seen the full season), and it's jam-packed with jokes.

 










Take Dennis. True to himself, he's still hiding from the cameras, but before he can go sit in a broom closet to stare at his phone for five straight days, a slight irritation sparks him into action: The school's coffee is terrible. Seeing Dennis go full Walter White (as he dubs himself) while technically providing an act of kindness to every hard-working public servant at Abbott isn't what I would've guessed he'd end up doing in his downtime, but seeing him prep coffee orders while lightly chastising his customers (“Katie, I remember you — super complicated order.”) is an honest-to-Dennis delight.

Plus, that's not all he does. As usual, Dennis' passions get the better of him, and he's sucked into the gang's outraged/conspiratorial orbit when Charlie (Charlie Day) mentions “the kids don't know anything about”… 9/11. Now, I can't connect every dot between their fateful lunch hour discussion and their eventual decision to update Billy Joel's “We Didn't Start the Fire” for post-9/11 America, but hearing Mrs. Barbara Howard (Sheryl Lee Ralph) rhapsodically bebopping with Charlie about a metaphorical fire right before Mac and Frank start a real fire — intended to test the melting point of steel beams — well, I can't say I ever thought I'd live to see the day. Exquisite comedy. No notes.

 










Speaking of Frank, his polite feud (by Frank's standards) with Mr. Johnson turns out to be nothing more than a diversion. “This guy's gonna be a problem,” Frank says, after Mr. Johnson busts them for hanging out in the teacher's lounge within minutes of arriving at the school, before adding, “I'll take care of him.” It then becomes clear that everything shown in “Abbott's” episode — where Frank kept screwing with the community garden run by Mr. Johnson and Gregory — was just a way to keep the janitor busy while Frank goes about his actual plan: hunting for copper. To close the episode, Ava finds out he raided the boys' bathroom for his targeted treasure (which turns out to be a win-win, since she needed to tear out the wall anyway).

For as magnificent as it is to see the Gang back to their old ways (especially after two years between seasons), just as essential to the premiere's success is how well the “Abbott” cast is utilized. Whereas seeing a tamed version of the gang does little to elevate “Volunteers,” witnessing Abbott's teachers off-the-leash brings quite a bit of joy to “Sunny.” There's Ava mocking Janine for rushing into her office all out of breath (and mocking a tall student who “can't shoot for shit”); there's Barbara singing, which in and of itself is a brilliant skill to write toward; there's Jacob walking in on Mac, Charlie, and Frank “recruiting” the aforementioned tall kid.

 










And then there was Brunson's first solo scene: In a callback to Dee's viciously two-faced arc in the “Abbott” episode, Janine (Quinta Brunson) calls her a “total fucking cunt” for trying to steal Gregory — eliciting a wide-eyed stare from Mr. Eddie that mimics the audience's reaction perfectly. 

“I thought you were going to call her a bitch,” he says. “No, I didn't feel that was strong enough,” Janine replies. “Bitch can be a very fine dog. That is not what this woman is.” Hell yeah, Quinta. Way to make the most of your uncensored platform.

With “Sunny” free to be “Sunny” again and “Abbott” seizing its rare shot at uncensored comedy, “The Gang Fucks Up Abbott Elementary” is a deft approach to closing out an unusual — and unusually successful — crossover event. If you knew it was coming, Sunny's Version makes for a remarkable payoff to Abbott's introduction, and if you didn't — but let's face it: everyone knew about Sunny's Version except me — it's a helluva way to kick off Season 17, proving once again that TV's longest-running live-action sitcom is still full of surprises.

“It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” premieres Wednesday, July 9 on FXX. New episodes will be released weekly and available to stream on Hulu the day after they premiere.

	After spending over a decade as a plus one to Mario's many parties and sports outings, Donkey Kong is back to leading star status with the upcoming Switch 2 title, Donkey Kong Bananza (out July 17). It's a big deal for a few reasons: not only is it the first 3D entry in the franchise since 1999's Donkey Kong 64, it's also the first time ever that DK himself is headlining a launch title for a new generation of Nintendo hardware.


	With that, there's plenty of weight on the ape's shoulders, but the developers at Nintendo are confident that DK is up to the task. Created by the internal team that previously worked on 2017's Super Mario Odyssey — both one of the original Switch's best games and an all-timer in the Mario catalog — and sporting a fresh redesign of the character, Donkey Kong Bananza aims to live up to the pedigree of both Nintendo franchises. And by all accounts, it's swinging in the right direction.


	But what goes into reimagining Donkey Kong for a modern generation? Rolling Stone recently spoke with the game's developers to discuss Kong's new look, bringing back Pauline, and the complex process of designing the perfect feeling punch. 

	











	The first thing players will notice upon booting up Donkey Kong Bananza is that its titular ape looks pretty different. Although DK has sported multiple styles before (and the name's been used for different characters entirely), his core aesthetic has remained mostly the same since the series' first reboot in 1994's Donkey Kong Country.

	











	While his grandfather Cranky Kong went fully nude in the 1981 arcade classic, and his dad (DK Jr.) sported a white unitard, Donkey Kong III has the series' most recognizable look. Wearing a now-iconic red tie and less cartoonish design with more angular and mischievous features, DKC's version of Kong has been a staple for over 30 years.


	But now he's received an overhaul. The new version of DK retains the red tie but can also rock a sweet pair of overalls (he's a working man after all), and has a more expressive, goofier veneer on full display.

	When designing a new take on the storied character, the developers wanted to ensure that they paid respect to the long history of the character, which dates to the earliest days on Nintendo games. “One thing we knew is that we wanted to be very sensitive to the original image of the creator, Mr. Miyamoto, for this character,” says producer Kenta Motokura. “But we also wanted to pull out some unique features. You know, he's sort of a fun and goofy character at times, too.”


	But it's not just DK creator Shigeru Miyamoto's original vision that informed the new aesthetic. The developers had to take into account the perspective of multiple generations of fans to find the sweet spot. “Because this is such a long history for the Donkey Kong series, I really feel that everyone brings their own feelings of what Donkey Kong is to them,” Motokura says. “So, what we really wanted to express in this more recent design of Donkey Kong is all of those different associations, all of those feelings that people have with the character over its long history to come out in its appearance in this new design.”


	One key aspect that more recent fans of the Donkey Kong Country series might not think about is the fact that DK himself might live on a jungle island, but he also coexists and interacts with different cultures and species. After all, the first DK saw Mario scaling an urban construction site to save his girlfriend, Pauline. “Another place that I would say we took inspiration from — the arcade version of Donkey Kong — in this case, was just in noticing that this was a world inhabited both by humans and by Kongs.”

	And while the team debated on how much of the human world and more Donkey Kong Country-specific wilderness to include, one character addition was non-negotiable for Motokura: “One thing I wanted to make sure we definitely included was Cranky Kong. Maybe it's just because I'm a fan, personally, but I wanted to make sure he was included.”

	











	While Donkey Kong games have genre hopped over the years, from the bread-and-butter platformers to rhythm games (and even a math-based edutainment), the core appeal is clear: it's all about action.


	But Donkey Kong's idea of action is different from, say, Mario's. And although the developers had previously found ways to make Super Mario Odyssey shine through its protagonists acrobatics, according to the game's director, Kazuya Takahashi, Bananza required something very different.


	“Super Mario Odyssey and Donkey Kong Bananza both have this very large play area where you are experiencing a lot of platform-based gameplay. Now, with that premise in place, I will say that one big difference is that Donkey Kong Bananza takes, as its core gameplay, this theme of destruction,” Takahashi says. “And we want to use that to allow the player to destroy an area and [find] an interesting element, and then destroy a little bit more, and find another — so that there is a continuity of destruction in that gameplay that leads them to new play experiences.”


	Like Odyssey, Bananza's environment is made up of dozens of sprawling levels that are all fully explorable for secrets, challenges, and collectibles. But unlike Mario, whose main mode of action is jumping, DK interacts with the world by using his fists. Punching serves as the game's primary verb, allowing DK to just knock out foes, but explore the densely packed terrain by tearing through the earth itself like a primate excavator.


	Pretty much everything in game is discovered by tearing up the terrain, but that also presented its own challenges. Once underground, how would players be able to see what they're pummeling?


	“One thing we hit on during development was the fact that we would need an underground camera, something that worked a little bit differently, because you're digging, you're going down, and you're going to have parts of your periphery that would normally block a camera view,” Takahashi says. “But we wanted the player to still be able to look around, so we needed some tech breakthroughs in order to make that happen.”


	But part of seeing what's being destroyed is also knowing how the various pieces are reacting to damage, or in many cases, interacting with each other. “Now, we're talking mostly about level design, but I also want to give a shout out to the programmers, because I think they had quite a difficult challenge ahead of them as well,” Motokura says. “From their perspective, we had this idea of how we wanted the levels to work, but the first thing we needed was a system to make those kinds of levels; we needed the tools.”

	











	To bring the world of Bananza to life, the developers focused on utilizing voxel art for all its destructible bits. Think of voxels as three-dimensional representations of matter, akin to pixels but bigger. The blocky characters and universe of Minecraft is all built of voxels, as are the levels of classic games like Q*bert. Here, they make up the debris unearthed and thrown about — from chunks of sand or dirt to globs of lava and snow.


	Whenever players punch a wall of dirt, it will gloriously explode into hundreds of little voxel chunks; materials themselves can also be ripped up to throw or ride on like a surfboard. For many puzzle-solving sections, it's essential to think about how different materials can be combined to change the environment.


	“Every time you get to a new layer of the game, you also have the opportunity to encounter new voxel types and see the way that they interact with one another,” Takahashi says. “For example, if you talk about an icy biome in the game, it wasn't just because we wanted there to be somewhere in the game that was cold. It was really the interactions of the voxels that we're thinking about. What if you had lava voxels in this icy world? How would they interact with different parts of it? And that leads to lots of new discoveries.”


	While creating a complex ecosystem of voxel materials is its own technical feat, one of the most challenging aspects of development came from designing the game's most basic (and frequent) verb: DK's punch. Given that players will be punching nonstop for the duration of the game (seriously, it's hundreds of times per minute), it's essential that the action remain satisfying not just to stave off boredom but consistently find tactile moments of joy that always feels good.


	“It starts with the moment you press the button. What sort of reaction are you seeing from Donkey Kong on screen? That's a place where I spent a lot of time paying attention to,” Motokura explains. “And so that responsiveness was something that [we] considered quite a bit. For example, because this is an action that you repeat many times, it helps to have a little bit of variation. That first punch is going to be a little bit different from the next one. Your successive punches will become faster.”

	











	But there's more to a good punch than the fluidity of its movement or inertia. The main crux of gameplay needs to encompass all the system's overlapping design elements and maximize them for all senses.


	“Another place that comes into play here is the sound design. You need sound effects that are going to be really good to hear each time, because you're going to be hearing them so often. [We] did some really fine adjustments was on the camera shake and the controller rumble that you experience when doing a punch,” Motokura adds. “You consider how many different elements go into making a good punch, and that they all need to be adjusted relative to one another, we can say that the development cost, the time that you spend working on just one punch, could be quite high.”


	Since its reveal, one of the biggest outstanding questions for fans is, “What the hell is going on with Pauline?” Nintendo's original damsel in distress first appeared in the 1981 game, kidnapped by DK for Mario (then called Jumpman) to rescue. Since then, she took a decades-long sabbatical before returning in 2017's Super Mario Odyssey as a woman with much greater agency. As the mayor of the DK-inspired New Donk City, Pauline wasn't just another princess, she was a career woman — multiple careers, actually — serving as a lounge singer who put on fully vocalized musical numbers in the game.


	But the Pauline in Bananza doesn't quite resemble the one we know. For one, she's a child — and seemingly has no idea who Donkey Kong is. Nintendo reps remain mum on exactly how or why Pauline has reverted to kid form, or if this is even the same Pauline. It wouldn't be the first time in the Donkey Kong series that different generations of characters share a name within a family tree.


	But whatever her deal, the chibi-like iteration of Pauline retains her powerful singing voice. In-game, she acts as a sidekick to DK, riding on his shoulders throughout the adventure. Her voice can be used to open sonically sensitive doors or even trigger superpowered transformations for DK. Turns out, her inclusion in the game is what helped shaped many aspects of its design.


	“Certainly, the idea of who Donkey Kong might be traveling with was something that we were thinking about in development from the very beginning,” Motokura says. “The idea of Pauline being on possibility for a traveling companion like this in the game came up, but it really was not until the game specifically called for her as a character that we made the decision.”

	











	“I think that moment was when one of our concept artists created this image of Donkey Kong transforming into a zebra,” Motokura continues. “When we implemented this into the game, we also had the composer make music that was specific to this zebra transformation. Then we started to think, ‘This would be a really interesting time to have Pauline, as a character, singing.' And so, we thought it really made a lot of sense, and we went back to the composer to make that request. That was a key moment where, once we had decided on that, a lot of other pieces started to fall into place.”


	The inclusion of Pauline ultimately reoriented the game to incorporate more musical elements in its mechanics — something the Donkey Kong games have always been known for. “It really starts with Pauline being a singer herself,” Motokura says. “That is what introduced music as a key element to the world and drove a lot of these later design sessions. There is a connection throughout the series with music.”


	To his credit, Donkey Kong himself is no stranger to tagalongs. In the Country series, he's been paired up with his nephew Diddy Kong, among others. But the choice of Pauline adds something unique: She can speak. While previous allies remained nonverbal, relying on high fives and pantomimes, Pauline is a fully voiced character in Bananza, and adds a different vibe to the game, closer in line to famous girl-meets-ape dynamics like those seen in Godzilla vs. Kong or (to an extent) Wreck-It Ralph.

	“Pauline, being a human character, one of the greatest merits of including her is that she speaks in a way that players would be able to understand and can be a little more empathetic or resonant for them,” Takahashi says.


	But that doesn't mean the developers have completely forgotten about DK's best bud. While he was recently teased to make a cameo in Bananza, the baseball-capped simian is still on Takahashi's mind: “Maybe you'll see more of Diddy in the future.”

	Right before the Eagles played the final encore of their two-year, 109-date History of the Eagles tour in July 2015, Glenn Frey walked up to guitarist Bernie Leadon and gave him a big hug. Leadon is the band's founding guitarist, and co-writer of many of their early songs, including “Witchy Woman,” but he left in 1975 following an infamous backstage fight where he poured a beer on Frey's head. And now here they were embracing following their first tour together in 40 years.


	“He said, ‘It's been great having you out here, and it's not over,'” says Leadon. “And then he hugged me again and repeated it. We then walked onstage and played the last encore of the tour.”


	In a better world, this would have marked the beginning of a new chapter of Eagles history where all the original members returned to the group for a series of albums and tours over the past decade. In this world, Frey died from pneumonia just six months later, and founding bassist Randy Meisner died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2023, having not toured with the band since his departure in 1977. Don Henley is now the only OG member still in the fold, though guitarist Joe Walsh and bassist Timothy B. Schmit have both been in the band since the Seventies.

	











	Leadon has been on the sidelines throughout the last decade of Eagles history, but his time on the road with the group between 2013 and 2015 reignited something inside him. He began writing songs, including “Too Many Memories,” releasing next week, for the first time since his 2004 solo LP, Mirror.











			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Too Many Memories” is a tender piano ballad about coming to terms with the past, and finding contentment in the present. “Too many memories of another life,” Leadon sings. “Too many memories/And it cuts like a knife.”


	The lyrics came to Leadon in a sudden flash about three years ago. “I've lived many lifetimes in one lifetime,” he says. “I've lived in five or six different cities in America, on both coasts. I've had a lot of different experiences. And the conclusion to the song is that I need to let it all go and melt like rising fog off the meadow. Ultimately, I do think we do have to let a lot of stuff go. We need to let resentments go.”

	The song was produced by Glyn Johns, whose history with Leadon goes all the way back to the first Eagles album in 1972. They maintained a close friendship after Leadon left the band, and worked together on a series of albums in England. Last July, Johns visited Leadon at his home studio in middle Tennessee. “He was supposed to come and do a John Hiatt record, and it didn't wind up happening,” says Leadon. “And one day he was like, ‘Maybe I'll just come over and we'll do some recordings anyway.' And we did like eight songs in five days.”


	They were joined at the session by bassist Glenn Worf, drummer Greg Morrow, and keyboardist Tony Harrell. “We did it all together, sitting in one room, looking at each other, listening to each other,” says Leadon. “And we did it all analog, which forces you to make decisions. There's a discipline that happens when you record that way.”


	Leadon isn't sure when he'll release the other songs or cobble them together for an album, but he is booked for a rare solo show at Nashville's City Winery on Sept. 12 as part of AmericanaFest. He'll be backed by his recording band at that show and center the set around their new material. But going forward, he hopes to put together a more expansive show.


	“The last Eagles tour that I was on was the History of the Eagles,” he says. “I think I should kind of do history of Bernie, and do some early stuff, some [Flying] Burrito Brothers, and some early Eagles.”


	In the past, Leadon has limited the Eagles songs in his solo sets to ones he wrote and sang, like “Hollywood Waltz,” “Bitter Creek,” and “My Man.” “I'm most comfortable doing things that I sang, but I recognize that the biggest hits are ones I didn't sing,” he says. “But sometimes I created the intro or there's an iconic solo or something.”

	Plans might change, but he's thinking about introducing songs that he's never played outside the Eagles, like “Take It Easy,” into his set. “I'd play the intro,” he says. “But I'd tell the audience ahead of time, ‘Guess what? You're going to sing it, not me.' It would be interesting to try that because I bet half the audience knows the lyrics.


	“I also might say to them,” he continues, “‘Hey, I'm going to do ‘Lyin' Eyes.' But I'm only going to do my part. I'll sing the harmony on the chorus, but I'm not singing lead.' That might be funny for a minute. I don't know if it would be funny for a whole song though.”


	Unlike many of his peers, Leadon hasn't sold his publishing. That means he continues to derive income from their catalog, including the Eagles' compilation Greatest Hits (1971–1975), which remains one of the top-selling albums in music history. “I came up during a point where the idea was you never sell your publishing,” he says. “And then people started doing it. But I'm glad I haven't done it.”

	Leadon lives on a farm in Tennessee these days, and devotes much of his time to family, including four grandchildren. And thanks to the History of the Eagles tour, he now has a solid relationship with Henley, and the other guys in the band. He hasn't been to the Sphere to see his former band in concert, but he's not opposed to checking out a show, and maybe even guesting with them for a song or two, if invited.


	But that's not really where his head is at right now. “I'm just happy that my relationship with the band has been cleaned up,” he says. “We stay in touch. And everything's great, honestly.”

From Jul. 16, a curated and regularly refreshed selection of hit shows and movies from Disney+ and ITVX will be available to viewers on both platforms.

	Lily Ford



Disney and ITV will launch a new, first-of-its-kind initiative to carry each other's streaming services.


	In the form of a promotional selection, the partnership will be billed as a “Taste of ITVX” and a “Taste of Disney+” on their respective platforms, the companies confirmed Thursday.




	From Jul. 16, a curated and regularly refreshed selection of hit shows and movies from Disney+ and ITVX will be available to viewers on both platforms.


	Disney+ customers in the U.K. will be able to stream some of ITV's most popular scripted and unscripted content, including the award-winning Mr Bates vs The Post Office, Spy Among Friends and reality show Love Island.

	At the same time, ITVX viewers will be introduced to a rotating rail of Disney+ shows and movies. Among them will be the first season of FX's The Bear, Lucasfilm's Andor as well as the Emmy-nominated Only Murders in the Building. Reality titles made available include The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives and The Kardashians. “A Taste of Disney+” will be available to all ITVX viewers at no cost, and ad free on ITVX Premium.


	The agreement builds on the “strong, evolving relationship” between Disney and ITV, the companies said. “This wouldn't work if we had the same demographic as ITVX,” said Karl Holmes, general manager, Disney+, EMEA, who caught up with The Hollywood Reporter on the details of the deal as the news was announced.

	











	ITV is the free-to-air home for Disney+'s Renegade Nell and the forthcoming Under the Bridge, whilst ITV Studios is the producer behind hit Disney+ shows including Rivals (Happy Prince), Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes (Etta Pictures in association with KDJ Productions), and the return of Britain's original dating series Blind Date (So TV & Stellify Media).


	“We are proud of this innovative collaboration with ITV, which will allow us to bring Disney+ customers some of the U.K.'s favorite and buzzworthy shows and encourage ITVX viewers to discover some of Disney+'s award-winning series and blockbuster films,” said Joe Earley, president, direct-to-consumer at Disney Entertainment.


	Kevin Lygo, managing director of media and entertainment at ITV, added: “Disney are fantastic partners with a brilliant breadth of content… This mutually beneficial alliance allows us to show our complementary audiences a specially selected collection of titles, regularly updating, that gives a flavour of the range in our respective offerings.


	“For us, this deal means even more great content for viewers on ITVX, and even more opportunity for viewers to find and enjoy our distinctive titles and services.”


	This “bundling” or combining of traditional TV providers with streaming is becoming quite the norm across Europe, with Netflix and TF1, and Amazon and France Televisions partnering in France, and RTL acquiring Sky in Germany.

Love Island is headed to Disney+ UK and The Bear will be served up on ITVX following a landmark deal that will see Disney and ITV carry “Taste of” versions of each other's streaming services.


	As part of the tie-up, ITV viewers will be able to watch Andor, Only Murders in the Building, The Kardashians and The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives via a “Taste of Disney+” rail on ITVX. At the same time, a new “Taste of ITVX” rail will launch on Disney+ with the likes of Mr Bates vs the Post Office, Love Island, A Spy Among Friends and Vera.


	Karl Holmes, Disney+'s General Manager for EMEA, told Deadline he “expects we will announce similar deals with other broadcasters [across EMEA] in the coming months.”

	“We believe there is a mutually beneficial relationship here and we can reach free-to-air audiences in larger markets,” he added. “This will enable ITVX to be successful and vice versa and we can replicate this elsewhere.”


	The partnership is a first-of-its-kind but is selective, with Holmes stressing only a tiny proportion of the Disney+ library will move to ITVX and vice versa – totalling around 70 to 100 hours to ITVX at the start and a little more going the other way. It is forward-facing, however. Disney+ executives have “set out the criteria for what we are prepared to offer” and will sit down monthly to decide which shows to move across, with content moving around every two months to keep things fresh. “We have a pretty regular release schedule so will want to promote new episodes of old shows,” added Holmes, who said most of the marketing of the deal will be “customer marketing or done in-app.” All shows will also remain on ITV and Disney's respective UK services. 


	Selected seasons of Love Island,  including the All Stars spin-off, will be available on Disney+ and Holmes said recent seasons could transfer pretty quickly after they conclude on ITV. “For ITV reality shows, we are talking about an accelerated second window,” he said.


	Disney+ will also become the first American streamer to carry Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the BAFTA-winning drama series starring Toby Jones that generated news headlines for weeks last year when it aired. Another BAFTA-winner, Disney+'s Rivals, which is produced by ITV Studios-owned Happy Prince, will not be available on ITVX as that one “has high awareness across the country already,” according to Holmes.

	











	Holmes said the Disney+ and ITV audience bases are complementary, rattling off stats including that less than 10% of Disney+'s audience is over the age of 55, while for ITV the figure is around 40%.


	“[ITV audiences] think Disney+ is about family and kids so this is a significant opportunity to put The Bear, Only Murders and Andor in front of that group in a contextually relevant place,” he added. “You won't see The Bear or Only Murders across free-to-air services in Europe. The reason we think this works is because our audiences are so complementary. It wouldn't work with the same demo.” 


	 Concurring, Kevin Lygo, who runs ITV content, called the deal a “mutually beneficial alliance.”


	Free-to-air VoD players and U.S. streamers will “come closer in the future,” Holmes said, stressing that Disney+ is actively thinking about these partnerships. It has certainly been a summer for these deals. Netflix and France's TF1 struck a “new kind of partnership” last month that will see the former carry channels from the latter, while Amazon and France Télévisions did similarly for France Télévisions' streaming service a couple of weeks later. 


	“There will be lots of different models that achieve a similar outcome,” added Holmes.


	Joe Earley, President, Direct-to-Consumer, Disney Entertainment, said: “We are proud of this innovative collaboration with ITV, which will allow us to bring Disney+ customers some of the UK's favorite and buzzworthy shows and encourage ITVX viewers to discover some of Disney+'s award-winning series and blockbuster films.”


	Disney and ITV have already proved successful bedfellows. ITV Studios produces and sells some of Disney+ UK's biggest shows, including Rivals, Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes and the upcoming Blind Date reboot, while ITV is already the free-to-air home of Disney+'s Renegade Nell and Under the Bridge.


	In terms of advertising, ITV Commercial will sell the advertising against “A Taste of Disney+” on ITVX, while Disney+ will sell the advertising against “A Taste of ITVX” on Disney+ Standard with Ads.

	Dean Cain is not a fan of the direction Hollywood is taking Superman. The actor, who played the superhero on Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman from 1993 to 1997, said he is concerned about James Gunn‘s vision for the character. 


	“How woke is Hollywood going to make this character?” he said in a video interview with TMZ. “How much is Disney going to change their Snow White? Why are they going to change these characters [to] exist for the times? For Superman, it was ‘truth, justice, and the American way.' Well, they dropped that … They came up with ‘truth, justice, and a better tomorrow.' Changing beloved characters I don't think is a great idea.”


	He added, “The ‘American way' is immigrant friendly, tremendously immigrant friendly. But there are rules. You can't come in saying, ‘I want to get rid of all the rules in America, because I want it to be more like Somalia.' Well that doesn't work, because you had to leave Somalia to come here … There have to be limits, because we cant have everybody in the United States. We can't have everybody, society will fail. So there have to be limits.”

	











	Gunn recently told The Times, “Superman is the story of America. An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me, it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.” The interview resulted in a backlash from the far-right, anti-immigrant MAGA set, which apparently includes Cain.

	











	“It's being portrayed as a real negative thing that we want people to follow our immigration laws, which is insane to me,” Cain said. “I feel we are in a bad situation here now because it's being stoked by politicians and by NGOs that have a political agenda. And I think bringing Superman into it, I think that was a mistake by James Gunn to say it's an immigrant thing, and I think it's going to hurt the numbers on the movie.”


	Cain added that initially he “was excited for the film” because it seemed to have a sense of humor that previous Superman movies have lacked.

	“I'm rooting for it to be a success, but I don't like that last political comment,” the actor said. “And I saw Sean Gunn say something about it too, and I know Sean, I like Sean, it's his brother but I just don't know that it's going to be the right. It's not going to take it like Snow White, but I don't think its gonna help the numbers. People really need to be educated on this immigration situation because we are the most immigrant friendly country by far on this planet.”


	James Gunn and members of the Superman cast were asked about the uproar at the Superman premiere in Hollywood in Monday night. Gunn laughed off a question from a Variety reporter, saying, “I think this movie is for everyone. I don't have anything to say to anybody. I'm not here to judge people. I think this is a movie about kindness, and I think that's something everyone can relate to.”


	Sean Gunn, the director's brother, who plays the villain Maxwell Lord, also got a chuckle out of the red-carpet question, but did offer a more blunt response. “My reaction to [the backlash] is that it is exactly what the movie is about. We support our people, you know? We love our immigrants,” he said. “Yes, Superman is an immigrant, and yes, the people that we support in this country are immigrants. And if you don't like that, you're not American. People who say no to immigrants are against the American way.”

	Nathan Fillion, who plays Guy Gardner/Green Lantern, gave the heartiest laugh and the quippiest response, saying, “Aw, somebody needs a hug. It's just a movie, guys.”


	James Gunn's Superman, which stars David Corenswet, arrives in theaters Friday. Rolling Stone commended the film in a review, writing, “It's faint praise, even in the post-MCU era of the genre, to say that Superman is a solid superhero film; the caveat is hiding in plain sight. What Gunn has pulled off is something more complicated, more interesting, and far tougher: He's given us a Superman movie that actually feels like a living, breathing comic book.”

“Too Much” opens on a slew of red flags. The very first shot is of London's Tower Bridge, accompanied by Fergie's 2006 song, “London Bridge.” Walking over said bridge is our lead, Jess (Meg Stalter), whose stylish star turn (zebra-stripe winter coat, star-laden vintage bookbag) is marred by her extraneous voiceover. That's two big warning signs in the opening seconds of Lena Dunham's first TV series since “Camping,” and they're promptly followed up by a third: when Jess imagines herself as the different kinds of women known to thrive in the United Kingdom: Jane Austen-era heroines who are hopelessly in love; hardened police detectives “who use [their] trauma to solve grisly crimes”; and turn-of-the-century sex workers who will go down in the history books as one of Jack the Ripper's victims.

Thankfully, the majority of these storytelling crutches dwindle as “Too Much” settles in. The soundtrack shifts toward lighter indie rock and away from brain-numbing redundancies, while the story treats those imaginary genre sketches like an accidental off-ramp left in the rearview. But the voiceover continues. Not only does it continue, it intensifies, along with the surrounding events. As they slowly swirl into a tornado of personal excess, Jess learns an important fact of perception: One person's red flags may just be flags to someone else — unheeded warnings that, in time, prove to be utterly unnecessary. You can see them and run for shelter, sure, or you can simply see where the breeze takes you.

“Too Much” will certainly inspire a few Netflix subscribers to retreat to the stock solace of “Emily in Paris” or “Nobody Wants This,” but like the algorithmically calculated intro it soon subverts, Dunham's latest pulls off a tricky balancing act: giving audiences what we expect from a TV rom-com, as well as what we don't always get.

The familiar aspects are surprising, if only because Dunham's semi-autobiographical series is from, you know, the creator of “Girls” — a landmark HBO comedy hailed for bucking conventions, expectations, and whatever else you wanted to throw at it. Co-created with her husband, Luis Felber, “Too Much” fits snugly within those confines, following a young Brooklyn producer, Jess, who moves to London and falls in love with an aspiring musician named Felix (Will Sharpe). The premiere episode sets up its love story rather quickly, from Jess' grievous break-up with Zev (Michael Zegen, well-versed with the despised ex as the former Mr. Maisel), who she dated for seven years, to her job opportunity in London, where she'll oversee a commercial directed by an acclaimed yet pretentious filmmaker (a beautifully sleazy Andrew Scott).

Despite her eagerness to embrace life across the pond, Jess can't leave her baggage behind. Shortly before she flees overseas, she breaks into Zev's house in the middle of the night to demand he apologize for their grievous break-up “in blood.” Luckily, she's all talk — Jess has never met an awkward silence she can't fill with an inappropriate comment, even when (as is often the case) she's the one who brought about the initial awkwardness — but that loquacity becomes its own problem. Jess cannot stop talking to Wendy, Zev's model-hot new girlfriend (played by the actual model, Emily Ratajkowski). She hate-watches Wendy's influencer videos about fashion or hears her voice in her head and then slinks off to a bathroom or quiet corner to yell at Wendy in the style of Gen-Z: via video. 

 










Jess' videos (which she posts to a private Instagram feed) form the basis for her aforementioned voiceover. She “talks to Wendy” all the time — at home, at work, when she's out with her friends or in the middle of a date — and she's only getting angrier, despite a pretty good start to her time in London town, from her job to her friends to her love life. Her co-workers conveniently share her tendency to over-share, whether it's Boss (Leo Reich), an absurdly cocky assistant who brags about his “acclaimed PDF novel”; Kim (Janicza Bravo), a narcissist and fellow New Yorker who's so in love with England she claims not to remember her time in the U.S.; and Jonno (Richard E. Grant), Jess' actual boss who throws cocaine-fueled dance parties in Notting Hill — for his employees.

To say they're a like-minded group is an understatement (and their overlapping romantic issues only double down on Dunham's struggle to imagine characters outside her own bubble), but the lively group supports Jess' journey just fine (and Grant is a particular treat, along with Naomi Watts as his desperate housewife). Jess' family, whom she leaves behind in Long Island but who pop in via FaceTime and flashbacks, is also an invaluable treat. Rita Wilson (as Jess' mom, Lois), Rhea Pearlman (Grandma Dottie), and Dunham, as the recently dumped Nora, all make it clear where Jess comes from — and why she should be proud of what she now calls “an intergenerational ‘Grey Gardens' hell of single women.”

 










Better still, on her first night abroad, Jess meets Felix. (Yes, on the first night! My god!) He's performing in a local pub, she likes his music, and idle chat leads to serious feelings. His unflappable composure pairs well with her constant flapping — when she gets extra worked up, Jess tends to wave her arms around — and they bond over their mutual attraction (Dunham addresses any doubts over their shared desirability in a single, pointedly dismissive conversation), senses of humor (they both make each other laugh in moments where only someone who really “gets you” can), and pop culture passions. (Although her indifference toward “Paddington” would be a dealbreaker if not for Felix's personification of Paddington-esque nicecore.)

Sure, Jess has been rightly accused of “giving crazy” and “giving psychotic,” and yes, Felix is technically an unemployed, recovering addict with a troubling amount of ex-girlfriends (who are now “friends”). But like any traditional tale of courtship, their love transcends reason, and Dunham's deft dialogue makes it easy to believe their connection. (She wrote or co-wrote every episode and directed all but one.) The 10-episode limited series is loudly and proudly a piece of genre, conforming to expectations to the extent I knew what would happen before the next half-hour began. But how and why, as always, are vastly more important than what, and once you settle in, it becomes clear the sound structure and familiar story are there to support a character — and creator — whose uninhibited inclinations could upend a less disciplined narrative.

 










Jess, after all, is barely hanging on. When praised by Kim for keeping her composure amid such tumultuous life changes, Jess says, “I'm just trying to do what I can to survive.” Her standard bubbly tone is flattened. Her oft-animated body language comes to a halt. It's a rare moment of blunt, unembellished vulnerability — the only side Jess is reluctant to show others — and it illustrates so much of what makes “Too Much” work: Without Jess' persistent vigor, the “com” in this rom-com would disappear. Without her unusual openness, the “rom” might not foster much feeling. And without Stalter's talent for masking Jess' fears through recklessness — while still lining that recklessness with genuine excitement for the unknown — the series and its central character would be little more than two parts of the same mess.

Instead, Jess yearns to live as she is, sans reproach, whether that bucks the status quo or embraces its comforts, and the same can be said for “Too Much,” an immensely endearing saga that isn't afraid to lead with its big heart. Committing to the conventional and unconventional at once may irk viewers who see the former as a concession made by the latter, just as Jess' titular too-much-ness may put off judgey viewers. The pacing isn't always smooth, and a few character arcs lose their tether to the Earth, but Dunham delivers enough salient insights about self-acceptance and sharp jokes about, well, everything to elevate her third TV series above many of the medium's typical love stories.

 










It's not the “voice of a generation” work some may have been hoping for, but that's not who Dunham set out to be; that was Hannah Horvath, and while the “Girls” star may have plenty of harsh words for the traditional side of her creator's new streaming rom-com, I also think she'd end up savoring more of it than she'd ever admit.

“Too Much” premieres Thursday, July 10 on Netflix. All 10 episodes will be released at once.

It really is amazing to consider the possible lifespan of an entirely fictional character. Setting aside the nearly infinite existence afforded icons like Odysseus and Wile E. Coyote, whose lives are extended with each new generation of fans, even those made-up characters confined to their original era can survive for such an absurd length of time their sheer accumulation of years insists we consider whether they're really, somehow, alive.

Take Dexter Morgan. He's been skulking around since 2004, when Jeff Lindsay wrote “Darkly Dreaming Dexter.” Two years later, he was embodied in the Showtime series “Dexter” by (eventual) seven-time Emmy nominee Michael C. Hall. He thrived there (more or less), concurrently with Lindsay's subsequent novels, until the open-ended series finale in 2013 and the more definitive final novel, “Dexter Is Dead,” in 2015.

Except on TV, Dexter wasn't dead. Not only did he survive his fateful outing at sea, but he also reappeared eight years later in “Dexter: New Blood.” Also created by Clyde Phillips and also airing on Showtime, the revival was more of a redo, a one-off limited series that would give Dexter Morgan the ending the original series couldn't quite provide. And it did! “New Blood's” finale wasn't an all-time ending, but it did the one thing it could to provide closure: Dexter died! Not only did he die, but he was shot in the heart by his own son — a fitting finale for an antihero who loved to bring up how he was “born in blood.”

 










Welp, you're reading this review, so you know how that turned out. Ratings were high, Paramount+ was hungry, and that meant even if Dexter was dead, “Dexter” couldn't be. The franchise's next extension came in the redundant prequel series, “Dexter: Original Sin,” but even that irrelevant entry served a greater purpose: to walk back Dexter's death. Opening after the events of “New Blood” before flashing all the way back to before “Dexter,” “Original Sin” (are you keeping your “Dexters” straight?) teased how the Bay Harbor Butcher would return for one more slice.

Frankly, the “how” doesn't matter — not just for “Original Sin” (which relied on the flash-forward preface to explain how Dexter/Michael C. Hall was narrating his Intro to Mass Murder studies), and not really for “Dexter: Resurrection,” either. The latest improbable yet inescapable sequel series premieres 21 years after Dexter first emerged, and like most Floridians who just reached legal drinking age, there's nothing sober about it. Anyone clearheaded enough to remember every minute of his journey from page to screen (or just from Showtime to Paramount+ with Showtime) wouldn't be able to explain how he survived a bullet to the heart — which was suffered hours from a hospital and left unattended for many onscreen minutes after the blood started to pour from his body — so rather than overwork the point, Phillips just says, “Fuck it.”

 










Technically, what Dexter says is, “I'll take it,” referring to his revived heart, post-surgery. Never mind the operation was so miraculous it would make Dr. Robby look like Dr. Frankenstein; all that matters is Dexter is alive. Again. He's back. He's on the prowl for Bad Men™️, and everything is back to normal. Maybe he can even hang around long enough to give Wile E. Coyote a run for his money.

As staggering as that sentence reads even to me, dear readers, what's next may knock you over (or send your phone flying across the room): “Dexter: Resurrection” may actually be… good? 

OK, thank you for sticking around, and to honor your trust, let me assure you there are plenty of caveats: Only four episodes were screened for critics, so there's plenty of time for “Resurrection” to run afoul. (“Dexter” has a history, after all, of starting strong and fading fast.) The first 40 percent of the “new” series also isn't “good” in the ways that the first four seasons of “Dexter” were good. (Those don't need quotations, for instance.) “Resurrection” retreads plenty of worn territory (including a cameo-heavy opening episode) yet shows little interest in examining the ethical quandaries inherent to Dexter's “code,” let alone the line between sympathizing with a sick man and rooting for his ritualistic bloodshed.

 










Instead, “Resurrection” asks the same question “30 Rock” posed to Liz Lemon: Can Dexter have it all? After a hurried recovery period in his upstate hospital, Dexter heads to New York City, where his son Harrison (Jack Alcott) has moved. He wants to make sure his son is doing OK after murdering his own father (or so Harrison still thinks). Once he sees that the boy has a job (as a lobby boy at The Empire Hotel) and friends (or co-workers who look like friends from afar), he then has to decide whether to stick around and try to be a better dad, or run away and start a new life somewhere else (again).

For now, at least, the answer is given clarity in the form of a curiosity-spiking club for serial killers. Teased over the first few episodes by watching a sleek Uma Thurman (who goes unnamed long enough for you to accept it's the actual Uma Thurman) deliver messages via breaking-and-entering and breaking a man's face, the biggest hook in “Resurrections” is billionaire Leon Prater (Peter Dinklage) and his dinner parties for sickos. I don't want to give too much away, but Dexter's fascination with Prater's assembled gang of fellow assassins is hard to resist: Each psycho killer — including Mia, aka “Lady Vengeance” (Krysten Ritter), Lowell “The Tattoo Collector” (Neil Patrick Harris), and Al “Rapunzel” (Eric Stonestreet) — piques Dexter's interest in different ways, even if he tells himself he's only attending Prater's get-togethers to gather names for his kill list. 

 










In addition to the silly fun offered by these comical recurring characters, “Resurrection” also revives Dexter's sense of humor. The dilemma about his son provides the bare minimum of drama to chew on, allowing Dexter's focus to shift toward playful topics like his new cold-blooded buddies and the peculiar nature of his new playground, New York City. Dexter stares blankly at the parking signs telling him when he can and cannot leave his car unattended. He sneers at a little boy stealing all the pancakes from his hotel's breakfast buffet. He's proud of his first rating as a UrCar driver — “three out of five stars, not bad” — until a fellow chauffeur informs him a score that low could cost him his gig.

Yes, Dexter is a rideshare driver now, and you know what? It's kind of great! OK, good, not great, like the rest of “Resurrection,” but those little flourishes — the new setting, the old humor, the new killers (who are just goofy enough to evoke the excellent killers of old) — are enough of a hook to reward anyone still eager to engage with their favorite aughts era mass murderer. It may not be enough to sustain an ongoing series, but Dexter's new lease on life may actually be worth waking the dead.

“Dexter: Resurrection” premieres Friday, July 11 on Paramount+ with Showtime. Two episodes will be released initially, followed by one per week through the finale on September 5.

"I can't afford the luxury of getting that emotional right now," Parton shared on Khloé Kardashian's Khloé in Wonder Land podcast.

	“My husband passed away three months ago… Several things I've wanted to start, but I can't do it. I will later, but I'm just coming up with such wonderful, beautiful ideas. But I think I won't finish it.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Parton continued, “I can't do it right now because I've got so many other things that I can't afford the luxury of getting that emotional right now. So there are times like that, things like that that will start here a little bit, but I'll write something else, though, if it comes. So I'm just putting that all on hold.”


	Parton also spoke passionately about her lifelong love for songwriting, calling it her “joy” despite being her career. “It happens just to be my job, but it is also my joy,” she said.


	Dean passed away in March at age 82. The couple shared one of music's most enduring love stories, having first met outside a Nashville laundromat the day Parton arrived in the city to pursue her dreams. They married two years later and stayed together for more than six decades.

	











	“Carl and I spent many wonderful years together,” Parton wrote on social media following his death. “Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy.”


	Despite the hiatus, Parton has stayed busy with projects including her Dolly: An Original Musical and various philanthropic ventures. Still, she made it clear that when the time is right, her pen will find its way back to paper.


	“Everything begins with a story or a song… I think that's one of the reasons I love to write, because I feel like I'm so connected to God right then,” she said.

When the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced the first nominees for the 52nd annual Daytime Emmys on July 9, 2025, the only HGTV that received a nomination in the Outstanding Instructional/How-To Program category was “Married to Real Estate,” starring Egypt Sherrod and Mike Jackson. 

Ironically, the married Atlanta couple and their series have been in the headlines a great deal since late June, when they announced that their show had been canceled after four seasons. Many fans have been up in arms over the news, as well as announcements from the stars of four other shows since mid-June that their series have also been cut. 

Late on July 9, Sherrod and Jackson posted a video about the news of their Emmy nomination, writing in the caption, “The show wrapped. We packed up, said our thank-yous, and started plotting our next move, with gratitude in our hearts. Then the universe hit us with an Emmy nomination. 😏💥”

The caption continued, “Apparently, Married to Real Estate is still making noise—even without new episodes. We're deeply honored, wildly grateful, and just bold enough to say: yeah, we're gonna celebrate this one. 🥂 Huge love to the Academy, our phenomenal crew, and everyone who tuned in.”

A post shared by Egypt Sherrod (@egyptsherrod)

The 2025 Emmy nominations were for shows that aired between January 1 and December 31, 2024, according to Deadline. The judging period took place from May 22 to June 9, before Sherrod and Jackson learned — upon returning home from a family vacation in mid-June — that their show had been canceled. They shared the news with their fans via social media on June 24. 

“Y'all are not gonna believe what we just heard,” Jackson began the video. “We just got some unexpected news. You wanna tell what the news was?” 

Sherrod then laughed, “Well, apparently, we shouldn't go away on vacation anymore. We go away on vacation, and we come back and we always get something unexpected. In this case it was good! We were just coming back from picking Kendall up from sleepaway camp in Florida and we stopped at the movie theater. On the way out, Mike gets a text.” 

“Very interesting text,” he interjected, and she added, “And my phone starts ping, ping, pinging! But he reads the text first.” 

“So I read the text,” Jackson recalled, “and it says, ‘Hey, congratulations, you have been nominated for an Emmy.' An Emmy, y'all! ‘Married to Real Estate' has been nominated for an Emmy!” 

Giggling, Sherrod said, “I'm sorry, I'm sorry, we might be the first show to get nominated after we got canceled! Like, what!?” 

The couple shared how grateful they're feeling and Sherrod added, “Isn't this wild? All I could do was laugh all the way home 'cause the irony!” 

Within 15 minutes of their posting, nearly 10,000 fans had already liked Sherrod and Jackson's video, with hundreds flooding the comment section with words of celebration, with some clearly hopeful it would cause HGTV execs to change their minds. 

One wrote, “Canceling an Emmy nominated show is nuts! 🤷🏾‍♀️💯🤏🏾”

Someone else commented, “The way I just chuckled at the irony and how we KNOW how God shows off and out tickles me!😆 ijs So deserving!! Congratulations to yall and the crew! GOD DID!!!🎼🔥🎉”

Another supporter wrote, “Yes fam! That's right! That's exactly how God does it! I'm spreading the word! Get that Emmy dress Sis! ⭐️ #emmyloading …”

Brian Kleinschmidt of “100 Day Dream Home,” whom the couple just visited with in Florida, chimed in, “Much respect!”

The Daytime Emmys ceremony will take place in Pasadena, California, on October 17. “Married to Real Estate” is up against Roku's “Dime Como Hacerlo,” BUYtv's “The Fixers,” Magnolia Network's “Fixer Upper: The Lakehouse (which also aired on HGTV), Amazon Prime Video's “Going Home with Tyler Cameron,” and Roku's “Martha Gardens.” 

In 2024, two HGTV shows were nominated for the Daytime Emmys — Dave and Jenny Marrs' “Fixer to Fabulous” and Alison Victoria's “Windy City Rehab.” The category's winner was Netflix's “Hack My Home.”

[Editor's note: The A.V. Club will return to recap this season's fourth episode on July 23.]    

Thank God, the Paddy's Pub gang is back. It's not just that It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia has been on for two decades and starting its 17th season (three more than the previous record holder for live-action sitcoms, the polar opposite The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet), it's that it's still extremely funny. Sure, there have been stretches over the last few years in which the writing has shown its age, but that's certainly not the case with the two-episode premiere, “The Gang F***s Up Abbott Elementary” & “Frank is in a Coma.” It's smart to waste no time completing the crossover that began with Abbott Elementary‘s January episode, and even smarter to quickly get back to what fans love about Sunny's consistently hysterical character beats. Well-paced, unpredictable, and, most importantly, still comical, it's nice to be in Sunny days again.

The season premiere offers the Sunny mirror image of Abbott's “Volunteers,” using a story about unseen footage from the gang's court-mandated community service at the Philly elementary school to detail exactly what went wrong that day. The initial impression that this might be more of an AE episode vibe than a Sunny one gets annihilated when Quinta Brunson's Janine calls Dee a “total f**king c*nt.” Take that, prudes at ABC. One of the great joys of this half-hour is getting to see AE performers like Brunson, Tyler James Williams, Janelle James, and Lisa Ann Walter play in a darker vein of humor, all of them seemingly invigorated by taking off a few off the guard rails that are understandably in place on broadcast TV.

Of course, episode writers Charlie Day, Rob McElhenney, and Keyonna Taylor know we're here for the Paddy's Pub gang, all of whom try to get as much as possible out of their time at Abbott. Is Charlie just there to learn how to read? Of course not. As Dee leans into her jealous side and tries to take down Janine, Charlie & Mac work on recruiting kids in a “reverse Blind Side” to their local school. It's all ridiculously in tune with Charlie, Mac, Dee, Dennis, and Frank, people who are constantly looking for a way to maximize the profit on their time and failing miserably, even while volunteering at an inner-city school. Much has been written about the bone-deep selfishness of this quintet, but it's almost refreshing to see how transparent they are about it in an era of two-faced grifters. They were almost ahead of their time in their desire to outwardly use every interaction as a road to improve their situations, and the humor of the show often comes from how they fall on their face every time that they attempt anything outside of their comfortable ruts.

In the case of the premiere, it culminates with Dennis spearheading a new version of Billy Joel's “We Didn't Start the Fire,” using Abbott teachers to sing about extremely un-timely topics like Guantanamo and Kaepernick—it's amazing how the gang's idea of current events is always a few years behind reality, even if they do get in a nice Ozempic dig. When Dennis learns that Fall Out Boy did their update to the Storm Front banger, the latest plan collapses, sending them back to a grift that Frank suggested from the very beginning: Ripping out the copper wiring. “The Gang F**ks Up Abbott Elementary” is a reminder that anyone who thinks that the writing on It's Always Sunny is about misanthropes behaving badly isn't paying enough attention. Yes, this is a show about grifters, but it's also about people too dumb to do too much damage with their cons to anyone but themselves. Even the conclusion of the episode works in everyone's favor, as the school was going to have to replace the copper anyway. 

The follow-up is even better. After Frank goes into a coma while watching Netflix's Is It Cake?, Dee is forced to stay by his bedside in case his heartbeat falls below 50 BPM. As she goes through the cycles of grief, the guys find their way to a Liberty Ball to raise capital to turn Paddy's Pub into “Starbucks for dive bars,” but end up mistaken for the help before finding their way to a crack house. In the end, Frank wasn't actually in a coma. He turned into a sweet treat himself to prove “the magic of cake technology.” Amazing. This installment works from a classic Sunny template in which the gang cuts Dee out of a possible endeavor only to f*ck it up themselves. It also works from the comic vein in which the gang blames someone else for their failures, usually Frank, who gets trashed this episode for not elevating them like they intended when they allowed him into their idiot club so many years ago.

As their failed benefactor lies in a supposed coma, Charlie, Mac, and Dennis take the Liberty Ball invitation that Dee found in the trash and try to find an investor. At first, they just end up working for the business fat cats around them as waiters, and then as bathroom attendants. The guys regularly talk about breaking out of their patterns but then dive right back into them, more comfortable getting a VIP a fresh bottle of wine than actually being one of them. A window to a brighter future opens in the form of a high-strung power player named Simon (a brilliant Alex Wolff, channeling the kind of spoiled bro-idiot he's certainly met at some Hollywood parties). He wins them over by saying, “I really hope your father dies,” and giving them some of his cocaine. Before you know it, they're snorting meth at another party before landing in a final location that Cricket probably knows well—the kind of place with mattresses on the floor and where “Narcan” is the password. After all, “Frank knew that galas were gateways to crack houses.”

	After making his Broadway debut last year, Joe Locke is taking his performing prowess to London's West End, where he will star in Clarkston, Samuel D. Hunter's play about two 20-something men from opposite ends of the U.S. who meet while working at a Costco in small-town Washington.


	“I'm thrilled to be making my West End debut in Clarkston,” the actor said in a statement, per Playbill. “Samuel D. Hunter's writing is so deeply human and honest that I immediately connected with the play when I read it. I can't wait to bring this beautiful story to life and share it with audiences in London.”

	The play, which has been previously staged stateside beginning in Dallas in 2015, will mark its inaugural U.K. showing later this fall, after Locke has wrapped filming on Netflix‘s Heartstopper film, which serves as a closer to the popular LGBTQ+ rom-dramedy YA series.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Locke, who is also known for his turn in Disney+'s Agatha All Along, told BBC News he was “so excited” for the opportunity, saying the role reflects his desire to depict “flawed characters … who have a bit of bite.”


	Appearing opposite Joe Locke are Ruaridh Mollica and Sophie Melville. Dates and a venue are yet to be announced, and Jack Serio will serve as director.


	A playwright with his star on the rise, Hunter is best known for his 2012 play The Whale, which was adapted to the silver screen by Darren Aronofsky in 2022. The film, starring Brendan Fraser, Hong Chau and Sadie Sink, won two Oscars, including Fraser's Best Actor win.


	“I couldn't be more excited to bring Clarkston to London audiences, especially with this phenomenal cast and creative team,” Hunter added in a statement. “I've always adored the U.K.'s theatre scene, so being able to share this play with audiences in the West End is truly a dream come true. This play draws from themes of the vast and isolated American West and the colonial past of the United States, but it's fundamentally a story about love and friendship in the midst of an unknown future, which is a pretty universal story these days.”

	











Clarkston opens with the addition of a new hire Jake (Locke), a young gay man originally from Connecticut, who moves west after a diagnosis of degenerative neurological condition Huntington's disease. Meanwhile, Chris (Mollica) has a strained relationship with his drug addict mother (Melville), and the play unfolds as the two men develop a deep connection to each other.


	“Everyone is flawed in some ways. And I've been lucky enough in my career so far to play a few flawed characters, and Jake is no different to that. And that's the fun bit, the meaty bit, getting to know these characters — they're good and they're bad,” Locke shared with BBC.


	In early 2024, Locke joined the cast of the Tony-nominated revival of the hit Stephen Sondheim-Hugh Wheeler musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street on Broadway, taking over the role of Tobias Ragg from Gaten Matarazzo.


	“I'm from the Isle of Man,” Locke explained to BBC, “and my birthday present every year was a trip to London with my mum to watch a few shows, so it's very full circle to bring my mum to my press night to my West End debut, it's going to be very exciting.”


	Speaking to the Heartstopper movie, currently in production, Locke said “it's going great, we're almost two thirds of the way through shooting now, and everything, touch wood, is going well. We're having a great time doing it, it's a really nice closing chapter of the story.”

Joe, should visit Clarkston, WA after wrapping up Heartstopper and before the play begins. I think he would like that part of rural America and he can better reflect what his character is going through and where he's from. It's a nice area.

In a keynote at the UN's AI for Good summit, Michael Nash discussed market-based solutions to AI issues, copyright and current collaborations.

Senior Writer


Universal Music Group's chief digital officer, Michael Nash, took the stage at the United Nations' AI for Good summit in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday (July 8) to discuss how the music industry — and UMG more specifically — is approaching generative AI.


	“Universal's strategy on AI is based on a simple philosophy: Center the conversation on artists, defend their rights and interests, and from that foundation, forge new commercial and creative opportunities,” Nash said. 


	Also during his talk, Nash stressed the position that “copyright is not the enemy of innovation” and that “market-based solutions are the answer” to the challenges AI poses to intellectual property-based industries like music. “If you don't claim a seat at the dinner table, you might wind up on the menu,” he warned.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Nash's comments at the summit come just weeks after it was reported that UMG — along with fellow major music companies Warner Music Group and Sony Music — were in talks with top AI music firms Suno and Udio to create an AI music licensing structure. Should that happen, it's expected that it would settle the majors' current blockbuster lawsuit against the AI companies. In that lawsuit, filed in June 2024, the majors alleged that Suno and Udio were engaged in the copyright infringement of their sound recordings on “an almost unimaginable scale.”


	Read a transcript of Nash's keynote speech below:


Good evening. Thanks for that kind intro, Don. I'm Michael Nash, the Chief Digital Officer of Universal Music, where I've led digital strategy for the past decade.


It's an honor to have this opportunity to highlight why music matters greatly to this dialog about “AI for Good.”


To better understand music's importance to this conversation… Let's start with the importance of music.


You will not be surprised to hear an executive from Universal Music say, as a starting point, “Music is Universal.”


Music engages a massive global audience.


It's the soundtrack of life on this planet.


About half the world's population is actively engaged.


In fact, music is the most popular form of entertainment in dozens of developed countries, where up to 90% of adults listen to music on a monthly basis…


…With internet-enabled fans spending over 20 hours a week on average listening to music.


Even more important than these engagement stats…


Music drives culture worldwide. As it has for centuries.


Comprehensive scientific research definitively concludes that music is integral to every society ever studied and pervades social life the world over…


Proving out the immortal words of Longfellow:


“Music is the universal language of humankind.”


But music is not just a universal language…


It is a universal force for good…bringing connection, expression, communion and enrichment to lives in every corner of the world.


Beyond music's fundamental role in culture…We are gaining a better understanding of how music promotes health and wellbeing.


Neuroscientific revelations have established how music significantly influences cognitive, emotional and physical functions of the brain. Backed by this growing body of research, music is now being deployed in advanced therapeutic and breakthrough medical applications.


This builds on what we've always known: that music is a powerful force for good in the minds, hearts and lives of people everywhere.


With this understanding of music's greater purpose, let's move into the conversation about technological disruption.


For well over a century, since the advent of sound reproduction and radio, music has been situated on the cutting edge of tech transformation…


Just one of many examples—this one quite relevant to the implications of AI—Peter Gabriel's pioneering incorporation of digital synthesizers in the 1980s… (Play)


As the next major milestone in this journey of technological disruption and transformation, we believe AI can be instrumental to the future of music.


However, it's critical to emphasize that AI will realize its potential to transform the future of music through the voices and visions of artists…


Yes, the scope of technological disruption may be unprecedented with AI, but that doesn't change a fundamental truth:


It's artists who've always shaped global culture. (Mosaic Transition Plays)


And that's why Universal's strategy on AI is based on a simple philosophy: Center the conversation on artists…


…defend their rights and interests….


…and from that foundation, forge new commercial and creative opportunities.


To maximize creative collaboration with technology, you must start from a foundation built on copyright and associated rights.


Of course it's essential that we energetically defend our artists' interests. You can't forge new business models with “non-rights.” If you don't claim a seat at the dinner table, you might wind up on the menu.


Working from our philosophy, we believe that market-based solutions are the answer.


We have enabled numerous entrepreneurs…and are working with a wide range of major tech platforms…in announced partnerships and with significant licensing deals in the works.


The anti-copyright premise of some AI industry commentators is deeply flawed.


Copyright is not the enemy of innovation.


Quite the opposite: Media/Tech convergence predicated on respect for copyright has produced a multi-trillion-euro economy….


…And that started with Apple: marrying iPod with iTunes in 2003 as a critical early step, embracing licensed music, to create the first trillion-dollar company.


Jobs wrote the blueprint. Now Google, Amazon, Meta and others are following in various ways with their own music and content strategies. Tech collaboration with the creative community, respecting the value of artists' work and harnessing their innovation, has produced enormous cultural and economic benefit.


Lessons learned in the first quarter of this century are why we believe the future of AI Music will be realized by unlocking new creative collaborations.


The future of AI music will not be the regurgitation of derivative knock offs of artists' music to cannibalize their current marketplace. Who wants that? It will be activated by putting new tools in the hands of artists so they can expand the market and create new experiences for their fans in partnership with technologists. This is how AI will promote innovation and advance culture.


Let's look at some examples of these collaborations and how they're being fostered.


An important foundation in successful collaboration is being promoted by creative community alliances…and Universal has taken a very active role.


Just one of many examples: We helped launch the Human Artistry Campaign and articulate its principles. This global initiative was formed in 2023 to protect creators' rights in the age of AI and now has more than 170 supporting organizations from over 40 countries.


We're backing many such industry and creative community initiatives you see referenced here.


On the business development front, Universal is forging the future of AI Music with leading innovators.


To highlight just a few of our active partnerships…


• Soundlabs, Hooky and Supertone are each employing “voice clone” AI technology enabling artists to perform in multiple languages so their audiences can hear them singing in the fans' native tongues for the first time.


• KLAY Vision is developing exciting new models leveraging Generative AI for hyper personalization and deeper fan engagement.


• ProRata is making important output attribution advancements to enable new Gen AI business models.


Let's look at some exemplary artist projects.


We were thrilled to release “Now And Then,” the last song from The Beatles – written and sung by John Lennon almost 50 years ago. Using next generation AI source separation technology, Lennon's voice was excavated from a cassette recording that had been completely unusable for decades, waiting for this moment in the evolution of AI to arrive.


In February of this year, “Now and Then” won the Grammy for “Best Rock Performance,” the first time any recording utilizing AI technology has been so honored in a major category.


We recently joined forces with Apple to introduce a new category called “Sound Therapy” powered by a team of scientists, engineers and producers at Sollos, Universal's music health division.

Rap beef veterans Fat Joe and Jada discuss the Toronto rapper's latest single on their podcast.


													By
												

	Angel Diaz



Jadakiss has some news for Drake.


	During a recent episode of his Joe and Jada podcast with Fat Joe, the two legends talked about the Toronto rapper's latest single “What Did I Miss?,” in which he speaks on the relationships that have changed since he got into a historic battle with Kendrick Lamar.


	“He got a taste of the rap industry, man,” said Kiss. “They flip on you emphatically. … They flip. … Rappers, the game, executives, everybody you could think of, store owners. Yeah, they f—ing flip. That's part of this. That's the game we in.”


	Joe added, “I didn't understand that sh–.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Prior to Jada's commentary, Joe said he enjoyed the track and mentioned Drake being tied with Michael Jackson for fourth place on the most Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s list with 13 apiece.


	“I felt like the new track was really dope,” said Joe. “I listened to it a couple of times and you know he's one No. 1 away from Michael Jackson's record [Editor's note: They're tied], and I think the soul of Michael Jackson is fighting that sh– 'cause every time he put out one you think it's going to take that joint, just it back down.”


	Crack and Kiss know a little something about rap beef. The two have had notable run-ins with the likes of Jay-Z and 50 Cent over the years, and have since reconciled with both of them, so there still might be hope for Drizzy and Dot to squash things eventually, if you know anything about the history of Joe and Jada's respective battles with Hov and Fif.

	











	There's no official release date for Drake's new album, but we know that its called Iceman and that it's coming soon.

News of LiAngelo Ball's divorce broke just before he sat down with Billboard News on Wednesday.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Shortly after news broke that GELO and Rashida Nicole were divorcing only six months after going public as a couple, the basketball player-turned-rapper sat down with Billboard News and addressed the Internet's reaction to the headlines.


	“When people conversate about my personal life, it don't touch me or bother me too much,” GELO (real name: LiAngelo Ball) tells Billboard News. “Like I see it, of course, because you know, everybody got a phone, but it don't rub me the wrong way or nothing because nobody really go [through] what I go through every day. You not me, for real. So it don't mean sh–, for real.”

	











	The “Tweaker” rapper says he only cares about what his friends and family have to say, not strangers online. “I don't even know half the people saying anything,” he tells Billboard. “And everybody I know rock with me. Sh–, there it is. I be feeling good when I step out. Got love.”


	Ball and Nicole went public back in February, when the influencer and podcaster sat courtside for GELO's “Tweaker” performance at the 2025 NBA All-Star Game. While TMZ — who broke the divorce news on Wednesday — are unsure when Ball and Nicole were married, their cameras did catch the couple leaving a SoCal courthouse wearing all-white, also in February. The couple was last spotted out at June 9's BET Awards.

	











	Last month, Nicole revealed that she's expecting a baby — which would be the couple's first child together, but Nicole's second and Ball's third. “Wish I had all the right words to describe this journey, but I guess if I had to define it, all I can truly say is: I'm grateful, terrified, anxious, nauseous, HANGRY … all of thee above,” she wrote on Instagram next to photos of her growing baby bump. “As a teen mom, I was always hesitant about going thru pregnancy and parenthood again. (Iykyk) I want to thank my daughter for being here for me during this process, always demonstrating unconditional LOVE & reassuring me that, ‘Everything is alright!' And for now…I choose to protect my peace and this beautiful energy.”


	Ball has two other children — LaVelo and LaNiyah — with his ex Nikki Mudarris.


	In January, GELO signed with Def Jam and released his breakout rap smash “Tweaker,” which became a top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 (peaking at No. 29), topped the Rhythmic Airplay chart, and had a remix featuring Lil Wayne released on Feb. 7. His debut album, League of My Own, is due July 18.

Kendrick Lamar‘s monumental career and his cultural impact will soon be a topic of discussion and study at Temple University.


	A course titled, “Kendrick Lamar and the Morale of M.A.A.D City,” will be available to all students during the Fall 2025 semester, with Timothy Welbeck, a professor for the Department of Africology and African American Studies and the Director for the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University, at the helm. 


	“Kendrick Lamar is one of the defining voices of his generation, and in many ways, both his art and life is reflective of the Black experience in many telling ways,” Welbeck told NBC10, which first shared the news. “Being able to discuss his art in the environment that helps lead him into being the man that he is in a lot of ways can tell you him as an individual, but can also talk about the journey's towards self-actualization particularly as it is related to the Black experience.”


	In previous years, the work of Tupac, Beyoncé, and Jay-Z have all been classes offered at the university. Welbeck, who has taught at Temple University for 14 years, said he planned the course for nearly a year. Lamar's material, however, has been woven into his past lessons for about a decade. 

	











	“My current department chair was very open to the idea and received it almost immediately,” Welbeck told the outlet. “In a lot of ways, our department at Temple specifically, and Temple more broadly, has embraced the study of hip-hop in academic spaces.”

	This year, Lamar, emerging victorious from a rap war with Drake, delivered a historic Super Bowl halftime performance, swept the Grammys with his chart-topping diss track, won Album of the Year at the BET Awards, and embarked on a National Tour with SZA packed with star power. Welbeck's course will no doubt touch on the rapper's many accomplishments, but he also hopes students will gain a “a deeper appreciation for Lamar, hip-hop culture and how art is a muse in which to convey the components of the Black experiences.” 


	The course, which begins in August, is now open for enrollment. Welbeck said that it “will take a look at various scholarship around the types of urban policies that shift the demographic of Compton and how it helped to shape Kendrick Lamar,” and shared that students will listen to three to four of his albums and plans to invite Lamar's collaborators to speak with students about his career and the music industry.

The head of the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday appeared to nod to conspiracy theories that have swirled around recent extreme weather events, directing people to the agency's website for science-based information on geoengineering and contrails.

In a post on X, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that people “have legitimate questions about contrails and geoengineering, and they deserve straight answers.”

“We're publishing everything EPA knows about these topics on these websites,” he wrote in a press release Thursday that promised “total transparency with the American public.” 

“EPA shares the significant reservations many Americans have when it comes to geoengineering activities," he said.

The new websites offer a variety of information that appears to stick closely to generally accepted definitions and science around geoengineering and the government's ongoing research on contrails. Some sections even debunk the more outlandish claims of government weather control.

“Has large-scale solar geoengineering deployment already happened?” the EPA's new “Frequent Questions” section asks, answering: “No. The U.S. government is not engaged in any form of outdoor solar geoengineering testing (e.g., small-scale experiments designed to study injection technologies) or large-scale deployment (e.g., intentional use of SRM to cool the Earth).” SRM refers to solar radiation modification. 

Severe weather events have hammered parts of the United States  in recent days. In Texas, at least 120 people have died and 173 are still missing after a devastating flood wiped out at least six communities July 4. Four days later, in New Mexico, at least three people died after a flood in Ruidoso, a resort town already susceptible to mudslides and runoff after two catastrophic fires last year. 

Scientifically baseless claims of weather control have become an increasingly common reaction to extreme weather, moving from the fringe and into some mainstream discourse. Many of these claims center on fears of government control of the weather, with some pointing to technologies like cloud seeding, a technique used to increase rain and snowfall. Others offer a vague assertion that whatever is happening to the weather is not natural.

“Fake weather. Fake hurricanes. Fake flooding. Fake. Fake. Fake,” Kandiss Taylor, a Republican congressional candidate in Georgia, said in a July 5 post on X about the Texas flood, now pinned on her page.

The inclusion of contrails, a natural phenomenon from aircraft or rockets, also seemed to point to long-running conspiracy theories about “chemtrails,” which have included repeatedly debunked claims of shadowy programs meant to poison Americans. 

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeated chemtrail misinformation, welcomed Zeldin's move.

“Im so proud of my friend Lee Zeldin and President Donald Trump for their commitment to finally shatter the Deep State Omerta regarding the diabolical mass poisoning of our people, our communities, our waterways and farms, and our purple mountains, majesty,” he wrote in a post on X in reply to Zeldin. 

The EPA resources Zeldin pointed to, however, offered no evidence of a diabolical plot.

The new EPA page on contrails seeks to address “myths and misconceptions that have persisted for decades,” according to the release. The page says that sometimes, chemicals are intentionally “sprayed from aircraft for legitimate purposes like firefighting or farming” and that the “federal government is not aware of there ever being a contrail intentionally formed over the United States for the purpose of geoengineering or weather modification.”

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it is against its policy to comment on statements made by anyone outside the agency. The National Weather Service, the Department of Health and Human Services and the EPA did not immediately respond to NBC News' requests for comment. 

Solar geoengineering activities involve cooling the Earth by reflecting sunlight into space through the dispersal of small particles into the upper atmosphere or by increasing the size and brightness of clouds over the ocean, among other ideas. 

Meteorologist Matthew Cappucci noted that any claims that current geoengineering technologies can cause or worsen severe weather are false.

“The conspiracy theories swarming around on social media have been disappointing, particularly considering elected officials have been pushing them,” he said. “The conspiracies have no scientific basis, and even a shred of basic scientific literacy debunks them.”

Still, claims of weather-control technology, once confined to relatively fringe circles, have gained some traction in the Republican Party. In some states, conservative politicians have passed laws that allude to fringe ideas and seek to ban geoengineering, which is used to counteract the effects of climate change.

After Hurricanes Milton and Helene last year, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., claimed “they can control the weather.” On Saturday, she said she was introducing a bill that “prohibits the injection, release, or dispersion of chemicals or substances into the atmosphere for the express purpose of altering weather, temperature, climate, or sunlight intensity.”

“We must end the dangerous and deadly practice of weather modification and geoengineering,” she wrote. 

Greene added that Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., is a co-sponsor. Burchett has spread similarly bizarre claims about extreme weather. 

In a statement, a spokesperson for Greene said that the congresswoman "has long discussed this issue" and that the bill was not related to the Texas flooding. Burchett's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Following Milton and Helene, the NOAA released a fact sheet in October 2024 to try to debunk “weather modification claims” that swelled after those two storms decimated communities in Florida and North Carolina. In it, the agency said that it “does not fund or participate in cloud seeding or other weather modification projects.” 

Zeldin's nod toward more fringe explanations for extreme weather comes as the Trump administration has cut funding for climate change research and removed the website that hosted the government's climate assessments. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, even as scientists have increasingly found strong evidence connecting the growing severity and frequency of extreme weather to global warming.

Decades of research into weather modification has at times become fodder for conspiracy theorists. 

From 1962 to 1982, NOAA was involved in a project called STORMFURY that sought to determine whether hurricane intensity could be modified. The research was unsuccessful at altering hurricane intensity and was discontinued. NOAA hasn't attempted similar research since, according to the fact sheet.

Cloud seeding is a weather modification technology currently in use. The practice has been around since the 1950s and typically involves spraying silver iodide into clouds to draw water out of the atmosphere and produce extra snow or rain. Currently, cloud seeding programs are primarily used in Western states to boost water supplies, and companies are required to file notices before implementing them.  

“Cloud seeding doesn't make water; it helps clouds in marginal environments to release 5-15% more moisture. But in Texas, there was already 100% humidity, extreme moisture and storms. The clouds didn't need any help,” Cappucci said.

The spread of these claims has coincided with an uptick in threats directed at meteorologists.

While geoengineering is a legitimate scientific endeavor, claims about its ability to control major weather patterns or create severe weather are not grounded in reality. Most geoengineering options are theoretical and untested. Federal researchers have taken only a few small steps toward studying their feasibility, and atmospheric scientists say there is no evidence of any large-scale programs.

Last year in Alameda, California, a small-scale testing project of a form of geoengineering called marine cloud brightening by academic scientists was shut down after community outcry, despite researchers demonstrating that the actions were harmless. 

Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert explained that conspiratorial thinking usually spikes during moments of collective fear and uncertainty, especially during weather events in which people feel powerless. 

“Conspiracy theories offer an emotionally satisfying narrative: They restore a sense of control by framing events as intentional acts by powerful agents rather than random, chaotic phenomena,” Alpert told NBC. “In this sense, ‘someone is doing this to us' feels more tolerable than ‘no one is in control.'”

However, while some view the EPA's move as an act of transparency, others believe it's merely the latest political maneuver to avoid critical environmental issues. 

“Some people have ‘questions' about whether birds are real — will that be your next project?” Rep. Don Beyer D-Va., said in response to Zeldin's Thursday morning post on X teasing the EPA guidelines. “How much taxpayer money will you be spending on this?”

      In 99.999% of journalism I would be on the side of protecting sources cause it's obviously very important and morally commendable. But on this topic, fuck your sources!!!! Let me reiterate. Fuck your sources. Fuck NDAs, oaths, etc..
    


      At what point is it not complicity and gatekeeping to go along with this? If we ever get total disclosure, the next day is a new world. No matter what the truth is, btw. Even if it isn't NHI. If the doors are opened, whatever we find is either going to fundamentally change our place in the universe and our understanding of it or it's going to be a technological and scientific discovery that's been kept hidden from us. In my mind these are the only two options
    


      Both result in an instantly different path forward for humanity. National security, ontological shock, societal uproars, doesn't matter to me  cause for this issue I'm all in letting the cards fall where they may to get the truth. This transcends country and self
    


      I understand peoples families and themselves are probably in danger. I'm positive people have been killed for this issue. But damn, people have and are dying for things that pale in comparison to this. Who knows how many lives the technology we might possess can save?
    


      I think there are enough of these whistleblowers, journalists, ufo personalities that between them they can get together and spill everything. Names, locations, evidence, etc. and do so publicly. Corner them. If I reveal X name and then X is killed, that's all the more proof
    


      If revealing the secrets can somehow lead to helping solve the energy crisis, change the way we travel, change how we move in space, the way we can conduct science experiments, and if NHI is the thing it will also answer one of the oldest questions mankind has ever pondered… I think a few sacrifices and bad journalistic integrity isn't that bad a price to pay

New York City's Walker Hotels is going to the dogs.

The company's Tribeca and Greenwich Village locations have both added a bundle of new services to lure four-legged guests (and their human companions) to stay there. And at the top of that list is a Pup Psychic in Residence.





The wellness package for canines will be available through Aug. 26 and is being done in conjunction with Happy Trails, a NYC doggy day-care facility, and pet food brand Ollie.





The offering, called the Inner Pup Package, runs between $340 and $380 per night at the Walker Hotel Tribeca. Guests at the Walker Hotel Greenwich Village will pay $495 a night. For those rates, your dog will get:





Luxury experiences for dogs are hardly new. Last year, Bark Air took to the sky—an airline that caters to dogs (and their humans) with first-class experiences in a private GulfStream jet. And even typical dog owners spend nearly $2,000 per year on their pooch between food, toys, and treats.




Even with that spend, there's research that says owning a pet can make someone more fiscally responsible (though we're not sure if that applies to people who invest in a pet psychic).

Paranormal Activity, the found footage horror franchise created by Oren Peli in 2007, is set to continue—not with another sequel, but on the West End stage in London. A Paranormal Activity spin-off is coming in the form of a play titled Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage.

Per Variety's report, the play will premiere on December 5, 2025, at the Ambassadors Theatre. It is set to run for 12 weeks, and won't follow the plot of the movies, but it's a new take on the franchise's supernatural horror theme. It will be directed by Felix Barrett, the co-creator of the immersive theater experience Sleep No More, which ran from 2011 to 2025 in New York City. Per the director's comment on the new adaptation:

"I'm so thrilled that 'Paranormal' will have a chance to ensnare and unnerve audiences in London later this year. From seeing the advertising campaign of the film 20 years ago, where you watched cinema audiences leap out of their chairs in horror, I have long wondered how you could recreate that visceral reaction in a theater setting. How do you bring one of the most frightening films to life? How do you break the inherent safety that a plush West End theater offers? It's been an incredible challenge, and we cannot wait to see how London audiences respond."

Let's dive in and check how Rotten Tomatoes' critics feel about the found footage franchise, Paranormal Activity.

A horror play sounds awesome – especially one rooted in Paranormal Activity. As reported by Variety, "the story follows a couple, James and Lou, who move from Chicago to London and discover a haunting presence in their home. So they use a camera to document the unsettling shadow in their midst." Levi Holloway—known for writing Grey House, which starred Tatiana Maslany—is adapting the stage version. He said the following:

"Collaborating with Felix Barrett to create an actual nightmare has been nothing short of a dream. Relishing in a shared language of dread, we've conspired to create something impossible, mixing the familiar with the uncanny, heart with horror. London audiences have a nose for honesty on stage and little patience for anything else. They'll find it here, right alongside all the mischief we've made to trouble their sleep."

Tickets for Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage can already be purchased on the venue's official site.

 At the turn of the century, Hollywood was saturated with horror remakes. There were original horror movies, but they were scarce. The Blair Witch Project had blown up the industry, but the found footage format was still associated with amateur filmmakers. Enter Oren Peli, who had a great idea and a modest budget.

Peli was inspired by the sounds he heard in his new home when he was living by himself. He got a fancy camera and cast two unknown actors in the roles of Katie and Micah. It is rumored that the film was shot in seven days, but it was enough to make Paranormal Activity. At some point, executives (Steven Spielberg among them) thought the film could be reshot with higher production value, but test screenings showed the success of Peli's original approach.

The film became a horror phenomenon and one of cinema's most profitable films. It was successful enough for Peli to reach a deal to produce a sequel, and eventually, oversee an entire horror franchise. Although Paranormal Activity is now taking an unconventional direction with a stage play, it is proof that there's still some juice in the franchise about the evil spirits tormenting an entire bloodline and those who dare to summon them.

The effect of The Blair Witch Project on the found footage genre has led to many trying to capture the same atmosphere and terror of the film.

As is usually the case with gangster tales, the show has several power players, each with a varying degree of influence.

Embeth Davidtz has worked with the very best for decades, and she's been taking notes.

The 'Night at the Museum' franchise is coming back.

Matt Fraser doesn't do 9 to 5s. His schedule? Strictly otherworldly.

After all, for the psychic medium, “I have the spirit world talking to me constantly,” he admitted in a joint interview with wife Alexa Fraser. “You can't turn it off because it's not a job. It's my life. And, you know, souls don't care whether you're feeding your baby, changing a diaper or being called into the next room because a kid is screaming.”

Or, as it turns out, if you're doing an interview with E! News. Because as the parents of sons Royce, 2, and Rowan, 4 months, broke down their new podcast Undeniable Proof, Matt paused to acknowledge my dad, who died in 2019. “Right away, I heard his soul,” Matt revealed. “He tells me you get messages from him. You sense him. And what's so beautiful is I see he's been a guide for you your whole life.”

And skeptics, don't ghost us just yet: There was no Internet sleuthing or last-minute Googling. It's just, well, spirit.

“First of all, what people put online is not the real version of them,” the Don't Wait Till You're Dead author emphasized of why he doesn't do his research, comparing his approach to a jury focused on evidence presented in court. “I don't want to know anything about anybody I'm reading for.”

In fact, admitted Alexa, mid-reading, “he'll actually tell people to stop talking."

Because in Matt's field, knowledge isn't power. Having done readings for stars like Kelly Clarkson and Gloria Estefan, “I want everything I'm hearing to be from the spirit world,” he shared. “Being a psychic medium is all about tuning into the energy around you, tuning into your loved ones and hearing their messages."

Those messages start hours or even days before he reads the room. “I'll get little notions where someone will come in and be like, ‘My mom is coming to see you,'” the 33-year-old explained. “The spirits are tapping me saying, ‘I'm here. Can you hear me?'”

Loud and clear, actually.

Because next he'll see visions “which are like daydreaming while you're awake,” Matt described. “I'll see the moments of their life and messages they have to share with friends and family. Maybe it's a regret, maybe it's something happening in that person's life.”

Or maybe just something you really need to hear. “I was just connecting with a father who wanted his daughter to know, ‘I'm not going to miss your wedding,'” Matt recalled. “And it's moments like that that are truly amazing because they show our loved ones are with us.”

We know you're conjuring up an image of Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost playing telephone with the dead, but Matt swears it's less séance; more group chat.

“When we text, we abbreviate and send emojis to say how we're feeling,” Matt began of how he interprets. “It's the same thing with the other side. They'll come through with signs.”

He also feels the weight of their experiences. “If someone passed of a heart attack, I'll feel my heart flutter,” he admitted. “If someone had lost their legs, I'll feel a sensation in my legs.”

“I'll hear whispers of names, dates, places,” he continued. “That soul is telling their story.”

The whirlwind of a reading can feel out of body, allowing Matt to focus solely on being the messenger. But when the work is done, he finally sits with what he's witnessed.

“That's when I get emotional,” the Rhode Island native admitted. “The stories stay with you. You're seeing people who took their lives, who died in tragedy, who passed in really tough ways.”

That's Alexa's cue to step in with a Diet Coke, a cold compress and Advil. “He's very drained after so we will watch a series we've been binging or a movie,” she said. “Anything that takes him out of the spiritual space for a little.”

She has her own brushes with the beyond, too. When the couple was trying to conceive, “Alexa met our son before he was actually even born,” Matt said of his wife, who dreamt of being pregnant, delivering a brown-eyed boy and vacationing at Disney together.

“And it's exactly what happened,” she revealed. “As soon as I found out I was pregnant, I knew it was a boy. He came out with blue eyes and my mother-in-law said, ‘He's going to keep those.' I'm like, ‘No, he's not.' The baby in my dream, my Royce, had big brown eyes, and that's exactly what he has. They're beautiful. I would get visions and premonitions from pregnancy.”

Her theory is it was an effect of having Matt's DNA growing inside her. Or, she said, “Royce could be psychic, and he was in me.”

This idea that the gift is hereditary isn't so far-fetched. Matt's mom and grandmother—the first spirit he spoke with as a toddler—were both psychic mediums and now, the couple are seeing similar signs (the spirit kind, too) with their son.

“He reminds me so much of Matt, not only his personality,” Alexa explained, “but the way he thinks and views the world. To me, that's a dead giveaway he could be psychic.”

A crystal ball may agree. As Matt weighed in, “The other night, the baby monitor went off and he was sitting up in his bed, reaching for something that wasn't there.” While Royce is quick to yell out for his parents if he's upset, “He didn't call for us,” marveled Matt. “He was in his room, lights out, talking to somebody that wasn't there. And he wasn't scared.”

They'd like to keep it that way. So, for now, Royce remains unaware of the family business.

“I haven't told him exactly what I do because I want to see what he picks up and how he understands it,” Matt, currently on his North American Undeniable Proof of Life After Death tour, told E!. “I've been bringing him to the shows. I ask him, ‘What do you think that Daddy does?' And he says, ‘He helps people,' but he doesn't know exactly what that means.”

They're waiting for Royce to connect the dots on his own.

“I don't want to influence him,” Matt continued. “I want him to come to me when he's ready and talk about what he might be seeing or experiencing.”

In the meantime, Matt and Alexa are happy to influence the rest of us with their bi-weekly podcast featuring interviews with paranormal hunters, hospice nurses, influencers, Reiki practitioners and more.

“People are finding their own church, their own way in spirituality,” Matt explained. “And this is an escape to figure out that you're not alone, that there are souls are guiding you, that are with you.”You just have to look for the signs. No cell service required.

Supernatural ran for an impressive 15 seasons, but a heated debate about whether the Supernatural season 5 finale or the Supernatural season 15 finale (which was also the series finale) was really the better ending persists today. Although the show remained popular, the original plan was for Supernatural to end with season 5, episode 22, "Swan Song."

It was also after "Swan Song" that Supernatural's creator, Eric Kripke, left the show. Many in the fanbase believe this is when the show should have ended, yet there are seemingly just as many fans who believe the series finale perfectly concluded the show. So, five years after Supernatural's conclusion, which ending was best: season 5 or season 15? 

Both Supernatural season 5 and Supernatural season 15's finales offered massive emotional conclusions that were not only heartbreaking but also brought the brothers' stories to a bittersweet end in different ways. In season 5, this meant Dean and Sam essentially fulfilling the roles they were always intended to, at least from a divine perspective.

That is, Sam had become the vessel for Lucifer, and although Dean hadn't been the vessel for Michael in the end, this still more or less saw each brother fulfilling their destiny. This ending of course would have been gutting as the show's end, because Dean was now left without Sam, Castiel, or Bobby, but it certainly felt full-circle.

In fact, particularly in terms of Sam's story, this ending was arguably more satisfying, as it was because of Sam's sacrifice that Lucifer was able to be stopped. After five seasons (and decades of his life), Sam was able to overcome his feelings of being inadequate, 'evil,' and beyond saving, and fix what he'd done by kicking off the Apocalypse.

Sam was able to overcome his feelings of being inadequate, 'evil,' and beyond saving, and fix what he'd done by kicking off the Apocalypse.

That isn't to say Supernatural season 15's conclusion wasn't satisfying, though. The way Dean Winchester died (or died for the final time, given Dean had many deaths in Supernatural) remains very controversial for some, as he wasn't taken out by some massive supernatural force but rather by a piece of rebar.

Yet, after Dean's death, Supernatural's final episode, "Carry On," gave the boys perhaps as happy an ending as they were ever going to get. Dean did die, but he also went to Heaven, and viewers got to see him happily driving Baby, truly at peace.

Sam also got what he'd long wanted. Although we never see his wife's face (the prevailing theory is that Sam married Eileen), Sam got married and had a son, whom he named Dean. Considering Sam had talked about how desperate he was for a 'normal' life since the pilot episode, this was a happy ending, in a way, for him.

Supernatural season 15's ending posed a huge question about Sam Winchester's life after the show ends, and a potential season 16 would answer it.

It's also worth noting, those who take issue with the series finale tend to dislike that Dean and Sam end up separated, with Sam living decades longer than Dean. Yet, both finales would have had the brothers torn apart in the end. In the true ending, this meant Dean's death, whereas in the original, Sam would have been eternally trapped.

Supernatural was in part able to sustain 15 seasons because of the show's brilliant storytelling, and while some seasons of Supernatural were better than others, as is true of any show, both the season 5 finale and the season 15 finale of Supernatural exhibited that powerful, compelling storytelling.

However, season 5's "Swan Song" has a leg up on season 15's "Carry On" for one reason: "Swan Song" was much more intentionally planned than "Carry On"—and that's not really the show's fault. For one, the arc leading to "Swan Song" was the entire focus of the show for five seasons.

This means that, while story details no doubt shifted and developed over time in those first five seasons, the target was generally that season 5 arc. The same cannot be said of season 15, which was of course not planned out from the inception of the show, as it wasn't expected for the show to last that long.

Yet, the bigger issue season 15's finale faced was something no one could have anticipated: the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of safety regulations and various other issues arising from COVID, certain aspects of the Supernatural season 15 ending were changed.

Although the show's producers have asserted that the characters' arcs and the core story weren't affected by COVID, it was confirmed that, initially, Supernatural's season 15 finale was going to include a number of cameos from characters across the show's fifteen seasons. The most notable of these returns was Misha Collins' appearance as Castiel.

Particularly given how heartbreaking Castiel and Dean's farewell was when Castiel was taken by the Empty, it certainly seems as though seeing Castiel again on screen would have been a significant moment that would have had an impact on the finale.

Despite still being divisive four years later, Supernatural's series finale concluded 15 years of television, even if some aspects weren't great.

Ultimately, Supernatural season 5 felt more aligned with all that had come before in the show. For five seasons, tensions had been building between Dean and Sam, Sam had increasingly been forced to face the reality not only of his past but also of what he'd done, and the show had become about this divine showdown between Lucifer and Michael.

While "Carry On" still upheld the themes that had been seen throughout fifteen seasons of the show, it just didn't have that same weight, in part because it wasn't even the episode in which the final face-off (between the brothers and God) took place. Arguably, the penultimate episode, "Inherit the Earth," served as a better finale because of that.

Even the massive showdown aside, there are simply elements of the series finale that still don't sit well with many viewers, Dean's death being one of them. Whereas the season 5 finale felt like a bittersweet, full-circle moment, wherein both brothers fulfilled their destinies, many felt as though Dean's death made no sense for his character.

Because of these many factors, I believe the Supernatural season 5 finale was the better finale of the two. "Swan Song" just seems to better capture the relationship between Dean and Sam and all that they had been through, and it feels like a more carefully-crafted conclusion to all that had taken place in Supernatural up to that point.

However, were that episode the series finale, it would mean everything that occurred in Supernatural following season 5 would never have come to be, and that would truly be a shame. Countless characters, storylines, brilliant scenes, and touching moments only came about in those 10 later seasons, and I wouldn't want to trade that for the season 5 finale.

Therefore, while I do believe the Supernatural season 5 finale is the superior finale, I could never wish away the 10 seasons that followed it—the series finale in season 15 included.

I loved every season of Supernatural, including season 15...until the last two episodes. Worst ending I have ever seen. It was even worse than Game of Thrones' ending. I felt so betrayed. I used to rewatch it all the time and I haven't watched a single episode since it ended, the ending tainted the entire show for me and I'm still not over it. 😭
