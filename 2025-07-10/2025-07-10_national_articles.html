A portion of a huge industrial tunnel under construction in Los Angeles collapsed Wednesday and up to 15 workers may have been trapped, the Los Angeles Fire Department said.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — All 31 construction workers who were far inside a huge industrial tunnel being dug under Los Angeles made it to safety after a partial collapse, an outcome officials called a blessing after they initially feared much worse. Maria Orozco hugs her son, Oraldo Orozco, one of her three sons who were trapped as tunnel workers inside a collapsed tunnel under construction for Los Angeles County's Clean Water project, Wednesday, July 9, 2025, in Los Angeles. Fire Department Chief Ronnie Villanueva said the workers had to make it through the most treacherous part themselves, climbing over more than 12 feet (3.6 meters) of loose dirt and debris to reach the boring machine before rescuers could drive them to the opening of the nearly $700 million project, which is designed to carry treated wastewater to the Pacific Ocean. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports on the successful rescue of 31 construction workers in a partially collapsed tunnel in Los Angeles. “It was sad and scary,” she said in Spanish. Working so near the shoreline and at such a depth means crews could have been contending with very wet conditions that add challenges during design and digging, said Maria Mohammed, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Southern California. The cause is under investigation, Chee said. Work will not resume until they can figure out what happened and determine that it's safe to proceed, authorities said. Mohammed said that investigation could take months, if not longer. Once inside, they'll try to determine where the collapse originated, she said. “It all comes down to, what's the first element that broke?” Mohammed said Thursday. So you would try to figure out, of the broken elements, which one broke first.” City Councilmember Tim McOsker praised the workers for keeping cool heads. “This is a highly technical, difficult project. And they knew exactly what to do. They knew how to secure themselves,” he said. Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference that she met with some of the workers. “I know when we raced down here I was so concerned that we were going to find tragedy. Instead, what we found was victory,” Bass said. Associated Press writer Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed.</p>

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration on Monday to produce a government witness "with personal knowledge" about the administration's plans for Abrego Garcia, who she said will be expected to testify, under oath, about the "who, what, where, and when" involving the government's plans to deport him again to either El Salvador or a third country pending release from federal custody. Justice Department officials notified Judge Xinis hours before the hearing that they plan to call as a witness Thomas Giles, the assistant director for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations office in Los Angeles, California. Trump administration officials are expected to address on Thursday, "among other topics, the asserted lawful bases for detention, the nature and timing of any notice to be provided to Abrego Garcia, the location of any proposed custody or transfer, and the procedural steps Defendants intend to pursue," Xinis said in her order. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran illegal migrant who was deported to El Salvador, is seen wearing a Chicago Bulls hat, in this handout (Abrego Garcia Family/Handout via REUTERS) The request came after Justice Department officials conceded at a hearing earlier this week that Abrego Garcia could be removed from the U.S. as soon as July 16 — nine days from today, when a federal judge in Tennessee will consider whether he should be freed and transferred to DHS custody. Marshals in Tennessee, was returned from El Salvador in June — three months after his deportation and weeks after the Supreme Court backed Xinis's order to facilitate his return. Upon arrival, Abrego was immediately slapped with federal charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. Justice Department officials acknowledged in court this week that they plan to immediately take him into ICE custody as early as this month and deport him to a third country — regardless of the status of his criminal case. Xinis, who is handling his civil case, grilled Trump administration lawyers for details Monday as to when they opened a federal investigation into Abrego Garcia in the U.S. Middle District of Tennessee — and how the timing of the investigation and federal indictment squared with the government's testimony in her own court.

"Now I have real concerns — as if I haven't for the last three months," Xinis noted in response. Justice Department lawyers also told Xinis that they do not plan to keep him in the U.S. until his trial is over. "No," Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn answered simply. "There's no intention to just put him in limbo in ICE custody while we wait for the criminal case to unfold," Guynn told Xinis. "He will be removed, as would any other illegal alien in that process." "Given the series of unlawful actions" here, I feel like it's well within my authority to order this hearing — perhaps more than one — to hear testimony from at least one witness with firsthand knowledge, who can answer these questions about the immediate next steps" from the government pending Abrego Garca's release from custody, Xinis said.

The Justice Department charged seven Chinese nationals this week for allegedly operating a multi-million dollar marijuana trafficking ring. Authorities in Massachusetts arrested six of the defendants on Tuesday morning, but one remains at large. The DOJ says the migrants were smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border to work in marijuana grow houses and had their passports withheld "until they repaid their smuggling debts." "This case pulls back the curtain on a sprawling criminal enterprise that exploited our immigration system and our communities for personal gain," said U.S. Attorney Leah Foley. "These defendants allegedly turned quiet homes across the Northeast into hubs for a criminal enterprise – building a multi-million-dollar black-market operation off the backs of an illegal workforce and using our neighborhoods as cover. Pictured is defendant Hongbin Wu, 35, wearing a "money laundering" shirt. Authorities say the marijuana ring began operations around January 2020, focusing mostly on Massachusetts and Maine. Prosecutors claim the grow house operators maintained contact with each other through a list of marijuana cultivators and distributors from or with ties to China in the region called the "East Coast Contact List." Authorities conducting a search of the home found over $270,000 in cash inside the house and inside a Porsche parked in its driveway. They also found several Chinese passports and other identification documents inside a safe. Roughly 50 kilograms of marijuana seized from a Chinese national in the US. Additional October 2024 searches of grow houses located in Braintree and Melrose where Ma and Zhu allegedly resided, respectively, resulted in the seizure of over 109 kilograms of marijuana, nearly $200,000 in cash and numerous luxury items including a gold Rolex watch with a $65,000 price tag still on it, the DOJ said.

Constitutional Accountability Center President Elizabeth Wydra and constitutional attorney Mark Smith weigh in on how the Supreme Court limiting nationwide injunctions on federal judges will impact the birthright citizenship ruling. A federal judge in New Hampshire blocked President Donald Trump's executive order banning birthright citizenship and granted nationwide class certification status to all infants impacted by the order on Thursday. U.S. District Judge Joseph LaPlante said that he will issue a written ruling by the end of the day further explaining his decision. In his order, LaPlante ruled that deprivation of citizenship, as held by the 14th Amendment, and changes in longstanding policy would create "irreparable harm." The U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington D.C.  (Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Still, it is almost sure to be quickly appealed by the Trump administration. It comes after the Supreme Court reviewed the case earlier this year, and ruled 6-3 in late June that plaintiffs seeking nationwide relief must file their cases as a class action lawsuit — narrowing the instances in which lower district courts can issue so-called universal injunctions. Still, Justice Department officials told a federal judge last week they plan to begin enforcing Trump's birthright citizenship order as early as July 27, in recognition of a 30-day stay included in the Supreme Court's ruling, showing they plan to act quickly. Trump's order, signed on the first day of his second White House term, directs all U.S. government agencies to refuse to issue citizenship documents to children born to illegal immigrants, or who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen of lawful permanent resident. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks alongside President Donald Trump on recent Supreme Court rulings in the briefing room at the White House on June 27, 2025 in Washington, DC. The order, signed by Trump on his first day in office, was immediately challenged in January by more than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups, which argued the effort to end birthright citizenship was both unconstitutional and "unprecedented," and threatened more than 100 years of legal precedent. It was almost immediately blocked by lower courts, before eventually making its way to the Supreme Court for review in May. The high court's decision also touched off a flurry of new lawsuits from the ACLU and other immigration advocacy groups, who re-filed class action lawsuits in federal courts in Maryland and in New Hampshire, where LaPlante reviewed the request Thursday. Lawyers for the Trump administration stressed last week that the Supreme Court's ruling did not preclude it from taking other actions before that date, and told U.S. it plans to "immediately" begin developing and issuing public guidance on the order. Advocates have warned possible fallout from the order could prove "catastrophic."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That office – which promotes “(e)xposure to and learning from different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences,” its site states – was announced internally just Wednesday as a replacement for the soon-to-close diversity office for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which encompasses Harvard College, the undergraduate school and university's PhD programs. Also Wednesday, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services notified the New England Commission of Higher Education that Harvard is “in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws and therefore may fail to meet the standards for accreditation set by the Commission,” according to a joint statement. That statement followed a June 30 finding by the Trump administration's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism that Harvard was in “violent violation” of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in programs or activities receiving federal funding. The new Office of Culture and Community is part of an effort to “break down silos, ensuring all members of our community are connected, supported, and empowered,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Hopi Hoekstra told colleagues Wednesday in a memo to which a university spokesperson directed CNN for information about the disappearance of the Harvard College website. As for its accreditation, Harvard “continues to comply with the New England Commission of Higher Education's Standards for Accreditation, maintaining its accreditation uninterrupted since its initial review in 1929,” the spokesperson said Thursday in a statement. The moves Wednesday come amid a monthslong fight between Harvard and the Trump administration, which has sought to coerce the school to make changes that adhere to its more conservative ideology and less than a month ago suggested a deal was in sight. Other US universities have faced similar pressure from the White House and met at least some of its demands. At Harvard, the White House since April has frozen billions of federal dollars and threatened to yank more if Harvard does not comply, accusing the university in part of failing to adequately combat antisemitism and curb diversity practices – designed to advance racial, gender, class and other representation in public spaces – it decries as “illegal and immoral discrimination.” Attacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months. Harvard should also “become a hub for antisemitism research” and dedicate a faculty member to its study, the task force said. “We remain committed to ensuring members of our Jewish and Israeli community are embraced, respected, and can thrive at Harvard,” its spokesperson added Thursday. Meantime, Harvard continues to battle the Trump administration in federal court on two fronts: In one, it seeks to claw back the frozen federal funds, with a hearing set for July 21; in the other, a judge has indefinitely blocked the White House's effort to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students, who make up about a quarter of its enrollment.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. FOX NEWS FIRST: Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is reigniting a congressional push to ban the Chinese Communist Party from buying up farmland and residential land in the U.S. on Thursday. Hawley is introducing the Protecting Our Farms and Homes from China Act, which bans Chinese corporations and individuals associated with the Chinese Communist Party from making such purchases. President Donald Trump's administration has sounded the alarm about Chinese ownership of U.S. land in recent days, particularly around American military bases. "China's ownership of U.S. farmland poses a direct threat to American interests," Hawley told Fox News Digital in a statement. That's why I'm introducing legislation to protect American assets from the CCP once and for all." While the bill would impose a flat ban on relevant purchases of farmland, the ban on residential purchases would only apply for two years, leaving an option for the president to re-up the prohibition every two years beyond that. Sen. Josh Hawley is pushing to ban Chinese corporations and individuals associated with the CCP from owning U.S. land. The legislation also requires Chinese corporations and CCP-affiliated individuals who own affected land to divest that ownership within one year. Hawley's move comes in tandem with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announcing its National Farm Security Action Plan earlier this week. The plan is specifically meant to address threats from foreign governments, like China, and how those threats impact American farmers. The plan laid out executive reforms and called for Congress to pursue legislation like Hawley's. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins outlines plan to tackle threats from China and other adversaries on American farmland on July 8, 2025. "The farm's produce is not just a commodity, it is a way of life that underpins America itself. And that's exactly why it is under threat from criminals, from political adversaries, and from hostile regimes that understand our way of life as a profound and existential threat to themselves," USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said at a press event in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. "For them, agricultural lands and our farms, because they are a previous inheritance, are weapons to be turned against us," she continued. All of this takes what is profoundly good and turns it toward evil purposes." The executive branch, Congress and state governments have pushed to prevent China's ownership of U.S. farmland. Joining Rollins at the event were Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Numerous states have laws on the books restricting land purchases by those with ties to China and other foreign adversaries. Nevertheless, in 2021, over 383,000 acres had ties to China.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The remains of a famous sycamore tree, which stood on Britain's Roman-built Hadrian's Wall in northern England for more than 200 years, has found a new home nearly two years after it was illegally felled. The removal of the tree from its spot known as “Sycamore Gap,” a pronounced dip in Hadrian's Wall, in September 2023 sparked global outrage. Sycamore Gap was considered one of the most photographed trees in England and was made famous to millions when it appeared in Kevin Costner's 1991 blockbuster film “Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.” In May, two men were found guilty of criminal damage for felling the landmark tree. Now, a section of it will be put on permanent display at The Sill: National Landscape Discovery Centre, about two miles (three kilometers) from where it once stood. Visitors left post-it notes, letters, drawings and messages expressing grief, love, and hope,” the park said in a press release Thursday. “The resulting exhibit honours the tree's natural form while inviting people to engage with it in a deeply personal way,” The Sill said in a press release Thursday. A spokesperson for the park told CNN on Thursday that the tree piece, which will be on public display from Friday, “can be touched and is huggable.” The trunk is positioned upright, as it once was, and is surrounded by tree oak benches and streams of wood bent to form a canopy in the shape of a huge leaf – recreating the shelter the tree once offered for people to sit and reflect. “The original tree may be gone in the form we knew it, but its legacy remains, and what has come since has been endlessly positive, affirming our belief that people nature and place cannot be separated and are interdependent,” said Tony Gates, chief executive of Northumberland National Park Authority, in the release. “I really hope what we've done in some small way allows the people of Northumberland and those who held this tree close to their hearts to process the loss they still feel from that day in September 2023, when the tree was illegally cut down,” he added. “The work looks forward with hope, the tree is regrowing, and Sycamore Gap will always be a magical place to visit,” Whinney continued.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action. She celebrated it on the Klamath River, with a group of young people making a historic journey paddling from the river's headwaters in southern Oregon to its mouth in the Pacific Ocean, just south of Crescent City, California. Williams, together with fellow paddler Keeya Wiki, 17, spoke to CNN on day 15 of their month-long journey, which they are due to complete on Friday. “We are getting justice,” Wiki, who is from the Yurok Tribe, added. “And making sure that my people and all the people on the Klamath River can live how we're supposed to.” Historically, it was also a lifeline, providing them with an abundance of fish. But between 1918 and 1966, electric utility company California Oregon Power Company (which later became PacifiCorp), built a series of hydroelectric dams along the river's course, which cut off the upstream pathway for migrating salmon, and the tribes lost this cultural and commercial resource. But it was only in 2002, after low water levels caused a disease outbreak that killed more than 30,000 fish, that momentum really started to build for their cause. Twenty years later, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission finally approved a plan to remove four dams on the lower Klamath River. Wiki and Williams were among them — neither had kayaked before then. Related article This 1,000-mile river suffered decades of oil spills. Upriver (beyond where the Klamath River technically begins), two smaller non-hydroelectric dams remain, where the paddlers had to disembark and carry the kayaks overland; there are currently no plans to remove them despite an ongoing campaign. Wiki recalled feeling giddy when she heard that the last dam had fallen. “It was a really long, hard fight, and a lot of people thought — even my grandma thought — they would never see the dams come down in their lifetime. “So, for us to paddle down the river… it's very surreal. Weston Boyles, founder and director of Ríos to Rivers, who is also on the journey, said that it was critical that native people lead the first descent. “Historically, ‘first descents' have been a colonial idea: outsiders staking claims on waterways that indigenous communities have navigated for millennia,” he said. It matters because those waters flow through ancestral homelands, and these young paddlers are reasserting sovereignty, healing cultural trauma, and honoring their tribes' deep connections to the river.” It took the salmon two weeks,” he told CNN. “No one saw that coming — the response has exceeded our wildest hopes. It demonstrates the remarkable resilience of these fish: if we give them a chance, they will make their way back home.” But there is no denying the landscape has changed dramatically since before the dams and it will take years to recover, according to Coffman. RES is working to accelerate the natural process by reshaping channels, excavating sediment, planting billions of native seeds along the riverbanks, and even using helicopters to place downed trees in tributaries to provide crucial cover for fish and wildlife. “Sometimes we give nature a gentle nudge, but sometimes we give it a great big shove in the right direction,” says Coffman. “I got to see it earlier this year and it was kind of looking sad, and then I paddled through a couple days ago and it looks like a completely different river.” Related article Lost underwater forests are returning to Sydney's coastline Williams will head off to college in fall and Wiki is starting her final year of high school. But despite living on different sections of the river and being from different tribes, they are confident their paths will cross again. Both strongly believe their futures are grounded in the Klamath. Williams dreams of coming back in her college breaks and becoming a paddle instructor, while Wiki sees herself doing advocacy work for her community. “We are celebrating (now), but there's still so much work to be done in the United States and also globally around dams and dam removal,” said Wiki.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A truly scary new revelation about Trump's effort to circumvent the TikTok ban. Just before the July Fourth holiday, we learned that President Donald Trump secretly claimed a power so dangerous that even King George was prohibited from using it. The letters, released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, consist mostly of weakly argued claims about why companies do not have to stop hosting TikTok on their platforms (as the legislation explicitly requires). But when put together, those claims amount to a frighteningly raw assertion of power: that the president can exempt specific companies from complying with legislation if he believes it interferes with his control over foreign policy. This is called the “dispensing power.” It was an old prerogative of English kings, one in which they could simply assert that the law doesn't apply to their friends (a power not limited to foreign affairs). Dispensations were basically proactive pardons, telling someone they can feel free to ignore specific laws and never suffer any consequences. Bondi's letters seem to directly contradict this basic principle of constitutional law. The Bondi letters have gotten virtually no attention outside of dedicated legal blogs and podcasts. They do not directly assert a dispensing power, but instead confusingly mash together multiple different legal claims without spelling out how they fit together into a coherent argument. During our conversation, Rozenshtein asked to be described as “spittle-flecked with rage” at the letters' technical legal incompetence. If Trump determines that legislation might “interfere” with his conduct of foreign affairs, Bondi suggests, he can bindingly promise individual corporations or people that the administration will not take any legal action against them for violating its provisions. On its surface, this argument seems like a mashup of two relatively normal presidential prerogatives: the ability to assert that a statute contradicts presidential power and the ability to use discretion in enforcing it. The Supreme Court has indeed held that legislation can unconstitutionally interfere with Article II powers, the most notable recent case (2014's Zivotofsky v. Kerry) overturning a law requiring that US passports list “Israel” as the birthplace for US citizens born in Jerusalem. However, this doesn't mean that all legislative constraints on the president's foreign policy powers are unconstitutional — far from it. And there is no credible case that the TikTok ban contravenes Article II. Presidents are also widely understood to have discretion in how they enforce the law. This discretion can give rise to tricky gray area cases. Barack Obama, for example, ordered the Justice Department to stop immigration enforcement actions against undocumented migrants brought to the US as children. There is a robust debate over whether this is a legitimate use of discretion, as the Obama administration argued, or an abuse designed to usurp Congress's lawmaking power. But the TikTok case, legal experts say, is very different. There's no issue of enforcement or limited resources; before Trump issued his exemptions, Apple and Google had already removed TikTok from their US app stores. Rather, it was giving big tech platforms a blank check to ignore a law they had previously complied with — which is, essentially, an assertion that the president has a version of the dispensing power that English kings lost centuries ago. To understand how scary these letters are, it's worth considering an analogy: the pardon power. Jack Goldsmith, a leading expert on presidential power at Harvard Law School, reads Bondi's letters as claiming the power to proactively forgive civil violations. This would, in effect, allow the president to authorize whole new categories of illegal conduct, provided he can find a sufficient foreign policy-related excuse. At the moment, it does not appear that this sweeping reasoning is being employed for anything other than giving companies cover to violate the TikTok ban. But as Goldsmith notes, executive power assertions typically function like one-way ratchets: Once used successfully, presidents turn to them again in the future. “There is an immense danger in Bondi's assertion of a dispensing power here—that it might set a precedent for assertions of the same authority in future cases in which the dispensations are far less popular and far more corrupting,” writes Steve Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University and author of a newsletter on the Supreme Court. It struck me as yet another in a long string of technical arguments over presidential non-enforcement, one that applied to law that it seems many in Congress regret ever passing. But after reading Bondi's letters, and studying their legal implications, I've started to see this as fundamentally different. This case isn't about TikTok, not really; it's about Trump being able to make an obviously unconstitutional power grab in secret and get away with it — as he very well may, as Rozenshtein believes the letters' claims will be hard to challenge in court due to standing issues. It's a situation that looks especially dangerous in light of his broader agenda. “Trump, unlike [previous] presidents, has clearly expressed, in word and deed, his disregard of any limits on his powers to do pretty much anything he wants to do,” writes David Post, a legal scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute. ICE just got its biggest cash infusion in more than two decades. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is back in Washington for a third visit. Trump officials say there's no deeper Epstein conspiracy they can reveal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of millions of flies dropping from planes in the sky might sound like a horrible nightmare, but experts say such a swarm could be the livestock industry's best defense against a flesh-eating threat poised to invade the southwestern border of the United States. An outbreak of New World screwworms — the larval form of a type of fly that's known to nest in the wounds of warm-blooded animals and slowly eat them alive — has been spreading across Central America since early 2023, with infestations recorded in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize and El Salvador. Most Central American countries hadn't seen an outbreak in 20 years. The fly reached southern Mexico in November, sparking concern among US agricultural industry officials and triggering the closure of several border-area cattle, horse and bison trading ports. Related article Scientists say a tiny brown moth navigates 600 miles using stars — just like humans and birds The strategy — essentially fighting flies with flies — slowly degraded the insects' populations by preventing them from laying more eggs. However, today only one facility in Panama breeds sterilized New World screwworms for dispersal, and hundreds of millions more sterile flies are needed to slow the outbreak, according to a June 17 letter from 80 US lawmakers. New World screwworms are the parasitic larva of a metallic blue blow fly species called Cochliomyia hominivorax. The flesh-eating maggots go for most warm-blooded animals, including horses and cows.They have also been known to infect domestic pets and even humans in rare cases, Kaufman said. “After mating, the female fly finds a living host, lands on its wound, and will lay up to 200 to 300 eggs,” Kaufman explained. “After 12 to 24 hours, those eggs all hatch, and they immediately start burrowing and feeding on the tissue of that animal, causing very, very large wounds to form.” Since the outbreak began in 2023, there have been more than 35,000 New World screwworm infestations reported, according to statistics listed on the Panama–United States Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of Screwworm Infestation in Livestock (COPEG) website. “It's a daily chore to provide those inspections to our livestock, just to make sure they're not infested,” said Stephen Diebel, a rancher and the first vice president of the Texas & Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. “We know the incredible economic impact an infestation would cause.” There are no known vaccinations or effective repellant methods to prevent infestation, Diebel said. Instead, during warmer months, ranchers should avoid branding, tagging and other procedures that create potential entry points for the screwworms in livestock, he recommended. While regional cattle trading is thought to be a major way the fly populations travel, Diebel said infestations can also affect wildlife such as deer, birds and rodents, making surveillance of the parasite's spread even more challenging. The result: impotent adult flies that cause female mates to lay unfertilized eggs. While it is unclear how dispersal would work in the US in the event of an outbreak, Kaufman said the adult flies are typically loaded into temperature-controlled containers and dropped from planes. However, there's no need to panic about the fly drops coming to a suburb near you, he said — they usually target sparsely populated rural areas, since the flies have no interest in urban environments. At the COPEG facility, about 100 million sterilized flies are produced and dispersed aerially in affected regions each week. Currently, the dispersal efforts have been focused in the southern regions of Mexico and throughout Central America, where cases of infestation have been reported, according to COPEG's website. In addition to the new sterile fly facilities, the USDA also announced $21 million plans to renovate an old fly factory in Mexico by late 2025. ‘When you offset the $300 million to the $10 billion of economic impact these flies would have, it's an easy trade-off to understand,” Diebel said. “Having (a domestic production facility) here is super important … to control the distribution of those sterile flies more efficiently.” Related article He's searching for a human-made problem in areas largely untouched by humans. Shortly after the June 18 announcement, the USDA shared plans to begin reopening  livestock trading ports in Arizona, Texas and New Mexico that closed last year, citing “good progress” in surveillance and sterile fly dispersal efforts throughout Mexico. COPEG did not immediately respond to request for comment on further details about the current progress of the US dispersal initiatives.</p>

In this May 9, 2019, photo, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, speaks during a press conference in Putrajaya, Malaysia. KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad marked a historic milestone as he turned 100 on Thursday, calling the moment “quite frightening” without showing signs of slowing down. A towering figure in Malaysian politics, Mahathir is known for his transformative and at times controversial leadership. First serving as the nation's fourth prime minister from 1981 to 2003, and then returning as its seventh from 2018 to 2020, Mahathir has been the country's longest-serving and oldest-serving prime minister. “I'd like to thank all those who sent cakes, flowers, letters and for turning up to wish me a happy 100th birthday. To be 100 is quite frightening,” he said in a special live podcast to mark the occasion. During the podcast, Mahathir also reflected on key moments in Malaysia's history, voiced solidarity with the Palestinian people and spoke about the rise of China. Mahathir, who previously attributed his longevity to neither smoking nor overeating and exercising his brain, also offered personal insights on aging. Although he has a history of heart disease, including two bypass surgeries, Mahathir said staying mentally and physically active has kept him going. I cannot understand people wanting to rest. But some people retire, and they want to rest. What is the meaning of rest? And I think being active is what keeps me alive,” he added. Mahathir acknowledged he was fortunate not to have been struck by any fatal diseases. “I didnt make an effort to live this long but I look after my health,” he said, describing his milestone birthday as just a “normal day.” During his first 22-year term, Malaysia transformed into a modern economy, but Mahathir used stifling political control to hold power and silence dissent. He came out of retirement to challenge his former party over a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal, forming an alliance with old foes that produced a 2018 election victory hailed as a triumph for democracy. When he returned to power at age 92, he was hailed as a hero who ousted a corrupt government and led Malaysia's first opposition victory since independence from Britain in 1957. His government collapsed during infighting after just 22 months and in opposition Mahathir became a divisive voice advocating Malay supremacy, working with an Islamist party he had long denounced. While there was no grand celebration, staff brought out a small cake and sang a birthday song, his aide Sufi Yusoff said. True to form, Mahathir ended the moment with his trademark discipline: “Ok, back to work!”</p>

New York Yankees pitcher Cam Schlittler (31) throws during the first inning of a baseball game against the Seattle Mariners, Wednesday, July 9, 2025, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — One game into his major league career, Cam Schlittler is the hardest-throwing member of the New York Yankees' rotation. Schlittler used his 100 mph fastball to shut down Cal Raleigh and the Seattle Mariners during an eye-opening debut Wednesday night, pitching the Yankees to a 9-6 victory before a throng of friends and family members in the crowd. He threw New York's seven fastest pitches this season and his average fastball velocity of 97.9 mph was the highest for a Yankees pitcher this year. But it was his poise and improved secondary pitches that really impressed manager Aaron Boone. “You see his stuff really plays,” Boone said. Boone called it “a great first step” and said Schlittler will get another big league start, likely after the All-Star break. “He was sick,” said Yankees teammate Jazz Chisholm Jr., who homered twice and drove in four runs. Schlittler was called up from Triple-A to pitch in place of injured Clarke Schmidt, who is expected to undergo a second Tommy John surgery on his right elbow that would sideline him for the rest of this season and much of next year. So there's a genuine opportunity for Schlittler to stick in the rotation for a Yankees squad trying to catch Toronto atop the AL East. “Obviously, just trying to get the first one under my belt and then whatever happens. Staked to an early 3-0 lead, Schlittler gave up three runs and four hits — including solo homers by J.P. Crawford and Jorge Polanco. The 24-year-old right-hander walked his first batter but settled down quickly and froze Raleigh, the major league home run leader, with a 100 mph heater for his first strikeout in the opening inning. “He was nasty,” Yankees outfielder Jasson Domínguez said. Schlittler said the strikeout ball will probably end up in his room back home eventually, but first he planned to give it to his parents. Schlittler, who walked two, ending his outing with another strikeout of Raleigh before leaving with a 6-2 lead in the sixth to a standing ovation as his parents hugged in the Yankee Stadium stands. Schlittler was born in Massachusetts but said he always wanted to play for the Yankees. The pitcher said his girlfriend and cousin were on hand in addition to plenty of friends, and he left 23 tickets for his supporters. “I think probably had more jitters this morning, honestly,” Schlittler said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The report, citing anonymous sources, suggested the agency's response was delayed by bureaucracy that required Noem to sign off on any contract and grant over $100,000 due to a Trump administration cost-saving rule. “This reporting is an unparalleled display of activist journalism and distracts from the robust, coordinated federal response led by Secretary Noem that has saved over 900+ lives,” DHS said in a post on X. This reporting is an unapparelled display of activist journalism and distracts from the robust, coordinated federal response led by Secretary Noem that has saved over 900+ lives. Within moments of the flooding in Texas, DHS assets, including the U.S. Coast Guard, tactical Border Patrol units, and FEMA personnel, surged into unprecedented action alongside Texas first responders. “We were operating under a clear set of guidance: lean forward, be prepared, anticipate what the state needs, and be ready to deliver it,” a longtime FEMA official said. “That is not as clear of an intent for us at the moment.” “FEMA is shifting from bloated, DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,” spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said. “The old processes are being replaced because they failed Americans in real emergencies for decades.” Warnings had been in effect before the flooding hit, but many were unaware. President Donald Trump is set to visit the area later this week and has approved a disaster declaration. This is a breakthrough in how FEMA supports state-led disaster recovery,” DHS said. At least 120 people have died due to the floods, with more than 173 missing. Trump and Noem have weighed whether it is possible to prosecute CNN for the latter two stories. The Washington Examiner reached out to CNN for comment, but did not receive a response.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the latest episode of her IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson podcast, which was released Wednesday, Obama told actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus that many women spend much of their lives second-guessing themselves, while young men, especially those in their 30s, often exude confidence they haven't necessarily earned. “We're always hedging … because in the back of our minds, we weren't raised with the certainty of maleness,” Obama said. The conversation was part of a broader discussion on aging, confidence, and cultural invisibility, especially for women. Obama, 60, said she has only recently reached a point in her life where she feels fully secure in herself. “This is really the first time in my life where I feel completely me, and I can absolutely embrace my wisdom,” she said. “We, as women, spend most of our lives saying, ‘Well, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.' Obama echoed that sentiment, emphasizing how society discourages women from expressing confidence when they gain the experience to justify it. “We don't start feeling that and owning that until our 50s and 60s, at a time when we start to be treated as invisible in society,” Obama said. “This stage in life for me, for me personally, is the first time that I've been completely free,” Obama shared. Where every choice that I make in my life is not about my husband, not about his career, not about what my kids need, or where they're going.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The decision leaves a lower court's ruling in place. The Supreme Court did not explain its decision, and no dissents were filed. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) earlier this year, makes it a crime for illegal immigrants to enter the state if they had been deported or previously denied entry into the United States, regardless of their history or if they had become lawful residents. Re-entering the state after being deported would have been deemed a felony. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier asked the Supreme Court to intervene last month and allow law enforcement. But the Supreme Court is leaving U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams's preliminary injunction in place while a legal battle on the law continues. Florida's position is supported by 18 states, which have submitted an amicus brief backing the immigration law. The ACLU has filed a motion opposing the law, saying it would undermine federal immigration enforcement and “lead to an unmanageable patchwork of varying state criminal regulations of immigration.” 4C “is in harmony, not conflict, with federal law.” The ACLU said in a court filing that several other states have tried to pass similar legislation, but all remain blocked in the courts.</p>
