There were mixed emotions across the Williams garage after the British Grand Prix, with Alex Albon thrilled to return to the points in P8 following a string of retirements while Carlos Sainz was left “frustrated” by his continued run of “bad luck”. After lining up in P13 amid mixed conditions, Albon found himself running in third place at one stage of the race due to being one of the last to switch to fresh intermediate tyres when the rain became heavier. “I think it was looking a little bit doom and gloom at some points of the race – we had some moments where we were looking out of the points. We got Fernando [Alonso] on the last lap which was fun, had a good battle with him and, P8, I think after a few DNFs is… [I'm] very happy.” It proved to be a tougher day for Albon's Williams team mate Sainz. “Story of my season, every time we're on to score good points and having a solid weekend, something out of our control happens and [I'm] getting a bit frustrated, tired with this season because every time there's something different when we're about to get good points.” “But when there's so many things happening out of your control, it makes you want to have a bit of a break to see if this run of bad luck and things that keep happening to us stop somehow and we start having a cleaner second half of the season. “I've never had such a run of so many bad things happening to you consecutively in a run of five, six, seven, eight races like we've been [experiencing].</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A managerial reshuffle is taking place at Red Bull, with Laurent Mekies replacing Christian Horner as CEO of the operation. Red Bull Racing CEO and Team Principal Christian Horner is to exit the squad with immediate effect, with Racing Bulls team boss Laurent Mekies taking over, it was announced on Wednesday. Horner has held the role for some 20 years – the Briton leading Red Bull through their first F1 season back in 2005 and playing a key role in turning them from points scorers into World Champions. “Oliver Mintzlaff, CEO Corporate Projects and Investments thanked Christian Horner for his exceptional work over the last 20 years.” “We would like to thank Christian Horner for his exceptional work over the last 20 years,” added Mintzlaff. “With his tireless commitment, experience, expertise and innovative thinking, he has been instrumental in establishing Red Bull Racing as one of the most successful and attractive teams in Formula 1. “Alan is the perfect man to take over now and continue our path. He knows the team inside out and has always been an important pillar of our early successes.” Permane added: “I feel very honoured to take on the role as Team Principal and would like to thank Oliver and Helmut [Marko, Red Bull advisor] for the trust they have shown in me. “I am looking forward to working with Peter to continue the good work that both him and Laurent have done in taking this team forward.</p>

Ex-Renault F1 driver Jolyon Palmer takes a look at his former team mate's F1 journey, and how he finally sealed the podium finish that has eluded him for 15 years.

It was brilliant to finally see Nico Hulkenberg get that long-awaited podium at Silverstone. I know first-hand how talented he is, having been privy to a year's worth of data on the other side of the garage when we were team mates at Renault in 2017.

For someone as good as Nico to need 239 races to end up on the podium is staggering, but he used all of his speed and nouse to convert the unlikeliest of chances on Sunday.

Hulkenberg was a first-year GP2 champion, winning the feeder category in 2009, which launched him on the path into Formula 1. It seemed inevitable at some point he would end up in a top Formula 1 seat, but somehow that chance has never come.
