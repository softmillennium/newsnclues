                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After facing hostile crowds at home in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, Tyler Adams says U.S. players hope to be better prepared in case American supporters are outnumbered at World Cup matches next year. Sellout crowds of 22,423 at St. Louis' Energizer Park and 70,925 at Houston's NRG Stadium overwhelmingly and loudly supported the visiting team during the U.S.'s 2-1 win over Guatemala in last week's semifinals and 2-1 loss to Mexico in Sunday's final. "That's an experience that they're going to have because who knows what the World Cup landscape is going to look like in terms of fans and the turnout?" Six of the American starters in the three Gold Cup knockout matches didn't play in World Cup qualifiers, where opponents often find difficult field conditions and loud fans. Adams said the five-week training camp was integral in getting to know coach Mauricio Pochettino, hired last year to replace Gregg Berhalter after the team's first-round exit at the Copa Am√©rica. Adams introduced the coach to his family members. "It creates a bond and a sense of the culture that he's trying to build within our team," Adams said. "He sat down after the game and he kind of spoke to us, and it really sparked a lot of emotions for him in that final because he knows how hard we worked over the past five weeks and how much more we were hoping to accomplish with winning the trophy. But he couldn't have been more proud and I felt exactly the same way of the whole group." Many regulars missed the tournament and some young players emerged. The first sign of how Pochettino reevaluates his player pool will be when he selects his roster for friendlies against South Korea on Sept. 6 at Harrison, New Jersey, and Japan three days later at Columbus, Ohio. "Their job just got a whole lot harder," Adams said of Pochettino and his assistants. "I think he saw a lot of guys grow and grow into big roles and guys that can play future big roles. And, of course, the next year obviously proves a lot, as well. You know, guys have to go back and perform and show that they're at the level to be there." Adams will report to Bournemouth on July 26 or 27 during its U.S. preseason tour ahead of its Premier League opener at defending champion Liverpool on Aug. 15. In the meantime, he gets a few weeks off. Scotts approached him about restoring a field, and on Thursday he and the company launched a "Keep It Real" sweepstakes open through July 24 in which five youth sports organizations will be picked to have Scotts refurbish grass fields with the company's products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Tobin Heath, a member of the U.S. women's national team's 2015 and 2019 Women's World Cup-winning squads, officially announced her retirement on Thursday, marking the end of a decorated career. Heath played the final match of her career in August 2022 with the Seattle Reign, who beat the North Carolina Courage 4-1 that day, while her final appearance for the national team was in a friendly win against South Korea in October 2021. The 37-year-old spent the final years of her career battling a serious left knee injury that she was ultimately unable to come back from. "Over New Year's, I actually came to the full acceptance that I wasn't going to be playing, which was like a two-year, some might say three-year process of acceptance," Heath said on Thursday's episode of The RE-CAP Show, a podcast she co-hosts with her former USWNT teammate and partner Christen Press. "I tried f---ing everything to get back, I spent tens of thousands of dollars and [had] two surgeries, one crazy surgery. The writing was definitely on the wall, I just couldn't accept I think that that was my ending." Heath is one of four USWNT players to make an appearance in three World Cup finals, including the 2011 final the U.S. lost to Japan following a penalty shootout. Her club career also included stints with Manchester United, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain. She was a must-watch star at her best, notching goals and assists while mixing in highlight-reel worthy moments on the regular. In addition to her podcast with Press, she is the only woman on FIFA's technical study group for the men's Club World Cup, which concludes on Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These are just a few words to describe the great Tobin Heath. The 37-year-old former US Women's National Team (USWNT) player announced her retirement Thursday on her podcast, "The Re-Cap Show." "And Tobin Heath will never play soccer again," she said after a three-minute-long compilation video played with relatives, former teammates, and friends thanking Heath for her dedication to the game. Heath made her USWNT debut in January 2008 and was named to the Beijing Olympics roster later that year, where the team won gold. In total, Heath has made 181 appearances with the USWNT, scoring 36 goals and providing 42 assists. The actual news of Heath's retirement comes less as a shock and more as a heartbreak to fans. Heath had suffered a knee injury three years ago and has since detailed her struggle with recovery. I spent tens of thousands of dollars and like two surgeries, one crazy surgery, like...the whole time I believed I was gonna get back," Heath said on the podcast episode titled "Your Favorite Player's Favorite Player." Heath's longtime girlfriend, former teammate, and podcast co-host Christen Press, also suffered a knee injury in 2022. Heath has not only had a tremendous impact on women's soccer on the field; her style of play can be seen in current players like Rose Lavelle and Alyssa Thompson. Heath was on the frontline of the equal pay fight and is one of the founders of RE-INC, a company that strives to make sports an inclusive space for everyone. In her post-professional career, she has become the first woman appointed to FIFA's Technical Study Group to analyze the men's tournament. Her presence on the field will be greatly missed. But the legacy she leaves behind and the work she continues to do will last for generations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PSG faces Chelsea in the FIFA Club World Cup final on Sunday, July 13, 2025 (7/13/25) at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Here's a soccer story via the Associated Press: Yet, it was PSG fans in a couple sections behind one goal who cheered virtually from start to finish as their team moved within one win of a historic quadruple. A 4-0 rout of Real Madrid in a Club World Cup semifinal following a 5-0 wipeout of Inter Milan in the Champions League final reinforced that PSG may be the dominant soccer team of the mid-2020s. ‚ÄúWe have always said that the collective work by the players is what's helping us,‚Äù said Fabi√°n Ruiz, who scored twice as PSG built a three-goal lead in the first 24 minutes. PSG moved on to Sunday's final against Chelsea in the first expanded Club World Cup with a chance to win its fourth major title of the season exactly 100 days after it clinched Ligue 1 on April 5. It added the Coupe de France by beating Reims 3-0 on May 24, then romped over Inter seven days later. PSG's blue, red and white jerseys don't have glamorous names pressed across the back, and they may not be as ubiquitous as the the red shirts of Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, Manchester City's light blue or Chelsea's royal blue, but the team is filling up the trophy display at Parc des Princes, its cramped, outdated stadium not far from Roland-Garros and the Bois de Boulogne. On May 31 at Munich, Achraf Hakimi got the first goal 12 minutes in, D√©sir√© Dou√© scored the next two and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Senny Mayulu added one goal each. This time, Ruiz scored in the sixth minute and Ousmane Demb√©l√© in the ninth following glaring mistakes by defenders Ra√∫l Asencio and Antonio R√ºdiger, and Ruiz made it 3-0 to cap a counter. Demb√©l√©, this year's Ligue 1 Golden Boot winner with 21 goals, started for the first time since straining his left quadriceps with France on June 5. He missed the Club World Cup group stage and was a substitute in PSG's first two knockout matches, scoring in second-half injury time during Saturday's 2-0 quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich. ‚ÄúThis is the first match in this World Cup that we can use Usman as a normal player,‚Äù PSG coach Luis Enrique said. ‚ÄúI think he is the best player this season by a long term and I think he deserves to win everything because he gave everything to the team and the team is going to achieve trophies, which is the most important thing for a club.‚Äù Real Madrid has 15 European and five world titles, a modern global superpower brand established two decades ago in the Galacticos era of David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo, then lifted loftier by Cristiano Ronaldo from 2009-18 and the rise of social media. PSG hadn't won a Ligue 1 title since 1995 when Qatar Sports Investments took over in 2011. Paris has won 11 of 13 French championships since 2013 but until May failed to become Europe's best, despite emulating Madrid's star collection when its lineup included Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbapp√©. A group achieved more than the star system. We were not up to standard today,‚Äù Real coach Xabi Alonso through an interpreter. PSG has outscored opponents 16-1 in six matches, getting three goals from Ruiz, two each from Dembele, Hakimi and Jo√£o Neves, and one apiece from Dou√©, Lee Kang-in, Kvaratskhelia, Mayulu, Ramos and Vitinha. ‚ÄúWe're truly happy to be in another final. ‚ÄúIt's very difficult to reach every final this season, and now we're one step away.‚Äù If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea have been handed a major boost by Mois√©s Caicedo returning to training before the Club World Cup final, raising hopes that the midfielder will recover from an ankle injury in time to face Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday. Enzo Maresca was left sweating over the availability of one of his most important players after Caicedo took a blow at the end of his side's 2-0 victory over Fluminense in their semi-final on Tuesday. Chelsea will not want to be without Caicedo when they face PSG at the MetLife Stadium. Maresca depends on the ¬£115m Ecuadorean's authority and will need the former Brighton & Hove Albion player to be at his best if PSG's exceptional midfield trio of Jo√£o Neves, Fabi√°n Ruiz and Vitinha are to be stopped. Encouragingly for Chelsea, Caicedo has not missed a game through injury or illness since a 2-1 defeat to Wolves on Christmas Eve in 2023. Caicedo has developed an indestructible reputation and looks likely to start against the European champions after training in New York on Thursday morning. Being without Caicedo would be a major complication for Maresca given that Rom√©o Lavia has been absent for two games through injury and D√°rio Essugo was unavailable against Fluminense after suffering an injury in training. Lavia was not pictured in training on Thursday. Chelsea's other options in midfield are Enzo Fern√°ndez and Andrey Santos. Caicedo's performances have seen him hailed as one of the best midfielders in the world but he believes that he is not at that level yet. I am working hard every day and want to show it on the pitch.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former U.S. women's national team star Tobin Heath announced her retirement from professional soccer on her podcast, The RE-CAP Show, Thursday afternoon. Heath, a two-time Olympic gold medalist (2008, '12) and two-time Women's World Cup champion (2015, '19), is hanging up her cleats three years after her last appearance in professional soccer on the NWSL's Seattle Reign in 2022. The 37-year-old previously played for the Portland Thorns from 2013 to '19, where she won two NWSL titles, and spent a brief stint in England playing for Manchester United and Arsenal. Heath's retirement comes as little surprise, as the midfielder has been rehabbing a serious left knee injury dating back to 2021 that required multiple surgeries and an eventual cartilage replacement. Her last appearance for the USWNT was in October '21. Heath ends her storied career as one of the most technically skilled and dynamic women's soccer players in the modern era. Heath earned 181 caps for the USWNT from 2008 to '22 and tallied 36 goals along with 42 assists. Since stepping away from soccer, Heath has started a podcast with former teammate and current partner Christen Press. She also recently made history as the only woman in FIFA's technical study group for the men's Club World Cup this summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has released its latest Men's World Rankings, and while Argentina continues to dominate at No. 1, the United States remains a notable presence, maintaining 16th place . With CONCACAF Gold Cup champions Mexico moving ahead to 13th and Canada rising to 28th, the U.S. stands as the top-ranked CONCACAF nation‚Äîjust one spot above Mexico. Despite a mixed recent run‚Äîwith a disappointing Nations League exit in April‚Äîthe U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) remains steadfast at 16th, according to FIFA's Elo-style rating system which dampens the impact of knockout losses. Under coach Mauricio Pochettino, the team has also secured three Gold Cup titles (2019-20, 2022-23, 2023-24) and three Nations League trophies, solidifying its regional dominance. With the 2026 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, a strong ranking could lead to a seeded spot‚Äîensuring an easier group stage draw Stars and Stripes FC. To improve their current standing, the USMNT must deliver strong results in upcoming friendlies‚Äîincluding matches against Turkey and Switzerland in June‚Äîand the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, where they aim to defend their regional title. As FIFA's next update approaches in September, the eyes of American soccer fans will be firmly fixed on results that could boost the USMNT on the road to hosting history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former U.S. women's national team midfielder Tobin Heath has retired from professional soccer, the player announced Thursday. The news comes three years after her final professional appearance and a serious left knee injury that required multiple surgeries. She leaves the game ‚Äî on the field, at least ‚Äî as a two-time World Cup winner and two-time Olympics gold medalist with the U.S. women, a two-time NWSL champion with Portland Thorns FC and a three-time NCAA champion with the University of North Carolina. But for Heath, the news of her official retirement is almost secondary as she grapples with the long-term impact of her knee injury. She's lost the ability to play the game at even a casual level and with it a part of who she was. ‚ÄúI had a personal journey back in January that I came to my own acceptance of not playing anymore,‚Äù Heath told The Athletic on Wednesday. ‚ÄúIt was me grieving not being able to play soccer anymore. For me, that was the greatest gift that had ever been given to me and such a core part of my identity and how I express myself and know myself to be.‚Äù Heath said she struggles even with running in a straight line. She described the heartbreak of having a ball roll up to her, knowing her ability isn't there anymore ‚Äî that the way she previously expressed herself in the world was no longer available to her. ‚ÄúFootball is a 360-degree sport, and I can't do it. ‚ÄúThe actual playing of soccer is gone, not even the professional or playing in a World Cup and stuff like that. The actual gift that was given to me when I first started. What started as a feeling of a pinch in her knee during preparations for the 2020 Olympics (held in 2021) turned into something much more: the discovery of a hole in her knee cartilage and two surgeries, including an eventual cartilage replacement. Her final NWSL appearance was August 14, 2022, a 4-1 win over Gotham FC. Heath's USWNT career ends with 181 appearances, 36 goals, 42 assists and 10,171 minutes played. She described an emotional conversation she had with her wife and former teammate, Christen Press, earlier this year. ‚ÄúThere was a long period of time where I knew that she would not be signing another professional contract,‚Äù Press said in a phone call with The Athletic on Wednesday. For the last three years, Heath always thought she would come back. She had a plan to evolve as an older player, a desire to mentor the next generation in the locker room. She never expected the 2019 World Cup to be her last one. Even with months of coming to terms with who she was without kicking a ball, Heath never intended to announce her retirement. It has been three years since her last appearance; she's been plenty busy co-hosting the RE-CAP show with Press, their other endeavors through RE, helping start World Sevens Football and serving as the only woman in FIFA's technical study group for the men's Club World Cup this summer. These two external prompts, along with some prodding from Press, helped her realize she hadn't actually taken time to close the door to playing. In a recording of Thursday's episode of The RE-CAP Show, Heath's emotions are on display as she describes coming to terms with her injury and retirement. Press jokes that if it weren't for her, the retirement celebration wouldn't have come together, while fondly acknowledging that Heath ‚Äúreally has evolved‚Äù by allowing herself this moment. ‚ÄúYou can see how emotional she is in the episode. It was like destiny,‚Äù Heath said of her childhood in New Jersey. ‚ÄúI'm lucky because Jersey is a hotbed for soccer,‚Äù she said. Heath found her way to the University of North Carolina, winning three national championships in her four years, and making her USWNT debut in 2008 while still in college. Her rookie season was mostly a wash after an ankle injury kept her out for most of the season. ‚ÄúThat was another click-destiny moment, because I don't know how I ended up in Portland,‚Äù Heath said. Ahead of the NWSL's first season, every national team player was given the option to rank their top three preferred teams. As an East Coaster, Heath hadn't even ranked Portland, assuming there was no way she'd be sent there. Instead, U.S. Soccer allocated her to the Thorns, alongside forward Alex Morgan and defender Rachel Buehler. Though she detoured through Paris on a six-month contract with Paris Saint-Germain, she made it to Oregon for the back half of the 2013 season. That level of appreciation and support unlocked something for Heath over a decade ago. ‚ÄúIt pushed me on the path of believing what I think women's sports could be,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey showed me a value and a worth that I never knew could exist in women's sports, and made me want to fight for it.‚Äù Clips of a signature Tobin move went viral after USWNT games. Sometimes that desire to create would get in the way of making the right call on the ball, as coach after coach drilled into her that the willingness to try things didn't have to be abandoned, but harnessed. It wasn't just being able to dribble at players, but serve up a cross or get on the end of one too. The memory of who she was as a player was central to Heath's journey to this moment, but Press has also been reflecting on decades of memories over the past few months. ‚ÄúWhen (Heath) talks about scoring in a World Cup final, she talks about it from the perspective of dreaming of scoring a World Cup final more than actually having done it,‚Äù Press said. ‚ÄúI think the intensity of professional sports means sometimes that you can't remember. ‚ÄúIt was horrible in a lot of ways. For me personally, going into that World Cup, I was playing some of the best football of my life. I was poised to have an incredible World Cup. ‚ÄúOne time, we were eating a salad at a meal,‚Äù Press said, barely holding in her laughter as she told the story. Everyone else would have been like, ‚ÄòThis is disgusting!' That tournament has shaped Heath, and the rest of her teammates forever. ‚ÄúYou can't feel what we felt leading up to that tournament, during that tournament, when we won. You can't feel that and not believe that you're doing something so f‚Äîking important for the world. When players retire, the first question is, ‚ÄúWhat's next?‚Äù For Tobin Heath, that question has already been answered in a myriad of ways, but probably not definitively. We didn't choose, it chose us,‚Äù Press said. ‚ÄúNow, she gets to choose what she does next, whether it's coach, whether it's to be an entrepreneur, whether it's one of the millions of things she wants to do. What I'm most excited for is to see her try things.‚Äù That's where projects like World Sevens and the technical study group for the Club World Cup come into play ‚Äî they're likely not permanent career paths, but explorations of options. Though Heath had to accept that nothing would take the place of football. I'll have more space for things, but nothing will ever fill that void. ‚ÄúI don't know if she told you, but she's riding a stage in the Tour de France,‚Äù Press said. Instead of trying to replace soccer, Heath said she is ‚Äúacknowledging and celebrating how awesome and how deeply meaningful that gift was to me, and being able to mourn it.‚Äù Thursday marks an ending for Heath, a complicated one. Still, there's a freedom to that door having fully shut behind her, even if she didn't realize it three years ago. ‚ÄúRight now,‚Äù Heath said with her usual smile, ‚ÄúI feel like I have an abundance of time and energy to really build lots of worlds.‚Äù (Illustration: Demetrius Robinson / The Athletic; Photo: Douglas P.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Kassouf breaks down his top candidates to win NWSL MVP, with San Diego's Delphine Cascarino taking the top spot. The NWSL's rising valuations, growing demand and increased emphasis on building new facilities look like the MLS playbook on repeat. NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman, however, has recently focused on another league as her comparative benchmark: the NFL. Berman has said multiple times in various settings that she believes the NWSL, which will expand to 16 teams next year, can support 30 to 32 franchises like the NFL. The comparison has raised a few eyebrows and several basic questions: Is the idea genuine, or a moonshot meant to generate buzz? ESPN spoke with over half a dozen club owners and executives, as well as executives in the branding and sports banking world, to understand how the league's future growth might develop. "The interest in the NWSL is tangible and you can see it," Sean Clemens, managing director of sports investment bank Park Lane -- which has worked on deals and valuations across major sports -- told ESPN. We take a lot of calls from interested investors that are trying to find ways to get involved in NWSL. The story is resonating with investors, and we really don't see that changing anytime soon." The NWSL's task is to convert that demand into growth. Multiple NWSL board members told ESPN that they can see the league doubling in size eventually, but that Berman's benchmark is a long way off -- long enough that they wouldn't even hazard a guess on a timeline. For all the times that Berman has mentioned the idea, she has never said how long it could take. A 30- or 32-team league right now seems ludicrous, but it sounds more achievable as a goal that is decades in the distance. Another NWSL board member said they see a pathway to 20 teams through more rounds of expansion. After that, they said, it is difficult to see the league getting bigger -- but they conceded that "the economics keep pushing you forward," as was the case for MLS, which took 16 years to double in size from 15 teams to 30 this season. "Our board believes that we can be the size of the NFL, there is nothing that stands in the way of us doing that, other than having access to top talent," Berman said on stage at a U.S. Soccer event in Los Angeles in April. "There's certainly not a problem with the supply, given the size of our country and the level of talent that exists, we just need to figure out how to develop them strategically and intentionally." One team owner told ESPN that the 32-team idea publicly specified by Berman is "very much her vision," and that the board has not discussed a specific number of teams as a target. One source called it a "crazy" idea to expand so much, while another said it would be "dangerous" for the product. Each referenced the need to improve talent development -- not just players, but staff, too. The two most recent rounds of NWSL expansion were semi-public bidding processes that drove up the cost to a $110 million fee for Denver, which will begin play next year. Dozens of serious groups, including several well-qualified finalists in Cincinnati and Cleveland, were left on the sidelines during bidding processes that took place in 2022 and 2024. One source with knowledge of expansion discussions told ESPN that the next additions to the league could happen more privately through direct conversations. The NWSL's recent bidding processes left both the league and prospective groups with an understanding of what to expect from each other, meaning they don't need to start from the beginning again. There are also markets that rank high on the NWSL's priority list, cities that several board members view as a matter of "when" not "if" they will join the league. Like most things, money is a big part of the answer. Denver's $110 million expansion fee is over twice as much as Boston Legacy FC paid ($53 million) to join the NWSL. Both teams will begin playing next year, but Boston was awarded the franchise two years earlier, in 2023. Five years ago, ownership groups were paying around $2 million to join the NWSL. This is where the NWSL's parallels with MLS continue. MLS expansion fees ballooned from the mid-eight figures just over a decade ago to $500 million for San Diego FC, which began playing this year. One NWSL owner said they firmly believe the NWSL will reach that $500 million expansion fee benchmark in the future as well. The reality for the NWSL is that it is still a league that loses money, a point made by multiple sources while reporting this story. Expansion fees in any league help current owners offset operating costs and avoid making cash calls to other investors. The NWSL's current media rights deals with ESPN, Amazon, CBS and Scripps Sports bring in $60 million annually combined. Those contracts all conclude at the end of 2027. The NWSL is also shopping its unsold games (which currently air on the league's in-house platform) to create more revenue. Michele Kang tells Jeff Kassouf why she's a fan of promotion and relegation and that she thinks it's "exciting." Team owners and executives are determined to achieve greater scale for sponsors, and that means they need more visibility on TV and wider reach in more markets across the United States -- a.k.a., they need to expand. Some of the NWSL's glaring market absences are Dallas-Fort Worth (No. Atlanta has been in and out of NWSL discussions for nearly a decade. But growth is about more than increasing scale of teams and media rights partners. Both a sports banking investor and a global branding expert who has worked with some of the top soccer clubs in the world told ESPN that the NWSL needs a multi-faceted approach to scaling up. What happens if the NWSL falls short of its lofty goal for media rights valuations in upcoming negotiations? And what good are more games on TV without regular content surrounding them to feed fandom? Berman & Co. have openly discussed the need for better storytelling around the league, a process that has only recently begun in earnest. NWSL expansion makes financial sense for the league, and it helps address the historical shortage of professional opportunities for women's soccer players where two previous U.S. leagues have failed. Thirty-team leagues in a single division are unheard of globally. Several NWSL general managers expressed concerns about the quality of the league's player pool if expansion continues, with only one out of 14 saying they think 30 teams is a good idea. The NWSL appears to be mindful of those concerns about compromising the product, and a second division could launch as early as next year for franchises to field reserve teams. Each solution could allow for more professional development of young players. "Our strategy is really clear," Berman told ESPN recently about the league's area of focus. We want to ensure that people know of the NWSL and want to watch our games and want to attend our games and know the stories of our players. "On the sporting side, we need to make sure that we have the best product, best players in the world, and that we're developing systems and practices to cultivate the path to pro so that we can continue to scale and grow from an expansion perspective in order for us to capitalize on the incredible demand that exists across the country from an expansion perspective and to be a 30-team league, we have to make sure that we have the ability to source talent domestically and proactively develop that talent." The NWSL's prospective second division league could also feature non-NWSL members -- which is an expansion strategy, too. One team owner noted that the second division could be seen as a testing ground for NWSL expansion markets. Outside factors will also influence the future of NWSL expansion. Tampa Bay Sun FC, playing in a market the NWSL recently looked at in depth, just won the inaugural USL Super League title. The WNBA is also expanding, and some investors might chase teams in that league as their entry point into the women's sports boom. Internally, the NWSL still has several clubs underperforming as businesses. It is possible that an investment group interested in entering the NWSL will view the acquisition of an existing team as a better investment than starting from scratch, although those opinions vary by investor and team. What is clear is that investors are still hungry to get into women's sports and the NWSL specifically even as valuations rise to $250 million, nearly a hundred times more than some team valuations just five years ago. Berman believes the NWSL can support 30 teams and that there are enough players to fill those rosters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American midfielder Tyler Adams grew up roughly 76 miles from where he made his professional soccer debut, and after growing into one of the leading role models for the U.S. men's national team, the New York native was honored in his hometown. Adams was in Wappinger Falls on Tuesday as Martz Field Recreation Facility honored the midfielder with the newly named Tyler Adams Soccer Pitch. A former High School graduate of local Roy C. Ketcham High School, Adams helped led drills with youth soccer players as part of his partnership with Scotts lawn care products to help raise awareness about the expansion of youth access to natural-turf sports fields. ‚ÄúNo, I definitely never dreamed of that,‚Äù Adams said in an exclusive interview with SBI when asked if he ever thought of a local field being named after him. I'm really thankful to not only Scotts and my partnership with them, but also to the people in my community that helped really make this possible. I've seen it grow tremendously in just the past eight years since I've been playing for the national team, so after the World Cup on home soil and so many other tournaments, I can only imagine what it will do.‚Äù Adams made his USMNT debut back in 2017 and has quickly become a leading face of the program, on and off the field. He recently made his 50th cap, while serving as captain throughout the summer in Mauricio Pochettino's squad. ‚ÄúHaving the luxury of playing a World Cup on home soil is amazing,‚Äù Adams said. ‚ÄúWhen I first started with the national team, it was probably not as focused on the development of players as it is now,‚Äù Adams said. It's a huge privilege to see the growth of U.S. Soccer and I can only imagine that in another eight years time, it's going to be even better. I take huge pride in being an experienced player now and helping those young players reach their maximum potential.‚Äù Adams will now have a short break from action before beginning preseason camp with English Premier League club Bournemouth ahead of the PL Summer Series in the U.S. Adams most recently completed his second season with the Cherries, delivering a sensational individual campaign of 32 appearances and three assists. The South Coast club finished ninth in EPL play, missing out on European qualification by nine points. Andoni Iraola's men also reached the FA Cup quarterfinals while watching international stars like Adams, Justin Kluivert, Antoine Semenyo, and many others shine during the 2024-25 campaign. Despite the losses of Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez to Real Madrid and Liverpool respectively this summer, Adams credited Bournemouth's impact on helping those players earn monumental moves in their careers. ‚ÄúThe growth of the club is reflected by some players going to play at big clubs like Real Madrid Liverpool, that only happens with team success,‚Äù Adams said. The Cherries will face off with fellow EPL clubs Everton, West Ham United, and Manchester United during an eight-day period before returning to England for the final matches of their preseason schedule. It will mark the second PL Summer Series in the last three years in North America, which has led to many international stars showing off their talents across several future World Cup venues.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This summer's expanded Club World Cup began with 32 teams from six confederations, and two of the sport's most recognizable sides are left vying for the trophy. The also match features the FIFA Club World Cup Halftime Show headlined by musical artists J Balvin, Doja Cat and Tems. The Brazilian striker was recently acquired from fellow English Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion. He joins an attack led by midfielder Cole Palmer, who posted 29 goal contributions (16g/13a) last season. Should head coach Enzo Maresca's side prevail, it would mark their second trophy in six weeks after winning the UEFA Conference League in May. PSG are one game away from yet another title, having won Ligue 1 and the UEFA Champions League during the 2024-25 campaign. They were also crowned Coupe de France and Troph√©e des Champions winners. Head coach Luis Enrique's side has outscored their opponents 10-0 in the knockout stages, most recently rolling to a 4-0 semifinal victory over LaLiga giants Real Madrid. Fabi√°n Ruiz netted a brace alongside goals from Ousmane Demb√©l√© and Gon√ßalo Ramos. This is PSG's first-ever Club World Cup final appearance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USA captain Tyler Adams believes his country's summer of soccer has been a 'wake up call' ahead of the World Cup next year. Both the expanded Club World Cup and Gold Cup have been hosted in the United States this summer, and Adams believes organizers will have their hands full when 48 nations descend upon the USA, Mexico and Canada in 2026. And I'm honestly very thankful that they're having the Club World Cup and Gold Cup there, and all these tournaments there right now, because I think it's a big wake up call for what they need to prepare for,' Adams said, while promoting his partnership with lawncare company Scotts. 'In terms of, stadiums weren't even necessarily all full for these Club World Cup games, and they're going to be completely full for World Cup games. You need to prepare for these kinds of things when they happen, and make sure teams are prepared for them as well.' Tyler Adams believes World Cup organizers will have their work cut out for them next year FIFA president Gianni Infantino brought an expanded Club World Cup to the USA this summer Some games earlier in the tournament struggled for crowds, though it has gained momentum The home of the New York Giants and Jets in East Rutherford, New Jersey is notoriously inconvenient to get to, and Adams is already wary of the challenges that could present fans next year. It's not the normal Premier League where you can take a bus. It's going to be not easy,' he said from his hometown of Wappingers Falls, New York on Tuesday. 'But listen, also, we're getting escorted in police escorts and all this stuff. So we have a luxury of being there, but for fans and stuff like that, it could prove to be difficult at times.' Christian Pulisic, most notably, earned plenty of criticism for taking a summer break to recharge his batteries, while Antonee Robinson, Sergino Dest and Folarin Balogun all took time away as well for injury maintenance. People are talking about the culture of our team, and guys that want to be there. They're significant in every single part of US Soccer,' he said. 'So if people need a rest and people don't need to be there, that's obviously a personal decision and a decision that they need to make, and whenever they start to funnel back in now, we know that we have something to build off of with the players that were there. Christian Pulisic was criticized by some for his decision to skip the Gold Cup and rest up 'So again, they're gonna have a significant role to play with the national team, no matter the circumstances, but we are building something special under Mauricio and he's done a really good job.' Pochettino has had a choppy start with the United States, as his side have struggled against top competition, including a 4-0 friendly loss to Switzerland - admittedly without his top players. There has also been a perception in certain corners that the Argentine, 53, is not fully committed to the job, and it didn't help his reputation when a report from Irish outlet The42.ie claimed that he had interviewed for the Brentford job. He later denied the report while speaking to Fox Sports, and Adams wasn't overly concerned with hearing his coach's name next to a big opening. 'I mean, he's coached PSG, Chelsea, Southampton, Tottenham, those are all massive jobs. So I'm not surprised by it at all, and I can guarantee mid-season in the Premier League, there will be coaches that are getting sacked, and he'll be linked to a job in the Premier League. 'That's just the nature of being a coach, and it works both ways. It's like, anything can change in a blink of an eye. So you obviously always have to be on your toes. Adams didn't play under Pochettino until March following the coach's appointment to the role in September, but came away hugely impressed by what he saw during a nearly 40-day stretch of working together this summer. 'He's such an open person, and he's very transparent in the way that he works, which is great, because I think in the beginning people were obviously nervous. The likes of MLS' Diego Luna and Sebastian Berhalter, meanwhile, also made a case for themselves in recent weeks. What's for sure is that Adams views this summer in a positive light. I think 100 per cent, because you gave guys experiences that didn't have experiences in tournaments before with the national team, and they're gonna be able to use those experiences moving forward,' he said. 'So now, the next time we play Mexico, and there's 80,000 people in the stands screaming for goals and whatever, it's nothing new to us. Adams teamed up with Scotts to launch the 'Keep It Real' sweepstakes, which will see five youth sports nonprofits get their grass fields upgraded by the company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What's the best type of pitch to play soccer on? While the answers may vary per person, FIFA has three types of pitch surfaces that are most commonly used: 100% natural grass, hybrid pitches, which use some synthetic fibers to reinforce the natural grass, and 100% synthetic (artificial) fibers. Watch NBC Bay Area News free wherever you are "You're playing on a football field, with laid grass that's all patchy and it breaks up every step you take. It's frustrating," U.S. midfielder Weston McKennie said after a Copa America game in Atlanta. Hopefully, there's someone who will look at that going into the World Cup next year.‚Äù That's where U.S. men's national team star Tyler Adams comes in. Adams is helping initiate the ‚ÄúKeep It Real‚Äù Sweepstakes from July 10 to July 24, which will give five youth sports organizations across the country the chance to win a complete refurbishment for their natural turf playing field with Scotts products. So, where did Adams choose to launch the sweepstakes and provide a field makeover? "It holds a special place in my heart so to be able to now make it an even better environment for young kids just like I was growing up here, it's really, really nice." Adams explained the advantages of natural turf over artificial, which has a higher injury risk for players of any age. "Playing on grass for kids is just so much better. "It keeps you outdoors, the smell of fresh-cut grass is one of the reasons you grow up loving to play soccer...It keeps them cool during the hot days. On the field, Adams and the USMNT are coming off a Gold Cup final loss to Mexico, where they fell 2-1 to El Tri's A team despite missing numerous key players themselves. He offered a positive outlook on what's to come. "I think there was so much talk about the expectations on the team going into this tournament with a fairly unexperienced team. To give ourselves an opportunity to play in a final with so much outside noise and so many what ifs...the guys did really well embracing it and taking their opportunity," Adams said. "Every single player that was in that camp deserves to be representing the national team at the highest level and every single player made their mark. Adams enjoys what Pochettino brings to the table due to the Argentine's resume and how Adams himself is still developing at 26 years old. "When you have a coach of that caliber come in it obviously excites you because he's had the opportunity to coach so many amazing players and build so many amazing teams," Adams said. "For me as a young player who's still developing, to work alongside someone with those experiences is really, really cool." Adams added that the 40 days spent together in the tournament helped him learn more about Pochettino through more authentic conversations, especially ones outside of soccer that made their coach-to-player relationship more relatable. After captaining the U.S. in Qatar at a young age, Adams is now establishing similar relationships with his younger teammates. "I was once in their shoes at some point and I had leaders and experienced players that helped guide me through the stages whether it was Michael Bradley or Alejandro Bedoya, big players," Adams said. I'm doing everything I can to put them in positions to succeed, whether it's on the field and giving them good passes and putting them in positions to score goals and have an assist or if it's off the field if they need a shoulder to lean on or have a conversation, help them through those things. They're going to be important players for us moving forward." "Leaving our mark is going even further than what we did in the past World Cup, showing that we developed, showing that there's such a big ambition of how we want to improve soccer in the U.S." Going a step further, Adams is amped to have the opportunity to play in a home World Cup given that not many will experience the feeling.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Premier League bosses are refusing to shift Chelsea's opening fixture - even after the Blues reached the Club World Cup final. Chelsea are scheduled to face Crystal Palace on Sunday, August 17, which comes just 34 days after the Blues play against Paris Saint-Germain in the final in New York's MetLife Stadium this Sunday. That leaves Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca's plans in tatters, as they will have just over a month for both a holiday for the players and then straight into pre-season training ahead of the kick-off. It will put immense pressure on Chelsea's squad and also leave them facing potential exhaustion after their impressive run to the Club World Cup final. The Blues are understood to have asked for help from the Premier League, but their chief football officer Tony Scholes insisted that there could be no special favours for either Chelsea or Manchester City following their participation in the States. The Premier League feel it is an example of the challenges faces by domestic leagues after FIFA expanded their calendar. But they feel that FIFA should have considered this aspect before putting another major club competition into the football calendar. City boss pep Guardiola admitted during the tournament that it could be a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù for their forthcoming season. They ended up going home on June 30 after losing to Al-Hilal so will get an extra two weeks on Chelsea. Maybe in November, December, January, ask me, Pep. I may say: ‚ÄòSo listen, we are a disaster. Speaking back in May, ahead of the Club World Cup, Maresca admitted he would have to be careful with managing the burden placed on his players. ‚ÄúFor sure, there is a chance we have players who because of the amount of games they can get injured or be tired. I can understand people thinking ‚Äòyeah but they earn (so) much money, that it's not a problem' but it's about health, protecting players.‚Äù Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has opened an office in Trump Tower in New York City, the organization's president Gianna Infantino announced this week, in the latest sign of deepening ties between soccer's governing body and President Trump before the U.S. hosts next year's World Cup. Infantino announced the decision in a presentation at the Trump Organization's Manhattan headquarters Monday, where he was joined by the president's son Eric Trump and former Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo, a two-time World Cup winner. "So today, we are opening an office of FIFA here in Trump Tower," Infantino said. The FIFA president added that soccer's governing body has "received such a big support" from the Trump White House and its World Cup task force. That government task force is chaired by Mr. Trump, whom Infantino called "a big fan of soccer." CBS News has reached out to FIFA and the Trump Organization for comment. The FIFA president has built close ties with Mr. Trump since he returned to office in January. "Great job, Gianni," Mr. Trump said at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum. In protest, delegates from FIFA's European confederation, UEFA, walked out of that session. In a statement to CBS News, UEFA called Infantino's delay "deeply regrettable" and backed its representatives, saying that the "last minute" request by FIFA to "accommodate private political interests does the game no service." Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters this week he plans to attend the final of the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday. The Club World Cup brings individual clubs from all six continental confederations of FIFA. Under the new format, 32 teams were selected for this year's tournament based on their domestic and international achievements. Although similar in name, the better-known World Cup features national teams only. Last summer, it opened a legal and compliance division office in Miami. Two Canadian, three Mexican, and 11 American cities will welcome 48 nations to the iconic competition, up from 32, its first increase since 1998. Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a massive spending law that passed both chambers of Congress last week, allocates $625 million for World Cup security funding. It also offers $1 billion for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. The event attracts a massive television audience, with some 570 million viewers tuning into the 2022 Finals match, according to figures from FIFA. But the selection process has increasingly attracted controversy, with FIFA facing allegations of corruption and bribery in the way it has managed past contests to secure hosting and media rights. "We want to make football truly global and in order for football to become truly global, we need to embrace the entire globe," Infantino said in the draw ceremony of the 2023 Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia.

Soccer fans couldn't contain their excitement as international star Lionel Messi and Inter Miami took on the New England Revolution in an MLS match at Gillette Stadium Wednesday night. 

The match took place just one year before Gillette is set to host seven matches in the FIFA World Cup tournament next summer. 

Messi fans packed the stadium on Wednesday, taking over the home of the Revolution. 

"Really looking forward to seeing Messi play," fan Lucy Pulcifer said, "The move to Miami, I was like amazing, maybe I'll see him here cause I'll never get to go to Europe."

Local hotels near Foxborough say they will open up rooms for World Cup dates in January, and that the rooms will go fast.

On Airbnb, some hosts are seeing a major spike in revenue, with one home going for $15,000 for the duration of the tournament compared to $4,000 in April and May.

Inter Miami beat the Revolution 2-1 on Wednesday night behind two goals from Messi.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shades of David Luiz's hamstring in the 2012 Champions League final? It was almost a perfect win on Tuesday against Fluminense in the Club World Cup semifinals, but then just a few minutes from time, Mois√©s Caicedo appeared to twist his ankle in an otherwise fairly innocuous and routine play. He tried to play on after hobbling off initially, but would end up watching the final few seconds from the touchline anyway, with Enzo Maresca urging him to take it easy lest he aggravate things unnecessarily. Afterwards, the head coach revealed some worry over Caicedo's status for Sunday's final. Coaches tend to be optimistic over injuries, so this is a definite concern. When it happened I told him that we could play with 10 players and hope it doesn't get worse. Hopefully he can be fit for Sunday.‚Äù Caicedo made no mention of the injury in is post-match Instagram post, but as per a fan video on Twitter, he didn't exactly look too comfortable coming off the team bus. Twisted ankles don't just go away in a few days unfortunately. With D√°rio Essugo and Rom√©o Lavia already out with injuries as well, it would be either Reece James or Andrey Santos to deputize for Moi. James was set to start in that role in the quarterfinals when Caicedo was suspended, until his own pre-match injury forced him out. Santos, who probably should've started anyway, did quite well unsurprisingly ‚Äî and, as a bonus, he already has direct knowledge of PSG, too! Which way shall the stars align?
