                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The head of the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday appeared to nod to conspiracy theories that have swirled around recent extreme weather events, directing people to the agency's website for science-based information on geoengineering and contrails. In a post on X, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that people “have legitimate questions about contrails and geoengineering, and they deserve straight answers.” “We're publishing everything EPA knows about these topics on these websites,” he wrote in a press release Thursday that promised “total transparency with the American public.” “EPA shares the significant reservations many Americans have when it comes to geoengineering activities," he said. The new websites offer a variety of information that appears to stick closely to generally accepted definitions and science around geoengineering and the government's ongoing research on contrails. Some sections even debunk the more outlandish claims of government weather control. “Has large-scale solar geoengineering deployment already happened?” the EPA's new “Frequent Questions” section asks, answering: “No. The U.S. government is not engaged in any form of outdoor solar geoengineering testing (e.g., small-scale experiments designed to study injection technologies) or large-scale deployment (e.g., intentional use of SRM to cool the Earth).” SRM refers to solar radiation modification. Severe weather events have hammered parts of the United States  in recent days. In Texas, at least 120 people have died and 173 are still missing after a devastating flood wiped out at least six communities July 4. Four days later, in New Mexico, at least three people died after a flood in Ruidoso, a resort town already susceptible to mudslides and runoff after two catastrophic fires last year. Scientifically baseless claims of weather control have become an increasingly common reaction to extreme weather, moving from the fringe and into some mainstream discourse. Fake,” Kandiss Taylor, a Republican congressional candidate in Georgia, said in a July 5 post on X about the Texas flood, now pinned on her page. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeated chemtrail misinformation, welcomed Zeldin's move. “Im so proud of my friend Lee Zeldin and President Donald Trump for their commitment to finally shatter the Deep State Omerta regarding the diabolical mass poisoning of our people, our communities, our waterways and farms, and our purple mountains, majesty,” he wrote in a post on X in reply to Zeldin. The EPA resources Zeldin pointed to, however, offered no evidence of a diabolical plot. Still, claims of weather-control technology, once confined to relatively fringe circles, have gained some traction in the Republican Party. After Hurricanes Milton and Helene last year, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., claimed “they can control the weather.” On Saturday, she said she was introducing a bill that “prohibits the injection, release, or dispersion of chemicals or substances into the atmosphere for the express purpose of altering weather, temperature, climate, or sunlight intensity.” Burchett's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Following Milton and Helene, the NOAA released a fact sheet in October 2024 to try to debunk “weather modification claims” that swelled after those two storms decimated communities in Florida and North Carolina. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax, even as scientists have increasingly found strong evidence connecting the growing severity and frequency of extreme weather to global warming. Decades of research into weather modification has at times become fodder for conspiracy theorists. NOAA hasn't attempted similar research since, according to the fact sheet. Cloud seeding is a weather modification technology currently in use. Currently, cloud seeding programs are primarily used in Western states to boost water supplies, and companies are required to file notices before implementing them. “Cloud seeding doesn't make water; it helps clouds in marginal environments to release 5-15% more moisture. But in Texas, there was already 100% humidity, extreme moisture and storms. The spread of these claims has coincided with an uptick in threats directed at meteorologists. While geoengineering is a legitimate scientific endeavor, claims about its ability to control major weather patterns or create severe weather are not grounded in reality. Federal researchers have taken only a few small steps toward studying their feasibility, and atmospheric scientists say there is no evidence of any large-scale programs. Last year in Alameda, California, a small-scale testing project of a form of geoengineering called marine cloud brightening by academic scientists was shut down after community outcry, despite researchers demonstrating that the actions were harmless. Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert explained that conspiratorial thinking usually spikes during moments of collective fear and uncertainty, especially during weather events in which people feel powerless. “Conspiracy theories offer an emotionally satisfying narrative: They restore a sense of control by framing events as intentional acts by powerful agents rather than random, chaotic phenomena,” Alpert told NBC. However, while some view the EPA's move as an act of transparency, others believe it's merely the latest political maneuver to avoid critical environmental issues. “Some people have ‘questions' about whether birds are real — will that be your next project?” Rep. Don Beyer D-Va., said in response to Zeldin's Thursday morning post on X teasing the EPA guidelines. “How much taxpayer money will you be spending on this?” Evan Bush is a science reporter for NBC News.</p>

New York City's Walker Hotels is going to the dogs. The company's Tribeca and Greenwich Village locations have both added a bundle of new services to lure four-legged guests (and their human companions) to stay there. And at the top of that list is a Pup Psychic in Residence. The wellness package for canines will be available through Aug. 26 and is being done in conjunction with Happy Trails, a NYC doggy day-care facility, and pet food brand Ollie. Guests at the Walker Hotel Greenwich Village will pay $495 a night. Last year, Bark Air took to the sky—an airline that caters to dogs (and their humans) with first-class experiences in a private GulfStream jet. Even with that spend, there's research that says owning a pet can make someone more fiscally responsible (though we're not sure if that applies to people who invest in a pet psychic).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paranormal Activity, the found footage horror franchise created by Oren Peli in 2007, is set to continue—not with another sequel, but on the West End stage in London. It will be directed by Felix Barrett, the co-creator of the immersive theater experience Sleep No More, which ran from 2011 to 2025 in New York City. "I'm so thrilled that 'Paranormal' will have a chance to ensnare and unnerve audiences in London later this year. From seeing the advertising campaign of the film 20 years ago, where you watched cinema audiences leap out of their chairs in horror, I have long wondered how you could recreate that visceral reaction in a theater setting. How do you bring one of the most frightening films to life? How do you break the inherent safety that a plush West End theater offers? It's been an incredible challenge, and we cannot wait to see how London audiences respond." Let's dive in and check how Rotten Tomatoes' critics feel about the found footage franchise, Paranormal Activity. A horror play sounds awesome – especially one rooted in Paranormal Activity. As reported by Variety, "the story follows a couple, James and Lou, who move from Chicago to London and discover a haunting presence in their home. So they use a camera to document the unsettling shadow in their midst." Levi Holloway—known for writing Grey House, which starred Tatiana Maslany—is adapting the stage version. "Collaborating with Felix Barrett to create an actual nightmare has been nothing short of a dream. Relishing in a shared language of dread, we've conspired to create something impossible, mixing the familiar with the uncanny, heart with horror. They'll find it here, right alongside all the mischief we've made to trouble their sleep." It is rumored that the film was shot in seven days, but it was enough to make Paranormal Activity. At some point, executives (Steven Spielberg among them) thought the film could be reshot with higher production value, but test screenings showed the success of Peli's original approach. The film became a horror phenomenon and one of cinema's most profitable films. It was successful enough for Peli to reach a deal to produce a sequel, and eventually, oversee an entire horror franchise. Although Paranormal Activity is now taking an unconventional direction with a stage play, it is proof that there's still some juice in the franchise about the evil spirits tormenting an entire bloodline and those who dare to summon them. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. As is usually the case with gangster tales, the show has several power players, each with a varying degree of influence. Embeth Davidtz has worked with the very best for decades, and she's been taking notes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After all, for the psychic medium, “I have the spirit world talking to me constantly,” he admitted in a joint interview with wife Alexa Fraser. And, you know, souls don't care whether you're feeding your baby, changing a diaper or being called into the next room because a kid is screaming.” Or, as it turns out, if you're doing an interview with E! Because as the parents of sons Royce, 2, and Rowan, 4 months, broke down their new podcast Undeniable Proof, Matt paused to acknowledge my dad, who died in 2019. “Right away, I heard his soul,” Matt revealed. “He tells me you get messages from him. And what's so beautiful is I see he's been a guide for you your whole life.” And skeptics, don't ghost us just yet: There was no Internet sleuthing or last-minute Googling. Kanye "Ye" West's Wife Bianca Censori Looks So Different With Bold New Hairstyle Wimbledon 2025: Hugh Grant Falls Asleep in Queen Camilla's Royal Box Jinger, Jessa and Joy-Anna Duggar Detail Miscarriages, Pregnancy Losses in Rare Sit-Down “First of all, what people put online is not the real version of them,” the Don't Wait Till You're Dead author emphasized of why he doesn't do his research, comparing his approach to a jury focused on evidence presented in court. In fact, admitted Alexa, mid-reading, “he'll actually tell people to stop talking." Because in Matt's field, knowledge isn't power. Having done readings for stars like Kelly Clarkson and Gloria Estefan, “I want everything I'm hearing to be from the spirit world,” he shared. “Being a psychic medium is all about tuning into the energy around you, tuning into your loved ones and hearing their messages." Those messages start hours or even days before he reads the room. “I'll get little notions where someone will come in and be like, ‘My mom is coming to see you,'” the 33-year-old explained. “The spirits are tapping me saying, ‘I'm here. Because next he'll see visions “which are like daydreaming while you're awake,” Matt described. Or maybe just something you really need to hear. “I was just connecting with a father who wanted his daughter to know, ‘I'm not going to miss your wedding,'” Matt recalled. We know you're conjuring up an image of Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost playing telephone with the dead, but Matt swears it's less séance; more group chat. “I'll hear whispers of names, dates, places,” he continued. “That's when I get emotional,” the Rhode Island native admitted. “Anything that takes him out of the spiritual space for a little.” She has her own brushes with the beyond, too. When the couple was trying to conceive, “Alexa met our son before he was actually even born,” Matt said of his wife, who dreamt of being pregnant, delivering a brown-eyed boy and vacationing at Disney together. I would get visions and premonitions from pregnancy.” Or, she said, “Royce could be psychic, and he was in me.” Matt's mom and grandmother—the first spirit he spoke with as a toddler—were both psychic mediums and now, the couple are seeing similar signs (the spirit kind, too) with their son. “He reminds me so much of Matt, not only his personality,” Alexa explained, “but the way he thinks and views the world. To me, that's a dead giveaway he could be psychic.” As Matt weighed in, “The other night, the baby monitor went off and he was sitting up in his bed, reaching for something that wasn't there.” While Royce is quick to yell out for his parents if he's upset, “He didn't call for us,” marveled Matt. So, for now, Royce remains unaware of the family business. “I haven't told him exactly what I do because I want to see what he picks up and how he understands it,” Matt, currently on his North American Undeniable Proof of Life After Death tour, told E!. I ask him, ‘What do you think that Daddy does?' They're waiting for Royce to connect the dots on his own. “I don't want to influence him,” Matt continued. “I want him to come to me when he's ready and talk about what he might be seeing or experiencing.” In the meantime, Matt and Alexa are happy to influence the rest of us with their bi-weekly podcast featuring interviews with paranormal hunters, hospice nurses, influencers, Reiki practitioners and more. “And this is an escape to figure out that you're not alone, that there are souls are guiding you, that are with you.”You just have to look for the signs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was also after "Swan Song" that Supernatural's creator, Eric Kripke, left the show. Both Supernatural season 5 and Supernatural season 15's finales offered massive emotional conclusions that were not only heartbreaking but also brought the brothers' stories to a bittersweet end in different ways. In season 5, this meant Dean and Sam essentially fulfilling the roles they were always intended to, at least from a divine perspective. That is, Sam had become the vessel for Lucifer, and although Dean hadn't been the vessel for Michael in the end, this still more or less saw each brother fulfilling their destiny. This ending of course would have been gutting as the show's end, because Dean was now left without Sam, Castiel, or Bobby, but it certainly felt full-circle. After five seasons (and decades of his life), Sam was able to overcome his feelings of being inadequate, 'evil,' and beyond saving, and fix what he'd done by kicking off the Apocalypse. Sam was able to overcome his feelings of being inadequate, 'evil,' and beyond saving, and fix what he'd done by kicking off the Apocalypse. The way Dean Winchester died (or died for the final time, given Dean had many deaths in Supernatural) remains very controversial for some, as he wasn't taken out by some massive supernatural force but rather by a piece of rebar. Yet, after Dean's death, Supernatural's final episode, "Carry On," gave the boys perhaps as happy an ending as they were ever going to get. Dean did die, but he also went to Heaven, and viewers got to see him happily driving Baby, truly at peace. Although we never see his wife's face (the prevailing theory is that Sam married Eileen), Sam got married and had a son, whom he named Dean. Supernatural season 15's ending posed a huge question about Sam Winchester's life after the show ends, and a potential season 16 would answer it. It's also worth noting, those who take issue with the series finale tend to dislike that Dean and Sam end up separated, with Sam living decades longer than Dean. Supernatural was in part able to sustain 15 seasons because of the show's brilliant storytelling, and while some seasons of Supernatural were better than others, as is true of any show, both the season 5 finale and the season 15 finale of Supernatural exhibited that powerful, compelling storytelling. However, season 5's "Swan Song" has a leg up on season 15's "Carry On" for one reason: "Swan Song" was much more intentionally planned than "Carry On"—and that's not really the show's fault. This means that, while story details no doubt shifted and developed over time in those first five seasons, the target was generally that season 5 arc. Because of safety regulations and various other issues arising from COVID, certain aspects of the Supernatural season 15 ending were changed. The most notable of these returns was Misha Collins' appearance as Castiel. Particularly given how heartbreaking Castiel and Dean's farewell was when Castiel was taken by the Empty, it certainly seems as though seeing Castiel again on screen would have been a significant moment that would have had an impact on the finale. Despite still being divisive four years later, Supernatural's series finale concluded 15 years of television, even if some aspects weren't great. Ultimately, Supernatural season 5 felt more aligned with all that had come before in the show. For five seasons, tensions had been building between Dean and Sam, Sam had increasingly been forced to face the reality not only of his past but also of what he'd done, and the show had become about this divine showdown between Lucifer and Michael. Even the massive showdown aside, there are simply elements of the series finale that still don't sit well with many viewers, Dean's death being one of them. Whereas the season 5 finale felt like a bittersweet, full-circle moment, wherein both brothers fulfilled their destinies, many felt as though Dean's death made no sense for his character. "Swan Song" just seems to better capture the relationship between Dean and Sam and all that they had been through, and it feels like a more carefully-crafted conclusion to all that had taken place in Supernatural up to that point. However, were that episode the series finale, it would mean everything that occurred in Supernatural following season 5 would never have come to be, and that would truly be a shame. Countless characters, storylines, brilliant scenes, and touching moments only came about in those 10 later seasons, and I wouldn't want to trade that for the season 5 finale. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. It was even worse than Game of Thrones' ending. I used to rewatch it all the time and I haven't watched a single episode since it ended, the ending tainted the entire show for me and I'm still not over it. James Spader has many great movies and shows, but one of his best is a masterpiece with 91% on Rotten Tomatoes all crime thriller fans should watch. Greta Gerwig must achieve several important things when adapting The Chronicles of Narnia related to the story's characters, world, and tone. In a huge change to Marvel lore, Deadpool's Wade Wilson is taking on a dark new name that reveals the horrific endgame of his healing factor. Al Pacino has played many gangsters, but his 1997 anti-Godfather crime movie may have a character better than his role in Coppola's movies. From Lost to How I Met Your Mother, some TV shows amassed such a huge fan base that it was impossible for the ending to satisfy them all.</p>
