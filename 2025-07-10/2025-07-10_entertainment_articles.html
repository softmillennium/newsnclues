When François Truffaut made his feature directorial debut with “The 400 Blows” in 1959, it quickly became an international sensation and the French New Wave's first smash hit. Along with Jean-Luc Godard‘s “Breathless,” it established many of the conventions for which the French New Wave would become known: documentary-style location shooting, playful experimentation with editing and film form, and most importantly, a direct connection between the filmmaker's personality and the action on screen. Anyone with even a cursory awareness of the director's biography can see the direct link between him and “The 400 Blows” hero Antoine Doinel, a 14-year old constantly at odds with a world of adults who don't understand him and don't care to — just as Truffaut was before he was taken under the wing of movie critic Andre Bazin and introduced to the cinephilia that would consume him until his premature death at the age of 52. Related Stories Ebon Moss-Bachrach: Mark Ruffalo Made Me Less ‘Anxious' About Working with CGI for ‘The Fantastic Four: First Steps' Henry Golding Wanted to Do Something Totally Different — Nacho Vigalondo's Sci-Fi Love Story Fit the Bill “The 400 Blows” is often given credit for kicking off the French New Wave — that glorious era that saw exciting work by Godard, Claude Chabrol, Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, Agnes Varda, and others exploding into theaters throughout the 1960s and beyond — but it kicked off something else too: a then unique experiment in world cinema in which Truffaut found an onscreen surrogate and tracked his journey from youth to adulthood over the course of five films and 20 years. What turned Antoine Doinel into a recurring character was an offer for Truffaut to contribute to an omnibus film called “Love at 20” in 1962. Motivated primarily by a desire to work with Léaud again, Truffaut took the opportunity to check in with Doinel a few years after “The 400 Blows” left the character frozen in time after his escape from a juvenile detention facility. While there are superficial substitutions — Doinel works for a record label and music occupies the same place in his life that cinema occupied for Truffaut — the basic trajectory of “Antoine and Doinel” follows that of Truffaut's real life, when as a young man he became obsessed with a beautiful young woman and moved into the building across the street from her family. Yet, already, the Antoine Doinel movies are moving away from straight autobiography and toward what they would ultimately become: a fusion of Truffaut and Léaud's personalities, as the movies become as much about capturing the actor at specific moments in time as they are about recreating the filmmaker's youthful experiences. Like Richard Linklater's “Boyhood,” the Antoine Doinel movies serve as a kind of meditation on the passage of time and how well suited the cinema is to capture it; while we obviously watch many, many actors grow up on film, there's something about seeing the actor return to the same character over an extended duration that draws more focused attention to the delicate emotional and physical nuances of aging. Starting with 1968's “Stolen Kisses,” Truffaut becomes more detached from Doinel, his camera taking on an increasingly objective position and his perspective broadening beyond that of his solipsistic protagonist (an evolution that would reach its apex in “Love on the Run,” where for the first time Truffaut leaves Doinel behind entirely for an extended stretch of time to follow one of the women in his life independently of his observations). Unlike Truffaut, Doinel does not seem particularly ambitious — in “Stolen Kisses,” he stumbles through a series of odd jobs (including, in a storyline that mixes whimsy and poignancy in a manner that Peter Bogdanovich might have had on his mind when he made “They All Laughed,” a stint as a private detective), and getting married in “Bed and Board” (1970) doesn't make him any more committal about a profession. It's not until the final “Love on the Run” that he makes good on his goal to become a novelist, and it's hard to get a sense of whether or not he's a particularly good or popular one. While “Stolen Kisses” depicts Doinel's developing relationship with the woman he will eventually marry, and “Bed and Board” depicts his attempts to escape from that marriage — and further attempts to return to it — “Love on the Run” forces its restless hero and the audience watching him to slow down and take stock. It's filled with flashbacks to scenes from the other movies, and it's in these that the subtle power of Truffaut's experiment becomes most evident. As Doinel looks back on his life, his inability to appreciate what he has reveals itself to be the defining problem of his adulthood — and an ongoing source of pain for the women he professes to love. This lover character, Lucien, is only onscreen in “Blows” for a few minutes, and we've long forgotten about him by the time we get to his appearance in “Love on the Run.” Yet when Lucien tells Doinel that his mother truly loved him, it's the moment in the series where everything crystallizes — the effect this revelation has on Doinel, who finally, after five films, slows down for self-reflection, makes it clear that everything we've been watching has been connected to the character's search for the mother he never felt was there for him. The scene with the lover is clearly informed by Truffaut's own discovery, after his mother's death, of papers left behind that proved she was more attached to her son than he ever perceived. In “Love on the Run,” it serves as the catalyst for Doinel's belated awareness of his own limitations as an artist, a husband, and a lover. Though in keeping with the series' overall tone, this awareness is only incremental. “I would be lying if I said Antoine Doinel succeeded in his transformation into an adult,” Truffaut said of the film, and the bittersweet aftertaste that lingers after the movie's conclusion comes from the open question of whether or not Doinel will really change his behavior at all. For Truffaut, the character steadily became less a way of working out autobiographical impulses than an independent, organic creation that fused personal expression with a different set of desires: the desires Truffaut the Jean-Pierre Léaud fan had to see Jean-Pierre Léaud do certain things on camera that might or might not have been related to anything that had happened to him or Truffaut. If ever there was proof that directors are the least reliable commentators on their own movies (an observation made slightly ironic by Truffaut's own past as a critic), this is it. There's never been a better way to consume all five movies together than the Criterion collection, which improves upon the label's earlier Doinel releases with new 4K restorations of the movies taken from their original negatives. And the movies themselves feel both like time capsules that couldn't have existed in any other era and like the timeless, enduring classics that they are. Doinel can be an exasperating identification figure — even Truffaut himself doesn't seem to have cared much for him once he became an adult — but as a vehicle for Truffaut's musings on love, art, freedom, confinement, work, and class, he's always riveting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: After battling vampirism in the box office smash Sinners, Hailee Steinfeld now has her sights set on a gold medal for her follow-up project as sources tell Deadline she is set to star opposite Miles Teller in Paramount's Olympics film Winter Games. Pat Cunnane and Colaizzo penned the script. Set in the high-stakes arena of the Winter Olympics, the film follows a perpetually overlooked skier (Steinfeld) and a self-sabotaging hockey legend (Teller) who collide at their breaking points. Their unexpected connection threatens her chance for a medal and his shot at a comeback as they navigate romance and redemption in the Olympic Village. Tim and Trevor White are producing on behalf of Star Thrower alongside Teller. Steinfeld is coming off one of the year's biggest hits with the Warner Bros horror thriller Sinners, where she stars opposite Michael B. Jordan. Following an almost two-year break, Steinfeld made her much anticipated return to music on the Sinners soundtrack with “Dangerous.” The song amassed over 4.7 million streams on Spotify in its first month. The film also earned rave reviews, putting it, Steinfeld and her co-stars in the mix for consideration this awards season. Following the film's success, Steinfeld saw a slew of offers come in but, after taking her time,  ultimately landed on Winter Games as her follow-up pic. The second film in the popular trilogy grossed over $690 million globally and received rave reviews. Spider-Gwen will make her return in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse on June 4, 2027. She is repped by CAA and Howard Fishman. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since at least 2022, Jason Momoa has been teasing his next Apple TV+ show Chief Of War, and his project is almost, finally out in the world. The series will also feature a significant amount of dialogue spoken in the Hawaiian language, which Sibbett described as “something from the beginning that was really important for us” in an interview with GQ earlier this year. “We just didn't know if it was something that anybody would ever do. It feels like we're presenting something that's been unseen, and people don't know much about it.” Learning the language, Momoa said, had the added benefit of making him realize he had been sort of mumbling his entire life. “It's so much more involved with the mouth,” he explained. “And Olelo Hawaiian is the most beautiful language, it was just really hard for my mouth to move that way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazilian-born Alec Santos is a quickly rising Hallmark star, having just headlined two Hallmark Channel rom-coms on back-to-back weekends — “A Machu Picchu Proposal” opposite Rhiannon Fish on June 28, 2025, and “Unwrapping Christmas: Tina's Miracle,” which premiered the following weekend. His ability to speak three languages and his worldly upbringing — including moving with his family to Chile at 13 and then to Florida for high school, per Hollywood North Magazine — not play a wide variety of characters but, he says, in the classroom as a substitute teacher. Santos told Woman's World on July 7 that his first teaching job was in northern India, “in a place where the Dalai Lama lives,” where he “taught science and English to Tibetan students.” “I still work as a substitute teacher because anywhere in the world, they always need teachers,” he explained. “Everyone's always surprised that I have a background in science,” Santos continued, “but these are my two passions, and they sometimes meld together. I think some teachers would benefit from a theater class, because you're performing in front of students, and they're the hardest audience in the world.” “Teenagers can be apathetic,” he told Woman's World, “but if you can make them laugh and get them interested in the material, they'll remember your class, and performance certainly helps. On the “Heart Full of Hallmark” podcast in early June, Santos said he “always loved school” when he was growing up, noting that “some of the most influential people in my life have always been teachers.” One — his 10th grade Spanish literature teacher — has even become his best friend later in life, he said. Ironically, though, Santos said on “Heart Full of Hallmark” that he hasn't been successful at landing any acting roles as a teacher. He laughed, “You know, the funny thing is I've auditioned for teacher roles many times, and like, (they say), ‘No you don't look like a teacher.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On May 13, as Netflix broke ground to redevelop 292 acres in Central New Jersey for a massive $848 million new film and TV production facility with 12 soundstages, Fort Monmouth County commissioner director Thomas Arnone made an offer to co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who was on hand. “We will make this easy for you,” Arnone said. That may well be the state's promise to Hollywood producers. Gavin Newsom managed to get his legislature to double its cap on incentives from $330 million to $750 million annually, he conceded on July 2 at a press conference that the state had taken its eye off the ball for years. "Stay in L.A." Campaign Sparks Local Documentary Development Grant (Exclusive) California Legislators Pass Bill Expanding State's Film and TV Tax Incentive The Garden State has been a big beneficiary of infrastructure projects, which once may have defaulted to Burbank, heading far outside of Hollywood's 30-mile zone. “Productions aren't just saving money here — they're finding purpose-built facilities, reliable crews, and a serious commitment to the work.” It certainly was not the state's first space used as a studio, however. Cinelease has three soundstages (each with 40 feet of clearance height) totaling 67,600 sq. It has hosted TV and film productions like Wild ‘N' Out season 17, Dumb Money, A Murder at the End of the World and American Horror Stories season three. Its Caven Point location has made Jersey City one of the state's production hotspots. Even where SANJ put on the NJ Film Expo — the mostly-shuttered Meadowlands sports arena — in May has been used as a TV production space. Across the Newark Bay lies another destination for Hollywood productions. Desireè Hadley, who manages the Newark Office of Film and TV, told THR it is Newark's “historic-looking buildings and architecture” that make it “desirable for period pieces.” Our sidewalks, alleys and park paths feature figures from central casting and our workforce is primed to cover every need from craft services, to camera crew, to feature length soundtracks,” Baraka told THR. “Most of all, Newark has a can-do vibe that is fresh and contagious, and sure to add extra magic to any set.” If you need an indoor location in Baraka's town, look no further than Newark Film Studios. The timeless space centers on a mezzanine featuring iconic gold doors and accents. It can easily be dressed up or down for everything from a Roaring Twenties feel to a midcentury-modern aesthetic or even present day. There, movies like West Side Story (2021) and A Complete Unknown filmed scenes, as did TV series like The Plot Against America (2020) and The Equalizer, among others. (Queen Latifah's The Equalizer, a spinoff of the Denzel Washington movies that aired on CBS from 2021-2025, is credited at basically every production space in New Jersey.) Like Cinealease, the old bank, which before this whole Hollywood East thing was occupied by Verizon, has generous ceiling heights throughout, on-site parking and office space used for film and post-production on various floors. The near-100-year-old building is “a blank canvas to meet [the] needs” of film productions, Newark Film Studios founder Joseph Dabbah told THR. That's not just for convenience, it circumvents union upcharges. The rule (basically) works like this: IATSE demands higher wages and hotel stays for its members on productions outside of the 35-mile radius. Inside is considered to be home base, a contractually-acceptable daily commute. Netflix's under-construction Fort Monmouth campus lies outside of that bubble. “Being 20 minutes from New York City by public transit and offering straightforward on-site parking makes a huge difference,” Dabbah said of Newark. The train is great, sure — especially if you want to film some on this side of the NJ/NY border and some on the other side — but what Newark also has going for it is a true international airport. Importing New York talent to a place like Newark is simple. But you'd be making a mistake not to look more locally as well, Diane Raver, the executive director of the New Jersey Film Academy, and Patricia Piroh, the director of production and technology for broadcast and media operations at Montclair State University, both told THR (independently). Raver began her career in TV commercial production, and has filmed “all over the world,” she said, including 20 years in New York City — but she found that “the most diverse and easy place to shoot” was New Jersey. “You can cheat almost any location here, since we have it all,” said Raver, who is from the beach town of Sea Girt, a pretty cool location itself. “Good luck filming a beach scene in Toronto,” Tim Sullivan, the CEO of New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA), quipped to THR. The hoops to jump through aren't that huge either. They're: 1) the productions qualifying expenses must exceed $1 million in New Jersey spend, and 2) 60 percent of the total production expenses (exclusive of post-production costs) must be incurred for services and goods purchased through vendors authorized to do business in New Jersey. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy told THR that the best thing about New Jersey's film tax incentive program isn't even about how much money they're willing to allocate, but rather for how long they're willing to allocate it. The New Jersey Film and Digital Media Tax Credit Program has already been extended through June 30, 2039. Though Murphy is on his way out as governor, the program has bipartisan support, Sullivan said. Thus far, it has helped make New Jersey the sixth-largest state for film and TV productions, according to an April 8, 2025 study by ProdPro. “The state is clearly invested in building a real production ecosystem here,” Dabbah said. “They're not just talking about tax credits — they're actively helping productions find sites, navigate permitting, and plan out stages that are still under construction.” Minimizing red tape has been a major sales pitch beyond the boundaries of Los Angeles County. Look no further than the fact that it took until 2025 for “Stay in L.A.” to become a real rallying cry for California production insiders. New Jersey is clearly thrilled to have Netflix, but officials are not yet satisfied. “One of the knocks on some tax credit programs around the country is that [they are set up to] have a production blow through town. That's fun to have that three or four weeks and it has real economic impact, but are you in the longterm, permanent-job creation [business]?” Sullivan said. What we're really trying to do is encourage brick-and-mortar construction for longterm job creation.” That sounds huge — and it is — until you consider what's going on in Bayonne. Headed way down the New Jersey Turnpike to Atlantic City, which 15 years ago famously lost out on HBO's Boardwalk Empire (about Prohibition-era A.C.) to Brooklyn and Staten Island, ACX1 Films has proposed building over a massive pier on the Atlantic Ocean.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When he was a 19-year-old working any gig he could scrounge up around Boston, Sean O'Brien found himself driving on the set of Malice, the 1993 thriller starring Alec Baldwin and Nicole Kidman. A fourth-generation Teamster from Medford, O'Brien wasn't the type to sip white wine and nibble appetizers with big-time movie stars. But he struck up a relationship with Tom Cruise — then married to Kidman — who often was lingering on the sidelines on shooting days. “I was the youngest guy on the set,” O'Brien recalls, “and he was always coming up talking to me.” The two became so friendly that they even got a touch football game going with Baldwin and a group of Teamsters on an off day. Billy Bush Claims He Flagged Donald Trump's Lewd 'Access Hollywood' Comments to His Producer in 2005 Sergei Loznitsa Thinks 'Two Prosecutors' Will Feel Familiar in U.S., Eyes Stalin Purge Drama Follow-up The moment tells of more than just Cruise's working-man conviviality. These days, following his controversial decision to speak at last summer's Republican National Convention, the 50-something union boss has become one of very few industry emissaries with real clout in the Trump White House, an awkward alignment that's stirred consternation among Hollywood's liberal establishment. Though industry outsiders might associate the Teamsters more with 18-wheelers than star trailers, the organization's members are an inescapable presence on film and TV sets. With Hollywood roots going back to the Great Depression, its 15,000 entertainment worker members of course drive (hauling everything from set dec to talent); cast those very stars to begin with (some 700 of Hollywood's casting directors are represented by the Teamsters); scout production locations; train set animals; and feed cast and crew. A brash blue-collar personality who can seem to enjoy provoking more effete Hollywood types — O'Brien has appeared on his podcast in a black veterans-group T-shirt that reveals his bicep tattoo as he tells saltily colorful stories about his Boston union days — the labor leader believes he can change the standing of the entertainment business in D.C. and, as a result, help ensure the survival of the industry. He is lobbying hard for a federal tax credit, has come out in support of Trump's 100 percent tariff on overseas productions and wants Apple and Amazon to be “put in check” for the harm he believes they're wreaking on the industry. O'Brien's story isn't just about the emergence of a blue-collar power broker of showbiz policy — it's a tale of the braided knot between the gritty world of the Boston white working class and an entertainment business 3,000 miles away that just can't stop portraying it. His public persona merges an old-school toughness with a new-age media savvy — sometimes simultaneously. A few years ago, one of the most surreal sights the modern Congress has ever witnessed had O'Brien at its center when Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin challenged him to a fistfight during a hearing on unions' impact on working families — a challenge the labor leader seemed eager to accept until Sen. Bernie Sanders stepped in to (slightly) lower the temperature. As he has staked out his turf, O'Brien has created something unique in the modern era of Republican and certainly Trumpian politics: a figure who can front Hollywood interests from right inside the White House. But a simple question remains unanswered: Does Hollywood actually want him there? Usually labor leaders turned up at the Democratic National Convention, which, possibly as a result of the RNC speech, O'Brien then wasn't invited to attend. O'Brien himself had dissed Trump during his own election campaign to lead the union, praising then-President Joe Biden and a Democratic-led Congress in 2021 for the COVID stimulus bill that bailed out a Teamster pension fund for nearly 400,000 members. Vice President Kamala Harris broke a Senate tie to advance it. “I want to commend everybody who worked hard on that,” O'Brien said at an election debate against his opponent, Steve Vairma, adding, “You know, it's unfortunate that a lot of our members voted for Trump.” (He also once described the National Labor Relations Board under Trump's first term as a “four-year reign of terror.”) Such comments made O'Brien's about-face in Milwaukee — he gave Trump the ultimate Teamster compliment by calling him “one tough SOB” — that much more striking. But a more straightforward explanation might have also applied: O'Brien was manifesting a move to working-class populism that was rippling through parts of the Republican coalition (a point that O'Brien would later bear out by aligning with Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has positioned himself accordingly). “We have never had access like this,” says O'Brien, who also visited Mar-a-Lago shortly before the inauguration but says he's still a Democrat. Yet O'Brien is vague on what, exactly, all those phone commiserations have yielded. Asked for examples, he first notes the appointment of Lori Chavez-DeRemer as Labor secretary. The naming of the union-leaning former Oregon congresswoman to the post — seen in D.C. as a kind of return-the-favor for O'Brien's decision not to endorse Harris in front of his 1.3 million members — is no small thing given how many departments under Trump, from education to the environment, seem to be undermining their agency's very goals (though progressive stalwart The Nation has strongly criticized Chavez-DeRemer as anti-union). O'Brien is vague in describing other achievements, saying in an interview only that “we have been consulted with on many issues from the administration” and that “we've got full access and we've got credibility.” Such acceptance hasn't sat well with segments of the Teamsters' leadership. Richard Hooker Jr., secretary-treasurer of Local 623 in Philadelphia, believes the White House coziness has mortally damaged both the Teamsters' standing and its goals. So when [nearly] 50,000 TSA workers lose their right to collectively bargain, and the strongest arm of the labor movement doesn't say anything, that sends a loud message to the employers that they can do whatever they want,” he adds, referring to O'Brien's silence in response to the administration's decision in March to neuter workers' rights at the Homeland Security agency. To some critics, O'Brien's alignment with Trump goes beyond utilitarian benefit to a place of identifying with brawler white-male politics; like the president, O'Brien regards himself as a sharp negotiator and, more troublingly to many, has offered up anti-immigrant rhetoric. (“I think the biggest problem is people are trying to protect illegal aliens that come over here and commit crimes, and that's unacceptable,” he told Hawley on his podcast.) But whatever you believe, I don't think you can argue any of this is good for labor,” Allen says, noting that Trump has “a non-functioning NLRB, a non-functioning OSHA and ICE going after working people trying to raise a family.” Even those who don't like O'Brien say he's a master politician, an instinctual learner who has no formal background in politics — he left the University of Massachusetts at Boston after one term to join his father's union as a heavy-equipment driver — but has learned how to strategically corral those once disdainful of him, as he did with left-of-center faction Teamsters for a Democratic Union before his 2021 election. O'Brien handily won that race (he ran on a reform platform promising tougher negotiations with UPS) even though his opponent had been handpicked by the incumbent, James P. Hoffa, generally a golden ticket. Once considered a watchdog for the excesses of union leadership, the Teamsters for a Democratic Union mostly now follows O'Brien. Even casual users of social media might be struck by how often O'Brien seems to be meeting with Republican leaders on entertainment industry issues lately, then posing for a photograph to document his encounters. There goes the union boss talking to Texas Gov. O'Brien says he and Trump speak frequently about entertainment issues. “We thank President Trump for boldly supporting good union jobs when others have turned their heads. O'Brien even went on Fox News to endorse the plan to the network's many Trump fans, giving it an air of Hollywood rank-and-file legitimacy. “Tariff them, make them work in the United States and take a little bit less off your bottom line,” he said. His late father, Billy O'Brien, was a transportation coordinator with Boston's Local 25 for more than five decades. He would sit in their home and flip through the trades to see where his next gig was coming from, often landing big ones, such as on Clint Eastwood's 2003 opus Mystic River or the quintessential Boston movie Good Will Hunting. His fascination with a kind of cinematic toughness was honed early in life, too. The labor leader's fears for Hollywood are similar to what a lot of people in town quietly grumble about: a tech takeover. While studio bosses have historically been the enemy of organized labor, O'Brien sounds an almost wistful note in talking about their stewardship of a tradition he thinks Silicon Valley is now ruining. On that point, Hollywood labor leaders would likely not disagree. But they might note that Amazon and Apple also provide plenty of industry jobs. In a way, O'Brien is channeling the concern that even in 2025 can remain unusually unaired in industry circles: If entertainment is not these companies' core business, what happens when they get tired of the side hustle? The Teamsters leader also is worried about AI and has become an ally of anti-AI advocate Justine Bateman, who sings his praises and even recruited the Teamsters to sponsor her “No AI” film festival in Hollywood in March. “You look at the appetite for convenience in society [not] realizing what the consequences are.” Driverless trucks are of course a bête noire, but O'Brien says he wants to be fighting equally hard against the tech on studio lots. “I mean, you can make a movie on an iPad and create Hollywood characters,” he says. But Trump, who has signaled little interest so far in AI regulation — he gutted a Biden executive order that had modestly attempted that — is an unlikely ally in this regard. And it remains perplexing both inside and outside Hollywood how O'Brien's interest in human-centric labor squares with Trump's seeming apathy on the subject. Other Hollywood-affiliated unions are conspicuously chilly to Trump (SAG-AFTRA has barred the former Apprentice star from readmission, and IATSE has decried him for allegedly crossing its picket line). In response to requests for comment from major Hollywood unions about O'Brien's efforts with the White House, only the actors' union responded, with leader Duncan Crabtree-Ireland not mentioning Trump but praising the Teamsters as a “powerful labor ally” whose solidarity “helped maintain momentum” during its recent strike. “We do have support from those other unions,” O'Brien says. “People are going to blow things up and hopefully rebuild them,” O'Brien offered, and somewhat jarringly changed the subject to job losses caused by Biden actions on the Keystone Pipeline. Still, the jury is out on whether O'Brien or anyone else can persuade Trump to offer a perceived gift to an industry he wars with, based in a state whose governor he can't stand. (Some Hollywood labor figures have been privately skeptical that the shuttle diplomacy by either O'Brien or Trump pal and “special ambassador” Jon Voight will amount to much. But one insider maintains O'Brien's presidential access has, at least, been effective in keeping Hollywood issues top of mind with an easily distractible president.) “I think he's got a lot better people around him making decisions.” O'Brien says that if the administration made what he felt were anti-labor moves, “obviously [we'd] hold them accountable,” even as his organization appears to have been largely silent on many issues that have alarmed other advocates. “We're doing something different that nobody else has done,” he says of the Trump relationship. Teamsters have simply tended to avoid the political lockstep of other labor groups. “They don't feel restrained historically,” says David Witwer, an American Studies professor at Penn State Harrisburg and author of Corruption and Reform in the Teamsters Union. One big question is how the Trump dynamic affects O'Brien's relationship with motion picture division director Dougherty, who has shown more socially liberal colors than some previous Teamster leaders but also strong loyalty to her boss. Dougherty, a bold personality disposed to tattoos (including one of the elder Hoffa) and R-rated language (her catchphrase is internet favorite “fuck around and find out”), has proved to be both a strong ally and asset for O'Brien. A longtime Teamsters staffer and former transportation dispatcher on projects like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Dougherty has raised the profile of the 6,400-member Local 399 in North Hollywood. He was looking to challenge the handpicked successor to 23-year incumbent James P. Hoffa, Jimmy's 80-year-old son, in coalition with the Teamsters for a Democratic Union, and as an outspoken millennial, Dougherty helped solidify his branding. O'Brien and Dougherty together have shaken up the Hollywood labor world with increasingly tough talk. O'Brien one-upped Dougherty's spicy rhetoric when he came to town in advance of Local 399's contract negotiations in 2024 and repeatedly called the studios a “white-collar crime syndicate.” “The process for Sean,” says John Palmer, a vp at large for the Teamsters from San Antonio and prominent O'Brien critic, “is to talk tough and sell short.” The new UPS contract, ratified by 86 percent of voting members, was praised by some members at the time for raising wages and improving working conditions. Shortly after he became president of Local 25 in 2006 on a platform of de-criminalizing the chapter, O'Brien flew out from Boston to do a backlot tour and reassure studios that, contrary to (well-earned) perception, Boston was not a scary place to shoot and that the Teamsters didn't make negotiations difficult for producers. O'Brien's predecessor George Cashman pled guilty to extortion, following a series of troubling incidents that included a grand jury investigation into shakedowns of producers on reportedly such films as The Cider House Rules and The Perfect Storm. “I believe Sean is meaningfully responsible for the amount of [Hollywood] work that came into Boston as a result [at the time],” the Oscar winner tells THR, adding that “he personally made sure that our movie company had a good experience.” But O'Brien's tenure didn't always go so smoothly on the Hollywood front. About five years after the Town shoot, a group of Teamsters picketed the Bravo hit Top Chef in an attempt to force the production to sign contracts with the union instead of local drivers and, according to allegations in an eventual trial, hurled misogynistic, homophobic and racist invective at cast, crew and a Bravo executive. O'Brien was never indicted in the controversy, but his No. But O'Brien has had his own brushes with discipline over union activities. After he said in 2013 that members who didn't vote in a Rhode Island Teamsters election the way he wanted would be “punished,” an independent oversight board for the union suspended him on intimidation grounds. The time O'Brien spent around sets appears to have honed his showman instincts. On the show, O'Brien deploys his Boston brogue to offer a mix of wisecracks and humblebrags. One running theme is guests noting how tough he is, a fact O'Brien tends to laugh at while also pointedly not dissenting. Taking a page from early Joe Rogan, O'Brien brings on figures from across the political spectrum, everyone from Hasan Piker and Ro Khanna to Hawley and Chavez-DeRemer, along with subjects like Casey Affleck and Dana White. Even as he now jets around the country, O'Brien's Boston working-class roots are visible. He is said to have several plainclothes security guards. Risteen left the troopers in 2018 amid one controversy over an altered arrest report for a judge's daughter and another reportedly regarding Risteen's ex-girlfriend, a trooper who'd admitted to money laundering and drug dealing. Per the union's latest financial disclosure form, he made a $241,000 salary in 2024. O'Brien by his own admission spends more time on the road and less in D.C. than past Teamsters bosses, and while it no doubt has contributed to his profile, it also has made some critics grumble that he has larger media or political ambitions. In April, O'Brien announced his slate, showing he again will be running alongside his current secretary-treasurer Fred Zuckerman and a list of candidates including Dougherty. The landscape of potential O'Brien challengers isn't yet clear, but Hooker, the Philadelphia Local official, is one of them. O'Brien may also have to answer for his associations with Trump, whose popularity among members could fluctuate over the next 15 months. Whatever happens in his campaign, O'Brien thinks history will bear out his move from the Democrats and prove the naysayers wrong. Let's keep supporting the people that aren't supporting us and get no return on our investment,” he says, referring to unnamed Democratic politicians.

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” Season 17, Episode 1, “The Gang Fucks Up Abbott Elementary.”] Back in January, when ABC premiered one of TV‘s most curious crossover events — pairing its family-friendly “Abbott Elementary” with FX's adults-only “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” — I couldn't shake two nagging issues with the pleasant-enough episode. Meanwhile, Mac (Rob Mac, né McElhenney) is very much out of character while sucking up to Ava (Janelle James), and Frank (Danny DeVito) gets into it with Mr. Johnson (William Stanford Davis) and Gregory (Tyler James Williams) in an atypically tame feud. Related Stories Jason Momoa Unites a People in Apple's ‘Chief of War' Trailer ‘Too Much' Review: Lena Dunham Returns with a Brash, Big-Hearted, and Oddly Conventional Rom-Com Obviously, the gang has to be on its best behavior to meet “Abbott's” broadcast standards, but their comportment in “Volunteers” never quite jells with the uncaring goons we've come to know and love. Audiences can often sense the corporate overlords' gruff hands pushing these previously distinct programs together. Some efforts are smoother than others (like when Dick Wolf's “Chicago” shows combine into one cavernous deep dish) and that goes double if the episode is more of a character cameo than a full-on crossover (like when “E.R. But in general, crossovers tend to sacrifice more than they create and work better for the suits than the fans. With “Abbott” and “Sunny,” the situation was slightly different. Yes, they're both successful sitcoms owned by Disney, and yes, they're both rooted in Philadelphia, so the financial and practical reasons for a crossover are clear enough. Does “Abbott” really want their innocent fans catching up on one of the most TV-MA sitcoms ever made? Does “Sunny” expect their sicko fans (complimentary) to fall for the earnest intentions and sweet central romance on “Abbott”? Which brings us to my second issue with “Volunteers” — an issue that's entirely my own, and an issue that nearly nullifies my previous issues: I didn't know “Sunny” was making an additional episode all its own. Rather than combine the two shows into a single ill-fitting story, it honors both “Abbott” and “Sunny's” distinct perspectives by giving them their own version of the same episode. Recognizing as much certainly makes “Volunteers” easier to digest (even if it doesn't elevate the episode among “Abbott's” finest). Everything shown in that half-hour is simply what's suitable for an all-ages documentary about the teachers at a public elementary school. True to himself, he's still hiding from the cameras, but before he can go sit in a broom closet to stare at his phone for five straight days, a slight irritation sparks him into action: The school's coffee is terrible. Seeing Dennis go full Walter White (as he dubs himself) while technically providing an act of kindness to every hard-working public servant at Abbott isn't what I would've guessed he'd end up doing in his downtime, but seeing him prep coffee orders while lightly chastising his customers (“Katie, I remember you — super complicated order.”) is an honest-to-Dennis delight. Now, I can't connect every dot between their fateful lunch hour discussion and their eventual decision to update Billy Joel's “We Didn't Start the Fire” for post-9/11 America, but hearing Mrs. Barbara Howard (Sheryl Lee Ralph) rhapsodically bebopping with Charlie about a metaphorical fire right before Mac and Frank start a real fire — intended to test the melting point of steel beams — well, I can't say I ever thought I'd live to see the day. Speaking of Frank, his polite feud (by Frank's standards) with Mr. Johnson turns out to be nothing more than a diversion. “This guy's gonna be a problem,” Frank says, after Mr. Johnson busts them for hanging out in the teacher's lounge within minutes of arriving at the school, before adding, “I'll take care of him.” It then becomes clear that everything shown in “Abbott's” episode — where Frank kept screwing with the community garden run by Mr. Johnson and Gregory — was just a way to keep the janitor busy while Frank goes about his actual plan: hunting for copper. To close the episode, Ava finds out he raided the boys' bathroom for his targeted treasure (which turns out to be a win-win, since she needed to tear out the wall anyway). For as magnificent as it is to see the Gang back to their old ways (especially after two years between seasons), just as essential to the premiere's success is how well the “Abbott” cast is utilized. Whereas seeing a tamed version of the gang does little to elevate “Volunteers,” witnessing Abbott's teachers off-the-leash brings quite a bit of joy to “Sunny.” There's Ava mocking Janine for rushing into her office all out of breath (and mocking a tall student who “can't shoot for shit”); there's Barbara singing, which in and of itself is a brilliant skill to write toward; there's Jacob walking in on Mac, Charlie, and Frank “recruiting” the aforementioned tall kid. And then there was Brunson's first solo scene: In a callback to Dee's viciously two-faced arc in the “Abbott” episode, Janine (Quinta Brunson) calls her a “total fucking cunt” for trying to steal Gregory — eliciting a wide-eyed stare from Mr. Eddie that mimics the audience's reaction perfectly. “I thought you were going to call her a bitch,” he says. “No, I didn't feel that was strong enough,” Janine replies. That is not what this woman is.” Hell yeah, Quinta. Way to make the most of your uncensored platform. With “Sunny” free to be “Sunny” again and “Abbott” seizing its rare shot at uncensored comedy, “The Gang Fucks Up Abbott Elementary” is a deft approach to closing out an unusual — and unusually successful — crossover event. If you knew it was coming, Sunny's Version makes for a remarkable payoff to Abbott's introduction, and if you didn't — but let's face it: everyone knew about Sunny's Version except me — it's a helluva way to kick off Season 17, proving once again that TV's longest-running live-action sitcom is still full of surprises. “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” premieres Wednesday, July 9 on FXX.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After spending over a decade as a plus one to Mario's many parties and sports outings, Donkey Kong is back to leading star status with the upcoming Switch 2 title, Donkey Kong Bananza (out July 17). And by all accounts, it's swinging in the right direction. But what goes into reimagining Donkey Kong for a modern generation? The first thing players will notice upon booting up Donkey Kong Bananza is that its titular ape looks pretty different. While his grandfather Cranky Kong went fully nude in the 1981 arcade classic, and his dad (DK Jr.) sported a white unitard, Donkey Kong III has the series' most recognizable look. Wearing a now-iconic red tie and less cartoonish design with more angular and mischievous features, DKC's version of Kong has been a staple for over 30 years. “One thing we knew is that we wanted to be very sensitive to the original image of the creator, Mr. Miyamoto, for this character,” says producer Kenta Motokura. “But we also wanted to pull out some unique features. You know, he's sort of a fun and goofy character at times, too.” But it's not just DK creator Shigeru Miyamoto's original vision that informed the new aesthetic. “Because this is such a long history for the Donkey Kong series, I really feel that everyone brings their own feelings of what Donkey Kong is to them,” Motokura says. “So, what we really wanted to express in this more recent design of Donkey Kong is all of those different associations, all of those feelings that people have with the character over its long history to come out in its appearance in this new design.” One key aspect that more recent fans of the Donkey Kong Country series might not think about is the fact that DK himself might live on a jungle island, but he also coexists and interacts with different cultures and species. After all, the first DK saw Mario scaling an urban construction site to save his girlfriend, Pauline. “Another place that I would say we took inspiration from — the arcade version of Donkey Kong — in this case, was just in noticing that this was a world inhabited both by humans and by Kongs.” ‘Donkey Kong Bananza' Makes Nintendo's Great Ape Into a King Again And while the team debated on how much of the human world and more Donkey Kong Country-specific wilderness to include, one character addition was non-negotiable for Motokura: “One thing I wanted to make sure we definitely included was Cranky Kong. But Donkey Kong's idea of action is different from, say, Mario's. And although the developers had previously found ways to make Super Mario Odyssey shine through its protagonists acrobatics, according to the game's director, Kazuya Takahashi, Bananza required something very different. “Super Mario Odyssey and Donkey Kong Bananza both have this very large play area where you are experiencing a lot of platform-based gameplay. But unlike Mario, whose main mode of action is jumping, DK interacts with the world by using his fists. Pretty much everything in game is discovered by tearing up the terrain, but that also presented its own challenges. Once underground, how would players be able to see what they're pummeling? “One thing we hit on during development was the fact that we would need an underground camera, something that worked a little bit differently, because you're digging, you're going down, and you're going to have parts of your periphery that would normally block a camera view,” Takahashi says. But part of seeing what's being destroyed is also knowing how the various pieces are reacting to damage, or in many cases, interacting with each other. “Now, we're talking mostly about level design, but I also want to give a shout out to the programmers, because I think they had quite a difficult challenge ahead of them as well,” Motokura says. Whenever players punch a wall of dirt, it will gloriously explode into hundreds of little voxel chunks; materials themselves can also be ripped up to throw or ride on like a surfboard. “For example, if you talk about an icy biome in the game, it wasn't just because we wanted there to be somewhere in the game that was cold. What if you had lava voxels in this icy world? Given that players will be punching nonstop for the duration of the game (seriously, it's hundreds of times per minute), it's essential that the action remain satisfying not just to stave off boredom but consistently find tactile moments of joy that always feels good. What sort of reaction are you seeing from Donkey Kong on screen? For example, because this is an action that you repeat many times, it helps to have a little bit of variation. That first punch is going to be a little bit different from the next one. But there's more to a good punch than the fluidity of its movement or inertia. “Another place that comes into play here is the sound design. [We] did some really fine adjustments was on the camera shake and the controller rumble that you experience when doing a punch,” Motokura adds. “You consider how many different elements go into making a good punch, and that they all need to be adjusted relative to one another, we can say that the development cost, the time that you spend working on just one punch, could be quite high.” Since its reveal, one of the biggest outstanding questions for fans is, “What the hell is going on with Pauline?” Nintendo's original damsel in distress first appeared in the 1981 game, kidnapped by DK for Mario (then called Jumpman) to rescue. As the mayor of the DK-inspired New Donk City, Pauline wasn't just another princess, she was a career woman — multiple careers, actually — serving as a lounge singer who put on fully vocalized musical numbers in the game. For one, she's a child — and seemingly has no idea who Donkey Kong is. It wouldn't be the first time in the Donkey Kong series that different generations of characters share a name within a family tree. In-game, she acts as a sidekick to DK, riding on his shoulders throughout the adventure. Her voice can be used to open sonically sensitive doors or even trigger superpowered transformations for DK. Turns out, her inclusion in the game is what helped shaped many aspects of its design. “Certainly, the idea of who Donkey Kong might be traveling with was something that we were thinking about in development from the very beginning,” Motokura says. “It really starts with Pauline being a singer herself,” Motokura says. In the Country series, he's been paired up with his nephew Diddy Kong, among others. But the choice of Pauline adds something unique: She can speak. While previous allies remained nonverbal, relying on high fives and pantomimes, Pauline is a fully voiced character in Bananza, and adds a different vibe to the game, closer in line to famous girl-meets-ape dynamics like those seen in Godzilla vs. Kong or (to an extent) Wreck-It Ralph. Former Superman Dean Cain Says Hollywood Has Made the Character Too 'Woke' Ethel Cain Apologizes for Offensive Old Posts: ‘Any Way You Feel About Me Is Valid' “Pauline, being a human character, one of the greatest merits of including her is that she speaks in a way that players would be able to understand and can be a little more empathetic or resonant for them,” Takahashi says. But that doesn't mean the developers have completely forgotten about DK's best bud. While he was recently teased to make a cameo in Bananza, the baseball-capped simian is still on Takahashi's mind: “Maybe you'll see more of Diddy in the future.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Right before the Eagles played the final encore of their two-year, 109-date History of the Eagles tour in July 2015, Glenn Frey walked up to guitarist Bernie Leadon and gave him a big hug. Leadon is the band's founding guitarist, and co-writer of many of their early songs, including “Witchy Woman,” but he left in 1975 following an infamous backstage fight where he poured a beer on Frey's head. And now here they were embracing following their first tour together in 40 years. In this world, Frey died from pneumonia just six months later, and founding bassist Randy Meisner died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2023, having not toured with the band since his departure in 1977. He began writing songs, including “Too Many Memories,” releasing next week, for the first time since his 2004 solo LP, Mirror. “Too Many Memories” is a tender piano ballad about coming to terms with the past, and finding contentment in the present. The lyrics came to Leadon in a sudden flash about three years ago. “I've lived many lifetimes in one lifetime,” he says. They maintained a close friendship after Leadon left the band, and worked together on a series of albums in England. Last July, Johns visited Leadon at his home studio in middle Tennessee. “He was supposed to come and do a John Hiatt record, and it didn't wind up happening,” says Leadon. And we did like eight songs in five days.” They were joined at the session by bassist Glenn Worf, drummer Greg Morrow, and keyboardist Tony Harrell. “And we did it all analog, which forces you to make decisions. Leadon isn't sure when he'll release the other songs or cobble them together for an album, but he is booked for a rare solo show at Nashville's City Winery on Sept. 12 as part of AmericanaFest. He'll be backed by his recording band at that show and center the set around their new material. But going forward, he hopes to put together a more expansive show. In the past, Leadon has limited the Eagles songs in his solo sets to ones he wrote and sang, like “Hollywood Waltz,” “Bitter Creek,” and “My Man.” “I'm most comfortable doing things that I sang, but I recognize that the biggest hits are ones I didn't sing,” he says. Don Henley Sued for Malicious Prosecution by Rare-Books Dealer in Stolen Lyrics Dispute Joe Walsh on Raising Millions for Veterans and Playing the Sphere Souther on How He Helped Write All Those Eagles Songs: The Lost Interview Plans might change, but he's thinking about introducing songs that he's never played outside the Eagles, like “Take It Easy,” into his set. “But I'd tell the audience ahead of time, ‘Guess what? I don't know if it would be funny for a whole song though.” That means he continues to derive income from their catalog, including the Eagles' compilation Greatest Hits (1971–1975), which remains one of the top-selling albums in music history. “I came up during a point where the idea was you never sell your publishing,” he says. Former Superman Dean Cain Says Hollywood Has Made the Character Too ‘Woke' Elon Musk's Grok Chatbot Goes Full Nazi, Calls Itself ‘MechaHitler' Leadon lives on a farm in Tennessee these days, and devotes much of his time to family, including four grandchildren. He hasn't been to the Sphere to see his former band in concert, but he's not opposed to checking out a show, and maybe even guesting with them for a song or two, if invited. But that's not really where his head is at right now. “I'm just happy that my relationship with the band has been cleaned up,” he says. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ironically, the married Atlanta couple and their series have been in the headlines a great deal since late June, when they announced that their show had been canceled after four seasons. Many fans have been up in arms over the news, as well as announcements from the stars of four other shows since mid-June that their series have also been cut. Then the universe hit us with an Emmy nomination. The caption continued, “Apparently, Married to Real Estate is still making noise—even without new episodes. 🥂 Huge love to the Academy, our phenomenal crew, and everyone who tuned in.” The 2025 Emmy nominations were for shows that aired between January 1 and December 31, 2024, according to Deadline. The judging period took place from May 22 to June 9, before Sherrod and Jackson learned — upon returning home from a family vacation in mid-June — that their show had been canceled. They shared the news with their fans via social media on June 24. “Y'all are not gonna believe what we just heard,” Jackson began the video. Sherrod then laughed, “Well, apparently, we shouldn't go away on vacation anymore. We were just coming back from picking Kendall up from sleepaway camp in Florida and we stopped at the movie theater. On the way out, Mike gets a text.” “So I read the text,” Jackson recalled, “and it says, ‘Hey, congratulations, you have been nominated for an Emmy.' ‘Married to Real Estate' has been nominated for an Emmy!” Giggling, Sherrod said, “I'm sorry, I'm sorry, we might be the first show to get nominated after we got canceled! The couple shared how grateful they're feeling and Sherrod added, “Isn't this wild? Within 15 minutes of their posting, nearly 10,000 fans had already liked Sherrod and Jackson's video, with hundreds flooding the comment section with words of celebration, with some clearly hopeful it would cause HGTV execs to change their minds. One wrote, “Canceling an Emmy nominated show is nuts! Someone else commented, “The way I just chuckled at the irony and how we KNOW how God shows off and out tickles me!😆 ijs So deserving!! The Daytime Emmys ceremony will take place in Pasadena, California, on October 17. “Married to Real Estate” is up against Roku's “Dime Como Hacerlo,” BUYtv's “The Fixers,” Magnolia Network's “Fixer Upper: The Lakehouse (which also aired on HGTV), Amazon Prime Video's “Going Home with Tyler Cameron,” and Roku's “Martha Gardens.” In 2024, two HGTV shows were nominated for the Daytime Emmys — Dave and Jenny Marrs' “Fixer to Fabulous” and Alison Victoria's “Windy City Rehab.” The category's winner was Netflix's “Hack My Home.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club will return to recap this season's fourth episode on July 23.] Well-paced, unpredictable, and, most importantly, still comical, it's nice to be in Sunny days again. The initial impression that this might be more of an AE episode vibe than a Sunny one gets annihilated when Quinta Brunson's Janine calls Dee a “total f**king c*nt.” Take that, prudes at ABC. One of the great joys of this half-hour is getting to see AE performers like Brunson, Tyler James Williams, Janelle James, and Lisa Ann Walter play in a darker vein of humor, all of them seemingly invigorated by taking off a few off the guard rails that are understandably in place on broadcast TV. Of course, episode writers Charlie Day, Rob McElhenney, and Keyonna Taylor know we're here for the Paddy's Pub gang, all of whom try to get as much as possible out of their time at Abbott. As Dee leans into her jealous side and tries to take down Janine, Charlie & Mac work on recruiting kids in a “reverse Blind Side” to their local school. It's all ridiculously in tune with Charlie, Mac, Dee, Dennis, and Frank, people who are constantly looking for a way to maximize the profit on their time and failing miserably, even while volunteering at an inner-city school. Much has been written about the bone-deep selfishness of this quintet, but it's almost refreshing to see how transparent they are about it in an era of two-faced grifters. In the case of the premiere, it culminates with Dennis spearheading a new version of Billy Joel's “We Didn't Start the Fire,” using Abbott teachers to sing about extremely un-timely topics like Guantanamo and Kaepernick—it's amazing how the gang's idea of current events is always a few years behind reality, even if they do get in a nice Ozempic dig. Yes, this is a show about grifters, but it's also about people too dumb to do too much damage with their cons to anyone but themselves. After Frank goes into a coma while watching Netflix's Is It Cake?, Dee is forced to stay by his bedside in case his heartbeat falls below 50 BPM. He turned into a sweet treat himself to prove “the magic of cake technology.” Amazing. This installment works from a classic Sunny template in which the gang cuts Dee out of a possible endeavor only to f*ck it up themselves. It also works from the comic vein in which the gang blames someone else for their failures, usually Frank, who gets trashed this episode for not elevating them like they intended when they allowed him into their idiot club so many years ago. As their failed benefactor lies in a supposed coma, Charlie, Mac, and Dennis take the Liberty Ball invitation that Dee found in the trash and try to find an investor. At first, they just end up working for the business fat cats around them as waiters, and then as bathroom attendants. Before you know it, they're snorting meth at another party before landing in a final location that Cricket probably knows well—the kind of place with mattresses on the floor and where “Narcan” is the password.

Neuroscientific revelations have established how music significantly influences cognitive, emotional and physical functions of the brain. Backed by this growing body of research, music is now being deployed in advanced therapeutic and breakthrough medical applications. This builds on what we've always known: that music is a powerful force for good in the minds, hearts and lives of people everywhere. With this understanding of music's greater purpose, let's move into the conversation about technological disruption. For well over a century, since the advent of sound reproduction and radio, music has been situated on the cutting edge of tech transformation… As the next major milestone in this journey of technological disruption and transformation, we believe AI can be instrumental to the future of music. However, it's critical to emphasize that AI will realize its potential to transform the future of music through the voices and visions of artists… Yes, the scope of technological disruption may be unprecedented with AI, but that doesn't change a fundamental truth: To maximize creative collaboration with technology, you must start from a foundation built on copyright and associated rights. Of course it's essential that we energetically defend our artists' interests. Working from our philosophy, we believe that market-based solutions are the answer. We have enabled numerous entrepreneurs…and are working with a wide range of major tech platforms…in announced partnerships and with significant licensing deals in the works. The anti-copyright premise of some AI industry commentators is deeply flawed. Quite the opposite: Media/Tech convergence predicated on respect for copyright has produced a multi-trillion-euro economy…. …And that started with Apple: marrying iPod with iTunes in 2003 as a critical early step, embracing licensed music, to create the first trillion-dollar company. Tech collaboration with the creative community, respecting the value of artists' work and harnessing their innovation, has produced enormous cultural and economic benefit. Lessons learned in the first quarter of this century are why we believe the future of AI Music will be realized by unlocking new creative collaborations. It will be activated by putting new tools in the hands of artists so they can expand the market and create new experiences for their fans in partnership with technologists. This is how AI will promote innovation and advance culture. Let's look at some examples of these collaborations and how they're being fostered. An important foundation in successful collaboration is being promoted by creative community alliances…and Universal has taken a very active role. Just one of many examples: We helped launch the Human Artistry Campaign and articulate its principles. This global initiative was formed in 2023 to protect creators' rights in the age of AI and now has more than 170 supporting organizations from over 40 countries. We're backing many such industry and creative community initiatives you see referenced here. • Soundlabs, Hooky and Supertone are each employing “voice clone” AI technology enabling artists to perform in multiple languages so their audiences can hear them singing in the fans' native tongues for the first time. • KLAY Vision is developing exciting new models leveraging Generative AI for hyper personalization and deeper fan engagement. • ProRata is making important output attribution advancements to enable new Gen AI business models. We were thrilled to release “Now And Then,” the last song from The Beatles – written and sung by John Lennon almost 50 years ago. Using next generation AI source separation technology, Lennon's voice was excavated from a cassette recording that had been completely unusable for decades, waiting for this moment in the evolution of AI to arrive. In February of this year, “Now and Then” won the Grammy for “Best Rock Performance,” the first time any recording utilizing AI technology has been so honored in a major category. We recently joined forces with Apple to introduce a new category called “Sound Therapy” powered by a team of scientists, engineers and producers at Sollos, Universal's music health division. This audio wellness innovation employs our own ethically developed, patented Gen AI system. It seamlessly integrates scientifically calibrated audio supplements into the recordings of some of our biggest artists including Imagine Dragons, Katy Perry and Kacey Musgraves. Immersive artist-approved remixes that deliver a range of wellness benefits to subscribers. Finally, I'm pleased to highlight a new music video project from global superstar Keith Urban…the very latest example of how our artists are harnessing their world-class creativity to engage with cutting-edge technology and map the future of AI Music. This mesmerizing treatment of Keith's hit “Straight Lines” is being created with Moon Valley Gen AI and other ethically trained tools. Now, a sneak preview clip from the nearly completed forthcoming Keith Urban music video, “Straight Lines.” We believe that music is universal…that AI can be instrumental to our future…and that it's the artists who will continue to shape global culture, channeling disruption into transformation as they have always done. In our artist-centric vision, AI innovation can drive music culture, and in so doing, generate even greater benefits to the quality of life on this planet.
