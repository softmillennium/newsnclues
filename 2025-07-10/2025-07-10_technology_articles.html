We're scouring the hottest sales at all retailers for the best Amazon Prime Day deals on gaming GPUs, CPUs, desktop PCs, laptops, monitors, and even hard drives, among other items, and collecting those here for you, live. We aren't just selecting deals willy-nilly, either; our domain experts are curating a list of the best value items, often based on our in-depth reviews, benchmarks, and extensive historical pricing analysis to ensure that when we say it's a great deal, it truly is. We'll be updating this deals live blog to help you find the best ways to save money on gear that can upgrade your PC and your entire tech life. HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. The 4TB QLC-based P310 NVMe SSD has hit an all-time low price this Prime Day. The QLC-based drive boasts excellent performance of up to 7,100 MB/s. Equipped with the Phison E27T controller, the drive also has excellent thermals and won't be in danger of throttling, making it excellent for usage in a multitude of systems. This small kit has all the tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx / Torx security and many others. This 27-inch Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best. So lets start with the best budget printer for those new to 3D printing. The Bambu Lab A1 Mini is phenomenal 3D printer for just over $200! It may have a smaller print volume (180 x 180 x 180mm), but other than that it is a simple to setup and use 3D printer for very little cash. It produces great prints and the frictionless process of assembly (there is very little) and setup (it guides you along the process via the touchscreen) means you get to printing in a very short space of time.The Bambu Lab A1 Mini can even be expanded with an AMS (Automatic Material System) that enables this little printer to print in multiple colors and filaments. So you can 3D print colorful projects, or objects with mixed filaments, all from the tiny printer. Check out our review of the Bambu Lab A1 mini. It levels itself before each print, so all we need to do is load filament and send our prints over the network. So we have a fast, cheap 3D printer that has great quality and plenty of build volume. This would be an excellent printer for the jobbing maker / creator who needs reliability, quality and speed. The printer features automatic bed leveling, and a built-in camera to monitor your prints. The excellent Lenovo Legion Go is now just $499 at Amazon, 30% off with $200 in savings. You get the Z1 Extreme chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It even has detachable controllers like a Nintendo Switch 2! The Lenovo Legion Go handheld gaming console comes with an AMD Z1 Extreme chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Deep discounts on Radeons are a rare sight this Prime Day season, but there are still deals to be found. Consider Sapphire's Pulse Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB, a compact and stealthy dual-fan implementation of this Editor's Choice-winning product. It's got enough power to game at 1080p and 1440p alike, and its 16GB of VRAM gives you plenty of headroom to max out settings in memory-hungry modern titles. Sapphire's handsome Pulse card has dual fans and a stealthy, compact design that will look good in any build. Our tests showed that the RX 9060 XT 16GB is great for high-frame-rate gaming at 1080p or a solid 60-ish FPS at 1440p overall, even with demanding settings. The RX 9060 XT also supports AMD's latest FSR 4 upscaler and its AI-enhanced image quality, meaning you have more freedom to tune performance to taste in the small but growing list of titles that support it. The RDNA 4 architecture boasts better AI performance and ray-tracing prowess than its predecessors, too, making the RX 9060 XT 16GB a thoroughly modern and well-rounded graphics card. There's a good reason it took home our Editor's Choice award. If you're looking for a graphics card upgrade and don't want to break the bank, this Sapphire Pulse RX 9060 XT 16GB should be at the top of your list. If you want a straight shooting laptop from Microsoft on Prime Day, there is a decent number of deals on Arm-based laptops, all with excellent battery. The Surface Pro with an OLED display and Snapdragon X Elite, along with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, is at a good price, but you'll still have to buy a mouse and keyboard. This cheaper laptop uses an entry-level Snapdragon X chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. We've all had handheld devices conk out while we'd still prefer to be using them, but it's no fun holding a device with a big cable poking out of the top, bottom, or side. Baseus' 100W charging cable makes that experience a little bit easier and a lot more comfortable, with its flat-topped, angled USB-C port, flat braided cable, and 100W, 5A charging capabilities. Baseus MVP 3 flat-top USB-C charging cable: $11 on Amazon (was $15)Want to use your mobile device while it's charging without having to contort your fingers around the USB-C cable? Baseus has you covered with its angled, flat-topped braided charging cable. It supports up to 100W and is available in 3.3 or 6.6-foot lengths. The shorter model is for charging off a battery pack, but I'd opt for the 6.6-foot model (which costs $4 more) if you're going to use the cable from a charger plugged into a wall. I also like this cable for charging my laptop on cramped flights and commutes, and its flat nature makes it easy to find in my cable drawer when I need it. The large top of the USB-C plug will block adjacent ports or vents on some gaming handhelds, though, so it may not be ideal for your particular use case. Also, as with most charging-specific cables, this one isn't great for data, as it's capped at slow USB 2.0 speeds. If you're anything like me, your keyboard is probably filthy. Our little secret, this Vichyie keyboard cleaning kit brush gets you a massive arsenal of tiny tools to clean your keyboard, all housed in a glorious multi-tool design. SSD, CPU, RAM, and display all match the cheaper 5070 Ti model. USB4 has become an increasingly common part of my tech life, via my AMD-powered Asus Zenbook and because I test external drives like the Corsair EX400U. And considering the stagnation of Thunderbolt 5 outside of some high-end Apple products and a couple of gaming laptops, USB4 looks like it's going to be more or less the standard for fast data connectivity for most people going forward. And now they are on sale for Prime Day. Cable Matters 40Gbps USB 4 Cable (6.6ft): now $18 at Amazon (was $22)These cables are certified by the USB-IF to meet USB4 standards, support 40Gbps data and up to 240W charging, and are compatible with Thunderbolt 4 (though they may run at slower speeds). Cable Matters 40Gbps USB 4 Cable (3.3ft): now $12 at Amazon (was $15)These cables are certified by the USB-IF to meet USB4 standards, support 40Gbps data and up to 240W charging, and are compatible with Thunderbolt 4 (though they may run at slower speeds). The 3.3-foot length is good for a lot of use cases where you want to plug in something close by, but not right next to your PC or laptop. That said, if you want to spend less, I picked up this 3.3ft braided USB4 cable a couple of months ago, and it's been working fine so far. Just don't complain if it fails, gets hot, runs slower than it should, or even goes up in smoke eventually. Again though, my gudxfj cable has been working fine so far. Albo 50 Pcs Colorful Cable Ties: now $13 at Amazon (was $16)These reusable hook-and-loop cable ties come in five colors so you can keep your cables sorted, are six inches long so they should work with larger cables, and with 50 of them, you should be able to keep all your cables tidy. That will help keep your cables tidy when not in use, and you'll probably be able to spot the blue or green wrap in your cable drawer when you need it. With 40% off, this 64 piece electronics toolkit is an irresistible purchase I recently wrote about the best PC tools that you can pick up during the Amazon Prime Day and it seems that this 64 piece electronics toolkit has become rather popular. This small kit has all the tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx / Torx security and many others. This precision kit has pretty much every tool that you could need to maintain a PC, all in a handy case. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx / Torx security and many others. One of the best things about USB making its way into pretty much every laptop for the last several years is that, unless you have a gaming laptop, you can charge on the go without the bulky power brick that most manufacturers still ship with their laptops. And many gaming laptops will also charger over USB-C, just not at full power, so you can't charge and game at the same time. I've used several small GaN chargers over the years, at home and while traveling, and a few of my favorites are on sale for Prime Day. Just note that not all of these models include a fast-charge USB cable, so you may need to buy one of those as well, if you don't already have one. XSufr 65W Flat USB C Wall Charger: now $15 at Amazon (was $30)This tiny, foldable charger is smaller than a deck of cards and has one USB-C and one USB-A port, with a max output of 65W and 45W max from the USB-C port. All I can say is that I've used this charger several times in the last six months and never had an issue. If you want more peace of mind, consider the next charger. This pocket-friendly charger is just 0.66 inches thick, with fold-down prongs and two USB ports. Lots of people haven't heard of Baseus either, but it's a quickly rising competitor to brands like Anker, and I've been using this as my main laptop charger for about 10 months now with no issues and no complaints. Anker Prime 67W USB-C Charger: now $35 at Amazon (was $60)This 67W charger is a little less travel-friendly than some others, but it's still tiny, and has three ports: two USB-C and one USB-A. SteelSeries' Aerox 3 wireless gaming mouse is perfect if you're looking for a stripped-down lightweight mouse — so long as you don't mind the holes — and it's currently just $59.98 at Amazon (down 50% from its retail price of $119.99). SteelSeries Aerox 3 is a lightweight, wireless gaming mouse with bright RGB lighting and a hole-filled chassis, and it's currently 50% off. The Aerox 3 Wireless is a 68g wireless gaming mouse with a perforated chassis — so it's not great if you have trypophobia. The interior parts are shielded and have an IP54 rating, so you don't have to worry too much about dust or liquid messing with the mouse (though you obviously shouldn't run it through a wash cycle). We haven't reviewed this exact model, but you can take a look at our review of the wired SteelSeries Aerox 3 here.— Sarah Our favorite wireless gaming keyboard, the Asus ROG Strix Scope II, is currently down to just $161.49 at Amazon, which is 23% off the current retail price of $209.99. It also sounds great, thanks to sound-dampening foam in the case. The ROG Strix Scope II is a hot-swappable mechanical keyboard that comes with Asus' ROG NX switches in either Snow (linear) or Storm (clicky). It features extra sound-dampening in the case, double-shot PCB keycaps with shine-through legends, customizable RGB, and a nearly-full-size layout in a much more compact form factor. It also offers up to 1,500 hours of battery life with the lighting turned off (this drops to 90 hours with the lighting turned on, which is decent but not nearly as good as 1,500 hours). Read our full review of the Asus ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless here. If you're a gamer with some upgrade cash burning a hole in your pocket, but you're not impressed with any of the graphics card deals out there right now, it might be time to take a long, hard look at your gaming monitor. All that is perfect for showing off every pixel and frame a powerful graphics card can push. This display even has a built-in KVM switch for seamless usage across multiple devices, and it's at an all-time low price of $279.99 at Newegg right now, no gimmicks required. If you'd rather step up to the extra eye candy only a 4K display can provide, Gigabyte's M28U can also get you there at a good price. Its 144Hz refresh rate will keep games smooth and fluid even with its exceedingly crisp resolution, and it has the same wide color support and AMD FreeSync VRR support as the M27Q X above. It has a wide color gamut, a fast 144Hz refresh rate, and AMD FreeSync VRR support to keep games fluid and smooth. Gaming monitors can last over multiple PCs builds, so it's smart to get a good one like either of these Gigabyte displays while they're on deep discount. We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage, and it is still going strong three days later. This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. Dell just marked down three laptops even further, slashing off another $300 to $400 off laptops that were already selling at deep discounts. This powerful Dell laptop packs in Nvidia's RTX 4080 mobile GPU. Accompanying the 4080 is Intel's Core Ultra 9 185H processor with 16 cores and a P-core boost speed up to 5.10GHz. Other hardware specifications include 32GB of 7467MHz DDR5 RAM and a 1TB NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD for storage. Accompanying the 4080 is Intel's Core Ultra 9 185H processor with 16 cores and a P-core boost speed up to 5.10GHz. Other hardware specifications include 32GB of 7467MHz DDR5 RAM and a 1 TB NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD for storage. Get the 16-inch Dell XPS laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, and 2 TB M2 NVMe SSD. You can also play around with the config to get some extra upgrades in. Dell also just took another $400 off the XPS 16 Laptop (RTX 4060), bringing it down to $2,499. That means we might not see these deeper cuts last long. The Phantom PG27F15RS1A may "only" be a 1080p monitor, but it has a 1ms response time and an incredible 240 Hz refresh rate for just over $100. The Phantom Gaming is one of the most affordable options we've encountered in its class, and while you're settling for a VA panel, at least it's a good one, offering 27 inches of real estate and a 240 Hz refresh rate with support for FreeSync. This monitor also has a 1500R curve and offers solid connectivity options at this price point, including two HDMI 2.0 ports and one DisplayPort 2.1 port. That's all good enough if you're looking to get a solid monitor on the cheap, and you'd be hard pressed to find this type of value at any time other than Prime Day. But for Prime Day, we found the Asus TUF Gaming VG27AQ with a 27-inch, 1440p screen and 165 Hz refresh rate that hit a new low price of $198.55. This QHD monitor features a 165 Hz refresh rate, 1 ms response time, and is VESA mountable. It also has both DisplayPort and HDMI input options. The TUF Gaming monitor also boasts an IPS display with a 1ms response time, Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, and is VESA mountable. Like many monitors, you'll get your choice of either DisplayPort or HDMI. )Asus also has its own "Extreme Low Motion Blur", or ELMB, to help reduce tearing during game play. This can be run at the same time as Nvidia G-Sync. There are also a handful of HDR modes to choose from. LG's Gram Pro 16, among the company's line of ultra-thin, extremely light notebooks, often come at a price premium. The Gram Pro 16 is half an inch thin and weighs 2.73 pounds. The system is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor along with a roomy 2TB SSD and 32GB of RAM.LG's 16-inch screen has a 2560 x 1600 resolution and has a variable refresh rate between 31 Hz and 144 Hz. We haven't had the chance to test this system ourselves, but for those who value thinnness and lightness above all else and are willing to pay a premium for it, that premium is a bit less today than usual. If you have headphones (and come on, most of us do) for your PC, you know how much desk space they can take up. And most headphone stands only make the problem worse by adding their footprint to your table. It clips onto the side of my desk and rotates 180 degrees so I can hang my headphones under the desk or facing outward. EURPMASK Rotating Headphone Stand: was $12.99, now $7.69 at AmazonThis headphone stand clips on to your desk so your headphones can hang off of the side rather than taking up valuable table real estate. One thing I've noticed about the EURPMASK is that it is long enough to hold not one, but two headsets. So I can hang a couple of pairs there and really keep my desk neat. The Lian Li DK-07X is a motorized standing desk that features support for dual E-ATX PC systems. Or, naturally, if you only need one PC in your desk, you can have more fans and drives in a single configuration. Other features include built-in cable organization, wireless charging pads, and multiple USB ports. Get an enormous 49-inch OLED monitor with 144Hz refresh rate, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and more. I've recently moved house and my first thought for the new office was "I need to work on my cable management", seriously it was! I love a messy desk, it shows the thought process of a hundred projects and it makes me feel happy. But I also don't want to trash my new home. So how can I have all my 3D printers, PCs, lights, audio / video equipment etc but minimize the clutter?I needed some help and these three products did indeed help me. We kick off with the ubiquitous cable / cord management kits. These kits come with adhesive holders for all manner of wires. A few more lock the cable / wire in place. There are also some connectors for cable ties, wire wrapping and sleeves to group wires together so they look less messy. Everything you need to tame the mess of wires that lurks behind your desk. Instead of these, I use reusable cable ties and Amazon has a load on sale for Prime Day. These hook and loop cable ties will hold up to six inch thicknesses of cables and we get a pack of 60 to tidy up our lives! Sixty reusable cable ties for under $6 is a great deal. Stick it to the wall, under your desk and tidy those cables. We've been tracking the best 4TB SSD deals on offer, notably drives that cost around $0.05 per GB of storage, so why not take a look at 2TB models too? Turns out you can get a smaller 2TB driver for less than half the price, making buying two more cost-effective than buying one 4TB drive, if you have the space, of course. The 16-inch Alienware X16 R2 gaming laptop is now at all-time low pricing. This laptop comes packing a 16-core Intel Core 7 155H CPU and last-gen RTX 4070 GPU with 8GB of VRAM, but that's a solid amount of horsepower considering this price point. The QHD+ panel has a blazing 240 Hz refresh rate and 3ms latency. The system also comes with 16GB of DDR5-7467 memory and a 1 TB SSD. Yes, this laptop has a previous-gen GPU, but it is more than worth the asking price, so we expect these to fly off the shelves in short order. This tiny magnetic, USB-charging flashlight is great for PC building and other everyday tasks – and it's on sale for just $14 I picked up the OLIGHT IMINI 2 mini flashlight a few months ago on impulse, because it looked well designed and cost around $20, but now it's down to just below $14, and I'm tempted to pick up a couple as gifts. The simplicity of its design and its built-in USB-A plug for charging makes it fun to use – just pull the back off and it turns on, and the magnet lets you easily mount it anywhere you need a little extra light, like inside a steel PC case while you're fiddling with fan or RGB wires or looking for that screw you dropped. The OLIGHT IMINI 2 EDC Rechargeable Keychain Flashlight: now $14 at Amazon (was $20)At just 2.17 inches long, this flashlight is rated to 50 lumens, and it sports a magnetic back with a USB-A plug for charging. The OLIGHT IMINI 2 is also small enough for your keychain, is designed to live with your keys, and includes two silicone covers for the USB port and a little carabiner clip. But the flashlight portion is only held to the charging port via a magnet, and I feel like (for me, at least) it would fall off and get lost before too long. It's not going to replace a full-sized flashlight, but it's very handy when you need something more fun and convenient (at least in some ways) than your smartphone's flashlight. If you're on the hunt for a great SSD, this Samsung 990 EVO Plus SSD 2TB is down to its lowest-ever price, just $113 thanks to a massive 36% discount. That makes it better value than the 4TB model at $0.05 per GB. With speeds of 7,250MB/s (read) and 6,300MB/s (write), it's also very snappy compared to cheaper 2TB alternatives. Get a 2TB EVO Plus for the lowest-ever price of $113, with PCIe Gen 5 technology, HMB, and Turbowrite 2.0. We've got a run down of every drive on the market with a breakdown of speeds, price, and cost per GB. Hoto's snap-together tool kits are great for keeping cramped workspaces tidy, and they're nearly 30% off During Prime Day, though, all three kits are on sale for $20 off, plus an additional "brand promotion" coupon of 10%, taking them down to $71 each. That's still expensive, but significantly less so, especially if you plan to pick up two or three of these kits rather than just one. Hoto's slim rotary tool sports a 4V brushless motor, variable speed up to 22000 RPM, and 38 accessories to compete with your old Dremel. Like the other kits, it also comes in a magnetic snap-together shell that keeps your accessories all together and connects to the other tool kits. With three speeds, a built-in light, and 20 bits, the Hoto Drill Pen is built for working with 3D Prints, wood, acrylic, and even metal. The Hoto mini electric screwdriver has 56 bits for just about any small project or repair, and a maximum torque rating of 0.5 N⋅m at 250 RPM. It's good for working with small electronics, servicing laptops, and building PCs, but you may want something larger with a bit more power for tough-to-loosen thumb screws. If you're wondering what the difference is between the three devices, other than their bits, it comes down to torque and RPM. Not everyone will need all three, but they're designed for very different tasks. If you're in the UK looking for a Prime Day deal on a graphics card, well, the RTX 5070 has just fallen below £500, thanks to this 5% saving on the MSI RTX 5070 Shadow 2X, dubbed as such because it comes with two fans, now just £499 at Amazon. This two-fan card from MSI will fit in pretty much any build thanks to its compact size. I've been furiously printing with the Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 combo, and it's currently $100 off, just $399 I've been using this printer for a couple of months now, and I've been very happy with it as my first 3D printer, so much so that I ordered the larger Kobra 3 Max, which is also on sale for $449 without the multi-color AMS module. The Anycubic Kobra 3 V2: now $399 at Amazon (was $499)The Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 combo is a bed-slinging 3D printer with a 255×255×260 mm (10x10x10.2 inches) build volume and print speeds up to 600 mm/s. It also comes with an AMS (automatic material system), a box that holds four spools of filament that are automatically fed to the printer. My experience with the Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 as a 3D printing novice has been solidly positive. The automatic bed leveling has worked every time for me. And while I have had a few failed prints here and there, as well as some lifting at the corners, I put most of that down to inexperience (and the fact that my air conditioner blows across the outer edge of my printer bed). Switching colors during a print wastes a fair amount of filament, as the extruder needs to purge the nozzle area. So prints with lots of colors in different layers will create a lot of printer "poop" and also be significantly slower. Still, if you're really excited about complex multi-color prints, you can pick up a second AMS from Anycubic and connect two to the Kobra V3, for 8-color printing. But personally, I have yet to use more than two or three colors in a print. If you're looking for a great gaming headset that both sounds good and will make you sound good, our favorite wireless headset is currently on sale at 25% off. The Xbox and PS5 versions of Razer's BlackShark V2 Pro wireless headset are currently priced at $149.99 at Amazon — down $50 from the retail price of $199.99. The BlackShark V2 Pro is a wireless over-ear gaming headset with both 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity (though, not simultaneous audio-mixing), 50mm titanium dynamic drivers, and a comfortable, lightweight build that you can wear all day. While the EQ needs a little tuning out of the box, once you've done some tweaking the headset sounds great for both music and gaming, and it also comes with several pro-tuned game presets for popular titles such as Fortnite and Apex Legends. All EQ tuning saves directly to the headset, so your sound tweaks will be available whether you're listening on your PC, console, or phone. The standout feature on the BlackShark V2 Pro is its detachable "HyperClear Super Wideband" mic, which is a 9.9mm condenser mic that will make you sound fantastic. No need to pick up a standalone gaming mic with this headset! It may have been released three years ago, but Razer's DeathAdder V3 Pro is still one of my favorite mice — and my favorite Razer mouse — ever. And it's currently on sale for just $86.44 at Amazon (in black), down 42% from its retail price of $149.99. The DeathAdder V3 Pro is a lightweight wireless gaming mouse with a fantastic shape, Razer's Focus Pro 30K optical sensor, and up to 90 hours of battery life. It weighs just 63g and is perfect for a range of gamers. The DeathAdder V3 Pro is a lightweight wireless gaming mouse with one of the best shapes we've ever tested — a right-handed ergonomic shape that makes the mouse feel like an extension of your arm. It's a fairly simple, stripped down mouse otherwise, with five programmable buttons, a notched scroll wheel, and two forms of connectivity: 2.4GHz wireless and wired (USB-C). It fits perfectly in your hand and weighs just 2.22 ounces (63g — 64g in white), has tactile, clicky optical switches, and gets up to 90 hours of battery life. If you're looking for the ultimate in PC gaming performance, it's hard to beat the Alienware Area-51 with RTX 5090 GPU and Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU. Alienware Area-51 (RTX 5090, Core Ultra 9 285K): was $6099, now $5199 at DellThis tricked-out configuration of the Alienware Area-51 sports an RTX 5090 GPU, Core Ultra 9 285K CPU, 64GB of RAM, a 4TB SSD, and a 1,500W power supply. We reviewed a similar configuration of the Alienware Area-51 (but with a 2TB SSD) back in April and were blown away by its performance. So, if you're looking for the ultimate in PC performance, this deal is hard to beat. We haven't seen many graphics card deals from Amazon itself this Prime Day, but Newegg has a couple aggressive discounts on a pair of RTX 50-series graphics cards. As long as you're OK getting your savings back as a Newegg gift card, you can get an RTX 5060 or an RTX 5070 for less than MSRP—a rare event in today's graphics card market. First up, Newegg will give you $50 back on one of Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5060 cards, taking it from $339.99 to an effective $289.99. This is among the lowest prices we've seen on an RTX 5060 card so far, and it's a solid pick for 1080p gaming so long as you can live within its 8GB of VRAM. The RTX 5060 already has modest power requirements, so Asus' triple-fan cooler should keep this card plenty cool and quiet. The GeForce RTX 5060 8GB is a solid graphics card for 1080p gaming, and its Blackwell architecture gives gamers access to Nvdia's full range of DLSS 4 upscaling and framegen features. ASUS' Prime card has a nice triple-fan cooler that's rarely seen in cards around Nvidia's $300 MSRP, and this Newegg deal goes $10 lower than that. If you have a higher-resolution, higher-refresh-rate monitor and you're looking for a Blackwell upgrade, it's worth checking out MSI's Ventus 3X OC take on the GeForce RTX 5070 12GB. MSI's triple-fan Ventus 3X OC version of this card should keep things cool and quiet. Stack a $20 rebate and $70 back on a Newegg gift card, and this card comes out to $20 under Nvidia's $550 MSRP for this card, making it one of the cheapest RTX 5070s we've seen so far. The RTX 5070 brings a strong triple threat to the midrange of the GPU market: enough raster and ray-tracing performance at 1440p to natively push high-resolution monitors, plus Nvidia's superior DLSS 4 upscaling and unique multi-frame generation capability. This MSI Ventus card is a good catch if you can grab MSI's own rebate and don't mind spending $70 of Newegg bucks at some point in the future. The Dell S3222DGM has long sat atop our list of best gaming monitors. This 32-inch, 2560 x 1440 display has an epic contrast ratio of 3,700:1 and a speedy, 165 Hz refresh rate. It also has excellent build quality and vibrant color. Now, the Dell S3222DGM is on sale for $263 at Best Buy, down from $329. Dell S3222DGM, 32-inch 2K 165 Hz Monitor: now $263 at Best Buy (was $329)This is the lowest price we've seen in a while. Overall, this is a great combination of price, performance and quality. At this low price, it may be time to buy. This powered, USB 3.0 hub has a whopping 10 Type-A ports, each with its own toggle switch. It's also extremely well-built with attractive blue power lights and toggle switches that have a sturdy, clicky feel. For Prime Day, the HB-BU10 is now $37.99, reduced from $44.99 at Amazon. At that price, it's quite a bargain and well worth the spend. Using the HB-BU10, I can connect every peripheral on my desk and then-sone, including my webcam, external SSDs, USB speaker, microSD card reader and Yubikey security key. But the toggle switches are what make this hub really stand out. I just turn off the speaker and turn on the wireless dongle for my wireless headset, no going into Windows settings to switch audio devices. I can also use the toggle switches with microcontrollers such as a Raspberry Pi Pico that normally need to be unplugged and replugged to reboot. Gaming laptops are usually the stars of the show, but there are plenty of productivity-focused laptops on offer during Prime Day. The Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 is 18% off for Prime Day. This 13-inch MacBook Air uses Apple's latest chip, M4, without a fan for silent operation. The 13-inch MacBook Air is a competing Arm-based device with Apple's M4 processor. OLED monitors are gaining popularity due to their perfect blacks and superior contrast, so we've rounded up the best OLED panels we've seen so far for Prime Day, and of the six, we've chosen the Alienware AW3423DWF to highlight as a lower-cost option. The Alienware AW3423DWF is a great panel that continues to impress despite its age, and it's $100 off for Prime Day. We tested this panel thoroughly in our in-depth review, finding it to have wonderful motion processing and SDR and HDR color performance, ultimately awarding it five stars. If you want an OLED monitor with almost no downsides, this might be the ultimate Prime Day deal. We've clocked our five-star rated, "near-perfect" Alienware 360Hz 1440p QD-OLED AW2725DF at $300 off, making it just $599 and a steal this Prime Day. It delivers knockout HDR performance for movies and games alike, features 0.03ms response times, and rocks a futuristic design on the back. This is already an easy recommendation, now at its reduced price, we're almost begging you not to miss it. As you can see from our testing, this monitor shines in benchmarking; the only downsides we could find were no internal speakers and no 3.5mm headphone jack. But at $300 off, we're quite happy to put those quibbles aside. You can get a super fast external storage device sale this Prime Day, but for that you'll have to opt for an SSD. You can also get a slower yet more capacious and affordable hard drive that hits the spot at a sweet deal, too, bringing us to your two options. The WD 5TB Elements portable external HDD hits the spot with 5TB of storage for a mere $115, a nice savings for Prime Day. Naturally this won't be the fastest drive out there due to its spinning platters, but it'll get the job done for bulk storage. The Crucial X10 is a lightning-fast portable SSD with sequential read speeds up to 2,100 MB/s. The Crucial X10 is a lightning-fast portable SSD with sequential read speeds up to 2,100 MB/s. You can opt for faster SSD storage, but the upcharge is steep. The company also has 1TB, 6TB, and 8TB models on offer at stellar prices, which you can read about here. Grab yourself a $1,000 saving on this Gigabyte Auros gaming PC at Newegg. For $2,999, you get an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5080, 64GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. We'd have like to have seen a bit more storage in a $3k rig, but this is still an epic saving. There are some astonishing processor savings at Amazon for Prime Day right now. Two standouts include these AMD Ryzen 9000 CPUs, with discounts of up to $215. This is the perfect processor for those building a powerful workstation. If you want to save even more, then check out this AMD Ryzen 5 9600X, now just $165 at Amazon, an all-time low price. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X comes with six cores and 12 threads, with a maximum boost speed of 5.4GHz and 32 MB of L3 cache. Get plug-and-play compatibility with any USB-capable device and speeds of up to 1,050MB/s. Get a whopping 37% off this external solid state drive from Samsung, perfect for professionals working with media or even as a backup drive. Perfect for picking up an extra SSD or a new case! Factor in that saving and you're looking at getting the card for just $789, which is as good as it gets for the 5070 Ti. You can get a 5070 Ti for $829 from Amazon without a gift card, so the saving is less but you're saving hard cash, rather than in store credits. Buy the 5070 Ti at Newegg and get $110 of store credit after you've made your purchase. This is perfect if you want to complement your new card with an upgrade to your SSD, PC case, or even a monitor. Want a slimmer saving but in cold hard cash? I recommend the Zotac 5070 Ti at Amazon, now $829, a $170 saving. The SteelSeries Arena 9 are our top pick for best PC speakers when it comes to surround sound. With 5.1 configuration and 300 watts of power they are a truly wall-shaking solution to your gaming setup. We've seen them for less, but it's unlikely this price will be beaten during the Prime Day week. We loved these speakers in our Arena 9 review, specifically because they're very powerful and offer fantastic audio with true surround sound. Aside from how much space any 5.1 system takes up, our only ever gripe has been the price, which makes this 34% saving all the more alluring. That's definitely the case with this gaming PC from CyberPowerPC, which is one of the cheapest ways to get your hands on an RTX 5070. This system is currently 15% off for Prime Day, saving you $300. The CyberPowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC features an RTX 5070 and an Intel Core i9-14900KF, paired with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. This is enough power to let you play the latest titles at 1440p and enjoy your favorite VR games. For $1,680, the Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC comes armed with an RTX 5070 paired with Intel's fastest gaming chip, the Core i9-14900KF. The system is also equipped with 32GB of RAM that will keep things snappy even during multi-tasking, and a 2TB SSD. I have a feeling this one will sell out quickly. At least two Tom's Hardware editors own the HOTO NEX 01 Pro screwdriver which has 33% off for Amazon Prime Day HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. Charging is via USB-C and from each full charge you get around 1000 screws. I am one of the staff members who owns this screwdriver, and I've built many IKEA cabinets and recently built an arcade cabinet using this great screwdriver. This is a deal that I can personally stand behind, because I bought the Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphone back in December 2024, and it wasn't this cheap! With noise cancelation, long-range Hollyland Lark M2 microphones are an excellent choice for conference calls, content creation, and interviews. To control the microphones, there is a single button that turns on / off noise cancellation. For more features there is an accompanying Android / iOS app that enables individual control of audio levels, and noise cancellation. The Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphones come with a kit bag full of extras. When not in use, the two microphones and the receiver are contained in a plastic case with onboard LiPo battery charging, just like Airpods. When you are done with them, throw them in the charging case and they will charge ready for the next interview. Paired with a good set of headphones, you have an excellent platform for content creation. I genuinely love these microphones, they are much easier to use than clunky wired mics, and I can use them across many different devices without the need for drivers. Amazon Prime Day has brought us a massive sale on the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD range. Ideal for gaming, computing, or workstations, they're some of the most premium hard drives around. Ideal for gaming or workstations, this 9100 Pro from Samsung has read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s and is a hefty $150 off, down to its lowest-ever price of $399. For a small amount extra on each model you can also get one with a heatsink if you want to optimize your cooling. As noted, these 9100 Pro drives are some of the fastest we've ever tested. A 10 inch 12K mono LCD ensures that your resin prints come out crisp and perfect. In the box you get a super high resolution (12K!) The build plate is laser-carved for excellent bed adhesion and the Fresnel Collimating Light Source emits a uniform beam of light for better print accuracy. Elegoo are experts in resin 3D printers, and we've tested the older Saturn 2 8K and awarded it the Editor's Choice award back in 2022. Grab yourself a bargain gaming laptop with this ROG Strix G16, down to its lowest-ever price of $1,359. This Strix G16 comes with GeForce RTX 4060, Intel Core i9-14900HX, 16GB DDR5-5600, 1TB PCIe SSD, Wi-Fi 6E, and Windows 11. Now Prime Day has started there are laptops galore, so it really pays to peruse for a bargain if you've got the time. With the stroke of midnight PT, Amazon Prime Day has now gone live in the U.S., stay tuned as we start tracking deals across PC hardware, components, and beyond. I've been eyeing an OLED gaming monitor for years, and Samsung now has two great options with hefty savings for Amazon Prime Day. Its new OLED G8 is now almost a third off in the UK. You can score the 27-inch model for £799 instead of £1,099, a 27% saving, or grab the larger 32-inch model for £849 instead of £1,199. If you want a bit more monitor for your money, there's an even bigger saving on the larger 32-inch model. There are definitely still some cheaper 4K OLED monitors in the UK, but this is the best price we've seen yet on Samsung's premium offerings. That gets you a Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 WINDFORCE OC SFF 12G Graphics Card, which is discounted by 19% from its usual price of £619. You can also save big on this MSI RTX 5070 Ti. This deal, which gets you £160 off, brings the card within £10 of MSRP. You also get the 76MB L3 cache and support for DDR5 memory. This Zen 5 processor has 12 cores for a total of 24 threads. An unlocked multiplier means you can manually overclock the chip. As you can see, it stacks up very well in our CPU testing hierarchy, check out the benchmarks below: Good morning, sports fans, and welcome to the start of Amazon Prime Day in the UK - deals switched over at midnight, and there are some handsome hardware savings to be had in the early running. Stephen here to take you through some of the early savings. It's a great time to pick up an all-purpose gaming mouse — Razer's Basilisk V3 Pro is currently on sale for $91.63 at Amazon (was $159.99). This wireless gaming mouse features an ergonomic, contoured right-handed shape, 11 programmable buttons, and a dual-mode tilt wheel (though, unlike the tilt wheel on the Logitech G502 X Plus, the Basilisk V3 Pro's is software- and not hardware-based). The Basilisk V3 Pro is an ergonomically-shaped all-purpose wireless gaming mouse with 11 programmable buttons, a dual-mode tilt wheel, and Razer's FocusPro 30K optical sensor. While there's a newer version of the Basilisk V3 Pro out — the Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, which features Razer's newest FocusPro 35K optical sensor — this is still a fantastic deal. The mouse features tri-mode connectivity (2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired via USB-C), up to 90 hours of battery life, and supports up to an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate via Razer's HyperPolling Wireless Dongle (sold separately). It's on the larger side, but it's still a very comfortable mouse, with textured, grippy sides, a well-placed buttons, and tactile, clicky optical switches. Read our full review of the Basilisk V3 Pro here.— Sarah However, this Prime Day has seen even deeper cuts — in fact, these are the lowest prices we've ever seen for the current family of AirPods. At $89, the AirPods 4 are entering impulse buy territory, and they are great-sounding earbuds for people who don't need a lot of fancy features to enjoy their music. Apple's entry-level Bluetooth earbuds have 5 hours of runtime, which can be boosted by another 30 hours with the included USB-C charging case. The AirPods 4 with ANC bring Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, Transparency Mode, and a Qi Wireless charging case. For $119, you get Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and a USB-C charging case that also supports Qi wireless charging. Logitech's G735 wireless gaming headset isn't the only lightweight white wireless headset on the market, but it is exceptionally comfortable and very pretty. The G735 is part of Logitech's Aurora line, which launched in 2022 at a premium price — the G735 retailed for $229 at launch and currently retails for $259.99, but it's currently on sale for just $129.99 at Amazon. Logitech's G735 is a lightweight, comfortable wireless gaming headset with a detachable boom mic, dual wireless audio mixing, and pretty pastel dual-zone RGB lighting. It features simultaneous dual wireless connections, which means you can listen to and mix audio input from both a 2.4GHz wireless and a Bluetooth source at the same time. It also comes with a detachable boom mic and features replaceable earpads (Logitech sells different colors, for those who want to mix it up). It's an extremely lightweight headset, weighing just 9.6 ounces (273g), and offers up to 56 hours of battery life with the lighting turned off. Inside, it sports 40mm dynamic drivers with a frequency response range of 20 - 20,000 Hz. If you're looking for a gorgeous and responsive all-around gaming mouse, Logitech's G502 X Plus is currently on sale for just $114.99 at Amazon — down 36% from its current retail price of $179.99 (though it was $159.99 at launch), and close to the lowest price we've ever seen it at. The flagship gaming mouse features Logitech's Hero 25K optical sensor, 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel that switches easily between tactile and free-scrolling modes, and an eight-zone LED strip that makes it one of the prettiest mice we've ever tested. The Logitech G502 X Plus gaming mouse is close to its lowest price ever — this comfortable, all-purpose gaming mouse features 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel, Logitech's Hero 25K sensor, and an attractive, customizable RGB lighting strip with 8 seamlessly blended zones. The G502 X Plus is a large, comfortable gaming mouse with an ergonomically contoured right-handed shape. Read our full review of the Logitech G502 X Plus here. The price of SSD storage continues to stay low, surprisingly, in the face of economic turbulence, so you can still score some great deals on big 4TB SSDs. 4TB SSDs are on sale for $0.05 per GB, or even as low as $0.06 per GB for a premium Samsung SSD. We have a much larger list of both 4TB and 8TB SSDs over in our tracking deals post, which you can view here. Our resident Wi-Fi expert, Brandon Hill, has dug up several great Prime Day deals that will enable you to upgrade your wireless network to either Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7, depending on your budget. The TP-Link Archer AXE75 combines excellent performance and value in a Wi-Fi 6E router. The AXE75 Wi-Fi 6E router is now at $120, a nice savings of $30. This router blasts out up to 574 Mbps of bandwidth on the 2.4 GHz band and 2,402 Mbps on the 5 and 6 GHz bands. It also features four Gigabit LAN ports and a USB 3.0 port, allowing you to connect a shared storage device to the network. It also supports the OneMesh standard, which makes expanding your network with satellite devices to extend range a snap. It really doesn't get much easier than OneMesh, where you can simply plug in a networking device and get it working with zero networking hassle. The TP-Link Deco BE23 is a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 router that features three nodes and covers up to 6,500 square feet. Each node features 2.5 GbE ports and supports wired backhaul. This entry-level Wi-Fi mesh setup includes three devices that support MLO, just not on the 6 GHz band. You can check out Brandon's in-depth analysis of these deals here. For students, the MacBook Air (read our review) offers a slim profile, battery life so good you won't need to charge between classes, and strong performance without a fan, so your machine stays silent. This 13-inch MacBook Air uses Apple's latest chip, M4, without a fan for silent operation. Both MacBook Airs come in the same silver, starlight, midnight, or new sky blue colors.While Apple Intelligence isn't the most useful tool yet, at least it means these laptops start with 16GB of RAM alongside 256GB of storage. For those looking for a desktop, the Mac Mini offers a bit more power with the same M4 chip thanks to an active cooling fan. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation. For those looking for a desktop, the Mac Mini offers a bit more power with the same M4 chip thanks to an active cooling fan. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation. It also sports a fast 1ms response time and AMD FreeSync tech. An all-time low price for this mid-range gaming monitor. It also comes with AMD FreeSync and several other features designed to give you an advantage over your opponents in every match. This monitor is also built for use with other monitors — the three-sided borderless design eliminates the thick bezels found on many panels, thus allowing you to stack up side-by-side displays so you can use up to three panels with minimal bezel nastiness to distort your view. This monitor is at an all-time low pricing, and we don't know how long the deal will last. While not quite the best price we've ever seen on it, this Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360L Core 360mm cooler is 15% off and now just $85 at Amazon. If you're looking for a great CPU cooler that can shift heat from your processor, then this is a great bet. This is a great price on a really excellent all-in-one CPU cooler that will fit AMD Ryzen AM5/AM4 and Intel's LGA 1700/1200 sockets. Don't just take our word for it though. We're continuing to see good deals (and perhaps even better deals) at Amazon rivals like Newegg, including these Samsung EVO Plus SSD's, available in 2TB and 4TB models with hefty savings on both. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB is now available at an all-time low price, boasting speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s, a five-year warranty that covers an impressive 2,400 TB of writes, and PCIe Gen 5x2/4x4 hybrid functionality. Save even more money with Samsung's 2TB version of the 990 EVO Plus, with the same 7,250 MB/s speeds and a saving of $37. The latest Steam hardware survey indicates most players only have between 100GB to 249GB of free storage space on their hard drives, barely enough for a couple of AAA games in 2025. Amazon Prime Day hasn't even started yet, but it's already proving enormously fruitful for CPU savings from both AMD and Intel. We're tracking discounts of up to 58% on some models, with prices starting at just $66. If you want to save even more money, there's a fantastic Ryzen 5 9600X that's 41% off, now just $165. This is the perfect processor for those building a powerful workstation. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X comes with six cores and 12 threads, with a maximum boost speed of 5.4GHz and 32 MB of L3 cache. Curious as to how these stack up to other great CPUs on the market, here's our extensive testing data from years of CPU benchmarking. We've been hungry for some RTX 50-series laptop deals in the run-up to Amazon Prime Day, and we finally have our first one, and it's a great one at that! Right now, you can grab $400 off the list price of this Alienware Aurora 16-inch 120Hz Gaming Laptop. Best Buy is hosting it's own Black Friday in July sale to rival Prime Day, and has stolen a march on Amazon with this an other laptop deals that are really quite excellent. Speedy SSDs get all the flashbulbs and attention, but the humble hard drive continues to chug along today in an untold number of desktop PCs, NAS, and various other bulk storage applications. That's because you simply can't beat the pricing for the sheer amount of capacity that you get for an HDD. This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. The BarraCuda is geared specifically for desktop HDD use, so its tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also uses the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, and not that cheap, performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) tech found on bargain basement drives. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. The HS-01 has become my go-to smart soldering iron, and for good reason. Its not compact, but it is designed for travel thanks to an aluminum chassis and protective lid that keeps the soldering tip free from damage or debris. So no accidental keypresses when you are concentrating on soldering. The soldering iron heats up in seconds, and it can hit 420C (788F) with ease. I've soldered up countless projects with it, including a full Zilog Z80 computer kit, and a hexagon shaped PCB with slow color-changing LEDs. The HS-01 didn't skip a beat, it just worked. But Fnirsi has also given us a selection of six soldering iron tips that slot into the HS-01. From fine needle points used in surface mount soldering, to much broader tips used to lay vast amounts of heat into large ground planes or for speaker wires that greedily wick away heat. Bambu Lab has some great deals on the A1 3D printer for UK readers! But what if you don't want or need such an expensive and quite rightly one of the best 3D printers? We gave the A1 4.5 stars and an Editor's choice award because it was fast, intuitive, inexpensive and it comes with a direct drive extruder, useful for flexible filaments like TPU. Saving £130 on this great 3D printer is a really good deal. It may look simple, but this printer packs every automation necessary to plug in and print. This is the same Bambu Lab A1, but you also get a multi-color/material printing system for more advanced prints. Amazon has a couple of excellent UK deals on Crucial's P310 right now. With speeds of up to 7,100MB/s, it's perfect for running as your OS boot drive, the foundation of a budget build, or as a handy storage expansion/upgrade for your existing PC. With a whopping 21% off, the 4TB model is a great saving and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Gaming laptop deals on Amazon UK are fairly scarce right now, but I have found this rather nifty Acer Nitro V16, now 17% off and £829 instead of £999. A similar spec Dell G15 5530 will set you back £1,049 on Amazon, as will the HP Victus 15-inch, both of which come with the same RTX 4050. There's also a 4060 option, but you won't find any savings on that right now, so it's much more expensive. We reviewed this laptop's forebear, the Acer Nitro 16, back in 2023. Since then, Acer has updated it with the aforementioned 8040 series Ryzen processors. With the uprated processor and this excellent deal, it's a pretty handy gaming laptop if you want to beat the Prime Day rush. While not totally solved, OLED burn-in concerns are minimal these days, and Samsung's OLED G6 is an alluring 25% off at Amazon right now, less than £600 for a 27-inch display. This deal is so good that it actually makes that 360Hz refresh rate option cheaper than the same resolution screen with just 240Hz, which you can still expect to pay £680 for. The lowest-ever price we've seen ahead of Prime Day, save some £200 (25%) on this Odyssey OLED G6 replete with HDMI 2.1, 360Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, and more. If you want to save even more money, Philips' excellent gaming offshoot Evnia is flogging its own 27-inch QHD OLED monitor for just £499. You'll get the same 1440p resolution, 360Hz refresh rate, response time, and connectivity. While the savings might not be as juicy as the Samsung, you'll save another £100 for a monitor with ostensibly the same spec sheet, only with a slightly less appealing brand and less eye-catching design. Prime Day doesn't officially kick off until midnight, but there are already some good early deals. This NZXT H6 Flow mid-tower PC case with panoramic class and 3 x 120mm fans (included) just hit its lowest ever price, a full 24% off and now just £76.44 instead of £99.99. We reviewed NZXT H6 Flow RGB and loved its impressive thermal results and the fact that it's very easy to build in. While that's modest for a case of this size, it's not a huge issue in the age of the M2 VNMe. This excellent mid-tower case comes with a panoramic glass panel and three 120mm fans. The dual chamber design makes for excellent thermal performance and there's optimized airflow all-round, as well as intuitive cable management. A four-star Tom's Hardware pick at full price, it's now fully 24%/£23 off for a limited time, the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Move fast, it's a limited run deal with constrained stock. Check out some of the benchmarks from our H6 Flow testing, including thermal and acoustic performance. As you can see, it's a little louder than some alternatives from Hyte under load, but outperformed both cases significantly in terms of thermal performance, with notable GPU cooling and a rather spiffy average. Snag a Samsung's award-winning 49-inch Odyssey OLED G9 monitor for only $959 at Amazon It has a dense resolution that measures in at 5120 x 1440px and a refresh rate that can get as high as 240Hz. This huge gaming monitor features a curved, 49-inch OLED panel. It also has a USB hub for connecting peripherals.

Intel has been in a dire state these past few years, with seemingly nothing going right. According to OregonTech, it's borderline a fight for survival for the once-great American innovation powerhouse as it struggles to even acknowledge being among the top contenders anymore. Despite Tan's insistence, Intel would still rank fairly well given its extensive legacy. While companies like AMD, Nvidia, Apple, TSMC, and even Samsung might be more successful today, smaller chipmakers like Broadcom, MediaTek, Micron, and SK Hynix are not above the Blue Team in terms of sheer impact. Regardless, talking to employees around the world in a Q&A session, Intel's CEO allegedly shared these bleak words: "Twenty, 30 years ago, we were really the leader. At one time, Intel was so powerful that it considered acquiring Nvidia for $20 billion. It never saw AMD as an honorable competitor until it was too late, and Ryzen pulled the carpet from underneath the Blue Team's feet. Now, more people choose to build an AMD system than ever before. Not only that, but AMD also powers your favorite handhelds like the Steam Deck and Rog Ally X, alongside the biggest consoles: Xbox Series and PlayStation 5. AMD works closely with TSMC, another one of Intel's competitors, as the company makes its own chips in-house. Faltering nodes that can't quite match the prowess of Taiwan have arguably held back Intel's processors from reaching their full potential. A long-overdue admission of failure that could've been prevented had Intel been allowed to make its leading-edge CPUs with external manufacturing in mind from the start. As such, Intel has been laying off thousands across the world in a bid to cut costs. Costs have skyrocketed due to high R&D spending for future nodes, and the company faces a $16 billion loss in Q3 last year. Intel wants to be more like AMD and NVIDIA, who are faster, meaner, and more ruthless competitors these days, especially with the advent of AI. An era almost entirely powered by Nvidia's data center GPUs, highlighting another sector where Intel failed to capitalize on its position. On training I think it is too late for us. Tan also highlighted agentic AI—an emerging field where AI systems can act autonomously without constant human input—as a key growth area. He expressed optimism that recent high-level hires could help steer Intel back into relevance in AI, hinting that more talent acquisitions are on the way. A few more people are coming on board,” said Tan. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. That being said, Intel now lags behind in data center CPUs, too, where AMD's EPYC lineup has overtaken them in the past year, further dwindling the company's confidence. Additionally, last year, Intel's board forced former CEO Pat Gelsinger out of the company and replaced him with Lip-Bu Tan, who appears to have a distinctly different, more streamlined vision for the company. Instead of focusing on several different facets, such as CPU, GPU, foundry, and more, at once, Lip wants to hone in on what the company can do well at one time. This development follows long-standing rumors of Intel splitting in two and forming a new foundry division that would act as an independent subsidiary, turning the main Intel into a fabless chipmaker. Both AMD and Apple, Intel's rivals in the CPU market, operate like this, and Nvidia has also always used TSMC or Samsung to build its graphics cards. However, it's too early to speculate given that 18A, Intel's proposed savior, is still a year away.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's primarily virtual, but founders will convene for an in-person summit at Google. Google has a pretty good track record so far of identifying notable AI startups. Alumni from American Infrastructure's first cohort last year include the government contractor company Cloverleaf AI, which went on to raise a $2.8 million seed round, and Zordi, an autonomous agtech that had already raised $20 million from Khosla Ventures. And it partners with some of the most significant AI companies that use its cloud. Here are the companies selected for this latest batch: TechCrunch reported a few months ago that it launched its inaugural AI Futures Fund initiative to back startups building with the latest AI tools from DeepMind. Sundar Pichai also said the company would create a $120 million Global AI Opportunity Fund to help make AI education more accessible to people throughout the world. A Google spokesperson told us earlier this year that its Google for Startups Founders Fund would also look to start backing AI-focused startups as of this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amidst unprecedented budget cuts and looming layoffs, U.S. President Donald Trump has appointed Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy as acting NASA Administrator. “Sean is doing a TREMENDOUS job in handling our Country's Transportation Affairs, including creating a state-of-the-art Air Traffic Control systems, while at the same time rebuilding our roads and bridges, making them efficient, and beautiful, again,” Trump said. Duffy has no formal background in science or space, though the DOT does oversee the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees commercial space transportation and air traffic control. As he will perform both leadership roles simultaneously, it's likely that his NASA tenure will be focused on implementing Trump's near-term policy goals. Those goals include wide-ranging cuts to NASA's budget that will likely slash many science initiatives and steeply reduce its workforce. Duffy's appointment comes just weeks after Trump abruptly withdrew his nomination of billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to NASA Administrator. Trump said he rescinded support following a “thorough review of prior associations,” citing Isaacman's donations to Democratic candidates and the billionaire's close ties to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. “I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life,” Trump said in a separate Truth Social post. Duffy replaces Kennedy Space Center director Janet Petro, a long-time NASA bureaucrat. It's unclear how long he will remain in the position.

China's aggressive push to develop a domestic semiconductor industry has largely been successful. The country now has fairly advanced fabs that can produce logic chips using 7nm-class process technologies as well as world-class 3D NAND and DRAM memory devices. However, there are numerous high-profile failures due to missed investments, technical shortcomings, and unsustainable business plans. This has resulted in numerous empty fab shells — zombie fabs — around the country, according to DigiTimes. As of early 2024, China had 44 wafer semiconductor production facilities, including 25 300-mm fabs, five 200-mm wafers, four 150-mm wafers, and seven inactive ones, according to TrendForce. Companies like SMIC, HuaHong, Nexchip, CXMT, and Silan planned to start production at 10 new fabs, including nine 300-mm fabs and one 200-mm facility by the end of 2024. However, while China continues to lead in terms of new fabs coming online, the country also leads in terms of fab shells that never got equipped or put to work, thus becoming zombie fabs. Over the past several years, around a dozen high-profile fab projects, which cost investors between $50 billion and $100 billion, went bust. Blacklisted by U.S. government; stole trade secrets from UMC; failed to develop DRAM process node Failed to launch; no progress has been made beyond PowerPoint presentation Ran out of funds; site abandoned with unfinished buildings Many Chinese semiconductor fab projects failed due to a lack of technical expertise amid overambitious goals: some startups aimed at advanced nodes like 14nm and 7nm without having experienced R&D teams or access to necessary wafer fab equipment. These efforts were often heavily reliant on provincial government funding, with little oversight or industry knowledge, which lead to collapse when finances dried up or scandals emerged. Some fab ventures were plagued by fraud or mismanagement, with executives vanishing or being arrested, sometimes with local officials involved. So, let's go over some of China's most ambitious fab projects, many of which have fallen into oblivion, or have become a dreaded zombie fab. Leading chipmakers, such as Intel, TSMC, Samsung, or SMIC have spent decades developing their production technologies and gain experience in chips on their leading-edge nodes. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. HSMC was founded in late 2017 with a plan to build 14nm and 7nm-capable logic fabs in Wuhan with an initial investment of around $19 billion. The company was born after issues with HSMC occurred. Despite government backing, the project never progressed beyond hype: there were no equipment orders, no factory construction, and by 2021, operations were suspended. By early 2019, the site was cleared of equipment and personnel, and notices were issued in May 2020 to formally suspend operations. However, it is unclear whether the Chengdu fab will be used as its flagship facility. A rare exception to the numerous failures that China has encountered thus far. Dehuai Semiconductor, an analog and mixed signal IDM startup, was not so lucky. Dehuai did not present a clear roadmap, and made false claims about how its project was proceeding. By mid-2021, local anti-corruption authorities arrested key executives after investigations revealed that no fab had been built: only initial site preparation had begun. The fate of Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit (JHICC) is a bit different. JHICC was launched with an ambition to build China's first large-scale DRAM fab in 2016. The company magically began trial production about two years after its inception, but it was soon discovered that it had stolen process technology from Micron using the help of UMC. As a result, while JHICC has formally survived and exists on paper, it is a spectre of its former ambitions. The company aimed to produce 100,000 300-mm wafers annually and attracted an initial investment of approximately $1.8 billion. Despite developing its first in-house PCM chips by 2019, AMS ran into financial trouble by 2020 and could no longer pay for equipment or employee salaries. Producing commodity types of memory is a challenging business. Tsinghua Unigroup was instrumental in developing Yangtze Memory Technology Co. and making it a world-class maker of 3D NAND. However, subsequent 3D NAND and DRAM projects were scrapped in 2022, after the company faced financial difficulties one year prior.Tsinghua Unigroup's second 3D NAND project aimed to mirror YMTC's model. But, at the time, even YMTC itself was still far from challenging multinational 3D NAND makers. So, the logic of building another costly fab (potentially reaching $24 billion) and possibly developing a new 3D NAND process technology was questionable. For its DRAM efforts, Tsinghua brought in former Elpida CEO Yukio Sakamoto, who had experience competing with Samsung and Micron. Given the years and billions needed to develop DRAM technology — compounded by tool supply risks — Tsinghua scrapped its DRAM ambitions. By contrast, CMOS image sensors (CIS) are produced using fairly basic production nodes and on relatively inexpensive (yet very large) fabs. Nonetheless, this did not stop Jiangsu Zhongjing Aerospace, Huaian Imaging Device Manufacturer (HiDM), and Tacoma Semiconductor from failing. China's wave of semiconductor production companies' failures highlights a fundamental reality about the chip industry: large-scale manufacturing requires more than capital and ambition. Without sustained expertise, supply chain depth, and long-term planning, even the best-funded initiatives can quickly fall apart. These deep structural issues in the People's Republic's semiconductor strategy will continue to hamper its progress for years to come before the fundamental issues will be solved.

A lot of countries now sabotage international cooperation for political and ideological reasons rather than cooperate, with China's actions against shipping in the pacific (Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, even Australia at times) as currently as the worst example, but far from the only one (Russia, boycotts against Israel, ...), and it certainly seems like it's still getting worse. For 3 years now we're doing about 1 new armed conflict breaking out every 2 months.It reminds me a lot of the pre-WW1 situation. EU/Turkey/Israel vs Russia/North Korea/Iran/"the non-aligned movement" who are doing trench warfare. 5 years ago there were 3 active conflicts, and 100 "frozen" ones.

It was a mistaken act committed intentionally.

Our democracies are built on the principle that we have due process for people that were not upholding the law. The people in those concentration camps did not have due process. Not by ICE, not by the people governing those camps.If the legal process is abandoned, it's by definition an absolutist executive power.The alien invasion excuse will only go so far. Maybe you should think about what happens when you run out of Latinos to blame, because nations that are built on fascist principles will need further demographics to blame, that's how they work. And we have a lot of historic evidence on what happens once those demographics run out. The people in those concentration camps did not have due process.

This is the only power station in this class that has a 1500W AC output that costs under $400, yet the competition is still $430 to $500 even with a sale. For Prime Day, Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is currently available at $399, a discount from its original price of $799 which is an astounding 50% off. For the price, you get a portable power station that you can bring along on camping trips, road trips, or backup use at home. With advanced ChargeShield 2.0 technology, the Explorer 1000 v2 will achieve a full charge from 0% within an hour with emergency charging mode activated via the Jackery app. The unit also charges at 1.7 hours as an option to ensure battery longevity but being able to charge up quickly in emergency situations is a major advantage. The battery itself is a LiFePO4 heavy-duty one that will retain over 70% of its initial capacity even after 4,000 charging cycles which translates to over 10 years of usage for the average user. It contains two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, DC car port, and three pure sine wave AC ports, thereby enabling you to power or charge multiple devices at once. The 100W USB-C port offers fast charging of laptops, tablets and other devices even without an adapter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Night at the Museum film franchise is getting another go at 20th Century Studios under Disney to mine more historical hijinks. It's been 20 years (a shocking number, yes) since the release of the first film starring Ben Stiller (Severance) as a museum night watch guard who goes on adventures when the exhibits come to life at night. The concept spawned several sequels, which featured stars like Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Rami Malek, and Dan Stevens as legendary figures. Writer Tripper Clancy (Die Hart) has been tapped as the reboot's scribe. There's no word yet if Levy will take the filmmaking reins again, but it was specified that the new movies will take place in a new museum with new characters. It was floated that the ride characters would come to life after dark. Follow me here: the Imagineering arm of the parks industry, for example, has made historical figures into animatronics and will be adding one based on Walt Disney himself come Disneyland's 70th birthday, right? So maybe this time around, instead of these figures coming to life because of pure magic, perhaps the figures in the museum exhibits might be animatronics-based. It would be really unhinged to go with that thread and make this some sci-fi fare. Then we'd really want Stiller to come back and direct.
