U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante, who is based in New Hampshire, issued the ruling in a class-action lawsuit featuring multiple parties, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who would be detrimentally affected by Trump's executive order. The Supreme Court suggested in its decision last month that class-action suits could be one of the ways in which a federal judge may be able to issue a nationwide order. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Laplante's injunction places a temporary block on Trump's enforcement of the executive order, barring the administration from enforcing it against citizens who were born in the U.S., as well as future children who may be affected by Trump's order. However, that argument may fall flat, as Laplante was appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush. Laplante has also been more cautious in his previous rulings. “I'm the judge who wasn't comfortable with issuing a nationwide injunction,” he said in his courtroom. The Supreme Court suggested class action is a better option.” “We are fighting to ensure President Trump doesn't trample on the citizenship rights of one single child,” Wofsy added.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Don't get me wrong, I was always aware of the benefits conferred on me by a U.S. passport, but I didn't give it much more thought than that. My great-grandparents immigrated through Ellis Island, and eventually I happened to be born on a certain tract of land, within certain lines drawn up by men many years ago. For more than 150 years, the Fourteenth Amendment has guaranteed birthright citizenship to every child born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents' immigration status. Another seven percent of the country — or 24.5 million people — are naturalized U.S. citizens. A mass deportation agenda once pitched as targeting the “worst of the worst” has quickly expanded into an all-out assault on immigrant populations, sweeping up citizens and non-citizens alike. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly weaponized immigration status to silence his critics, targeting and deporting what he's called “the enemy from within.” First, he went after the visas of international college students, especially those students who protested to demand an end to Israel's genocide in Gaza. Then, when the Trump administration learned that Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was in fact a lawful permanent resident, officials attempted to revoke his green card and deport him too. Now, we're seeing the goal posts shift yet again: In a June 11 memo, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is prioritizing efforts to strip naturalized Americans of their citizenship. Last week, Trump amplified baseless claims — circulated online by racist extremists — that Zohran Mamdani, the New York City Democratic mayoral candidate, could be living in the U.S. without authorization. Mamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, to one Indian parent and one Ugandan parent of Indian descent, and moved to New York City at age seven. He became naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2018 and was elected to the New York state assembly two years later. Whether or not the administration moves forward on its threat to revoke Mamdani's citizenship, Trump's comments clearly aim to intimidate opponents and curb Mamdani's enforcement of New York City's sanctuary city policies, should he be elected mayor. Republicans have already threatened to arrest and criminally prosecute several Democratic mayors of sanctuary cities — even as courts have long upheld the legality of policies that restrict local law enforcement from collaborating with ICE. Brandishing Mamdani's status as an international-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, and painting it as something subject to the Oval Office's whims, is just another ugly iteration of Trump's crackdown on dissent. History has also shown us that authoritarian regimes readily exploit legal frameworks, eroding the already-porous bounds of legality to further repression. We've seen how quickly this administration has weaponized allegations of “criminality” to further political goals — sanctuary cities, for instance, are not illegal, but the administration has repeatedly claimed that they are. And in his push to revoke international student visas, Trump has falsely claimed that protesting against Israel's genocide in Gaza amounts to illegal support for terrorist organizations. History has also shown us that authoritarian regimes readily exploit legal frameworks, eroding the already-porous bounds of legality to further repression. Trump has made it clear that his issues with Mamdani are ideological. On July 8, Trump ramped up his diatribe against Mamdani by suggesting to reporters during a Cabinet meeting that the White House would somehow take control of New York City if the Democratic socialist is elected mayor in November. “If a communist gets elected to run New York, it can never be the same. Still, while Trump's authoritarian second term has brought the U.S. to a point of Constitutional crisis, denaturalization itself isn't new. Back then, fears about the spread of communism led to more than 20,000 denaturalization cases per year. But let us not forget that the Red Scare eventually fell out of favor. McCarthy was censured by the Senate and exposed for his baseless accusations. We must not let Trump's threats dissuade us from speaking out for what is right, pushing back against political persecution and standing up for our neighbors regardless of immigration status.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Vice President Mike Pence says he thinks isolationists “may have lost some of their footing” in President Donald Trump's administration, as he praised Trump's tougher talk toward Russia's Vladimir Putin and his decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities. Pence, since his split with Trump after the 2020 election, has often criticized the president's approach to Russia and his tepid support for Ukraine. Related article Pence rebuffs Trump on tariffs, Russia and January 6 pardons in CNN interview Pence said Trump's sharper criticism of Putin and support for Ukraine could be the result of Trump tuning out those advocating isolationist policies after some criticized the United States' direct military involvement in Israel's efforts to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions. “I think what may have changed is that some of the isolationist voices in and around this administration have recently condemned the president's correct and courageous decision to launch a military assault against Iran,” Pence said. “I think they may have lost some of their footing with the president.” GOP lawmakers are seeking not to get ahead of the White House on the measure, but Pence said he “spoke Trump fluently for four years” and noted that Trump said Tuesday he is “looking very strongly” at the bill. He suggested it could strengthen Trump's hand against Putin. “When I saw the other day that he said he's strongly looking at it, I know what that means,” Pence said. Noem, at a meeting of the FEMA Review Council, said disaster response should be led by state and local governments, rather than the federal agency. “It has been slow to respond at the federal level,” said Noem, a former South Dakota governor. Pence, who was governor of Indiana prior to serving as vice president alongside Trump for four years, said he takes Noem's point that states play the primary role in disaster response. “I think making sure that the federal government is there, speeding those resources to hurting Americans, is important and should be continued,” Pence said. The former vice president, a long-time critic of tariffs, also urged Congress to step in and assert its authority as Trump tacks steep fees on most goods entering the United States. Pence paired his call for Congress to check the president on tariffs with praise for the far-reaching policy law Trump signed last week to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, slash spending and impose work requirements on Medicaid and more. “I think that, combined with telling the story about how they extended those tax cuts, defunded Planned Parenthood, reformed Medicaid, rebuilt our military, is a winning message in 2026 and beyond,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island gives 300th climate speech on the US Senate floor He began giving these speeches in 2012, when Barack Obama was in his first term, and has consistently criticized both political parties for their lackluster response to the climate emergency. While Whitehouse slams his fellow Democrats for timidity, he blasts Republicans for being in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry, an entity whose behavior “has been downright evil”, he said. “To deliberately ignore [the laws of physics] for short-term profits that set up people for huge, really bad impacts – if that's not a good definition of evil, I don't know what is.” Long before Donald Trump reportedly told oil company CEOs he would repeal Joe Biden's climate policies if they contributed $1bn to his 2024 presidential campaign, Republicans went silent on climate change in return for oil industry money, Whitehouse asserted. I could take facts from colleagues' home states right to them, and it would make no difference because of this enormous, multibillion-dollar political club that can [punish] anyone who crosses them.” Most Republicans even stay silent despite climate change's threat to property values and other traditional GOP priorities, Whitehouse said. He noted that even the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell – who is not known for his climate bona fides, he said – testified before the Senate in February that in 10-15 years there will be whole regions of the country where nobody can get a mortgage because extreme weather will make it impossible to afford or even obtain insurance. Democrats can turn all this to their advantage if they get “more vocal and aggressive”, Whitehouse argued. Democrats also need to recognize “how much [public] support there is for climate action”, he said. Yet this overwhelming climate majority does not realize it is the majority, partly because that fact has been absent from most news coverage, social media and politicians' statements. Democrats keep “getting caught in this stupid doom loop in which our pollsters say: ‘Well, climate's not one of the top issues that voters care about, so then we don't talk about it'”, said Whitehouse. “So it never becomes one of the top issues that voters care about. [But] if you actually go ask [voters] and engage on the issue, it explodes in enthusiasm. It has huge numbers when you bother to engage, and we just haven't.” Nevertheless, Whitehouse is optimistic that climate denial won't prevail forever. “And if we're effective at communicating what a massive fraud has been pulled on the American public by the fossil fuel industry denial groups, then I think that's a powerful combination.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts, politicians and concerned Texans say their state could be a blueprint for Republican efforts to stave off losses in next year's elections, with some calling the GOP division a “festering wound” in Texas – all while Donald Trump stacks the deck against potential Democratic inroads. Last month, nearly 150 people showed up at a Tarrant county commissioners court meeting in north Texas. The packed building wasn't used to such a high volume of visitors, but the day's key vote had been hotly contested for weeks. In an unusual move, the commissioners court initiated a redistricting process that both liberal and conservative voters widely criticized. One map, as proposed, would essentially funnel more people of color away from precinct 2 and into precinct 1, thereby creating an opening for a GOP that has historically underperformed with people of color. At the 3 June meeting, dozens of speakers rose to voice their concerns, and several were kicked out of the meeting by O'Hare. “Your constituents are telling you that they do not want these maps,” one woman said during the public comment section. Shortly afterward, the Trump administration said it wanted more maps to be redrawn in Texas ahead of the 2026 midterms – and the governor, Greg Abbott, said on Wednesday that a special legislative session called for later this month would pick up that cause. Amid a heated Senate primary race and Trump's slipping approval rating, Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist at the University of Houston who has extensively researched the Texas GOP, said “partisan leaders are always looking for an edge”. “Redistricting gives them the clearest opportunity to increase their strength and numbers. Bob Stein, a gerrymandering expert at Rice University in Houston, echoed Rottinghaus's comments. “Republicans are afraid they're going to lose upwards of three to four seats in Louisiana, California and New York and probably New Jersey,” he said. “In fact, some of the privileged stuff I get to see says it could be a complete sweep. So what they want to do is get going now, and what you're seeing in Tarrant county is the effect of that.” Most recently, less than 8% of Tarrant county voters cast ballots in May's local elections. All of this spells trouble for the GOP as it prepares for 2026, especially in light of a GOP primary race that has already gotten personal. Senator John Cornyn, who has been in office since 2002, is being challenged by the state attorney general, Ken Paxton, whose controversies includes an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and an impeachment on charges of bribery, obstruction of justice, harassment and abuse of office. Cornyn, who is typically seen as a more traditional Republican, has attacked Paxton's character, using terms such as “conman” and “fraud” to describe his opponent. Paxton, for his part, has cast Cornyn as an establishment figure out of touch with Texas. Ken Shimamoto, a Fort Worth resident who opposed his county's recent redistricting, is following the Cornyn-Paxton primary race and displeased by what he sees. “Everybody hates Ted Cruz, but Cornyn seemed the more reasonable senator until Paxton mounted his challenge,” he said. “And ever since then, it seems like Cornyn has been bending over backwards to appease Donald Trump.” Other efforts have been less obvious but far more insidious. Three days after Paxton announced his challenge, Cornyn asked the Department of Justice to investigate the East Plano Islamic Center's plans to build a community around a mosque. Without evidence, the senator claimed such a project could constitute religious discrimination. Despite widespread criticism (the Council on American-Islamic Relations called Cornyn's complaint “factually baseless”) the justice department opened an investigation – only to close it roughly a month later. To Texans like Shimamoto, as well as the political scientists interviewed for this story, there's a clear tie between gerrymandering and races like the Cornyn-Paxton fight. Only the most extreme candidates win in a primary, which means conservatives must run further right if they hope to triumph or keep the seat they already have. “We've been gerrymandered to death,” said Allison Campolo, who lives in Fort Worth and is running to be chair of the Tarrant county Democratic party. At the same time, politicians like Cornyn, Paxton and even Trump are unpopular in Texas. Theoretically, this is good news for people upset about redistricting efforts or unhappy with their current leadership – but only if they vote. “Texans have to continue to vote and make their voices heard,” said Democratic House representative Marc Veasey, whose district includes part of Fort Worth.</p>

Taking this legendary rail journey last April, I departed from Vancouver, rolled along hills and through hot desert canyons, and found myself near the end among the ice-capped peaks of Jasper National Park. As Jasper welcomes tourists back, this train is one of the most awe-inspiring ways to get there, turning a 90-minute flight into a two-day, one-night adventure. For travellers like myself, it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Though each day may be different, they are all just as well-rehearsed. The Rocky Mountaineer's crew works overnight to get the train ready, says Celia Bautista, who has been a train manager for four years. Soon after boarding, you're offered tea, coffee and cake with lemon glaze poured on top at your seat, before you're invited to the dining cart for breakfast. (The train's cheaper SilverLeaf service still offers great views – the main difference is you're served breakfast and lunch at your seat.) Elaborate and colourful meals include Fraser Valley chicken paillard with corn and fennel sauté, locally-farmed steelhead with gnocchi, seared albacore tuna with truffle aioli, and for dessert, a lavender lemon posset.

While we were in Jasper National Park's Yellowhead Pass, Mohns told us the area is home to around 1,500 moose and that if we see wildlife, we should yell so the staff can alert the other coaches. I enjoyed my cabin in Jasper, walking the trails near the gushing Athabasca Falls, and seeing wildlife such as mountain goats, elk, and a black bear emerging from hibernation. But I missed the train, with its promise of serendipity, and an excuse to be still. It helped me forge a deeper connection to this part of the country. Black Canyon, near Ashcroft, a landscape of dusty-brown ridges and large osprey nests.Rocky Mountaineer Travellers in wheelchairs can use a lift to get on the train, and also have access to narrow wheelchairs on board that fit in the aisle and the railcar elevator. The Rocky Mountaineer is not a sleeper train – the night in Kamloops is spent in a three- or four-star hotel. Pre and post-trip extensions are offered in five-star hotels, such as the Fairmont Waterfront in Vancouver and Jasper Park Lodge. Rocky Mountaineer packages can include excursions such as wildlife tours, ice plunges and Indigenous plant walks. Some areas of Jasper National Park remain closed because of wildfire damage; you can find updated information on the Parks Canada website. You can extend your trip by booking a bus from Jasper to Banff on the Icefields Parkway, where you pass jagged sawtooth mountains, gravel flats with braided streams, and the Columbia Icefield.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has detained two Chinese nationals in Kyiv suspected of attempting to steal classified military technology related to Ukraine's Neptune cruise missile system, the agency announced on July 9. The younger man, who remained in Ukraine after being expelled from university in 2023 for poor academic performance, allegedly attempted to recruit a Ukrainian national with access to classified defense technologies in order to obtain technical data on the RK-360MC Neptune missile system. China has emerged as one of Moscow's key wartime partners, helping Russia circumvent sanctions and becoming the largest supplier of dual-use goods aiding its defense sector. President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly accused China of backing Russia and signed an order on July 8 imposing sanctions on five Chinese-registered companies for allegedly supplying components found in Russian Shahed-type drones used to attack Ukraine. The Neptune, a Ukrainian-developed coastal defense missile, gained international attention after it was used to sink the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva in 2022. Investigators allege the elder suspect, who resides in China but made periodic visits to Ukraine, personally supervised his son's espionage activities. Searches of the suspects' belongings uncovered mobile phones containing evidence of coordinated efforts to spy on Ukrainian military technology, including encrypted communications between the two men. If convicted, they face up to 15 years in prison and confiscation of property. Ukraine struck a Russian warehouse storing ammunition and reconnaissance drones with a Neptune missile near the village of Chaltyr in Russia's Rostov Oblast in a January operation carried out by the SBU and Ukraine's Navy. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. Therefore, one of my ideas is that it can be Ukraine's defense minister," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets mistakenly presented a June 30 report by a little-known group as an internal U.N. analysis on the 2022 Olenivka prison explosion, which killed over 50 Ukrainian POWs, Slidstvo.Info reported on July 10, citing a response from Lubinets's office. "I wouldn't characterize it as something that guarantees peace, but it's a concept that, you know, that I'll take back to the president (Donald Trump)," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said without giving further details. The Kyiv Independent staff documented what it feels like to live and sleep in Kyiv, Ukraine, as Russia intensifies its drone and missile attacks on the city. Filmed over several weeks in June and July, our journalists take shelter in bathrooms, basements, and parking garages as explosions ring out overhead. DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy company, has begun final commissioning of the country's largest battery energy storage project, , developed in partnership with Fluence Energy Inc., DTEK announced on July 10 at the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in Rome. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during the ASEAN Summit. "The Americans need some of them (Patriot air defense systems) themselves, but they also have a lot of them," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. Moscow's forces launched yet another mass aerial attack, deploying 18 missiles and about 400 drones, including 200 Shahed-type kamikaze models, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>McDonald's Snack Wrap is finally returning to menus, going on sale Thursday in the chain's latest push to revive slumping sales. Despite being pulled from a majority of menus in 2016, the Snack Wrap has remained a fan favorite, with thousands of people demanding McDonald's bring it back. They finally get their wish this week with the relaunched version: the chain's new crispy chicken strips, lettuce and cheese on a tortilla, with the option of either ranch dressing or spicy pepper sauce. The menu item, which will be a permanent addition, is priced at $2.99. The company said low- and middle-income consumers pulled back their spending because of economic uncertainty from the Trump administration's chaotic trade war. McDonald's isn't alone in its financial slump. Other fast-casual chains, including Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Starbucks, reported meager earnings results this year as consumer sentiment sank to record lows in the spring. The re-introduction of the Snack Wrap “will likely be a positive move” for McDonald's, according to RJ Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, which tracks foot traffic. He told CNN that the “return of nostalgic products has driven incremental visits” for competing fast food chains. McDonald's menu has already gone through a slew of changes this quarter. Consumers are increasingly choosing to make breakfast at home, meaning slower sales for McDonald's in the mornings, executives revealed on its most recent earnings call. Related article Why crispy chicken is the latest battleground in fast food The chain is adding a new “Daily Double” cheeseburger to its value menu beginning July 22 — a new option for its “McValue Meal Deal” bundle. Those limited-time dessert offerings come after a planned partnership with Krispy Kreme to sell donuts at all of its US restaurants was cancelled mid-rollout. “McDonald's latest menu additions align with several innovation trends we've seen across the fast food category, including a shift toward afternoon snacking and the introduction of new sauces to create product excitement,” Hottovy said, adding that the new additions rolled out so far “have helped drive incremental visits” during specific times of day. Beverages will likely be part of the next shakeup. McDonald's announced in May that it was pulling the plug on its CosMc's spinoff, which was opened in response to demand for specialty coffee and rise of beverage chains. Some of the drinks formerly sold there will soon be available at McDonald's. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Minister Mark Carney meets with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in May.Leah Millis/Reuters Is Canada about to make it through the worst of what a Trump administration can bring? That may be an odd question given Tuesday's announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump of a 50-per-cent tariff on copper, adding to a seemingly endless series of bad-to-worse news from Washington on trade. However, there is a larger, more significant change working its way through U.S. courts to which we should be paying attention. This change will either limit the President's ability to impose tariffs on Canada – or reinforce it. But the appeals court has put the case on an expedited timeline and is set to hear arguments on July 31. Even though Mr. Trump has already chosen to exclude products traded under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement from these IEEPA tariffs, that exemption is based on presidential whim; should the President change his mind, those tariffs could reappear. U.S. court rules Trump does not have ‘unbounded authority' to impose tariffs As bad as Tuesday's announcement on copper was, a decision by the President to change his mind on the CUSMA exemption for his global tariffs would be worse. In a side note, the Trump administration has already conceded in legal filings that importers who have paid IEEPA tariffs will be eligible for refunds, including interest, if the U.S. Court of International Trade's decision survives appeal. This is obviously a momentous ruling for Americans and Canadians and needs to be unpacked, especially in light of Tuesday's announcement. A U.S. president has several powers, all delegated from Congress, that can be used to impose tariffs. Section 232 and other non-IEEPA tariff measures require an investigation, public comment and the issuance of a report, all of which turn a “snap of the fingers” act into a drawn-out, politicized, public process. The Section 232 investigation into steel and aluminum took nearly 270 days. Copper took a few months, but the investigations all take time. U.S. appeals court reinstates Trump's tariffs as legal battle reframes global trade war Furthermore, these tariffs are applied at the four-digit level of classification under the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule, which has more than 1,220 four-digit headings. The political and regulatory math is not in the President's favour for widespread use of this or other IEEPA substitutes. There is still the potential for real economic harm from the use of other tariff measures, as we have seen. However, it is critical to put this in perspective. For Canada and other countries, if the ruling stands, Mr. Trump's negotiating leverage will be weakened – both in imposing new tariffs and threatening to, in effect, abrogate agreements by imposing new tariffs at will. Step 1 is to pause making any further concessions or signing agreements until the court cases play out. Second, signing agreements now, when the President still has a strong hand, makes even less sense. For example, Canada already has, or thought it had, an agreement to end the steel and aluminum tariffs. But in his second term, Mr. Trump reneged on the agreement he signed in his first term without adhering to any of its conditions. The administration's expansion of Section 232 tariff investigations to other products makes this point. Not having this sort of concession is an explicit acknowledgment that, like the steel and aluminum agreement, sooner or later, any deal will not be worth the paper on which it is written.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elbridge Colby halted supplies in bid to follow administration's ‘America First' policy, say insiders Donald Trump's frustration was clear when he was asked who had approved a pause on sending weapons to Ukraine during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. “I don't know,” he snapped at the reporter. The freeze in military aid last week blindsided top national security figures, alarmed key allies and was rapidly reversed by the US president himself, but not before generating a rush of headlines about dysfunction and incoherence in the policy process. At the centre of it all is a little-known Pentagon official: Elbridge Colby, a national security policy chief, who reportedly halted supplies because US stockpiles were running low. Insiders say that, at best, it illustrates confusion about how to put Mr Trump's “America First” policies into practice and, at worst, it shows how the administration's decision-making process has broken down. A former member of the US national security council said Mr Colby had come unstuck because he was trying to put proverbial flesh on the bones of Mr Trump's vague platform of ending foreign wars and avoiding anything that looked like intervention. Others pushed back on the claim that Mr Colby was behind a freeze. “There was no pause,” said a person familiar with the events. But his return in the second Trump administration has proved controversial. He has argued consistently that America can no longer rely on massively outspending rivals. His argument that defence resources should be reoriented away from Europe and the Middle East and towards China ignited a feud between Maga loyalists and hawkish conservative senators when his name was put forward earlier this year. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas senator, led opposition to his nomination and highlighted some of Mr Colby's past comments on Iran, including how he had played down the threat of Tehran obtaining nuclear weapons. A nuclear-armed Iran could be contained, he argued in 2012, angering Israel's allies who, much like Mr Trump, see it as an existential threat. Opponents scoured his background for ammunition to prevent him taking up the position. They pointed to a grandfather who ran the CIA and degrees from Harvard University and Yale Law School as evidence that he was too “establishment” for the Trump administration. Arthur Schwartz, an adviser to Donald Trump Jr who is also close to JD Vance, the vice-president, had responsibility for steering his nomination through the Senate. Key Trump confidants, such as Charlie Kirk, head of the Turning Point USA youth movement, spoke up in his support. And Mr Vance delivered a telling line at his confirmation hearing, setting out an “America First” approach to Pentagon policy. “We cannot fight wars unless our troops have the ammunition we need; we cannot defend our own national security unless we have the tank shells, the artillery shells and increasingly the drones and other advanced weapons that are necessary to actually fight battles when – God forbid – those battles are necessary to fight,” he said. After Mr Colby concluded his review last month, the US halted supplies of Patriot air defence systems, Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, missiles used by Himars rocket artillery, Stinger portable air defence systems and 155mm artillery shells promised by the Biden administration. “This decision was made to put America's interests first following a [US department of defence] review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,” said Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman. Some of that stems from the administration's mix of traditional conservatives and Maga World iconoclasts, according to John Herbst, former US ambassador to Ukraine. Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to Mr Trump, said pivoting away from Ukraine to China made more sense from an “America First” perspective. “This is key to our hemispheric defence, and we're being sucked dry,” he said, before drawing an analogy with the strikes on Iran.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a Marshall Plan-style reconstruction strategy to help Ukraine recover from Russia's all-out war in his opening remarks at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 10. The previous three conferences have taken place in Lugano, London, and Berlin. "We need a Marshall Plan-style approach, and we should develop it together," Zelensky told representatives of governments, international organizations, and businesses who gathered in Rome. The Marshall Plan was an economic aid program that the United States offered to European countries after World War II to help them rebuild their economies. Drawing comparisons to existing international coalitions supporting Kyiv's military efforts, he called upon international partners to form a recovery coalition and help Ukraine rebuild with a systematic approach. "The way we rebuild our country can also modernize your infrastructure and industries. Zelensky stressed that Kyiv would welcome only "true partners" in the initiative, "those who are not helping Russia continue this war." The president called for more "active" ways of using roughly $300 billion in Russian assets immobilized by the West to aid Ukraine's recovery efforts. He also urged foreign partners to increase investment in Ukraine's missiles, air defenses, and interceptor drones to help fend off Russian aerial attacks. Speaking before Zelensky, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni emphasized Italy's commitment to mobilizing private capital for Ukraine's reconstruction. "We can play this match and win it only if we manage to mobilize private capital, the entrepreneurial spirit of enterprises, and their ability to attract investments," she told the participants. The conference yielded significant financial commitments, with participants agreeing to "more than 10 billion euros ($12 billion) commitment" for reconstruction efforts, according to Meloni. Because you may like it or not, but what happens in Ukraine is about all of us." Drawing comparisons to Italy's "economic miracle" after the devastation caused by World War II, Meloni voiced hope that the Rome conference would usher in a new "miracle" in Ukraine. Zelensky told the conference that he and Pope Leo discussed efforts to bring home Ukrainian children abducted by Russia. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha earlier announced that on July 10, Zelensky is scheduled to hold further talks in Rome with U.S. officials to discuss sanctions policy and the imminent adoption of a new U.S. sanctions package against Russia. Therefore, one of my ideas is that it can be Ukraine's defense minister," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets mistakenly presented a June 30 report by a little-known group as an internal U.N. analysis on the 2022 Olenivka prison explosion, which killed over 50 Ukrainian POWs, Slidstvo.Info reported on July 10, citing a response from Lubinets's office.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Just weeks into Donald Trump's second presidency, the Department of Homeland Security began sending immigrants living in the United States to prisons in Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Panama and to the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. At the time, newspapers reported that the Trump administration was pursuing similar agreements with Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Kosovo, Libya, Moldova, Rwanda, and Ukraine. The list has more recently grown to dozens of countries, including South Sudan. Although this strategy shocked many Americans, the offshoring of detention is not new. In fact, it has a recent precedent in American history: it was used during the so-called war on terror, when Washington detained suspected terrorists in one country and took them to another, a process formally known as “extraordinary rendition.” This was often done for the express purpose of torturing suspects or enabling other governments to do so. For decades, the United States and other countries have systematically and forcibly moved asylum seekers to “third countries,” or territories that have lower legal standards and that are neither their places of origin nor their intended destinations. His administration has sent hundreds of immigrants who were living in the United States, some of them for years, to third countries where there is no practical way to judge their asylum claims. Moreover, immigrants have been removed from the United States before they have had a chance to defend themselves before an immigration judge, as is standard practice in the United States. “The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,” a U.S. appellate court wrote in April, in a decision demanding that the Trump administration return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was wrongly sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, to the United States. Although this offshoring practice sends a strong signal that the government is taking a hard line on immigration, it is bad policy: it is far more expensive than detaining and processing asylum seekers on the mainland, offers too many concessions to host countries that often have poor human rights records, and is used to skirt the human rights obligations to which the United States has agreed. It also portends a broader threat to the rule of law domestically; normalizing offshore detention can normalize the mistreatment of U.S. citizens. “Homegrown criminals next,” Trump told Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's president, during a televised meeting in the Oval Office in April. Following World War II, most of the world's countries signed international accords designed to prevent “refoulement,” or sending refugees back to places where they might be persecuted. But most governments still sought to block the entry of refugees; to do so without blatantly violating new international laws, they prevented people from setting foot on their territory and being able to ask for asylum. In the early 1990s, the U.S. Coast Guard began intercepting asylum seekers at sea and taking them to the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo, where they were granted fewer rights than they would enjoy on the U.S. mainland, including access to information about their right to ask for asylum, their right to be represented by a lawyer, and their ability to file an appeal. With capacity at Guantánamo full, the Clinton administration sent 8,000 of the asylum seekers to Howard Air Force Base, in what was then the Panama Canal Zone, and to ships anchored in Kingston Harbor, Jamaica. Most who were found to meet the criteria of being persecuted at home were ultimately settled in the United States, but some were quietly resettled as refugees in other countries, including Australia, Nicaragua, Panama, Spain, and Venezuela, as a result of diplomatic favors from these governments. In 2001, the country's special forces boarded a container ship carrying 433 asylum seekers, most of them from the persecuted Hazara minority group in Afghanistan. Hundreds who had been verified as refugees nonetheless remained detained there for years, because the Australian government wanted to deter more asylum seekers from using that route. The islands' isolation allowed abuses by detention staff to go unchecked. A cache of documents from the facility in Nauru obtained and published by The Guardian in 2016 included extensive reports of assaults on children, including sexual assault. Doctors Without Borders treated 208 patients there; it reported that 60 percent of them experienced suicidal thoughts and that 30 percent attempted suicide. The organization said that the level of mental suffering it found on Nauru was among the most severe it had “ever seen among its patients anywhere.” At least seven asylum seekers detained on Nauru died by suicide. The United Kingdom announced a similar deal with Rwanda, also in 2022. But the country may yet become an offshoring destination: in May 2025, Rwanda's foreign minister, Olivier Nduhungirehe, claimed that Kigali was negotiating with the Trump administration to receive migrants expelled by the United States. The clearest implementation of Europe's aspirations to push its border control into other countries was a deal signed by the EU and Turkey in March 2016. The EU paid Turkey six billion euros and promised to grant Turkish nationals visa-free travel in exchange for the Turkish government attempting to stop asylum seekers—mostly Syrian refugees fleeing that country's civil war—from crossing into Greece and agreeing to accept people who had been intercepted during attempts to cross. But Europe may also be on the cusp of more direct offshoring arrangements. Last year, Italy signed a five-year deal with Albania that would allow the transfer of up to 36,000 intercepted asylum seekers per year to detention facilities in Albania. Italian officials would manage the camps and process the migrants' asylum cases in Albania, which is not an EU member state. But this past April, under a new version of the plan, Italy sent 40 migrants to the facilities for forced repatriation after their asylum applications were rejected in Italy. This marked the first known instance of an EU member state sending rejected asylum applicants to a third country outside the EU. Despite the recent proliferation of third-country candidates, rich countries have generally had difficulty finding hosts for their offshoring schemes. There can also be reputational costs to offshore detention. For some, the schemes represent a way to rehabilitate their images. Negative global reactions to the Rwandan deals suggest they have not been a reputational blessing. Italy was expected to spend around $1 billion over five years through its deal with Albania. British taxpayers will also be paying an estimated $1 billion for their government's deal with Rwanda, despite its cancellation. A 2016 study estimated that the Australian government would have saved about $300,000 annually per asylum seeker if it had transferred them to Australia for community detention while their claims were adjudicated. For host countries, these payments can be a windfall. Speaking at a press conference in February, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the Salvadoran government's “very generous offer” to detain immigrants deported from the United States. Alternatives to detention are far cheaper: the agency's Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, for instance, which monitors asylum seekers via telephone reporting, a smartphone application, or an ankle or wrist bracelet, costs only $4.20 per immigrant per day. Countries seeking offshore processing and detention often offer concessions beyond direct payments for services. Like several other countries that serve as migration buffers, Albania is a candidate for EU membership; the Italian government has expressed support for its accession. Willingness to allow the detention of migrants on their soil gives countries such as Albania leverage in these negotiations. Several third countries approached by the Trump administration to detain migrants have reportedly sought to avoid being placed on the list of countries whose nationals are banned from traveling to the United States. The real rationale for countries wishing to offshore the processing and detention of asylum seekers and even long-term immigrants is to create a spectacle of control while hiding individual immigrants in legal black holes. Bukele, for instance, released a slick video on social media, with English-language commentary, that celebrated the arrival of deportation flights from the United States. It opens with drone footage of the aircraft but then cuts to a montage of machine guns and guards in balaclavas frogmarching detainees under flashing red and blue lights before roughly shaving their heads and stuffing them into cells. The following day, the White House released its own video in which a handcuffed man is frisked on an airport tarmac to the tune of Semisonic's hit song from 1998, “Closing Time”: “Closing time / you don't have to go home / but you can't stay here.” Such productions are a way for the Trump administration to show domestic supporters that it is making good on its promise to carry out mass deportations—even if the number of deportations this year is on pace to be lower than it was during the final year of the Biden administration. Other aims are to scare asylum seekers and unauthorized migrants already in the United States into self-deporting and to deter potential future immigrants with images of harsh treatment. The Immigration and Nationality Act specifies that when immigrants are deported, they should be sent to their country of citizenship or former residence. Only if those options are “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible” can they be deported to a third country. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor laid out in her dissent in the June 23 Supreme Court case, the Trump administration's policy is to “ignore the clear statutory command that notice and a hearing must be provided.” The White House's website features only partial lists of deported violent criminals, who represent a minuscule fraction of migrants in the United States. This is because, at its core, offshore processing and detention are attempts to hide people from public scrutiny, strip immigrants of their right to seek asylum, and normalize indefinite detention and even torture. The major question is whether national and international legal systems will consistently compel governments to follow their own domestic laws as well as international treaty obligations. Rich countries around the world are watching one another for policy models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. JIM TOWNSEND is an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security. From 2009 to 2017, he served as U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy. KATE JOHNSTON is an Associate Fellow at the Center for a New American Security. Amid fears that U.S. President Donald Trump would blow up a normal agenda, NATO leaders significantly pared back the program, taking hard discussions on issues such as support for Ukraine, NATO's relations with Russia, and Russian hybrid attacks in Europe off the table. But the summit did close with a historic agreement by most allies, Spain being a notable exception, to increase members' defense spending to five percent of GDP over the next ten years, with 3.5 percent earmarked for core military spending and 1.5 percent for hardening civilian infrastructure and overall resilience. Trump even appeared to leave The Hague with a newfound appreciation for NATO members, telling reporters: “These people really love their countries. It's not a rip-off, and we're here to help them.” Any sense of relief among the allies, however, may be short-lived. The Trump administration is undertaking a sweeping force posture review slated for release in late summer or early fall that could fundamentally reshape the U.S. military's global footprint. If that process results in a significant and swift reduction of U.S. forces in Europe, an outcome that administration officials have publicly suggested is possible, the alliance will become more vulnerable to further Russian aggression. Europe is stepping up in a big way, and defense budgets are rising, but it will take time to ramp up production and deliver the capabilities that the United States currently provides on the continent. But Washington must carefully plan any such shift, leaving U.S. forces in place long enough that Europeans can work to fill the coming gaps and retain their credible deterrent against Russia. It is critical that any drawdown be closely coordinated with NATO military authorities and that allies agree in advance to cover lost capabilities. Otherwise, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be tempted to take advantage of a weakened alliance. The political signals surrounding the U.S. Defense Department's force posture review have only increased European allies' fears that a rapid drawdown is coming. Trump has been reluctant to define Russia as a threat, instead calling Putin a “good guy” and making clear his aim to normalize U.S. relations with Moscow. Senior U.S. officials have also downplayed Putin's risk to Europe. Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, who also oversees diplomacy with Moscow, said in an interview with the conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson in March that it was “preposterous” to think that Russia would “march across Europe”—a straw-man argument meant to suggest that European assessments of the Russian threat are overblown. NATO allies had planned to present a Russia strategy for approval at the June summit but suspended it in fear that they could not get Trump on board. Even if Moscow does not march across Europe, Russia will pose a threat to NATO. The Russian military, although not without its flaws, is no longer the disorganized force it was just over three years ago, when it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since February 2022, Putin has transformed Russia's economy and military to support prolonged confrontation. Moscow's defense industrial base is running at full capacity. As Rutte said at Chatham House in June, “The facts are clearly there that Russia is able, within five years, to mount a credible attack against NATO territory.” Multiple European intelligence agencies have arrived at similar conclusions. Washington can ill afford to rapidly reduce its presence in Europe just as Russia is gearing up for further aggression. After the Cold War, when most European militaries substantially cut their defense budgets, this dependence only deepened. The United States also lowered its defense expenditures and reduced its forces in Europe, from about 300,000 during the Cold War to about 100,000 troops today (including 20,000 additional forces Washington deployed in 2022 in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine). The U.S. military also stores equipment, its Army Prepositioned Stocks, in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland to outfit army reinforcements that arrive by air. The U.S. Navy has six Aegis-class destroyers deployed at a U.S. base in Rota, Spain, to support NATO's missile defense and take on other maritime tasks in European waters, such as maritime patrols in the Baltic Sea. Their withdrawal would leave the alliance especially vulnerable to Russian hybrid attacks, such as undersea cable sabotage, jamming, or cyberattacks. Fewer such resources would also limit early warnings about incoming attacks and hinder NATO's ability to select, prioritize, and engage Russian targets in the event of conflict. Europe also remains highly reliant on U.S. air-to-air refueling tankers, heavy lift aircraft, and other such “strategic enablers” to move forces across the continent and supply it with battlefield intelligence. Despite European allies' progress on procuring the military equipment needed to meet their newly mandated responsibilities in NATO planning, they have made less headway in developing these particular capabilities at scale. Other essential capabilities—long-range precision missile systems such as HIMARS, stockpiles of precision-guided munitions, and advanced drones—could also be diminished by a premature U.S. withdrawal. One of NATO's key deterrents against Russia is its credible ability to target high-value assets within the country. And these capability gaps do not exist in isolation. Moscow has long sought to undermine NATO, seeing its demise as a critical step toward reasserting Russia's position as a global power. Most immediately, the Kremlin would seize on any U.S. retreat to amplify Europeans' anxiety that Washington is abandoning them. Putin would assume that with a smaller U.S. presence in Europe, the West would be forced to favor de-escalation, creating an environment the Kremlin would view as exceptionally permissive and paving the way for increasingly brazen acts. Moreover, Russia has long viewed Europeans as supplicants of Washington, unable to function effectively without U.S. direction. If the United States goes forward with a rapid reduction in forces, Moscow might judge that European unity would collapse, fueling Putin's propensity to overestimate Russia's ability to achieve its goals. Most immediately, Putin would look to further scale up gray-zone activities in Europe, such as cable cutting and other forms of sabotage. With fewer U.S. intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets in place, such acts would be harder for European countries to detect or attribute, allowing Moscow to operate with greater impunity. Beyond hybrid attacks, Russia could be tempted to take limited military action. Russia is not going away, and Europe's buildup will take time. If the United States does plan to reduce its troop deployment in Europe, simply notifying the alliance that such a change is underway will be woefully insufficient to ensure NATO's continued ability to protect its members. NATO military authorities must be given time to review and update their battle plans, and individual countries with the means to do so must commit to replicating specific capabilities that that will be lost as the United States pivots. Pulling back as Russia is ramping up its military capacity and before Europe is ready to defend itself would embolden the Kremlin and raise the risk of another war—this time on Trump's watch. The United States must tell its partners exactly where any new gaps will be—long before they appear.
