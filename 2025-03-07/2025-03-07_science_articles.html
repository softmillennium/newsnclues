Scientists Date Remains of an Ancient Child That Resembles Both Humans and Neanderthals

NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have dated the skeleton of an ancient child that caused a stir when it was first discovered because it carries features from both humans and Neanderthals.

The child's remains were discovered 27 years ago in a rock shelter called Lagar Velho in central Portugal. The nearly complete skeleton was stained red, and scientists think it may have been wrapped in a painted animal skin before burial.

When the humanlike child was discovered, scientists noted that some of their attributes — including body proportions and jawbone — looked Neanderthal. The researchers suggested that the child was descended from populations in which humans and Neanderthals mated and mixed. That was a radical notion at the time, but advances in genetics have since proven those populations existed — and people today still carry Neanderthal DNA. 

But trying to figure out when exactly the child lived has been difficult. Small roots had grown through the bones and contamination — from plants or other sources — made it impossible for scientists to use traditional carbon dating to measure the child's age. They instead dated the charcoal and animal bones around the skeleton to between 27,700 and 29,700 years ago.

Techniques have improved, and researchers reported Friday in the journal Science Advances that they were able to date the skeleton by measuring part of a protein that's found primarily in human bones. 

Examining part of a crushed arm, they revealed that the earlier estimate was in the ballpark: the skeleton was from between 27,700 and 28,600 years ago.

“Being able to successfully date the child felt like giving them back a tiny piece of their story, which is a huge privilege,” said Bethan Linscott, a study author now at the University of Miami, in an email.

She noted the initial discovery was more than a skeleton — it was also the grave of a young child. When dating the bones, she couldn’t help but wonder who loved the child, what made them laugh and what their world looked like in the short four years they walked the planet.

Paul Pettitt, an archaeologist at Durham University in England who was not involved with the new research said in an email that the study is an example of how dating methods are becoming more effective and helping scientists better understand the past.

The study of where humans came from is important “for the same reason we keep the portraits of our parents and grandparents,” said study author João Zilhão from the University of Lisbon.

“It's a way of remembering,” he said.

	Experts argue that current tests are distracting and new ones are needed

Measuring progress in health care AI performance relies heavily on question-answer tests, researchers argue, and not enough on evaluating real-world medical tasks.

Artificial intelligence algorithms are being built into almost all aspects of health care. They’re integrated into breast cancer screenings, clinical note-taking, health insurance management and even phone and computer apps to create virtual nurses and transcribe doctor-patient conversations. Companies say that these tools will make medicine more efficient and reduce the burden on doctors and other health care workers. But some experts question whether the tools work as well as companies claim they do.

AI tools such as large language models, or LLMs, which are trained on vast troves of text data to generate humanlike text, are only as good as their training and testing. But the publicly available assessments of LLM capabilities in the medical domain are based on evaluations that use medical student exams, such as the MCAT. In fact, a review of studies evaluating health care AI models, specifically LLMs, found that only 5 percent used real patient data. Moreover, most studies evaluated LLMs by asking questions about medical knowledge. Very few assessed LLMs’ abilities to write prescriptions, summarize conversations or have conversations with patients — tasks LLMs would do in the real world.

The current benchmarks are distracting, computer scientist Deborah Raji and colleagues argue in the February New England Journal of Medicine AI. The tests can’t measure actual clinical ability; they don’t adequately account for the complexities of real-world cases that require nuanced decision-making. They also aren’t flexible in what they measure and can’t evaluate different types of clinical tasks. And because the tests are based on physicians’ knowledge, they don’t properly represent information from nurses or other medical staff.

“A lot of expectations and optimism people have for these systems were anchored to these medical exam test benchmarks,” says Raji, who studies AI auditing and evaluation at the University of California, Berkeley. “That optimism is now translating into deployments, with people trying to integrate these systems into the real world and throw them out there on real patients.” She and her colleagues argue that we need to develop evaluations of how LLMs perform when responding to complex and diverse clinical tasks.

Science News spoke with Raji about the current state of health care AI testing, concerns with it and solutions to create better evaluations. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

SN: Why do current benchmark tests fall short?

Raji: These benchmarks are not indicative of the types of applications people are aspiring to, so the whole field should not obsess about them in the way they do and to the degree they do.

This is not a new problem or specific to health care. This is something that exists throughout machine learning, where we put together these benchmarks and we want it to represent general intelligence or general competence at this particular domain that we care about. But we just have to be really careful about the claims we make around these datasets.

The further the representation of these systems is from the situations in which they are actually deployed, the more difficult it is for us to understand the failure modes these systems hold. These systems are far from perfect. Sometimes they fail on particular populations, and sometimes, because they misrepresent the tasks, they don’t capture the complexity of the task in a way that reveals certain failures in deployment. This sort of benchmark bias issue, where we make the choice to deploy these systems based on information that doesn’t represent the deployment situation, leads to a lot of hubris.

SN: How do you create better evaluations for health care AI models?

Raji: One strategy is interviewing domain experts in terms of what the actual practical workflow is and collecting naturalistic datasets of pilot interactions with the model to see the types or range of different queries that people put in and the different outputs. There’s also this idea that [coauthor] Roxana Daneshjou has been doing in some of her work with “red teaming,” with actively gathering a group of people to adversarialy prompt the model. Those are all different approaches to getting at a more realistic set of prompts closer to how people actually interact with the systems.

Another thing we are trying is getting information from actual hospitals as usage data — like how they are actually deploying it and workflows from them about how they are actually integrating the system — and anonymized patient information or anonymized inputs to these models that could then inform future benchmarking and evaluation practices.

Sponsor Message

There are approaches that exist from other disciplines [like psychology] about how to ground your evaluations in observations of reality to be able to assess something. The same applies here — how much of our current evaluation ecosystem is grounded in the reality of what people are observing and what people are either appreciating or struggling with in terms of the actual deployment of these systems.

SN: How specialized should model benchmark testing be?

Raji: The benchmark that is geared towards question answering and knowledge recall is very different from a benchmark to validate the model on summarizing doctors’ notes or doing questioning and answering on uploaded data. That kind of nuance in terms of the task design is something that I’m trying to get to. Not that every single person should have their own personalized benchmark, but that common task that we do share needs to be way more grounded than multiple-choice tests. Because even for real doctors, those multiple-choice questions are not indicative of their actual performance.

SN: What policies or frameworks need to be in place to create such evaluations?

Raji: This is mostly a call for researchers to invest in thinking through and constructing not just benchmarks but also evaluations, at large, that are more grounded in the reality of what our expectations are for these systems once they get deployed. Right now, evaluation is very much an afterthought. We just think that there’s a lot more attention that could be paid towards the methodology of evaluation, the methodology of benchmark design and the methodology of just assessment in this space. 

Second, we can ask for more transparency at the institutional level such as through AI inventories in hospitals, wherein hospitals should share the full list of different AI products that they make use of as part of their clinical practice. That’s the kind of practice at the institutional level, at the hospital level, that would really help us understand what people are currently using AI systems for. If [hospitals and other institutions] published information about the workflows that they sort of integrate these AI systems into, that can also help us think of better evaluations. That kind of thing at the hospital level will be super helpful.

At the vendor level too, sharing information about what their current evaluation practice is — what their current benchmarks rely on — helps us figure out the gap between what they are currently doing and something that could be more realistic or more grounded.

SN: What is your advice for people working with these models?

Raji: We should, as a field, be more thoughtful about the evaluations that we focus on or that we [overly base our performance on.]

It’s really easy to pick the lowest hanging fruit — medical exams are just the most available medical tests out there. And even if they are completely unrepresentative of what people are hoping to do with these models at deployment, it’s like an easy dataset to compile and put together and upload and download and run.

But I would challenge the field to be a lot more thoughtful and to pay more attention to really constructing valid representations of what we hope the models do and our expectations for these models once they are deployed.

Brain scans, postmortem dissections, artificial intelligence and lab mice reveal differences in the brain that are linked to sex. Do we know what they mean?

You're holding two wrinkly human brains, each dripping in formaldehyde. Look at one and then the other. Can you tell which brain is female and which is male?

You can't.

Humanity has been hunting for sex-based differences in the brain since at least the time of the ancient Greeks, and it has largely been an exercise in futility. That's partly because human brains do not come in two distinct forms, said Dr. Armin Raznahan, chief of the National Institute of Mental Health's Section on Developmental Neurogenomics.

"I'm not aware of any measure you can make of the human brain where the male and female distributions don't overlap," Raznahan told Live Science.

But the question of how male and female brains differ may still matter, because brain diseases and psychiatric disorders manifest differently between the sexes. Disentangling how much of that difference is rooted in biology versus the environment could lead to better treatments, experts argue.



There are many different disorders of the brain — psychiatric and neurologic diseases — that occur with different prevalence and are expressed in different ways between sexes, said Dr. Yvonne Lui, a clinician-scientist and vice chair of research in NYU Langone's Department of Radiology. "Trying to understand baseline differences can help us better understand how diseases manifest."

Now, thanks in part to artificial intelligence (AI), scientists are starting to reliably distinguish male and female brains using subtle differences in their cellular structures and in neural circuits that play a role in a wide range of cognitive tasks, from visual perception to movement to emotional regulation. Other studies point to sex-based differences in human brain structure that may be present from birth, and still other, lab-based research in animals points to sex-based differences in how brain cells fire at a molecular level.

What's still completely unclear is to what extent these differences matter. Do they change how people's brains function or how susceptible they are to disease? Should they dictate which treatments doctors offer to each patient? Even as scientists pinpoint subtle brain differences between females and males, their research inevitably runs up against tricky questions of how sex, gender and culture interplay to sculpt human cognition.

Right now, it's impossible to answer these big questions. But ongoing and future research — focused on lab animals, human chromosomes and brain development, and subjects followed from youth through adulthood — could start to reveal how these sex-based differences concretely affect cognition, and ultimately, the development of diseases of the brain.

Historically, scientists used purported brain differences to make sweeping statements about how men and women think and behave and to justify sexist beliefs that women were innately less intelligent and less capable than men.

While that early research has been discredited, modern studies still find cognitive differences between men and women — at least on average. For example, men reportedly perform better on tests of spatial ability, while women are better at interpreting the facial expressions of others. But men and women are raised and treated very differently in society, so what's at the root of these differences? Is it nature or nurture, or both?

"It's actually incredibly difficult in humans to … causally distinguish how much of a sex difference is societally or environmentally driven," Raznahan said. "We have all of these assumptions and biases that sort of slip into our heads through the back door without us realizing."

Given the dubious history of studying sex differences in the brain, and the logistical difficulty of doing it the right way, one might wonder why scientists bother. For many, it's because neurological diseases and psychiatric conditions seem to play out differently in males and females, and both biological and environmental factors could explain why that is.

Data suggest women experience higher rates of depression and migraine than men do, while men have higher rates of schizophrenia and autism. About twice the number of men develop Parkinson's disease than women do, but women with the condition tend to have faster-progressing disease. All these data come from studies that don't necessarily distinguish sex from gender — "sex" describes biology, while "gender" reflects self-identity, as well as societal roles and pressures. Lumping the two concepts together muddies our understanding of why a given difference exists.

For instance, pubescent girls are more likely to experience depression than boys are, which may be related to how their maturing brains handle stress or the possibility that they encounter more stressful events than boys do at that age. Conversely, do boys' brains make them resilient against depression, or are they actually going underdiagnosed due to social stigma? The answers to these questions point to different solutions.



Thanks to brain-scanning techniques like MRI, scientists have found subtle sex differences in the size, shape and thickness of various brain structures, as well as differences in networks that link different parts of the brain.

But these differences are small to negligible when you account for the average size difference between males and females, argues Lise Eliot, a professor of neuroscience at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science and author of "Pink Brain, Blue Brain" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009).

Eliot and colleagues recently looked at about 30 years of studies, finding that, on average, male brains are 6% larger than female brains at birth and grow to be 11% larger by adulthood. This makes sense because average brain size scales along with average body size, and male bodies tend to be larger. But when you take this overall size difference into account, subtler structural differences between male and female brains shrink to the point of negligibility, the researchers concluded.

"There are maybe species-wide sex differences in the brain, but so far, they haven't been proven," Eliot told Live Science. "And so if they exist, they must be pretty small."

Nonetheless, some scientists have reported differences that they say don't scale with body size. Some examples came from a research group who'd crunched MRI data from over 40,000 adult brains scanned for the UK Biobank, a repository of medical data from 500,000 adults in the United Kingdom.



In that study, males had a larger thalamus, a relay station for sensory information. They also had a larger putamen, which helps control movement and forms part of a feedback loop that tells you whether a movement was well executed. Females, on average, had a larger left-side nucleus accumbens, part of the brain's reward center, and a bigger hippocampus, the storage site for short-term memories of facts and events that also helps transfer the information to long-term memory.

But neither this nor other studies have revealed a specific feature that reliably distinguishes a given male brain from a female brain, since the size ranges seen in each sex largely overlap, Raznahan and colleagues noted in a letter responding to that study.

For the few size differences that do exist, it's currently impossible to say whether they explain any differences in cognition linked to sex, or alternatively, whether they actually make males' and females' cognition more similar, the letter authors noted. Perhaps male and female brains operate slightly differently to reach the same output — to "counterbalance" differences in hormones or genetics that may affect brain function, they wrote.

"When we're just talking about describing a difference in a measurement, that's not saying anything about whether it's got any functional relevance at all," Raznahan emphasized.

While large-scale structural features might not distinguish male and female brains, AI is helping to uncover other, subtler features that may differentiate the two. Some of these differences appear on the level of the brain's microstructure, meaning its individual cells and components of those cells.

For instance, a study published in May 2024 used different AI models to analyze brain scans from 1,030 young adults ages 22 to 37 years old. The research primarily focused on white matter, the bundles of insulated wiring that run between neurons. "I believe ours is the first study to detect brain microstructural differences between sexes," said Lui, who co-authored the study.

The AI models analyzed differences in both local landmarks in the brain — such as the corpus callosum, which connects the brain's two halves — and the highways that connect distant cells. It also looked at differences in how the white matter was bundled together, as well as in how dense and well insulated those bundles were.

The algorithms accurately predicted the sex of the subject tied to a given scan 92% to 98% of the time. That remaining gap in accuracy likely comes down to the "huge amount of variance in humans," Lui said.

No single part of the brain could be used to make predictions; one model relied on 15 distinct regions of white matter. All models showed some consistencies, though, with the largest white matter structure that crosses the midline, the corpus callosum, standing out as key.



Lui and colleagues' study was not designed to address how an individual's upbringing or environment shapes the brain. Nor did it aim to disentangle biological differences in the brain from those rooted in gender.

Sex describes biological differences in anatomy, physiology, hormones and chromosomes. Sex traits are categorized as male or female, although some people's traits don't fit neatly in either category. Gender, on the other hand, is cultural. It encompasses how people identify and express themselves, as well as how they are treated and expected to behave by others. Genders include man and woman, as well as others, including those that fall under the umbrella term nonbinary or are unique to specific cultures, like the māhū of Hawai'i.

Historically, studies have conflated sex and gender. To tease these factors apart and see how each manifests in the brain, it would be helpful to follow people over time as their brains are developing — and new research is beginning to do just that.

For example, a 2024 study looked at average brain volume in over 500 newborns: Males' brains were 6% larger overall, even after accounting for differences in birth weight, and females had larger gray-to-white matter ratios. (Gray matter, the cell bodies of neurons, is primarily found in the outer layer of the brain, called the cortex.) That average difference in gray matter is also seen in adults, which makes sense given that larger brains need more white matter to relay signals between far-apart cells.

Statistically, these big-picture brain differences were more significant than differences seen in smaller structures. Females had larger corpus callosa, as well as more gray matter around the hippocampus and in a key emotion-processing hub called the left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG). Males had more gray matter in parts of the temporal lobe involved in sensory processing, as well as in the subthalamic nucleus, key for movement control. But sex could only explain a fraction of the variance seen in these structures.



Some of these brain differences are "present from the earliest stage of postnatal life" and persist into adulthood, the authors noted. This applies mostly to the global differences, but also potentially to some of the smaller ones. For example, some studies — but not all — show that the left ACG is also larger in adult females, not only in babies.

Durable differences present from birth are likely sex-based. But differences that emerge or disappear in later life, like those in the hippocampus, may be influenced by the environment, or else reflect sex differences in development, including hormonal shifts in puberty.

Studies like this can help tease apart the influence of sex and gender on the brain. At present, there's a "massive gap" in our understanding of how these factors shape the brain independently and in tandem, said Elvisha Dhamala, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in New York.

Dhamala and colleagues recently aimed to fill in that gap using data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, an enormous U.S.-based study of brain development and child health. They incorporated functional MRI (fMRI) scans from nearly 4,800 children; fMRI tracks blood flow in the brain to give an indirect measure of brain activity. Each child joined the study at age 9 or 10 and will be followed for 10 years, which will enable follow-up studies.

The fMRI scans highlighted linked brain areas, or networks that lit up as the children did different tasks, including memory tests that required them to recall several images. The children and their parents also answered questions about the kids' feelings about their genders and how they typically play and express themselves. "It's not anything clinical," Dhamala noted. "It's just an aspect of behavior that represents your gender."

These answers were used to generate "scores" for each child that the AI algorithm could use as data points.



The algorithm ultimately revealed two largely distinct brain networks tied to sex and gender. The brain differences most strongly tied to sex were found in networks responsible for processing visual stimuli and physical sensations, controlling movement, making decisions and regulating emotions. Differences tied to gender were more widely dispersed, involving connections within and between many areas in the cortex.

After pinpointing these networks, the researchers trained their AI algorithms to "predict" a child's sex or gender based on brain activity. They accurately determined most children's sexes, similar to the results of Lui's study. Gender proved trickier: With the children's questionnaire answers, the AI couldn't predict where they landed on a continuum of gender, whereas with the parents' answers, its predictive power exceeded chance but was still "much lower" than the predictions for sex, Dhamala said.

Nonetheless, the study highlighted an understudied idea: that gender sculpts the brain in ways that are distinct from sex, she said.

Interestingly, some tentative lines can be drawn between Lui's and Dhamala's AI-powered studies. They can't be directly compared, as the two studies used different types of analyses and focused on different features of the brain. But many of the physical white matter tracts flagged in the former study correspond with functional networks highlighted in the latter, Dhamala told Live Science.

As an example, the cingulum — a white-matter tract that encircles the corpus callosum — seemed key for making predictions in Lui's study. It also links together various networks flagged in Dhamala's study, including circuits involved in emotional processing. That hints that sex differences exist in both the physical anatomy of these networks and in their activation patterns, Dhamala said.

Scientists have made some progress at teasing out sex differences in the brain, but to truly understand these distinctions, researchers will need to do more animal studies to allow for more experimental control, according to a 2020 paper co-authored by Raznahan.

Various studies in lab rats have already revealed differences in how males and females form connections between neurons, and how each sex processes fearful memories, for example.

In humans, scientists can collect more brain data right at the time of birth, to pinpoint baseline differences that might exist before a child encounters any cultural influences, and then track the child over time, Raznahan and colleagues added.

Another option is to study human genes that are unique to either the X or Y chromosome. By looking at people with extra or missing sex chromosomes, for example, scientists have started to unravel how these genes either inflate or shrink brain structures, contributing to sex differences in size. Chromosomes may also raise or lower the risk of disorders — for instance, carrying an extra Y raises the likelihood that a person has autism, whereas an extra X does not. That may help to explain why males, who usually carry one X and one Y, have higher autism rates than females, who typically have two Xs.

Right now, the fate of such research is uncertain in the U.S.

Prompted by executive orders from the new presidential administration, the National Science Foundation has been combing through active research projects to see if they include words that might violate said orders, such as "woman," "female" and "gender," and the National Institutes of Health appeared to archive a long-standing policy requiring both male and female lab animals in studies.

—Men have a daily hormone cycle — and it's synced to their brains shrinking from morning to night

—Pregnancy shrinks parts of the brain, leaving 'permanent etchings' postpartum

—Babies' brain activity changes dramatically before and after birth, groundbreaking study finds

"There's just a lot of uncertainty," Dhamala told Live Science. If the worst case scenario comes to pass, "removing that gender component, or making it harder to study sex differences, is going to push us backward rather than forward."

But if the field survives, future work could incorporate gender the way the ABCD study did, using questionnaires to generate composite scores, Dhamala said. As a start, scientists could at least ask study participants what gender they identify as, she added. Other experts agree.

By adopting these strategies, scientists could dramatically advance this research field that dates back to Aristotle. Their efforts could lend new talking points to the endless debate of nature versus nature. They could uncover meaningful sex differences that pave the way to better treatments for depression, Alzheimer's and more. Or they could highlight the ways members of the "opposite sex" are actually more alike than they are different.

Neuroscience research has only recently begun to prioritize the inclusion of both male and female lab animals in studies. Could we see that shift reverse?

Actions taken by the Trump administration have spurred changes at America's major science agencies — and if worst comes to worst, these shifts may jeopardize our understanding of how the brain works and how to treat neurological conditions, experts told Live Science.

For years, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has upheld a policy that requires scientists who work with vertebrate animals to consider "sex as a biological variable." To earn grants, researchers must explain how their study designs account for sex, such that any differences between the sexes will be made apparent. Researchers must provide strong scientific justification to include only one sex in a study.

But recently, The Transmitter reported that the NIH seems to have archived this policy. The NIH has yet to issue an official statement on the matter, but the move followed executive orders issued by the Trump administration that called for overturning "gender ideology" and "radical" diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

In apparently archiving its "sex as a biological variable" policy, the NIH could be signaling a shift away from requiring both males and females in research. And such a shift could be particularly dire for basic neuroscience research.

Emerging animal research is revealing fundamental differences between male and female brains. These differences manifest in how sex hormones influence brains at the basic level of memory formation and neuronal firing, for example, and evidence suggests these differences may be relevant not just to lab animals, but also to humans. Failing to include both sexes in lab research could lead us to miss fundamental forces that shape the human brain and how drugs affect it.

"If the fundamental mechanisms by which molecules sculpt neurophysiology differ between the sexes, then we need to know that as early as possible in the process," said Catherine Woolley, a professor of neurobiology at the Northwestern University Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.

Are male and female brains wired differently? The question has beguiled humanity for centuries, but scientists have only recently begun to find answers.

That's partly because, to uncover differences between males and females, you must study both sexes, including in research with lab animals. But scientists haven't done that until relatively recently.

Animal studies enable experiments that would be impossible with humans. Researchers can't slice living people's heads open, pluck out their neurons or implant electrodes with wild abandon.

Human subjects also come with baggage — namely, men and women are raised differently and have different life experiences. These cultural factors shape the brain alongside biological factors, like hormones and chromosomes, making it difficult to separate nature from nurture.

Historically, however, scientists simply ignored the variable of sex by excluding females altogether. This bias was particularly pronounced in neuroscience — one 2009 review found that studies with exclusively male lab animals outnumbered those with females 5.5-to-1.

There was a concern that the reproductive cycle of female lab animals would "mess up the data, make it too variable," said Lise Eliot, a professor of neuroscience at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in Chicago. That idea has been thoroughly debunked, but for a time, the prevailing viewpoint was, "let's just study males and keep it simple," Eliot told Live Science.

Only in recent years has that attitude begun to shift.

Including female lab animals has led to findings that unseated long-held assumptions about how the brain works.

For instance, Woolley uses lab rats to study how the sex hormone estrogen drives synaptic plasticity, the brain's ability to dynamically strengthen or weaken connections between neurons over time. This process enables the ability to learn and form memories, and it also underlies the brain changes behind psychiatric conditions like addiction.

Woolley has shown that plasticity works differently in males and females.

Connections between two neurons grow stronger via a process called long-term potentiation, which unfolds in two phases: an early phase, which lasts a few hours, and a late phase, which lasts longer. A key enzyme — protein kinase A (PKA) — was thought to participate in only the later, long-lasting phase.

It dawned on me that perhaps the results that we were getting differed from the published literature because we were using female animals.

"We've shown that that's true only in males," Woolley said. For females, PKA is crucial for the early phase of long-term potentiation, she and her colleagues revealed.

In another study, the team uncovered a sex-specific difference in the hippocampus, a brain region key for learning and memory. They showed that, exclusively in female rats, a specific type of estrogen makes neurons more likely to trigger a signal, thanks to a "previously unknown" mechanism. This particular estrogen is made in the brains of both males and females, and it doesn't follow the same cycle as estrogen made by the female reproductive system.

In that research, the team was "doing an experiment that has been done before … and our results were different," Woolley told Live Science. "It dawned on me that perhaps the results that we were getting differed from the published literature because we were using female animals." Previous work had included only males.

Many drugs act at the connection points between neurons, so it's important to understand how those connections are formed and maintained, Woolley said. Therefore, findings from these animal studies could help inform future treatments and diagnostics for people, she added.

There are some key differences between rodents and people, including that the human menstrual cycle is about seven times longer than the comparable cycle in rodents. But many studies have probed the similarities and differences in how estrogens act on the rodent brain and the nonhuman primate brain.

Based on these data, Woolley suspects many observations in the rat brain will translate to humans, even if they're not exactly the same.

Beyond Woolley's lab, scientists have also uncovered nuances in how male and female mice store fearful memories.

When the researchers blocked signals from part of the amygdala — a key emotion-processing center involved in fear conditioning — it stopped fear memories from being "saved" in male mice, but not in females.

Then, they studied people with a genetic mutation in that same signaling pathway. Males with the mutation had trouble remembering that a cue on a screen would come with a mild electric shock, but the same mutation had no effect on females' memories.

That hints that males and females store fearful memories differently, and that could have implications for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the authors speculated. For instance, using a drug to block those amygdala signals after a traumatic event could help prevent PTSD in males but likely not in females.

Another study revealed cell-level differences in the nucleus accumbens, the core of the brain's reward system. More excitatory, or "activating," signaling occurs in the nucleus accumbens of female mice and rats, compared with males.

And several methods of damping that excitement in males do not work in females, the team found. That finding could be relevant for better understanding depression and addiction, since signaling in the reward system underlies both conditions, the study authors suggested.

A better understanding of these sex differences could lead to improved psychiatric and neurological treatments tailored to each sex, scientists argue. But the future of this research is uncertain given the changes that seem to be unfolding at America's premier science institutions.

—Can rats 'imagine'? Rodents show signs of imagination while playing VR games

The fate of the NIH's "sex as a biological variable" policy is currently unknown. But if including both sexes in research is no longer prioritized, it could set back the whole field of biomedicine, Woolley emphasized.

"It is very important to understand that the Sex as a Biological Variable policy is not about sex differences research," Woolley told Live Science. "This policy is about all biomedical research and ensuring that the results of taxpayer-funded biomedical research are relevant to everyone: both men and women, both boys and girls."

	For each 1-degree-Celsius increase in sea temp, green sea turtles lay eggs over 6 days earlier

Green sea turtles are laying their eggs earlier in the season to cope with warming temperatures, a new study shows.

Green sea turtles are adjusting their nesting habits in response to rising global temperatures. Individual females are laying their eggs earlier in the season to cope with warmer conditions, researchers report in the February Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Scientists have long known that the sex of most turtle species is determined by incubation temperature — higher temperatures give life to females, and lower ones produce males. As climate change drives up temperatures, more females and fewer males are being born, potentially weakening populations. Extreme heat can also be lethal for the eggs.

To understand how turtles are adapting, conservation ecologist Annette Broderick and colleagues analyzed three decades of nesting data from around 600 tagged green turtles (Chelonia mydas) on the beaches of Northern Cyprus. The data included the number of successful hatchlings in each nest and temperatures during incubation. The team found that individual females nested earlier as temperatures rose, laying eggs just over six days earlier, on average, for each 1-degree-Celsius increase.

This is “the first time anyone looked at individual turtles and looked at how they’re changing,” rather than studying nesting behavior at a population level, says Broderick, of the University of Exeter in England.

While previous research has shown the nesting activity of whole turtle populations moving earlier, the new study confirms that individual turtles are actively adjusting their behavior in response to climate change. “This may seem like a foregone conclusion. It really isn’t,” says study coauthor Mollie Rickwood, a marine biologist at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. That’s because population-wide shifts in nesting behavior could be happening for multiple reasons.

“For example,” Broderick says, “each female may be consistent in the time she nests each year, but new recruits to the population may lay earlier than older nesters, therefore making the average earlier.” By looking at individual animals, the researchers showed that all females are adjusting their timing.

Along with temperatures, breeding experience and number of clutches laid in a year equally influenced the timing of nesting. Other studies suggest that the earlier egg-laying seen now in some turtle species seems to be enough to offset the effects of warming temperatures on the eggs.

“This gives them a much better outlook in the face of climate change,” Rickwood says.
