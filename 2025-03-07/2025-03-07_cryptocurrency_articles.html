President Donald Trump said Friday that he continues to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants peace and that he is “finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine.” His comments, to reporters in the Oval Office, came after Russia carried out a major missile attack against Ukraine while U.S. intelligence-sharing that normally helps Ukraine repel Russian forces was paused. Trump, who threatened to impose sanctions on Russia in response to the attack, said he had sent Russia a “very strong statement — can’t do that.” But he softened his tone during his Oval Office appearance. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to address a White House cryptocurrency summit, elevating an industry he promised to aid during his campaign.

The National Republican Congressional Committee deleted a social media post baselessly claiming that Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-New York) was an “illegal immigrant.”

Espaillat became a citizen after his family came to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic almost 60 years ago. They overstayed a tourist visa but then obtained green cards.

The NRCC’s post asserted that “Democrats literally chose an illegal immigrant to give their response to President Trump’s address,” referencing Espaillat’s Spanish-language response to Trump’s address to Congress earlier this week.

The post was up for roughly 24 hours and remained online after Democrats sharply criticized the House GOP campaign arm for the escalated rhetoric.

Several Hispanic Republicans in the House were also irked by the post, with Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-Florida) telling The Washington Post it is a term he would not have used, especially for a sitting member of Congress.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to create a White House task force to help prepare for the FIFA World Cup 2026, which is set to be played in the United States, Canada and Mexico. North America was awarded the right to host the tournament in 2018.

Asked by a reporter whether the latest political tensions over tariffs between his administration and the other two countries would affect the soccer tournament, Trump said, “I think it’s going to make it more exciting. Tension’s a good thing.”

Less than a month after placing the entire staff of the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights on administrative leave, the Environmental Protection Agency has reinstated dozens of employees in offices across the country.

Employees at regional EPA offices received an email Monday asking them to return to work, according to four employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, and they returned to work Wednesday.

The U.S. has temporarily suspended satellite imagery services to Ukraine, a fresh blow to Kyiv from the Trump administration, which has frozen weapons shipments and intelligence-sharing.

President Donald Trump on Friday celebrated “big gains for native-born Americans” in the latest jobs report, suggesting that the early gains were a product of U.S. businesses gearing up for his administration.

“For the first time in 15 months, the job gains for native-born Americans — for American people, people born in America — exceeded job gains for migrant and foreign-born workers,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “This is the first time this has happened in more than 15 months.”

Education Secretary Linda McMahon said Friday she’s on the same page as President Donald Trump on his desire to close the department she now leads.

Asked in an interview on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends” whether the United States “needs” the Education Department, McMahon directly said: “No, we don’t.”

McMahon’s comments come as Trump is set to issue an executive order directing her to begin the process of dismantling the agency with the goal to ultimately shut it down.

President Donald Trump is set to host the first White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

The event will put on display just how much Trump, once a skeptic of cryptocurrency, has aligned himself with the industry since winning the November election with the support of some of its biggest players. He tapped venture capitalist David Sacks to serve as his crypto czar and more recently announced a national crypto reserve.

President Donald Trump said he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran and sent a letter this week to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader, indicating his desire to do so.

Elon Musk and his allies in the U.S. DOGE Service have justified their efforts to dismantle federal agencies by invoking a frequent refrain: They’re merely targeting fraud, waste and abuse.

March 7 (UPI) -- Working with Germany and Finland, U.S. officials disrupted and took down the online infrastructure used to operate Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly facilitated money laundering by transnational criminal organizations.

Those organizations included terrorist groups, according to U.S. Justice Department officials, who made the announcement in a press release on Friday.
An indictment unsealed in the Eastern District of Virginia leveled charges against Aleksej Besciokov, 46, a Lithuanian national and Russian resident, and Aleksandr Mira Serda (also known as Aleksandr Ntifo-Siaw), 40, a Russian national and United Arab Emirates resident, according to Justice officials.
According to the indictment, Garantex has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since April 2019.

In the release, Justice officials said Mira Serda and Besciokov are charged with money laundering conspiracy, and Besciokov is charged with conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.

Garantex was run by Mira Serda and Besciokov from 2019 to 2015, according to Justice officials. Authorities said Besciokov was Garantex's main technical administrator and responsible for maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Officials say Mira Serda was Garantex's co-founder and chief commercial officer.
U.S. officials say the crypto exchange Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal funding and was used to "facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to U.S. victims."
Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that the exchange was facilitating crimes, Justice officials said, adding that Garantex took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities, such as money laundering, on its platform.
According to Friday's release from the Justice Department, in April 2022 the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Garantex for its role in facilitating money laundering of funds from ransomware actors and so-called darknet markets.
According to court documents cited in Friday's release, "despite the widespread publicity of the sanctions and Garantex administrator's personal knowledge of them, Besciokov and his co-conspirators violated those sanctions by continuing to transact with U.S.-based entities.
"Further, Besciokov and his co-conspirators redesigned Garantex's operations to evade and violate U.S. sanctions and induce U.S. businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions," Justice officials said.

As an example of attempts at evasion, Justice officials said Garantex allegedly moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis "in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts."
Additionally and despite doing a notable amount of business in the United States and operating as a money transmitting business, Garantex failed to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as required, Justice officials said.
The U.S. Justice Department said that, on March 6, U.S. law enforcement executed a seizure order authorized by a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia against three website domain names used to support Garantex's operations: Garantex.org, Garantex.io, and Garantex.academy.
According to officials, the seizure will prevent the sites from being used for money laundering and any other crimes. Individuals who go to those sites now see a message indicating that the site has been seized by law enforcement.
Additionally, officials said Friday that German and Finnish law enforcement also seized servers hosting Garantex's operations. U.S. law authorities, according to the Justice Department, have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex's servers, including customer and accounting databases. More than $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex's money laundering activities have been frozen, U.S. officials said.

US Department of Justice

The Justice Department announced today a coordinated action with Germany and Finland to disrupt and take down the online infrastructure used to operate Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly facilitated money laundering by transnational criminal organizations — including terrorist organizations — and sanctions violations. Since April 2019, Garantex has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions.

In conjunction with the operation targeting Garantex, the Department also announced the unsealing of an indictment in the Eastern District of Virginia against Aleksej Besciokov, 46, a Lithuanian national and Russian resident, and Aleksandr Mira Serda (previously Aleksandr Ntifo-Siaw), 40, a Russian national and United Arab Emirates resident. Mira Serda and Besciokov are charged with money laundering conspiracy, and Besciokov is charged with conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.

According to court documents, between 2019 and 2025, Besciokov and Mira Serda controlled and operated Garantex. Besciokov was Garantex’s primary technical administrator and responsible for obtaining and maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Mira Serda was Garantex’s co-founder and chief commercial officer.

Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to U.S. victims. According to the indictment, Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that criminal proceeds were being laundered through Garantex and took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities on its platform. For example, when Russian law enforcement sought records relating to an account registered to Mira Serda, Garantex provided incomplete information in response and falsely claimed the account was not verified. In reality, Garantex had associated the account with Mira Serda’s personal identifying documents, even while disclosing identifying information related to other accounts requested by Russian law enforcement.

On April 5, 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Garantex for its role in facilitating money laundering of funds from ransomware actors and darknet markets. According to court documents, despite the widespread publicity of the sanctions and Garantex administrator’s personal knowledge of them, Besciokov and his co-conspirators violated those sanctions by continuing to transact with U.S.-based entities. Further, Besciokov and his co-conspirators redesigned Garantex’s operations to evade and violate U.S. sanctions and induce U.S. businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions. For example, Garantex moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts.

Despite doing substantial business in the United States and operating as a money transmitting business, Garantex failed to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as required.

On March 6, U.S. law enforcement, led by the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), executed a seizure order authorized by a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia against three website domain names used to support Garantex’s operations. According to court records unsealed today, Garantex.org, Garantex.io, and Garantex.academy were associated with the administration and operation of Garantex. The seizure of these domains will prevent these sites from being used for money laundering and additional crimes. Individuals visiting those sites now will see a message indicating that the site has been seized by law enforcement.

As part of the coordinated actions, German and Finnish law enforcement seized servers hosting Garantex’s operations. U.S. law authorities have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex’s servers, including customer and accounting databases. In addition, U.S. law enforcement has also frozen over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering activities.

Besciokov and Mira Serda are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Besciokov is also charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.    

Supervisory Official Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Erik S. Siebert for the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant Director Michael Centrella of the USSS’ Office of Field Operations, and Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division made the announcement.

USSS and the FBI are investigating the case.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Zoe Bedell for the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Tamara Livshiz of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department’s National Security Division and Office of International Affairs provided valuable assistance.

The Justice Department also recognizes the critical cooperation of the German Federal Criminal Police Office, the Frankfurt General Prosecutor’s Office, the Dutch National Police, Europol, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, and the Estonian National Criminal Police.

Finally, the Department thanks Tether and blockchain analytics firm Elliptic for their proactive assistance in this investigation.

Any individual who believes he/she is a victim whose funds were laundered through Garantex or who may otherwise have a claim to restrained funds should reach out to law enforcement via email address GarantexClaimants@secretservice.gov.

President Donald Trump’s March 6, 2025 executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Crypto Asset Stockpile is a historic moment for this original cryptocurrency first launched in January 2009, and for the digital assets industry, more broadly. The move signals a major shift in policy, with the U.S. government recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic asset alongside traditional reserves like gold.

Vocal crypto-critic Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has demanded immediate financial disclosures from Crypto Czar David Sacks (who  reportedly liquidated his holdings just days ago), questioning potential conflicts of interest amid Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement. Citing concerns over insider trading and regulatory rollbacks, Warren pressed for details on Sacks’ crypto divestments and who knew of Trump’s plans before his public announcement. The inclusion of Solana in the crypto stockpile has raised eyebrows, particularly since Trump launched his “Official Trump” meme coin on Solana’s blockchain prior to his inauguration.

This has fueled speculation that some aspects of the reserve and stockpile may be politically motivated rather than purely strategic.

While some in the crypto industry welcomed the announcement, Bitcoin’s price dropped more than 5% upon news that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile would not include government purchases, only a formalization of existing policy to hold confiscated assets. Despite its bold rhetoric, the order largely reaffirms current asset management practices rather than introducing substantive new policies. However, it does place Bitcoin alongside other strategic reserves and fulfills Trump’s campaign pledge to prioritize the asset in digital asset policy.

In a March 7, 2025, X/Twitter post, early Bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem reflected on the momentous shift in policy. “Not in our wildest dreams,” explained Shrem, “could we ever have imagined that one day the President of the United States would establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.”

The order’s vague framework has sparked concerns, particularly as Trump’s March 7, 2025, Crypto Summit is set to feature a narrow circle of industry elites, with little representation from diverse perspectives or consumer advocates. The revelation that the reserve would only consist of seized Bitcoin (rather than positioning the U.S. as an active buyer) sent the market into a freefall, failing to meet some expectations and deepening uncertainty and the tribal divide over the government’s long-term role in Bitcoin’s future.

Strategic reserves are government-controlled stockpiles of critical assets, typically created to mitigate national security or economic stability risks. The most well-known example is the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which holds crude oil to protect against supply disruptions. Governments, including the United States, also hold reserves of gold and foreign currencies to stabilize national economies.

By establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the U.S. is effectively placing Bitcoin in the same category as these traditional reserves, thus further legitimizing a nascent and volatile emerging asset class plagued by fear, uncertainty and doubt. The White House’s framing of Bitcoin as a national asset suggests that policymakers now view it as an emerging ‘store of value’ rather than merely a speculative investment. “In economics,” explains AccountingInsights.org, “the concept of a store of value is vital for understanding how assets retain their worth over time.” Assets that act as stores of value, “provide individuals and businesses confidence in preserving purchasing power against inflation or market fluctuations.” For this reason, Bitcoin is considered a “hedge” against inflation.

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, however, is not without controversy. Unlike oil, which is essential for energy security, or gold, which has served as a recognized store of value for millennia, Bitcoin remains highly volatile. At least for now. But volatility is not the absence of value; it is often a sign of an emerging asset class finding its place in the financial system. While critics argue that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic worth due to its digital nature and absence of industrial applications, intrinsic value is always in the eye of the beholder and shaped by the needs of the economic era in which an asset exists.

Today, Bitcoin’s value is derived from market demand, provable scarcity, and its decentralized security model, characteristics that have made it increasingly attractive as a hedge against currency debasement and financial instability. What is dismissed as speculation today may, as the world economy evolves, become an essential pillar of financial resilience tomorrow, a shift already evident in institutional adoption trends and now, through the U.S. government’s own recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.

When news of the imminent signing of this EO ahead of the March 7, 2025, Crypto Summit) first broke, Bitcoin’s price surged past $90,000 as traders speculated that the U.S. government would begin actively acquiring Bitcoin, especially with only 1.5 million of the total 21 million supply still available. However, once it became clear that the reserve would rely solely on confiscated Bitcoin rather than new government purchases, the market quickly reversed course. Adding to the uncertainty, an executive order is not law and, therefore, can be overturned by any future president, leaving the long-term fate of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in question absent congressional action.

Investors who had positioned themselves for a major institutional Bitcoin buying spree began offloading their holdings, triggering a sell-off that sent Bitcoin’s price tumbling below $82,000 in a matter of hours. The market reaction highlighted a broader issue: many traders had assumed that the reserve would function similarly to a central bank accumulating gold. Instead, the reliance on seized Bitcoin introduced uncertainty, reinforcing concerns that the reserve would be politically motivated rather than strategically structured.

Some investors also viewed the plan as antithetical to Bitcoin’s core ethos of decentralization and voluntary participation. The idea that the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings would come exclusively from confiscations rather than open-market purchases raised ethical concerns about whether the reserve represented a legitimate financial strategy or simply a means of monetizing legal seizures.

Adding to the confusion was the creation of a second entity, the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, which will be managed by the Treasury Department and hold other confiscated cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA).

This distinction has led to uncertainty about the government’s long-term approach to digital assets. While the Bitcoin reserve is intended to be a long-term strategic holding, the stockpile’s purpose is less clear. Unlike the Bitcoin reserve, which explicitly prohibits selling its assets, the stockpile may function as a more flexible repository of confiscated cryptocurrencies, potentially allowing for future liquidations.

Supporters of the Bitcoin reserve argue that it elevates Bitcoin’s status and signals U.S. leadership in digital asset policy. Some believe the move will encourage other nations to formalize their own Bitcoin reserves, accelerating institutional adoption.

Sacks defended the plan, arguing that the U.S. had lost over $17 billion in potential value by prematurely selling confiscated Bitcoin over the past decade. “Had we held onto the Bitcoin we seized, we would control a much more valuable reserve today,” Sacks wrote in a social media post. “The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve corrects that mistake.”

Some Bitcoin maximalists, including Tyler Winklevoss, applauded the idea of a government-controlled Bitcoin reserve but criticized the inclusion of other cryptocurrencies in the stockpile.

As reported by the Bitoinist, Winklevoss explained “I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA,but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve. Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar, and that digital asset is Bitcoin.”

Other industry figures, however, have raised concerns about the lack of clarity on how the government will manage its Bitcoin holdings. Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures noted that while a Bitcoin reserve could establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets, mixing it with other cryptocurrencies would dilute its credibility. “A Bitcoin-only reserve would ratify Bitcoin as a global asset of consequence, somewhere in the realm of gold,” Carter told CNBC. “Throwing in other digital currencies makes it look like another speculative fund.”

According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the U.S. government currently holds 198,109 Bitcoin, valued at $17.5 billion at today’s market prices. These holdings have accumulated over time through major enforcement actions, including the Silk Road seizures and the Bitfinex hack investigation. This makes the U.S. one of the largest institutional Bitcoin holders, controlling nearly 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. However, the long-term implications of this ownership remain unclear.

Trump’s Bitcoin reserve initiative has drawn both praise and skepticism, reflecting broader tensions in the crypto industry over government involvement in digital assets.

The political context is inescapable. After years of regulatory hostility under the Biden administration, Trump’s policy represents a dramatic shift toward institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. Yet, the lack of a clear strategy for managing the reserve, combined with concerns about potential political motivations, has left many unanswered questions. If the government mismanages the initiative—through opaque policymaking, insider deals, or future market interventions, it could undermine Bitcoin’s status as a neutral, censorship-resistant asset.

The coming weeks will determine whether the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a bold step toward financial modernization or a risky political experiment. For now, uncertainty looms over the digital asset market, and the debate over Bitcoin’s role in U.S. economic policy is far from settled.

NOTE: In this latest article of the Electing Crypto™ series, Prof. Evans breaks down the key provisions of Trump’s executive order, examines the market’s reaction, and assesses whether this move signals a meaningful shift in U.S. Bitcoin policy or simply repackages existing asset management practices under a new name.</p>

A senior White House official told Decrypt that President Donald Trump created a strategic reserve exclusively for Bitcoin on Thursday because the president’s administration views the cryptocurrency as belonging to a league of its own. 

“Bitcoin is special in our view,” the senior White House official said. “It’s the most secure. It’s the most decentralized. It doesn’t have an issuer. So it deserves special treatment.”

In signing an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Trump also established a federal Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include various other cryptocurrencies seized by the U.S. government “in connection with criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.”

Trump stated on Sunday that such a stockpile would specifically feature XRP, Solana, and Cardano, sending market prices for those assets flying. "I think the president just gave five examples of cryptocurrencies in his post," the official said. "Those five have to be the largest by market cap, so I think people are reading into that a little bit too much. The bottom line is, I think that what we’ve announced here is consistent with what the president has always said about the space.”

It's currently unclear if the U.S. government is in possession of any assets mentioned in Trump's post, other than Bitcoin and Ethereum, that it may have gained from prior criminal proceedings. U.S. government crypto wallets identified by blockchain intelligence firm Arkham currently hold zero XRP, SOL, or ADA. 

When asked by Decrypt whether this means the crypto stockpile may not feature XRP, SOL, or ADA after all, the White House official deflected, saying the U.S. government does not yet have a full accounting of which digital assets it holds and in what amounts.

“We have to go see what the federal government actually owns,” the official said. “They've never done an audit before. I think that's the place to start.”

The official elaborated that while the nearly 200,000 Bitcoin believed to be in the U.S. government’s possession will be held indefinitely with the aim of generating “long term value,” the U.S. Treasury secretary will have the authority to sell off any altcoins in the Digital Assets Stockpile if they “decided that was the best strategy.”

The official also teased the agenda for this afternoon’s first ever White House Crypto Summit, which will put various industry leaders in dialogue with senior government officials. No tax-related issues will be discussed; the emphasis will instead be primarily on dismantling Biden-era, anti-crypto regulations. 

Editor's note: This story was updated after publication to include additional comments from the senior White House official.

Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIH) today announced the launch of Bitcoin Range Binary (BTCRB) Options on its MIAX Derivatives Exchange (MIAXdx).

BTCRB Options are fully-collateralized, cash-settled binary options on Bitcoin (BTC) that expire each trading hour and are settled to the dxFeed Bitcoin Reference Index. BTCRB Options are offered on MIAXdx in $10 units with a minimum tick size of $0.01.

“We are pleased to launch the new BTCRB Options on MIAXdx to meet the rising demand for products that allow investors to manage risk exposure in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market,” said Thomas P. Gallagher, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MIH. “MIAXdx has a history of providing innovative digital asset products and these new options offer both retail and institutional investors a powerful tool to manage short-term fluctuations in bitcoin prices.”

The dxFeed Bitcoin Reference Index represents the price of BTC in USD, constructed using trade data from Bitstamp and Gemini during a ten-minute calculation window prior to each hourly expiration.
