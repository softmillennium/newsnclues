NEW ORLEANS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Former Attorney General of Louisiana, Charles C. Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”), announces that KSF has commenced an investigation into Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ACHC).





On September 27, 2024, the Company disclosed the receipt of a voluntary request for information from the U. S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York as well as a grand jury subpoena from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri “related to its admissions, length of stay and billing practices.” Then, on October 30, 2024, the Company disclosed that it had lowered its full-year 2024 revenue outlook to a range of $3.15 to $3.165 billion and its full-year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $725 to $735 million due in part to slower same-store patient day growth of only 3% in the month of October.



The Company has been sued in a securities class action lawsuit for failing to disclose material information, violating federal securities laws, which remains ongoing.



KSF’s investigation is focusing on whether Acadia’s officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to Acadia’s shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws.

10About Town at 4 p.m.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — A Republican bill in the Tennessee legislature could allow healthcare providers to deny patients some kinds of treatments and services, such as birth control, based on their religious, moral or ethical beliefs.

SB 0955 was introduced by Senator Ferrell Haile (R-Gallatin). It would prohibit healthcare providers from requiring medical workers to participate or pay for healthcare procedures and treatments that they don't agree with. The bill includes language meant to ensure healthcare providers continue following their duties to treat people — as long as those treatments "do not violate the healthcare provider's conscience."

The bill also said insurance companies that are contractually obligated to pay for procedures and treatments would still need to pay for them, even if a provider objects to a treatment.

The bill would also protect healthcare providers who choose not to provide treatment from civil lawsuits or criminal prosecution. However, the bill also says protections do not extend to "procedures, treatments, or services governed by federal law, including the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act."

It also does not extend to situations in which a person is in imminent danger of harming themselves or others.

"The bill prevents healthcare professionals from being forced to provide certain treatments, but it does not allow them to refuse care to specific groups of people," Haile said.

He said pharmacists who refuse to give prescriptions for birth control because they object to it would be protected under the bill.

The bill passed the Tennessee Senate Thursday in a 27-3 vote, with four senators not voting. It will be discussed in the House Health Subcommittee on March 12.</p>

Southeast Georgia Health System is asking residents in Brantley, Camden, Charlton, Glynn, McIntosh and Wayne counties to participate in an online survey to share their feedback on health care needs and concerns.

The online Health Needs Assessment Survey is completely anonymous— meaning no one can connect you to your answers. The survey, which takes less than 10 minutes to complete, is accessible now through March 21, 2025. Those interested in participating must be 18 years or older. Click on the links below to participate today!

Information derived from the survey responses will provide the Health System with a better understanding of community needs and help guide decisions on how best to tailor programs and services to address those needs. “We encourage the community to participate in this survey and share their thoughts on how Southeast Georgia Health System can better address the health needs of the populations that we serve,” says Christy Jordan, Interim President & CEO/Chief Legal Officer. “The survey results provide valuable feedback which influences our strategic planning, allocation of resources, and development of partnerships with local programs.”

The Affordable Care Act requires all not-for-profit hospitals to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment of their service areas every three years. In addition to surveying local residents in six counties, data is collected from public sources, health experts, and public health and federally qualified health centers. Previous survey findings have resulted in Health System investments in recruitment of additional primary care physicians, screenings for cancers and diabetes, and community health education. Results of the survey will be made available on the Health System’s website later this year.

A nonprofit healthcare clinic in Normal that serves a largely uninsured clientele is hoping an update to its patient income qualifications will encourage more people to seek services.

The Community Health Care Clinic [CHCC] is now accepting applicants who make up to 250% of the Federal Poverty Level [FPL], according to an email the clinic sent to donors. Previously, applicants could make up to 185% of the FPL.

Updated 2025 poverty guidance says that a single household falling within 250% should make no more than $39,125 a year and a four-family household, no more than $80,375 a year. This, according to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation

Executive Director Holly Wayland-Hall said in the email that the organization’s policy was outdated and forced the clinic to turn many potential clients away.

“In the last two years, CHCC had discharged or not accepted hundreds of patients who exceeded income qualifying criteria but otherwise had no other access to healthcare,” she said. “A review of applicant data and comparison with other free and charitable clinics in Illinois revealed that an increase was in order.”

This marks the first time CHCC — which offers primary, dental and behavioral health care — is updating its guidance for patient income qualifications since the nonprofit opened over three decades ago. The nonprofit noted that the minimum wage has increased by $10 since then.

CHCC is encouraging patients who were previously turned away, as well as new patients who meet the updated criteria to apply for services.

Wayland-Hall wrote in the email that the clinic’s hope is “that we can once again be the medical home for those who have no other way to access healthcare, so they can manage chronic medical conditions and be able to continue working and providing for their families.”

Boston, Massachusetts, March  07, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a major step toward transparency and efficiency in the healthcare and home service industry, MyVisits.net has officially launched its innovative Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) app. Founded by behavioral healthcare veteran Joseph Catan, the platform aims to modernize the way home visits are tracked, verified, and reimbursed.

  

MyVisits

Available now on Apple and Google Play stores, the MyVisits app is designed to help companies and healthcare providers accurately document in-home visits, track mileage, and ensure services are delivered as billed. With a user-friendly interface, automated verification features, and cloud-based convenience, MyVisits is poised to become an essential tool for agencies across the United States and, eventually, the world.

The figures underscore the urgency of a solution like this. An investigation in New York revealed $14.5 billion in unverified Medicaid home care services, which is less than half of the claims submitted, due to a lack of reliable tracking. Without proper visit verification, fraudulent claims and billing errors remain widespread.

Joseph Catan, who spent 15 years running a behavioral healthcare company, has seen these issues firsthand. “When we started, we were told by the practitioners that verifying that staff actually went to a client’s home as scheduled was a major challenge,” Catan recalls. “The existing system was unreliable and easy to manipulate.”

Traditional verification methods, like manual sign-ins and random phone call confirmations, only address a small percentage of visits, leaving the majority unchecked. Compounding the issue, companies are held financially responsible for fraudulent or inaccurate claims, leading to steep fines and compliance risks.

Determined to solve this long-standing problem, Catan developed MyVisits.net: a secure, automated solution that gives verifiable data in real-time, which shows that visits happen as scheduled.

This cloud-based solution utilizes geolocation with its seamless QR code scanning to ensure the authenticity of the records. It also automatically records mileage from practitioners’ departures to patients’ locations, eliminating the need for manual calculations and ensuring accurate reimbursements. Telehealth integration allows practitioners to document telehealth calls, logging start, duration, and end times for billing purposes without disclosing doctor-patient conversations. 

Unlike expensive custom-built software, MyVisits requires no additional hardware, making it accessible for smaller agencies with limited budgets. Catan emphasizes affordability as a key factor, stating, “Small and mid-sized agencies don’t have the resources to develop custom software. We designed the app to be accessible to all providers without the high costs of IT infrastructure.”

The launch of the MyVisits app aligns with the federal mandate for Electronic Visit Verification under the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016, which required digital tracking for Medicaid-funded home services. Yet, many agencies have struggled to comply due to the lack of a universal, industry-wide solution. “The MyVisits app provides the scalable, standardized solution the industry has been waiting for,” says Catan.

While the initial rollout is focused on North America, Catan envisions a global expansion. With healthcare systems worldwide facing similar challenges, MyVisits.net has the potential to become the go-to verification tool for home healthcare, behavioral health, nursing, and beyond. “We want to evolve alongside our clients,” Catan states. “As regulations change and industry needs shift, we will adapt. The reason we’re in this situation is because the industry wasn’t agile enough. We’re here to change that.” 

Future updates will incorporate additional features based on user feedback to ensure continuous improvements. Telehealth capabilities, already integrated into the platform, will continue to expand as virtual care becomes more prevalent. “At the end of the day, this isn’t just for compliance; we need to be able to deliver better patient care,” Catan concludes. “When visits are accurately tracked and verified, patients receive the services they need. And that’s what matters most—one verified visit at a time.”

The department of veterans affairs announced this week that they plan on cutting 80,000 jobs, as part of the Trump Administration's DOGE initiative. 

Iowa's News Now stopped in to the Freedom Foundation in Cedar Rapids, which serves hundreds of our veterans every week with a food pantry and other resources,  to hear what they have to say about the news.

Vice President Roger Jensen says he is not worried just yet. He says he's confident the Trump Administration is doing what they can by cutting access spending, but there is one fear he has and that's the medical needs of the veterans he serves.  

"I don't believe that those cuts will involve doctors, nurses, people that are necessary, as far as the health care. If it started cutting health care, were in big trouble because they're already short on doctors. I don't think it'll go so far to affect us that bad. I really don't. I'm confident in what he's doing," said Jensen.

Mangione said the letter was the first to make him ‘tear up’ as the mom, only identified as Karen, shared details of her daughter’s rare, life-threatening disease

Luigi Mangione has written a letter from his prison cell to a mother who ‘made him tear up’ as she detailed her struggles to pay for her daughter’s healthcare.

“Your letter is the first to make me tear up. I am so, so, sorry for what you and your daughter so senselessly had to endure,” Mangione wrote from his cell at the end of December. 

Mangione’s letter to “Karen” was shared with journalist and novelist Ashley Shelby, who published it on her Substack dedicated to the case. The mom, Karen, detailed how her daughter deals with a life-threatening condition. Karen told said that her daughter requires constant care and medical treatment and last year, costs mounted after she was hospitalized for 60 nights, according to the Substack.

“What she and I went through as a result of insurance calling the shots rather than the doctors is a horrible story,” Karen said. “She is improving, but hardly close to her old self.”

The mom referenced the famed mosaic of Christ in Majesty at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., and referred to it as “Warrior Jesus” in her letter. 

She vowed that she would “keep up the fight” in Mangione’s name.

Mangione has developed a following of fans since his arrest in connection to the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was fatally shot outside of a hotel in Midtown Manhattan on December 4. Mangione has pleaded not guilty. A specific motive for the killing has not been released, but many have speculated that is tied to Thompson’s role with the insurance company. 

The 26-year-old is awaiting trial in New York’s notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. New York, where he sent the letter from. 

“If you are able to send a photo of you/your daughter or the mosaic, it would mean a great deal to me,” Mangione wrote to mom. “I will put it up on my prison cell wall next to your letter. Your daughter is blessed to have a mother who loves her so much and fights for her so relentlessly.” 

Initially, Karen felt “very weird” about writing to Mangione, she said, but did so after being “driven by some force that didn’t make sense but couldn’t be ignored.”

The mom added that after hearing similar stories of Americans’ battles with health insurers, her anger has turned to determination to support “nurses and doctors, telling them that a change was surely coming.”

Mangione has been inundated with fan mail since he began his prison stint. 

Last month the murder suspect released his first public statement since his December arrest where he told supporters he reads every letter he receives.

“I am overwhelmed by - and grateful for - everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions, as mail has flooded MDC from across the country, and around the globe,” Mangione’s statement said. “While I can't reply to most letters, please know that I read every one that I receive. Thank you again to everyone who took the time to write. I look forward to hearing more in the future.”

Supporters have been donating to his legal defense fund, which currently stands at $641,491. One generous donor gave $30,000 last month.

Hundreds of his fans turned up in droves to support Mangione at his pre-trial hearing inside a New York courthouse last month.

“I think what happened was inevitable given the amount of tension” between Americans and the healthcare industry, one New Yorker told The Independent outside the court.

One person who traveled three hours from Maryland just to see the reaction to the hearing remarked on this tension: “Something’s gotta give and that something was Luigi Mangione …. he’s a go-getter.”

Another protester, who flew in from Chicago to show solidarity, said: “I think major changes are needed in insurance.” Thompson’s killing “brought a spotlight and a charge to take action against wrongdoing by corporate entities milking as much as they can from normal people.”

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers delivered his weekly radio address highlighting plans from his 2025-27 Executive Budget to crack down on insurance companies and prescription price gouging, lower out-of-pocket healthcare costs, reduce appointment wait times, and enable Wisconsinites to get healthcare closer to home, and expand access to affordable healthcare statewide, including in rural communities.

During his 2025-27 Biennial Budget Message, Gov. Evers announced several key initiatives to:

As part of Gov. Evers’ comprehensive plan to lower costs for working families, he is also proposing to eliminate the sales tax on over-the-counter medications, which would save Wisconsinites a projected $70 million over the next two years. Additional information on Gov. Evers’s plan to address the frustrating challenges Wisconsinites face with sweeping changes to the healthcare industry in Wisconsin is available here.

Audio File of Radio Address.

Hey there, Wisconsin! Governor Tony Evers here.

A key part of my plan to lower costs for working families includes making it easier for folks to get the healthcare they need without breaking the bank.

It’s why I’m again proposing to expand BadgerCare, which would save Wisconsin taxpayers nearly $2 billion over the next two years and expand quality, affordable healthcare coverage for about 100,000 Wisconsinites.

I’m also proposing sweeping plans to lower costs for prescriptions and medication and crack down on price gouging and health insurers.

My “Less for Rx” plan will lower costs for life-saving prescription drugs and insulin, including capping insulin copays at $35 and eliminating the sales tax on over-the-counter medications to save Wisconsinites $70 million over the next two years alone.

And I hear from folks all the time who feel like they’re getting ripped off by the healthcare industry and insurers. Wisconsinites aren’t getting a fair shake when it comes to healthcare, and I want to change that.

So, first things first: I want to make Wisconsin the first state in America to start auditing insurance companies over denying healthcare claims.

If an insurance company is going to deny your healthcare claim, they should have a darn good reason for it. So, under my plan, if an insurance company is denying Wisconsinites’ claims too often, we’re going to audit them. Pretty simple.

And here’s what else my plan would do: we’d create a new office to help Wisconsinites whose health insurance claims are denied, and we’re going to create new standards to expand the healthcare services and procedures that insurance companies are required to cover.

That means more healthcare services and procedures will be covered by your insurance automatically—no delays, no hassle, no questions asked.

And we’re working to make sure Wisconsinites know what you’re getting when you buy your insurance plan, to reduce wait times, and to make sure covered care is close to home, and so much more.

Folks, healthcare should not be a privilege afforded by only the healthy and the wealthy. Wisconsinites should be able to get the healthcare they need when they need it.

So, let’s make this a priority this session. Thank you.

Changes this year to Tricare, the military’s health care program, have brought cascading disruptions to millions of service members, their families and network providers nationwide.

About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid for months, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.

The disruptions to a network that provides benefits to about 9.6 million people have left military members scrambling to secure medical, behavioral and mental health services for themselves and their loved ones, as advocates worry about lasting repercussions.

In Tennessee, Army Sgt. Bo Heggins has relied on Tricare for years to cover occupational therapy for his 8-year-old son who has autism. Up to eight hours with a provider each week had helped his son learn life and conversational skills. The progress was visible, and Heggins, 35, had hope that his son could grow to live a happy, independent life.

Then, in mid-February, when Heggins and his wife tried to schedule another routine appointment, they learned the provider was one of many who had not been paid by Tricare, which threatened future coverage. In all the confusion, his son has not had a session since and has begun to regress.“There’s no longer improvement,” Heggins said, as he began to cry. “My son is my heart. And I want him to be the best person he can be.”

The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since Jan. 1, after a new contractor began managing benefits on the West Coast and in six Eastern states that were reallocated to the west region.

The DHA previously said the new contracts would “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries.

This situation has become untenable.

Brenda Stephens, a tricare provider

In a statement to NBC News, DHA spokesperson Brenda Campbell said the agency was working with the contractors to resolve the issues.Among the most severe: Several thousand health care providers have not been paid since December 2024 because of a data issue, officials said. Some say they are owed more than $100,000.

“This situation has become untenable,” said Brenda Stephens, who submitted $180,000 in claims for services that her mental health clinic in San Diego provided to military members this year.

Another mental health provider in San Diego said he has only had about $1,000 to spend in monthly income, received through cash-paying patients, since January.

Rodger Questin, 50, a clinical psychologist, said his private practice has accrued about $50,000 in unpaid Tricare claims. He has had to dip into his savings and said he has not bought a single item this year that he did not need.

“There are times where I’m like, what am I going to do?” he said. 

A spokesperson for Humana Military, the regional contractor for the east region, said the company learned in early January that a “small percentage” of providers’ records in the claims administration system had outdated or incorrect data, which prevented the claims from being processed.

The issue affected fewer than 16,750 providers. The Humana spokesperson said that figure was less than 1% of the total number of providers in and out of the network.

The company said it has been “working around the clock” to clear the backlog of unpaid claims.

“We have identified the root cause of this issue and have fixed the majority of the issues caused by the incorrect data,” the spokesperson said. “We take our commitment to TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and providers very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this problem has caused.”

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the new contractor for the west region, did not say how many providers there have also not been paid.

“All major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges, and we are working tirelessly seven days a week to implement solutions because there is nothing more important than ensuring military families get the care they earned,” a TriWest spokesperson said in a statement.

TriWest said it has processed 1.6 million claims since January and issued more than 351,000 Tricare referrals and authorizations for care.

In a statement to NBC News, DHA officials said it will take one to two weeks to determine if the technical fixes resolved the east region issues.

The agency said the contractors have met the contractual requirements to pay 98% of processed claims within 30 days and all claims within 90 days to date.

The DHA officials, citing the contractors, said no east region provider has left the network due to claims issues but that a few have left in the west.

Regarding payment issues on the West Coast, DHA officials said claim payments are “always slightly slower” in the first month of every calendar year to make sure Tricare rates have been properly applied. Contractors, they said, also verify that numbers and provider information in each claim are correct before money is paid.

“This time frame has now passed and claims are now flowing much faster,” the officials said. “Additionally, TriWest is actively contacting the few providers who have left the network to ask them to rejoin the network.”

NBC News spoke to more than half a dozen providers across the country who said they are still waiting to be reimbursed. Faced with a sudden cash flow crisis, many have had to make difficult and heartbreaking decisions.

In San Diego, Stephens took out a $75,000 loan at the beginning of February, but it only got her clinic through two payrolls. By the end of February, she had to pause services for all of her clinic’s 350 Tricare patients — some whom she said are in “desperate shape” — as well as lay off seven employees.

“It’s been nothing short of devastating. I feel a reaction in my whole body right now,” she said through tears. “We’ve been forced into an impossible situation. We can’t continue to treat them without being paid and they can’t find other providers.”

A Florida clinic that provides psychiatry and therapy services to about 300 people also recently decided it would have to stop treating Tricare patients after it racked up more than $100,000 in unpaid claims since Jan. 1, office manager Beth Matricia said.

You're talking about people who are suicidal.

“We’re going to have to charge them out of pocket because if we keep going this way, we’re going to have to close down,” said Matricia, who manages MAPS Integrated Wellness in the military community of Fernandina Beach.Matricia said she and other staff members fear the fallout will further affect the mental health of service members, who will likely not be able to afford the full cost of up to $150 per session.

“You’re talking about people who are suicidal,” she said. “If you stop their care, they can choose to end their life. It’s very hard to transfer therapists. It’s really hard to open up again.”

Ross Wise, a registered nurse who works with a psychiatrist at MAPS, said some of their patients are children struggling at school and adults dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.

“It might spiral someone down to a deep depression,” Wise said.

In Clarksville, Tennessee, Jenne Nesbitt-Decker, owner and chief financial officer of Mariposa Behavioral Health Services, a small clinic that treats children and teens who have autism, said she has had to cut the number of available appointments in half to make up for the lack of payments and the loss of one provider who quit.

If she still has not been paid by April 1, Nesbitt-Decker, who has four children and a mortgage, said she will have to stop serving Tricare patients, which she has done since 2007.

There is a growing concern that if providers continue to leave Tricare, it will worsen an existing health care worker shortage, said Eileen Huck, the National Military Family Association’s acting director of government relations.

“That exacerbates an already difficult problem,” she said. “What implications does that have for health care access for service members and their families? That’s really troubling.”

The monthslong upheaval has left Heggins, the service member whose young son has autism, to make his own agonizing choice.

His son’s provider told NBC News that if Tricare does not resolve the reimbursement issue in two weeks, her clinic will send out a 45-day notice to current Tricare clients to terminate services. Her office has already stopped accepting new Tricare patients.

While Heggins has served in the military for 16 years and had plans to give another four years, he said he is contemplating leaving the Army when his contract is up in June to find better care for his son.

“If my insurance won’t cover what I think is an essential, needed service, I might have to look at getting covered by other insurance,” he said.

Other options, Heggins said, include selling his vehicle and relying on his wife’s car to transport their family of six in order to afford out-of-pocket treatment, or taking out a loan. He sees hardship with any decision.

“It would be incredibly difficult,” he said. “I hope and pray that the Defense Health Agency figures this is out in a timely manner.”
