Samsung Galaxy Buds FE 2 is in development as the successor to 2023's Galaxy Buds FE, according to a report. The purported true wireless stereo (TWS) earbuds are expected to replace the original Buds FE as the South Korean technology conglomerate's most affordable offering. The development of the product is said to have reached a “fairly advanced stage”. Although details remain scarce, the Galaxy Buds FE 2 are speculated to build upon the features of its predecessor.

According to a report by Dutch publication GalaxyClub, the purported Galaxy Buds FE 2 may come with the model number SM-R410. Notably, the Galaxy Buds FE has SM-R400N listed as the model number. Although the report does not shed light on the specifications of the purported TWS earbuds, they are speculated to be launched before the end of summer.

Their development is said to have reached a “fairly advanced stage”, with the company also reportedly developing its firmware. The report speculates Galaxy Buds FE 2 could be launched alongside the Galaxy Z Flip FE.

The original Galaxy Buds FE were launched in October 2023 as the company's most affordable TWS earbuds, priced at Rs. 9,999. They are offered in two colourways — Graphite and White. Nearly two years after their debut, Samsung could finally introduce their successor.

Samsung Galaxy Buds FE TWS sport a design similar to the Galaxy Buds Plus model with the wing tips. However, this time around, they come equipped with active noise cancellation (ANC). They offer support for touch controls along with a feature which allows it to switch between devices automatically.

The wireless headset has an IPX2 rating for splash resistance, which means it should survive light splashes of water. The company claims you get up to six hours of battery life with these earphones when ANC is enabled and a total of 21 hours without ANC, including the charging case.

WhatsApp, the most popular instant messaging app, continues to improve user experience with new features. The platform is frequently updating itself to enhance privacy, security, and customization. Now, the company has started rolling out 5 new features that will make messaging more convenient for the users.

WhatsApp first tests its new features with beta users before making them available to everyone. Over the last couple of months, several new tools have been in the testing phase, and now their stable version is being released worldwide. These features will personalize chats, improve notifications, and enhance video playback. Let’s take a closer look at what’s new!

WhatsApp users can now personalize their chat experience with colourful themes. Previously, users had limited options to customize their chat backgrounds, but now WhatsApp has introduced 20 vibrant chat themes and 30 new wallpapers. This feature allows users to set theirfavouritee colors for conversations, giving the app a fresh and personalized look.

Many users find the unread message notification dot annoying, especially when dealing with multiple messages. To fix this, WhatsApp has introduced a clear chat notification feature. Now, users can control how notifications appear and eliminate unnecessary message alerts. This feature can be accessed in the notification settings section.

WhatsApp introduced chat filters last year, making it easier to organize messages. Now, a new unread chat counter has been added to this feature. This means users can see the exact number of unread messages directly in the chat filter, ensuring no important message is missed.

A long-awaited feature is finally here! WhatsApp now allows users to change the video playback speed. Earlier, this was only possible for voice notes, but now users can watch videos at 1.5x or 2x speed. This is especially useful for quickly viewing long videos shared on the platform.Read Also

Have you ever skipped a highly-rated movie just because of the language issue- not available in either Hindi or English? For this kind of movie, Amazon Prime Video is working on a solution by testing AI-assisted dubbing, which will make it easier for viewers to enjoy foreign films and shows without relying solely on subtitles.

Prime Video comes with a vast library of international films and TV series, but many of them are never dubbed into other languages due to the high costs and effort involved.

Traditional dubbing use to happen with the professional voice actors to record new dialogue, a process that is both time-consuming and expensive. As a result, several great movies and shows remain inaccessible to a global audience.

To address this, Amazon is leveraging AI technology to create dubbed versions of select titles. This approach reduces dubbing costs and speeds up the process, ensuring that more content becomes available to viewers worldwide.

The AI dubbing system isn’t fully automated—it combines AI technology with human expertise. Here’s how it works:

Initially, Prime Video is rolling out AI-assisted dubbing for 12 titles, including:

The AI dubs will be available in English and Latin American Spanish, with more languages expected in the future.

Amazon has been actively working to make its platform more inclusive. The company already provides subtitles, closed captions, and audio descriptions for better accessibility. AI dubbing is the next step in ensuring that users can enjoy a seamless language-friendly streaming experience.

In the future, viewers may see a wider selection of movies and shows dubbed in multiple languages using AI, making foreign content more accessible than ever before.

Gboard, the default keyboard app that comes pre-installed on almost all Android devices is getting a visual change that might be making many uncomfortable.

As it turns out, the latest version of Gboard for Android beta has introduced circle and pill-shaped keys for select users. Instead of the rectangular keys most of us are familiar with, the new shapes seem to be frustrating many as it has messed up with their muscle memory.

And while there is no functional change as to how these keys work and that the new keys look more modern than they ever did, some are having a hard time using the “”Long press for symbols option, which appears directly above a letter. The new keys seem to be rolling out for users who are on Gboard beta build version 15.1, and currently there seems to be no way to revert to the old key style. However, users can try turning off key borders for a cleaner look.

To do so, open Gboard settings, navigate to Themes, select a theme and on the pop-up that appears, turn off the toggle named ‘Key borders’. Alternatively, you can also opt out of Gboard beta from the Google Play Store, uninstall and then reinstall the stable version to get back the rectangle keys.

At the moment, it is still unclear if Google will bring the design change to the stable version of the app, so we will have to wait a while to know more.
