Iran on Friday declined to resume negotiations on its nuclear programme with the United States if President Donald Trump continues to implement his “maximum pressure” campaign against it.

Trump wrote to Iran on Friday, asking Tehran's leadership to come to the negotiating table or face a military attack. “I've written them a letter, saying I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for them,” he told Fox Business.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told AFP that his country will remain in contact with other negotiators under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement, but not the US when Trump persists in ratcheting economic sanctions on his country.

“We will not enter any direct negotiations with the US so long as they continue their maximum pressure policy and their threats, but it doesn't mean we will not negotiate with other parties; we are talking with the three European countries, we are negotiating with Russia and China, other members of the JCPOA, and these talks can continue, and I think we can reach a result from this path too,” Araghchi said.

“As long as the US government continues its pressure, we will also continue our resistance,” he added.

The foreign minister said that Tehran will respond to the language of respect and dignity like in the past, but not pressure and threats. He also urged Washington to observe the conditions of a fair and just negotiation.

“We are in close consultation with Russia and China, and we are continuing our discussions with other countries that are interested. It is natural that our points of view will be conveyed by these countries to the American government,” Araghchi said.

He also brushed aside Israel's threats to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, asserting that such installations are scattered throughout the country and well protected. “The first reason is that this is a technology that we have achieved, and the technology is in the brains and cannot be bombed,” he said.

Araghchi also said that Israelis have avoided such escalation so far as they are aware of Iran's ability to respond to military attacks "very strongly and in a completely proportionate and balanced manner.

“I believe that if an attack on Iran were to take place, this attack could turn into a widespread fire in the region; not that we will do that. It is Israel's desire to involve the other countries in the region in a war. It is Israel's desire to draw America into a war. This is precisely an Israeli plan to drag America into war, and America is extremely vulnerable if it enters a war in the region. They themselves know this,” the minister said.

“I think that both Israel and America and others are fully aware of our capabilities, and therefore, if rationality prevails, even the permission for threatening Iran should not be given, let alone an actual military attack,” he added.

President Donald Trump's administration said Friday it was cutting $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University over claims the institution stood by "in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students" following anti-Israel protests.

Four government agencies announced in a statement "the immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University due to the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students."

Trump said earlier this week that he would cut funding for schools that allow "illegal protests," his latest threat to turn off the flow of federal money to the country's education system.

US campuses including Columbia's were rocked last year by student protests against Israel's war in Gaza following the October 7, 2023 attacks, which ignited accusations of anti-Semitism.

Friday's statement, issued by the US General Services Administration, said the cuts were the "first round of action" -- and that additional cancelations are expected to follow.

"Since October 7, Jewish students have faced relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-Semitic harassment on their campuses -- only to be ignored by those who are supposed to protect them," said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon.

"Universities must comply with all federal anti-discrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding," she said.

"For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer."

The university did not respond to a request for comment.

President Donald Trump raged on Truth Social against “sleazebag journalists” for their portrayal of a moment with Chief Justice John Roberts. The situation was the result of a hot mic recording of Trump speaking to Roberts in the wake of Trump’s speech to Congress Tuesday night.

The moment, caught on tape, showed Trump shaking Roberts' hand and stating, “Thank you again. Thank you again. Won’t forget it,” while patting the Chief Justice on the arm. 

Multiple media outlets reported on the interaction, leading to widespread speculation about its meaning. Many interpreted Trump’s words as an expression of gratitude for the Supreme Court’s conservative-majority ruling, which granted him broad immunity from most criminal charges, both past and future.

Late Wednesday night, responding to the reports, Trump launched an attack on the media in a Truth Social post. “Like most people, I don’t watch Fake News CNN or MSDNC, but I understand they are going ‘crazy’ asking what is it that I was thanking Justice Roberts for?” Trump lambasted MSNBC. 

“They never called my office to ask, of course, but if they had I would have told these sleazebag ‘journalists’ that I thanked him for SWEARING ME IN ON INAUGURATION DAY, AND DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB IN SO DOING! The Fake News never quits!”

Notably, Trump received a series of Supreme Court wins, including a March 2024 ruling that blocked Colorado from removing Trump from its presidential election ballot for his role on January 6 and a July decision that freed former presidents from criminal prosecution for official actions, ending a federal case against the Republican.

Trump’s critics argue that the Court, under Roberts’ leadership, has repeatedly made decisions that have benefited him politically and legally.

Writing for The Atlantic, journalist Adam Serwer summarized the sentiment, stating, “We can’t know precisely what the president meant, but Trump does have a lot to thank Roberts for.”

Pope Francis's condition remained stable but complex on Friday as he battles pneumonia in hospital, the Vatican said, a day after releasing an audio message in which the 88-year-old sounded weak and breathless.

The message broadcast to pilgrims in St Peter's Square on Thursday evening was the first time the world had heard the pope's voice since he was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14.

The Argentine pontiff has suffered several respiratory crises since his admission, most recently on Monday.

Amid increasingly lurid online speculation, fuelled by the absence of any photos of the pope, the Holy See on Thursday released a short audio message recorded that day by Francis.

"I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the Square. I accompany you from here," the pope said, sounding weak and taking laboured breaths.

"May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you."

The Argentine spoke in his native Spanish, drawing speculation he could not muster the strength to speak in Italian, which is used for official Vatican business. 

But a Vatican source insisted Francis wanted to speak in a language that would have a wider audience.

The Vatican press office said Friday the pope's status was "stable", but he was still in a "complex clinical condition" so "the prognosis remains guarded".

The pope did a bit of work and some physiotherapy, but mostly rested and prayed, including spending around 20 minutes in the little chapel which is part of the hospital's papal suite, it said.

He continues to switch between an oxygen mask at night and a cannula -- a plastic tube tucking into the nostrils -- delivering high-flow oxygen during the day.

'Good sign'

When the message was broadcast in the square in front of St Peter's Basilica, where prayers have been held every evening for the pope, applause broke out among the hundreds of pilgrims gathered there.

"We were very happy that he could speak," said John Maloney, a 76-year-old English pilgrim visiting Rome for the 2025 Jubilee holy year celebrations.

"It's a good sign that he's actually able to speak," he told AFP, adding: "He's got a long way to go so he's in the hands of God."

But for Claudia Bianchi, a 50-year-old Italian from Rome, "it struck me to hear him so tired".

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said it was Francis himself who wanted the message broadcast.

The pope's message was on the front page of many  Italian newspapers, which reported it was an attempt by the Vatican to battle disinformation about the pontiff's deterioration or even death.

They noted the weakness of his voice, with the Corriere della Sera daily describing it as "pained".

Change in communication

In a bid for greater transparency, the Vatican has been publishing an update on how the pope slept every morning, followed by a more detailed medical bulletin each evening.

It said Thursday that "in view of the stability of the clinical picture", there would be no medical bulletin on Friday evening, with the next due on Saturday.

Nonetheless, "the doctors are still maintaining a reserved prognosis", it said, meaning they will not say how they expect his condition to evolve.

On Friday morning, the Vatican provided the usual brief update, saying Francis "passed a calm night and woke up shortly after 8:00am (0700 GMT)".

During previous hospitalisations, the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics appeared on the Gemelli balcony for his weekly Sunday Angelus prayer.

But he has missed the last three, and no announcement has yet been made about whether he will make an appearance this weekend.

The pope has suffered a series of health issues in recent years, from colon surgery in 2021 to a hernia operation in 2023, but this is the longest and most serious hospitalisation of his papacy.

On February 22, he suffered a "prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis" and on February 28 had "an isolated crisis of bronchospasm" -- a tightening of the muscles that line the airways in the lungs.

On Monday March 3, Francis "experienced two episodes of acute respiratory failure, caused by a significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and consequent bronchospasm", the Vatican said.

Francis's health has regularly led to speculation, particularly among his critics, as to whether he could resign like his predecessor, Benedict XVI.

PARIS (AP) — The disposal of what Paris police called an “excessively dangerous” unexploded World War II bomb caused hours of transportation chaos Friday on rail and road networks in the French capital, including the suspension of high-speed train links with London and Brussels.

Having moved the bomb into a hole, disposal experts managed to unscrew and then destroy its fuse, “like you see in the movies,” said Christophe Pezron, who heads the Paris police laboratory that includes bomb disposal services. He said that the half-ton British-made bomb could have caused major damage had it exploded after workers inadvertently dug it up with an earthmover. 

But the police operation that made the bomb safe before it was then taken away triggered major disruption for hundreds of thousands of rail travelers and motorists. 

The bomb was dug up near train tracks north of Paris, forcing a shutdown of the rail network serving Gare du Nord, France’s busiest station. A portion of the A1 highway — a major road artery into northern Paris — and sections of the capital’s always-busy beltway were also closed while police disposal officers worked.

“We’re delighted and relieved that all this has come to an end,” Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot was able to finally declare Friday afternoon — 12 hours after the bomb-disposal police were first called — as roads reopened and rail services were progressively being restored.

The minister said that almost 500 trains had been canceled, impacting around 600,000 people at Gare du Nord that serves not only Paris’ northern suburbs and northern France, but also international destinations in the U.K., Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.




“All of the northern part of our country was paralyzed,” Tabarot said.

Eurostar, the operator of high-speed trains through the Channel Tunnel that joins England with the European continent, said that normal traffic would resume Saturday between Paris and Brussels and Paris and London, after Friday’s full day of cancellations. Hundreds of commuter, regional and high-speed train services between Paris and its suburbs and towns and cities in northern France were also canceled.

Gabrielle Cotton, a tourist from the U.S. state of Missouri, was traveling by train from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Paris, but got no further than Brussels.

“I heard the girl next to me — her parents called her and said that there was a World War II bomb found in the train station,” she said. “They told us we had to get off in Brussels.” 

Retired Parisian Michel Garrot also found himself stranded with his wife in the Belgian capital.

“There’s no solution. We’re going to call the hotel and stay one more day. And change our train ticket,” he said.

At Eurostar’s hub in London, St. Pancras International station, passengers scrambled for alternatives. Fridays are invariably busy with thousands of weekend travelers. Paris-bound passengers were advised to try taking trains to Lille in northern France, or fly.

Bride-to-be Charlotte Liddell had a bachelorette party — her own — to get to in Paris and wanted to join friends already in the French capital.

“It’s the hen do without the hen!” she said. “We’re very upset, but it’s so out of our control.”

Eurostar said that it “sincerely apologizes for the disruption and understands the inconvenience this may cause.”

Workers laboring overnight on a bridge-replacement project spotted the rust-eaten, dirt-covered bomb before dawn Friday, after it was found by an earth-moving machine at a depth of about two meters (six feet), between train tracks to the north of Gare du Nord, national rail operator SNCF said.

Bomb disposal services arrived within the hour and set up a 200-meter security perimeter, later extended to 500 meters. Pezron, the police lab director, said that the bomb could have exploded had it been struck accidentally with workers’ tools or shaken too vigorously.

Morning rush-hour travelers arriving at Gare du Nord to catch trains were greeted by bright-red signs warning of disruptions, lines of passengers seeking information and ticket exchanges, and barriers blocking access to the Eurostar terminal.

The Gare du Nord habitually hosts 700,000 travelers per day, making it the busiest rail hub in both France and Europe, the SNCF says. 

Bombs left over from the battles fought in France and its skies in both world wars are regularly unearthed, even more than a century later, although it’s rare that they cause such widespread disruption in people-packed Paris.

“It’s the fourth one we’ve found in this area since 2019,” Pezron said.

In World War II, Allied forces’ bombing raids flattened towns and cities in the Normandy region northwest of Paris, but didn’t wreak destruction on the same scale on the French capital. Still, factories, train lines and other targets in and around Paris were bombed repeatedly, killing more than 3,600 people and wounding thousands more, according to city archives.

The Interior Ministry says that since World War II’s end in 1945, disposal teams have defused 700,000 air-dropped bombs and made safe nearly 50 million mines, shells and other explosive devices.

Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has formed an unexpected bond with disgraced fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried while he’s been behind bars. In a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host asked him about his time in prison, specifically inquiring if he had made any friends and whether he had been spending time with Diddy.

During the interview with Sam, Carlson asked, “Have you made friends there? Are you hanging with Diddy? I think he's in there with you.” Grinning, Sam replied, “He is.. he's been kind. I've made some friends, it's a weird environment. It's a combination of a few other high-profile cases and a lot of alleged ex-gangsters.” He continued, “I've only seen one piece of him, which is Diddy in prison. He's been kind to people in the unit, he's been kind to me. It's kind of a soul-crushing place for the world in general and what we see are just the people that are around us on the inside rather than who we are on the outside.”

Carlson then asked Sam about what the other inmates think about being in prison with two famous personalities. Sam shared, “Some of them I think are thinking well this is sort of an opportunity to meet people they wouldn't otherwise get to meet. It makes sense from their perspective, but boy is that not how I think about prison.”

Sam also shared that he never expected to find such good chess competitors inside prison. He revealed, “They're good at chess... former armed robbers who don't speak English, and probably didn't graduate middle school, a surprising number of them are fairly good at chess. I'm not saying they're grandmasters, but I lose games to them all the time,” as reported by Daily Mail.

In the latest episode of DailyMail.com's podcast The Trial of Diddy, federal prison consultant Sam Mangel revealed that the Metropolitan Detention Center has been on lockdown since last week following a violent melee involving more than 40 individuals. Although high-profile inmates like Combs, Mangione, and Bankman-Fried were not located in the area where the incident took place, the entire Brooklyn facility has been placed on "modified operation" for at least the next month as a precaution.

Mangel told the Daily Mail, “He's locked down now, at least 23 out of 24 hours. I'm sure they allow him out at least three times a week for a shower, maybe to make a phone call, but that's about it. So he's being fed in his cell, it's a six by nine cell with a little slat for a window.”

He continued, “If he wants to exercise in his cell, he can read in his cell. There are no TV's and that's where he is and will be for the next month other than legal visits. I know my client as well as other clients. I work closely with another consultant that is actually a Mangione's consultant. They're clamoring for legal visits because it's the only time that they can get out of their cells to see people, interact with people in a more open environment.”

The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed to DailyMail.com that several inmates were involved in a fight at the Brooklyn facility on February 22. BOP spokesperson Donald Murphy shared on the outlet’s podcast, “Responding employees isolated and contained the incident and at no time was the public in danger.”

US President Donald Trump has said that he sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, regarding a potential nuclear deal.

In an interview aired on Friday by Fox Business News, President Donald Trump said he had reached out to Iran’s leadership to negotiate a nuclear deal.

“I’ve written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing,’" Trump said. 

The White House later confirmed Trump’s remarks, saying that he had sent a letter to Iranian officials proposing talks. The full interview is set to air on Sunday.

“I would rather negotiate a deal. I’m not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily," Trump added. 

“But the time is happening now. The time is coming up. Something’s going to happen one way or the other,” he said.

“I hope you’re going to negotiate because it’s going to be a lot better for Iran and I think they want to get that letter. The other alternative is we have to do something because you can’t let them have a nuclear weapon,” the US President said. 

Iran has long insisted that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. However, as tensions with the US persist over sanctions and a fragile ceasefire holds in Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, Iranian officials have increasingly hinted at the possibility of pursuing nuclear weapons.

Trump's statement was reported by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, citing the broadcast. However, there was no immediate reaction from the office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who, at 85, holds the final say on all state matters.

The Trump administration has consistently emphasised the importance of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons since his return to the White House. 

However, a recent report from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog indicated that Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium.

Dark and Dangerous Shadow of Stalking Hovers Over Growth of Women's Sport

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Emma Raducanu described being unable to see the ball through her tears after spotting a stalker at a match last month, and the image of the British tennis player taking refuge behind the umpire's chair encapsulated the darker side of women's sport.

On the eve of International Women's Day, women's sport is celebrating greater participation numbers and an unprecedented surge in popularity, but the rise of social media exposure and increased visibility have made women athletes more vulnerable than ever, experts say.

"People wanting photographs, people coming up close to (athletes), wanting to put their hands on them -- you've got a different dynamic with sports stars," safeguarding consultant Marcella Leonard told Reuters. "There's an expectation that they should be nice to the public, they should allow the public to touch them, they should allow them to get photographs. 

"That gives a stalker the permission to do what they want to do and that's a really serious issue."

Although one-in-five women in the UK will experience stalking at some point in their lives, there are no scientific studies around the stalking of athletes, Canadian forensic psychologist Sarah Coupland said in an interview with Reuters. 

Between 35% and 75% of people in the public eye such as politicians and television presenters, however, experience stalking, she added.

The 22-year-old Raducanu had not yet been born when world number one Monica Seles was stabbed in the back by a fan in a 1993 on-court attack that brought the risk of stalking starkly into the public eye.

MULTIPLE STALKING INCIDENTS

Despite it being an under-reported crime, there have been countless stalking stories since, including several in the past few months.

Last month, Michael Lewis was arrested on a felony stalking charge after he repeatedly sent threats and sexually violent messages to Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark. The 55-year-old told Clark he had been "driving around your house three times a day."

In December, 40-year-old Robert Cole Parmalee pleaded guilty to charges of stalking University of Connecticut basketball player Paige Bueckers. Parmalee had posted on social media that he was travelling to Connecticut to propose to the player and to get her expelled from the university.

Last month, a distressed Olympic 200 metres champion Gabby Thomas posted on TikTok about her frightening experiences with a group of men who had stalked her at several airports. Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee and tennis player Coco Gauff were among the athletes who replied to her post, saying they had similar experiences while travelling.

Social media gives female athletes more exposure than ever, which is a double-edged sword as it opens up the possibility for fans to develop "parasocial relationships," said Coupland. 

"You've got a person who's consuming a piece of media, and they start to form a one-way relationship," she said. "The relationship is viewed (by the fan) as mutual, even though the (athlete) has no way of knowing that the person is actually there."

BRAND EXPOSURE

Since athletes with large followings can amplify brands, sport sponsorship contracts usually require athletes to post on their social media platforms.

Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the UK-based Women in Sport charity, said sponsors and sport organizations need to stop pressuring female athletes. 

"It's just so wrong. The opposite should be true. Female athletes should be protected more and advised to do less exposing of their personal life," she told Reuters. 

"It's almost like as part of the mechanism for righting the wrongs of the past, where no investment or sponsorship were made in women's sport, women are expected to expose themselves to additional risk. It couldn't be more wrong, could it?"

The majority of stalking results in psychological harm, Coupland said. 

"Anxiety, potentially post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression, changes in functioning, ability to go to work, or in athletes' performance," she said.

Raducanu told reporters she "could barely breathe" when she spotted her stalker, who had previously approached her in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha, in the crowd at the Dubai Championships. 

It was not her first experience. Three years ago, another stalker Amrit Magar was given a five-year restraining order after he turned up at Raducanu's London house on several occasions, leaving unwanted gifts and cards and stealing personal items.

Some sport federations are ramping up their online protection of athletes. World Athletics recently offered 25 athletes year-round AI protection on their social media platforms after they were targeted by cyber bullies. 

The Premier League and Women's Super League have been monitoring players' social media accounts for several years.

Juan Valdez has signed a strategic partnership with Colombian conglomerate Grupo Trinity to accelerate outlet growth in Spain. 
 

The joint venture partners, both based in Bogotá, Colombia, will collectively invest €40m ($43m) to open 140 new stores by 2032. Expansion will include both company-operated and franchised stores.  


Juan Valdez currently operates six outlets in Spanish capital, Madrid. 


The agreement will also see Grupo Trinity distribute Juan Valdez branded packaged coffee to horeca clients, as part of a wider strategy to drive brand awareness in Spain and lay the groundwork for further retail expansion across Europe. 


“This expansion is the result of a strategic commitment shared by two Colombian companies that seek to take the Juan Valdez brand to its full potential, promoting shared values such as Colombian identity, integrity, service and diversity. This alliance is essential to strengthen our connection with European consumers and allows us to take a big step in the brand’s internationalisation strategy,” said Camila Escobar, President, Juan Valdez. 


“As Colombians, we are proud to lead the expansion in Spain of the brand that best represents Colombia in the world,” added Omar González Pardo, President, Grupo Trinity. 


Created by Colombia’s National Federation of Coffee Growers, the first Juan Valdez coffee shop opened at El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá in December 2002. The coffee chain, which takes its namesake from a fictional character designed to represent the archetypal Colombian coffee farmer, currently operates over 373 stores in Colombia alongside a further 260 across 18 international markets.  


Juan Valdez’s only other European market is Turkey, where it has opened 26 outlets since debuting in April 2022. 


Founded in 2005, Grupo Trinity operates across Colombia, Spain, Costa Rica and Canada within the hospitality, retail, manufacturing and commodity trading industries. The business group’s hospitality portfolio includes Colombian restaurant chain Ideal, Verano and The Pinta restaurant brands as well as the Home Burgers fast-food chain in Spain.  


In January 2024, Grupo Trinity acquired 1,000-store Spanish health and beauty retail chain Clarel for €42m ($45.2m) – a move it said makes it the largest Colombian investor in the country.

Donald Trump has threatened Russia with sanctions, saying both sides need to get to the negotiating table. It comes after the Kremlin and Ukraine shared very different starting points for truce talks. Watch Sky News live below - including coverage of an unscheduled Trump speech.

That's all for our coverage of the war in Ukraine for today.

If you're just checking in, here is a quick recap of the key developments over the last 24 hours.

Ukraine has to "get on the ball and get the job done", Donald Trump says as he answers questions on the war.

Russia is "bombing the hell out of Ukraine... I'm finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine," he adds.

Russia has "all the cards", he says, and says it "may be easier" to deal with Moscow, despite their position.

Asked if he believes Vladimir Putin when he says he wants peace, Trump says "yeah...  I believe him".

Donald Trump is delivering unexpected remarks in the Oval Office.

You can watch it live in the stream above.

Earlier this afternoon we held a Q&A with about Donald Trump, and many questions focused on the Ukraine war.

Correspondents David Blevins and James Matthews were answering questions from readers about the US administration.

Will the Ukraine war spread to other countries in Europe? Why is it so important for Trump to do a minerals deal before he can start peace negotiations?  Why isn't Europe striking a minerals deal with Kyiv?

If you'd like to see the answers to these questions and more, take a read here...

These pictures show damaged buildings and smouldering fires in the aftermath of Russian missile strikes in the frontline town of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region.

Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, has proposed enshrining defence spending of at least 4% of GDP in the country's constitution.

Poland currently spends a higher proportion of GDP on
defence than any other NATO member, including the United States.


It reached 4.1% of GDP last year,  according to NATO estimates, and could rise to 4.7% this year.


Donald Tusk, the prime minister, said in parliament that
spending 5% on defence seems a "necessity" and Poles have a "lot of effort" ahead of them. 

As we reported in our post at 2pm, he has announced a plan to offer military training to every adult male.

Donald Trump has threatened further sanctions against Russia.

That is based on the "fact" that Moscow is "pounding" Ukraine on the battlefield at present, he has written on Truth Social.

He is threatening banking sanctions and tariffs until a "ceasefire" and a final peace settlement are reached.

The US president wrote: "To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!"

He did not provide any details on how extra sanctions might be imposed.

In January, Washington intensified the measures it is taking against Vladimir Putin's regime by targeting Russia's oil production and exports.

These pictures show firefighters battling a blaze after a Russian air attack in Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region.

Russian forces are steadily advancing on the region and have been slowly capturing village after village over the last few months.

The Polish government is drawing up plans to offer military training to every adult male.

Donald Tusk, the country's prime minister, told the lower house of parliament the idea is to create a reserve force "adequate to possible threats".

Poland is on NATO's eastern flank and shares a border with Ukraine.

Concerns have become heightened after President Trump stopped providing Kyiv with military support and intelligence.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy needs to acknowledge security guarantees for Ukraine will be provided by Europe, the US treasury secretary has said.

Scott Bessent told CNBC the situation regarding any peace deal over Russia's war in Ukraine is fluid.

Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK will "step up" to provide security guarantees for Ukraine, but said it would "need the US to be working with us".

Canada has blocked imports from the biggest U.S. pork processing plant, a facility run by Smithfield Foods in Tar Heel, North Carolina, the company said on Friday.

The suspension comes as Washington and Ottawa have sparred in a heated dispute over trade tariffs.

It is the latest blow for America’s farm sector, which has been roiled by concerns that U.S. tariffs will spark retaliation from top importers that reduces demand for American agricultural products.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the suspension was in line with standard protocols and unrelated to recent trade activity. The agency and Smithfield, the largest U.S. pork processor, did not specify what triggered Canada’s action.

“Under Canada’s policy, three noncompliance issues within six months trigger a temporary suspension,” USDA said.

Blocking shipments from the plant limits a market for U.S. pork products.

USDA is working with Smithfield to address the issues and develop a corrective action plan that will be communicated to Canadian authorities, according to an agency statement.

“Once reviewed and accepted, Canada may consider reinstating the plant’s export eligibility,” USDA said.

Canada halted imports from the facility on Thursday, according to a USDA website.

“The issue pertains to a limited number of certain offal shipments,” Smithfield spokesman Jim Monroe said.

Smithfield shares were nearly flat on Friday.

U.S. President Donald Trump exempted goods from Canada and Mexico on Thursday under a North American trade pact for a month from the 25% tariffs he imposed earlier this week.

Canada was the fifth-largest export market for U.S. pork last year, according to U.S. government data. Though shipments slipped, they were valued at about $850 million.

U.S. pork has a significant presence in the Canadian retail and foodservice sectors, said Joe Schuele, spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation, an industry group.

Smithfield, whose brands include Eckrich and Nathan’s Famous, returned to a U.S. exchange in January after more than a decade, in a spinoff by Hong Kong-based WH Group 0288.HK.

In a speech before the United Nation’s General Assembly, a representative of President Donald Trump ’s administration rejected the U.N.’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Edward Heartney, a minister-counselor at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, called the 2030 agenda “a program of soft global governance that is inconsistent with U.S. sovereignty and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans.”

Trump also said he’s “strongly considering” sanctions and tariffs on Russia in hopes of forcing a settlement to the war in Ukraine, and he sent a letter to Iran’s leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal.

In economic news, uncertainty in world markets continues after Trump declared a weeks-long delay of tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada.

Here's the latest:

Travis Keith Lang, of Irmo, was arrested on Thursday and arraigned on Friday before a federal judge in Columbia.

The 47-year-old pleaded not guilty. He is being detained pending a bond hearing scheduled for March 14. The Secret Service is investigating.

A short indictment was filed in federal court on Tuesday. It says Lang threatened to “take the life of, to kidnap, and to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States.”

Lang filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for president as a Republican in 2024. According to FEC filings, his only campaign donation was $6,000 he gave himself.

Trump denied reports that there was a clash between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk over sweeping government cuts during a Cabinet meeting at the White House this week.

“No clash, I was there,” Trump told reporters Friday afternoon.

Trump said immediately after the Thursday meeting that he instructed the Cabinet secretaries to work with Musk, the billionaire overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency’s widespread cuts to the government.

“Elon gets along great with Marco,” Trump said Friday. “And they’re both doing a fantastic job. There is no clash.”

Trump announced that he’s creating a task force to prepare for the World Cup, which will be held in North America next year.

Soccer’s biggest tournament will have games spread across the United States, Canada and Mexico over the course of a month. It’s expected to draw millions of tourists to the continent from around the world.

Trump met Friday with officials from FIFA, the international soccer governing body.

“It’s a great honor for our country to have it,” Trump told reporters. He said he’d like to attend multiple games.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon cites what she describes as the Ivy League school’s failure to squelch antisemitism.

“Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus,” McMahon said in a statement Friday.

Columbia set up a new disciplinary committee and ramped up its own investigations of students critical of Israel, alarming free speech advocates. But Columbia’s efforts evidently didn’t go far enough.

Columbia has become the first target in Trump’s campaign to cut federal money to colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war. University officials vowed to work with the Trump administration to get the funding restored.

The 17 “sustainable development goals” included ending poverty, achieving gender equality and urgently tackling climate change.

The Trump administration now says it “rejects and denounces” them. Others included providing clean water and sanitation for all people, quality education for every child and promoting good health and economic growth.

Edward Heartney, a minister-counselor at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said these goals “advance a program of soft global governance that is inconsistent with U.S. sovereignty and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans.”

U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said all 193 member states voted unanimously to deliver on the goals, and that the U.N. is holding onto it’s guiding principles “to advance a world of peace, prosperity and dignity for all.”

Fort Liberty’s short-lived existence came to an end Friday when the nation’s largest Army installation officially returned to its former name: Fort Bragg.

Christened a century ago to honor Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, the post in North Carolina was renamed in 2023 amid a drive to remove symbols of the Confederacy from public spaces.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s order reinstating the Bragg name instead honors Army Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, a World War II paratrooper and Silver Star recipient from Maine.

A few hundred members of the military and civilians gathered under black and yellow tents outside base headquarters to watch the ceremony.

But — at least for the moment — benefits for the nation’s more than 70 million Social Security recipients should still be on track.

On its website, DOGE lists 47 Social Security field offices set for closure across the U.S. The agency says some were unused or set to shutter before Trump took office, but Democratic are warning that constituents could suffer.

Earlier this week, a person familiar with the agency’s plans but not authorized to speak about them publicly said that the Social Security Administration was preparing to lay off at least 7,000 people from its workforce of 60,000.

Musk and Trump seem to differ a bit on the agency’s future: Musk has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme,” while Trump has said benefits “won’t be touched.”

Gina McCarthy, a former White House climate adviser and EPA administrator, is taking aim at President Trump for signing an executive order banning paper straws.

McCarthy, who served in two Democratic administrations, wrote in a sarcastic essay in McSweeney’s that only a man of Trump’s “stature, extraordinary power, intellect, sensitivity and unwavering focus on the needs of the American people” would find time to address the “insidious” issue of the “continued forced sucking of paper straws.”

Trump’s order will allow Americans to “fully embrace our patriotic duty to Make America Suck Again by ensuring that only plastic straws remain accessible in our towns, cities, states, businesses — and most importantly our schools,” she wrote.

Acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said in a note to staff that Noem’s treatment of transportation security officers aligns with a vision that aims at “maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.”

“By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,” Stahl wrote.

Breaking the contract, Stahl wrote, aims at “ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.”

Stahl said the agency “will establish alternative procedures” to address employee concerns and grievances “in a fair and transparent manner.”

The American Federation of Government Employees represents roughly 47,000 transportation security officers whose collective bargaining agreement is being unilaterally revoked by the Trump administration.

These workers are responsible for making sure every day that hundreds of thousands of passengers in airports nationwide don’t carry weapons or explosives.

The union said Noem is violating their right to collective bargaining and that the Trump administration “completely fabricated” its reasons for ending their union protections.

The AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal workers and has been pushing back on many of the administration’s cuts.

“Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action,” the union said.

President Donald Trump said Friday he plans to impose what he’s calling “reciprocal” tariffs on lumber and dairy imports from Canada as soon as later in the day or early next week.

Trump said the tax on these products would match Canada’s tariff rates in a possible escalation of a trade war that Trump started by imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada.

“They’ll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it, and that’s what reciprocal means,” Trump said. “And we may do it as early as today, or we’ll wait till Monday or Tuesday, but that’s what we’re going to do.”

In his first statement since the board at the Virginia Military Institute voted against renewing his contract, retired Army Maj. Gen. Cedric T. Wins said the decision was “a partisan choice that abandons the values of honor, integrity, and excellence upon which VMI was built.”

“Unfortunately, the winds of resistance by the few have drowned out those who desire to bring the institute into the 21st Century,” wrote Wins, a 1985 graduate of the 189-year-old public college in the Shenandoah Valley that educated Gens. George Patton and George Marshall.

Schools and colleges across the U.S. have been rolling back diversity programs after President Trump threatened to pull federal funding.

The guidance, issued this week, escalates the role that Elon Musk’s efficiency group, known as DOGE, will play at the Environmental Protection Agency.

“Any assistance agreement, contract or interagency agreement transaction (valued at) $50,000 or greater must receive approval from an EPA DOGE team member,″ the EPA guidance says, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press.

To facilitate the DOGE team review, EPA staff members have been directed to submit a daily one-page explanation of each funding action between 3 and 6 p.m. Eastern time. Other relevant forms also must be completed.

Trump spoke to reporters after sending a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, seeking a new deal to restrain Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program.

“Hopefully we can have a peace deal,” said Trump, who previously suggested the other option might involve the U.S. getting involved militarily in Iran.

“I’m not speaking out of strength or weakness. I’m just saying I’d rather see a peace deal than the other. But the other will solve the problem,” Trump said.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown is leading a coalition of attorneys general in a federal lawsuit filed late Thursday. They want the firings to stop and the workers to get their jobs back.

It says the mass firings of probationary employees is illegal, and will cause irreparable burdens and expenses on the states, which will lose tax revenue even as they support the workers’ rights to unemployment assistance.

Thousands of federal employees have been fired in Trump’s dramatic downsizing of the federal government. The lawsuit says the administration’s blanket claims of unsatisfactory performance are false, and that laws and regulations governing large-scale reductions in force must be followed.

The U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency cited “the Administration’s directive on support to Ukraine,” without elaborating.

The satellite imagery provider Maxar Technologies confirmed the U.S. decision to “temporarily suspend” the program. The loss of access was first reported by a Ukrainian website associated with its military, Militarnyi.

Western air-defense systems are crucial for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. Ukraine has used Maxar’s images to plan attacks, see the results of their strikes and monitor the movement of Russian forces.

U.S. help is now uncertain under President Donald Trump, who held a tempestuous televised — White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump is planning to sign an executive order taking aim at a program that forgives student loans for people in public service careers.

White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf said the order aims to ensure people working for nonprofit organizations engaged in “improper activities,” such as illegal immigration, can’t have their loans forgiven.

It appears to be an attempt to target organizations working on causes Trump opposes.

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program allows people working for government or nonprofits to apply for the remainder of their loan to be wiped out after making 10 years of payments. It was created by Congress, so it’s unclear whether the Trump administration has authority to modify it.

A new Pentagon memo also says the cards now have a $1 limit.

Exemptions include travel “in direct support of military operations or a permanent change of station,” and the memo says senior leaders can issue additional guidance on what that covers.

The memo says any non-exempt worker now traveling must return “as soon as feasible.” Civilian employees also must cancel all future official travel reservations for anything that does not meet the exemption rules.

The credit card freeze is meant to comply with Trump’s DOGE mandate to cut costs as described in an executive order last week.

The State Department issued a broad exception to the order, and has not implemented the freeze.

The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, a centerpiece of Biden administration policy that cleared Congress with support from Republicans, was meant to make U.S. manufacturing more competitive with China and overseas producers.

Trump has since hailed foreign investment in U.S. chip production that began under Biden. But he insisted the legislation itself should be repealed “because it’s hundreds of billions of dollars and it’s just a waste of money.”

Trump talked up Friday’s jobs report that showed employers created 151,000 jobs last month, downplaying the possibility that tariffs or mass layoffs of federal workers would harm the economy.

“We’re here for just a little over four weeks and these are fantastic numbers,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday.

Trump said his policies will create “a little bit of a disturbance” but will ultimately be beneficial.

“I think the labor market’s going to be fantastic but it’s going to have high paying manufacturing jobs,” Trump said.

The Trump administration is welcoming initial positive steps by the interim Syrian authorities and the global chemical weapons watchdog to address all remaining issues about ousted president Bashar Assad’s chemical weapons program.

U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea told the U.N. Security Council Friday that there is “a historic opportunity” to secure, declare and destroy any remaining chemical weapons under international verification.

Compliance is imperative, she said, “to ensure that any remaining elements do not end up in the wrong hands.”

Syria’s new rulers say they’re committed to destroying any remnants of Assad’s chemical weapons program, but Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani called for international help to bring justice to victims of Syrian chemical attacks.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright held a pep rally for expansion plans at a massive liquefied natural gas facility in Louisiana.

Venture Global estimated that its $18 billion LNG expansion would enable exports of up to 20 million tons a year to Asia and Europe and generate 8.5 million tons of planet-warming emissions.

There’s strong local opposition. Watchdogs say Venture Global violated its permits thousands of times by flaring gas and releasing chemicals. Former Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm warned that “unfettered exports” could drive up gas prices for U.S. consumers.

But Burgum told reporters Thursday: “We can absolutely do both — we can sell energy to our friends and allies, we can lower the cost at home.”

As their party struggles to navigate the early days of Donald Trump’s second presidency, some Democrats are convinced their road to recovery lies in blaming Trump for the price of eggs.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects egg prices to rise 41% this year over last year’s average of $3.17 per dozen.

Democratic officials shared new internal data showing voters are most worried about inflation and the cost of living. Democracy itself, by contrast, ranked No. 12. The party establishment’s focus on blaming Trump for inflation is a break with activists trying to mobilize against what they see as an existential threat — that Trump is a budding dictator has no regard for the Constitution.

Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who helped coordinate nationwide protests that put House Republicans on defense, said “bored, tired talking points” won’t stop authoritarianism: “It’s 2025 — this isn’t how politics works anymore.”

In a major attack on worker rights, the Department of Homeland Security says it’s ending the collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of frontline employees at the Transportation Security Administration who are responsible for keeping weapons and explosives off airplanes and protecting air travel.

The department’s announcement Friday says poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job, and that the contract was hindering the ability of the organization “to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe.”

The director of the White House National Economic Council is cheering Friday’s report: U.S. employers added solid 151,000 jobs last month.

Kevin Hassett said that’s “really, really impressive” while noting that the mass federal firings Trump has championed likely won’t be reflected in jobs figures until next month or later.

Hassett acknowledged that the Biden administration had “some strong jobs numbers” too, but asserted that they were based on government employment, while Trump has promoted manufacturing and the private sector.

The report came in below the 160,000 jobs economists had expected for last month. Unemployment also rose slightly, to 4.1%.

A separate court order out of New York still puts limits on what Elon Musk ’s team can do inside the Treasury Department’s systems, however.

In Washington, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly previously restricted DOGE to two employees with read-only access. She declined Friday to grant a longer-term block, however. Her decision comes in a lawsuit filed by retirees and unions who fear DOGE’s activities could expose sensitive information.

Kollar-Kotelly found that concerns about DOGE are “understandable and no doubt widely shared,” but she hasn’t yet seen evidence of serious legal harm that would justify barring the team. She invited plaintiffs to return if more immediate risks emerge.

A labor union says 85 immigration courts employees have accepted Trump’s financial incentives to resign.

They include 18 judges, one assistant chief immigration judge and 66 support staff in a court system that typically takes years to decide each asylum claim.

Shortly after Trump took office in January, the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review fired 20 judges without explanation, according to the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers.

“This makes no sense,” said Matt Biggs, the union president. “Immigration judges are hard to replace given their specialized knowledge and legal experience. It takes at least a year to recruit, hire, train and conduct a background check on a new judge.”

Trump said he is “strongly considering” sanctions and tariffs on Russia in hopes of forcing a settlement to the war in Ukraine.

He said in a post on Truth Social that they could remain in place “until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.”

The post came as Trump faces criticism for increasing pressure on Ukraine to reach a deal while downplaying or even denying Russia’s responsibility for starting the war with its invasion three years ago.

“To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,” Trump added.

Scrambling to replace their health insurance and to find new work, some laid-off federal workers are running into another unexpected unpleasantry: Relatives cheering their firing.

The country’s bitterly tribal politics are spilling into text chains, social media posts and heated conversations as Americans absorb the reality of the government’s cost-cutting measures. Expecting sympathy, some axed workers are finding family and friends who instead are steadfast in their support of what they see as a bloated government’s waste.

“I’ve been treated as a public enemy by the government and now it’s bleeding into my own family,” says 24-year-old Luke Tobin, who was fired last month from his job as a technician with the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho’s Nez Perce National Forest.

Trump’s comments about the letter to Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei were not immediately confirmed by the supreme leader.

Trump made the comments in an interview aired Friday by Fox Business News.

The White House confirmed Trump’s comments, saying he sent a letter to Iran’s leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal. Trump made the comments in an interview that will air fully Sunday.

Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported on Trump’s comments, citing the broadcast. However, there was no immediate word from the office of the 85-year-old Khamenei, who has final say over all matters of state.

After European leaders committed Thursday to freeing up hundreds of billions of euros for security, Trump said he was “not so sure” that the military alliance would come to the United States’ defense if the country were attacked.

Here’s a look at how some EU leaders responded:

1. “We are loyal and faithful allies,” French President Emmanuel Macron said late Thursday, expressing “respect and friendship” toward U.S. leaders and adding that France was “entitled to expect the same.”

2. Māris Riekstins, Latvia’s ambassador to NATO, stressed the military alliance remained the most important platform for addressing transatlantic security issues. He emphasized the commitment from his country — which shares a nearly 300-kilometer (186-mile) border with Russia — to defense spending.

3. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would raise defense spending to reach NATO’s target faster than previously committed. But he did not specify when the eurozone’s fourth-largest economy — and NATO laggard — would hit the 2% of GDP military spending target.

WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it’s important for U.S. trade partners not to panic and engage in tit-for-tat measures but to embrace dialogue in reaction to Trump’s threats in recent days to impose tariffs.

Okonjo-Iweala preferred to describe the threats and reversals as “disruptions.”

“I think we need to listen to the United States and listen to what their concerns are, and say, ‘how can we also help them deal with their concerns,’” she said, speaking during a discussion alongside former German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the WTO headquarters in Geneva.

Wall Street is poised to open with gains Friday after another U.S. pivot on tariffs kicked off the third market sell-off in four days.

Futures for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2%. Nasdaq futures rose 0.4%.

However, the high growth, tech heavy Nasdaq tumbled 4% into correction territory this week. The S&P shed. 3.6% over the last four days and closed at its lowest point since early November on Thursday. The Dow has slid about 2.9% since Monday.

The U.S. on Friday releases February employment numbers, which will show how many workers U.S. employers hired. Economists believe hiring accelerated last month.

Canada’s initial retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. will remain in place despite Trump postponing 25% tariffs on many imports from Canada for a month, two senior Canadian government officials said.

Two senior Canadian governments official told the Associated Press that Canada’s first wave of response tariffs will remain. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

Canada’s initial $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) worth of retaliatory tariffs have been applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products.

References to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan and the first women to pass Marine infantry training are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the Defense Department works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, according to a database obtained by The Associated Press.

The database, which was confirmed by U.S. officials and published by AP, includes more than 26,000 images that have been flagged for removal across every military branch. But the eventual total could be much higher.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks.

Billionaire Elon Musk is telling Republican lawmakers that he is not to blame for the firings of thousands of federal workers, including veterans, as pushes to downsize the government. Instead, he said in private talks this week that those decisions are left to the various federal agencies.

The message from one of Trump’s most influential advisers came as Republicans publicly support Musk’s work at the Department of Government Efficiency digging up waste, fraud and abuse, but are privately raising questions as personnel cuts ripple through communities across the nation.

It’s a remarkable shift of emphasis away from the chainsaw-wielding tech entrepreneur whose vast power has made him an admired, revered and deeply feared figure in the second Trump administration.

European Union leaders on Thursday committed to bolstering the continent’s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security after Trump’s repeated warnings that he would cut them adrift to face the threat of Russia alone.

With the growing conviction that they will now have to fend for themselves, countries that have faltered on defense spending for decades held emergency talks in Brussels to explore new ways to beef up their security and ensure future protection for Ukraine.

The resulting pledge underscored a sea change in geopolitics spurred on by Trump, who has undermined 80 years of cooperation based on the understanding that the U.S. would help protect European nations following World War II.

The order, issued Thursday, impacts nearly $2 billion in debts to partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department, giving the Trump administration a Monday deadline to repay the nonprofit groups and businesses in a lawsuit over the administration’s abrupt shutdown of foreign assistance funding.

U.S. District Judge Amir Ali described the partial payment as a “concrete” first step he wanted to see from the administration, which is fighting multiple lawsuits seeking to roll back the administration’s dismantling of USAID and a six-week freeze on USAID funding.

The ruling came a day after a divided Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s bid to freeze funding that flowed through USAID. The high court instructed Ali to clarify what the government must do to comply with his earlier order requiring the quick release of funds for work that had already been done.

Ali’s line of questioning in a four-hour hearing Thursday suggested skepticism of the Trump administration’s argument that presidents have wide authority to override congressional decisions on spending when it comes to foreign policy.

President Donald Trump on Thursday postponed 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war.

The White House insists its tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl, but the taxes proposed by Trump have caused a gaping wound in the decades-old North American trade partnership. Trump’s tariff plans have also caused the stock market to sink and alarmed U.S. consumers.

In addition to his claims about fentanyl, Trump has insisted that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit. He emphasized while speaking in the Oval Office that he still plans to impose “reciprocal” tariffs starting on April 2.

“Most of the tariffs go on April the second,” Trump said before signing the orders. “Right now, we have some temporary ones and small ones, relatively small, although it’s a lot of money having to do with Mexico and Canada.”

Country music singer-songwriter Ingrid Andress broke her silence for the first time on Thursday, nearly a year after she admitted herself to rehab following her admission that she had been "drunk" during her controversial national anthem performance at the 2024 MLB Home Run Derby.

Andress, 33, appeared on "The Viall Files" podcast this week to discuss the fallout from her performance and what transpired just before she took the field at Globe Life Field in Arlington in mid-July.

"That day started as a very – what seemed like a normal day," Andress recalled. "At that point, like that day, I knew that I was drinking, but I was really loving the numbing feeling that I was having, and so I just didn’t stop."

The four-time Grammy nominee explained that a recent split with her first manager and a breakup had prompted her to begin drinking excessively in the months leading up to her performance. She admitted that in her state at the time, she had been unaware of the crowd and fan reaction at home and had believed that she had "kind of nailed it." 

"It wasn’t until I woke up the next day where I was like ‘OK, this is so unlike me. This is not OK. I need help,’" Andress said. "I didn’t realize how much the video was going viral, because I had never experienced anything like that."

Andress later admitted in a statement she shared on social media that she had been "drunk" while singing the national anthem. She said on Thursday that she had shared the statement while on plane to rehab.

INGRID ANDRESS ADMITS SHE WAS ‘DRUNK’ DURING MLB HOME RUN DERBY NATIONAL ANTHEM PERFORMANCE, CHECKS INTO REHAB​​

"I'm not gonna bulls--- y'all, I was drunk last night," her statement read. "I'm checking myself into a facility today to get the help I need. That was not me last night. I apologize to MLB, all the fans, and this country I love so much for that rendition. I'll let y'all know how rehab is, I hear it's super fun." 

Andress said on Thursday that she had received an overwhelming amount of hatred and felt like "America’s punching bag." She joked that because of the political climate at the time, she took some solace in knowing that she could at least unify people on one thing. 

"I will say, at the time, politics was really bubbling, and I just feel like there was a lot of angst in general during that time. So, if anything, I feel like – I’m fine with being America’s punching bag, because for one moment, everybody was united in the fact that that was awful. So I feel like I united America in a way."

Last month, Andress had the opportunity to redeem herself and performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" at an NHL game in Colorado. She also released a new single earlier this week. 

She said on Thursday that after her stint in rehab and time with her family at home in Colorado, she felt ready to return.

"I spent a lot of time with family, and then I was like, ‘I think it’s time to re-emerge.’"

The federal government is unveiling new support measures to mitigate the impact of the U.S. trade war on Canadian workers as fears of layoffs and economic impact grow.

The announcement came moments after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he plans to put new tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber within the coming days.

Labour Minister Steve MacKinnon announced new “temporary work-sharing measures” that will go into effect Friday, calling the trade war that Trump launched this week a moment of “maximum peril.”

A sweeping 25 per cent tariff on all Canadian goods went into effect Tuesday, before Trump announced a partial, temporary reprieve for some goods that fall under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).

Canada’s counter-tariffs on $30 billion worth of American goods also went into effect Tuesday, with provinces issuing their own suites of measures, and will remain in place until all of Trump’s tariffs are lifted.

“In this moment of maximum peril, the likes we have never seen from a friend and ally, no less, the federal government must stand tall and stand by fellow Canadians and stand by we will,” MacKinnon said during a press conference in Ottawa.

Under the “mitigation” plan announced Friday, Ottawa is expanding the existing work-sharing program to let employers cut hours while keeping workers in their jobs with income support.

This will allow employers to keep workers on their payrolls without having to resort to cutting jobs, he said.

MacKinnon said the federal government will broaden the program to include workers in for-profit and charitable sectors as well as those working in cyclical or seasonal jobs.

“We are moving ahead with these changes, despite yesterday’s pause, because businesses and workers need assurances right now,” he said, adding that measures will remain in place for as long as needed.

The work-sharing program is funded through the Employment Insurance benefits that workers and employers pay into.

The program is aimed at avoiding layoffs “when there is a temporary decrease in the normal level of business activity that is beyond the control of the employer,” according to Employment and Social Development Canada. 

Under the working-sharing agreement, all employees who participate in it must agree to cutting their normal working hours – a minimum 10 per cent reduction.

Employees must also share the available work equally while their employer recovers.

These agreements can last anywhere from six weeks to up to 26 weeks, and if needed, extended to a total of 38 weeks.

Under the changes announced Friday, MacKinnon said the maximum length of agreements will be increased to up to 76 weeks.

The work-sharing program was also used to support businesses impacted by the wildfires in Jasper last year as well as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ottawa also announced a suite of other supports for Canadian businesses and workers.

These include $5 billion in funding over two years for Export Development Canada to help Canadian exporters reach new markets and help companies navigate the economic challenges posed by the U.S. tariffs, according to a news release by the finance department.

Businesses directly impacted by the tariffs will also be able to get “favourably priced loans” to the tune of $500 million through the Business Development Bank of Canada.

In addition, the agriculture and food industry will get $1 billion in new financing through Farm Credit Canada.

“These steps underscore our government’s resolve to ensure that our businesses continue to be resilient,” said International Trade Minister Mary Ng.

She added that the federal government’s top priority is to get the “unjustified tariffs” removed.

WASHINGTON (KXXV) — According to a database obtained by The Associated Press, the Defense Department is set to delete tens of thousands of photos and online posts, including references to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, and the first women to complete Marine infantry training, as part of an effort to remove diversity, equity, and inclusion content.

The database, confirmed by U.S. officials and reported by AP, identifies more than 26,000 images flagged for removal across all military branches, though the final total may be even higher.

The vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes many posts that mention various commemorative months – such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.

However, a database review also underscores the confusion among agencies about what to remove following Trump’s order.

It should be noted that theU.S. Department of Defensestill recognizes World War II war heroes as of Friday, 7, 2025.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his new administration.

NEW YORK (AP) — Scrambling to replace their health insurance and to find new work, some laid-off federal workers are running into another unexpected unpleasantry: Relatives cheering their firing.

The country’s bitterly tribal politics are spilling into text chains, social media posts and heated conversations as Americans absorb the reality of the government’s cost-cutting measures. Expecting sympathy, some axed workers are finding family and friends who instead are steadfast in their support of what they see as a bloated government’s waste.

“I’ve been treated as a public enemy by the government and now it’s bleeding into my own family,” says 24-year-old Luke Tobin, who was fired last month from his job as a technician with the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho’s Nez Perce National Forest.

Tobin’s job loss sent him scurrying to fill prescriptions before he lost his health insurance and filling out dozens of applications to find whatever work he can, even if it’s at a fast-food restaurant. But some relatives reacting to his firing as “what has to happen to make the government great again” has been one of the worst parts of the entire ordeal.

“They can’t separate their ideology and their politics from supporting their own family and their own loved ones,” says Tobin.

Kristin Jenn got a similar response from members of her family after she learned the National Park Service ranger job she was due to start had been put on hold by the billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency hiring freeze. She thinks it’s likely the job will be eliminated altogether.




As she has expressed her disappointment over potentially losing her dream job, some members of her mostly conservative family have unfriended her on social media. Others are giving her the silent treatment. Nearly all favor such cuts even if she’s a victim of them.

“My life is disintegrating because I can’t work in my chosen field,” says Jenn, 47, from Austin, Texas. “Lump on top of that no support from family – it hits you very hard.”

The strife has extended to Jenn’s mother, a former federal employee herself. When she has criticized the administration’s actions, her mother simply says she supports the president.

“She has somehow been convinced that public servants are a parasite and unproductive even though she was a public servant,” says Jenn.

The federal job cuts are the work of DOGE, which has been tearing through agencies looking for suspected waste. No official tally of firings has been released, but the list stretches into the thousands and to nearly every part of the country. 

More layoffs are expected as DOGE continues its work.

Eric Anderson, 48, of Chicago, was still absorbing the shock of being fired from his National Park Service job as a biological science technician when he came across his aunt’s social media post celebrating the DOGE cuts. The gist, Anderson said, was, “Man, it sure is great seeing all this waste being knocked off.”

He grows angry thinking about it.

“Do you think I’m a waste?” he says, his voice rising as he recalls the post. “There are a lot of people out there that are hurting right now that are not a waste.”

Erica Stubbs, who was working as a forestry technician with the U.S. Forest Service in Boulder, Colorado, is avoiding social media after seeing hate for federal workers.

Though most people in her life have been supportive since she was fired, some have made passing comments about the necessity of eliminating jobs like hers.

“What they tell me is it’s just cutting out the waste, the excess spending — that your job’s not that important,” says 27-year-old Stubbs. “I’m not saying it’s the most important job in the world but it’s my job. It’s important to me.”

Social media is teeming with posts reveling the layoffs and urging DOGE: “Fire more!” In a fiercely divided country, many saw the cutbacks through their own political lens.

One man’s devastation, it turns out, can be another man’s delight.

Riley Rackliffe, who was working as an aquatic ecologist at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada, was buoyed that his firing led so many friends and relatives to reach out, offering to pass his resume along, call their congressman or even help with his mortgage.

Mixed with that, though, has been the vitriol.

When his firing made the local news, a Facebook posting of the story led to a storm of comments deriding him and championing the layoffs. One person called Riley, who is 36 and holds a Ph.D., a “glorified pool boy” whose job nearly anyone could do.

Even some of Rackliffe’s friends paired their expressions of consolation for Rackliffe with support for cutting jobs they contended were unnecessary government bloat.

“Hey, I’m sorry you lost your job but I think we really need to cut out some of this waste in the government,” Rackliffe said one friend texted him, saying he supported DOGE’s aims. “He basically said, ’We’ve got to do this. We’ve got to rip off the Band-Aid.”

What stings most, Rackliffe says, is the contention that people like him were lazy and worthless, collecting big paychecks for meaningless work.

“It’s really hurtful for the president to insinuate that you don’t exist or that your job consisted of sitting at home doing nothing and cashing the paycheck,” he says. “I’d like to see him sifting through spiny naiad in 120-degree weather looking for parasitic snails. He’s the one that goes golfing on the government dime. I don’t even know how to golf.”

HGTV named Lambertville, New Jersey, one of America's "most charming towns."

A New Jersey town made a nationwide list of 50 of the most “charming small towns” in America.

Lambertville, New Jersey, also known as the “Antiques Capital of New Jersey,” made the list due to its many galleries and antique shops that line the small town of 4,000 residents, according to the list from HGTV.

Founded in 1705, Lambertville is situated along the Delaware River in central New Jersey.

The town is home to many townhouses and Victorian homes, as well as a restored 19th-century train depot called Lambertville Station that now serves as a restaurant and inn.

HGTV noted that Lambertville has many “Zagat-rated restaurants and award-winning hotels and B&Bs,” making the town ideal for a weekend getaway.

Visitors looking for history can visit the James Wilson Marshall House, which is open seasonally to visitors.

For those interested in a little retail therapy, Lambertville offers shops on Bridge, Main and Union streets, as well as The People’s Store Antiques and Design Center for serious antique hunters.

Artist’s Gallery is also a draw for art collectors looking to find some lovely artwork.

The National Weather Service has lost about 10% of its staff, hitting offices prone to severe weather hardest

As deadly severe storms swept the US this week, recent Donald Trump administration staffing cuts have left key parts of weather monitoring and disaster preparedness systems severely understaffed, the Guardian has learned.

March typically signals the start of a four-month tornado season across the eastern two-thirds of the US. Last year’s tornado season was one of the most prolific on record, and this year’s tornado season is getting off to an early active start.

A multi-day tornado outbreak tore across several southern states, with significant damage reported near Ada, Oklahoma, including part of an elementary school. Dangerous storms then spread eastward into the Carolinas and the mid-Atlantic. Strong winds in Mississippi killed and injured multiple people in separate incidents.

The period of unsettled weather raised concerns internally among National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologists that the newly downsized agency could be stretched thin.

Late last week, the Trump administration directed the NWS’s parent organization, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), to terminate approximately 800 probationary employees. In addition, more than 100 deferred resignations and early retirements took effect on Friday, mostly in senior roles.

The downsizing comes as part of a radical reshaping of the US federal government, led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is seeking to slash tens of thousands of jobs and tens of billions of dollars in spending.

The NWS, which is staffed around the clock, has lost about 10% of its workforce in recent days. But current and former Noaa scientists and officials that the Guardian consulted say the NWS cuts fell haphazardly, leaving some forecast offices in a much worse staffing position than others.

Some of the hardest-hit offices were the most prone to severe weather, according to an analysis of publicly available staffing information reviewed by the Guardian. The NWS offices in Miami, Boston, Houston, Cheyenne in Wyoming and Rapid City in South Dakota have all lost more than 30% of their staffing as compared with last fall.

“At some point these cuts are going to make Noaa break,” said Tom Di Liberto, a former Noaa public affairs specialist, who lost his job last week. “I am just so mad because our ability to help other people is going to go down … This is going to hurt people.”

In addition to this week’s tornado threat, weather warnings for high winds, dust storms, wildfires and a major blizzard stretched across much of the central US this week as a tumultuous spring storm system swept the country. Over the next several days, a series of coastal storms are also expected to bring steady rains to parts of the west coast, including scorched areas across southern California where out-of-season wildfires recently destroyed thousands of homes.

Accurate and timely weather forecasts provided by the NWS not only power virtually all weather apps and television weather forecasts, they also underlie much of the US economy and help it to function efficiently.

The Trump administration’s cuts to the NWS are “likely to cause irreparable harm and have far-reaching consequences for public safety, economic well-being, and the United States’ global leadership”, according to a statement by the American Meteorological Society (AMS), a scientific organization.

The AMS statement called continued federal investment in weather forecasting “an internationally recognized and highly respected means of multiplying value and benefits to the American people”.

When asked to confirm the staffing cuts and their likely impact on routine weather forecasting operations, Noaa refused to directly comment.

“Per longstanding practice, we are not discussing internal personnel and management matters. Noaa remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation’s environmental and economic resilience,” said Noaa spokesperson Susan Buchanan. “We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission.”

The NWS has 122 offices nationwide where teams of meteorologists work three rotating shifts throughout the day. NWS staff said that, typically, two or three meteorologists are in the office during overnight hours or periods of quiet weather, but those numbers routinely double during severe weather episodes.

Safety concerns are growing as NWS offices gradually update their public-facing staffing pages after last week’s cuts and the exact nature of the staffing shortages becomes more clear.

About one-third of the approximately 40 offices whose post-layoff staffing rosters the Guardian examined throughout tornado alley and in population-dense areas of the east coast now have critical staffing shortages – insufficient to even minimally staff all three shifts while factoring in weekly time off. Those critically understaffed offices include Miami, Boston, Houston, Omaha, Wichita, Kansas City, Sioux Falls in South Dakota and Cheyenne in Wyoming.

One senior meteorologist who manages a NWS office in tornado alley said the cuts have made him feel “stressed” and has reduced the morale of his staff.

“The day to day (hour to hour) uncertainty of what’s going to happen next or what’s going to show up in your inbox is mentally exhausting,” said the meteorologist, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “Focus is still on our mission and we will do whatever it takes to deliver services to fulfill that mission.”

Some high-impact offices, such as the one in New Orleans, did not appear to lose any staff. Other offices, such as those in Wichita and Omaha, remain at critical shortages that predate Trump’s second term in office.

During times of acute severe weather, NWS offices can request that another office fulfill part or all of their duties. This happens most typically when weather service staff are forced to seek physical shelter when the storms they are forecasting affect their home office, but can also happen during periods of communication outages.

Most likely, critically understaffed offices will require their forecasters to work overtime and cancel planned leave, worsening morale and taxing meteorologists’ mental and physical health.

Some tasks, such as training and public outreach – including storm spotter training and school field trips – have already been cancelled. Weather radar systems near San Francisco and San Diego that went down shortly after last week’s staff cuts were announced took days to be repaired. At one point during this week’s severe storms, 11 weather radars were down nationwide – nearly 10% of the country’s fleet.

“These people, they’re human beings, they’re not magicians,” said Di Liberto. “The burnout is going to be intense.”

Other essential parts of federal disaster management, such as Fema and the agencies that manage public lands, have also been hamstrung by staff cuts and strict spending limits.

Researchers have recently uncovered evidence that our warming atmosphere is contributing to an eastward shift in the region where tornadoes are most likely to form, in addition to boosting the odds of extreme early season activity.

Water temperatures over the Gulf of Mexico spent much of February at record warm levels, contributing additional moisture and fuel for this week’s severe weather outbreak. The level of warmth over southern states this week is more typical of late April, around the peak of the annual tornado season.

Unlike Canada’s Trudeau, Sheinbaum has been more diplomatic while insisting on protecting Mexico’s interests. Here’s why.

As United States President Donald Trump’s sweeping 25-percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada were about to kick in on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hit back.

Even before the tariffs actually came into effect, Trudeau put out a statement, calling the tariffs “unjustified” and imposing immediate retaliatory tariffs. Then, a few hours later, on Tuesday morning, he addressed a news conference where he referred to Trump as “Donald”, called the tariffs a “very dumb thing to do”, and accused the US president of trying to cripple the Canadian economy to annex the country.

In contrast, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s first comments only came in a news conference on Tuesday. She promised to defend Mexican interests. But while announcing tit-for-tat tariffs on US imports, she said these would only come into effect on Sunday, giving it time to strike a deal with the US.

That deal came over a phone call with Trump on Thursday, during which, according to Sheinbaum’s account, the US president initially refused to budge on the tariffs. But the Mexican president persisted – and, by the end, Trump had relented.

He announced a waiver until April 2 from the tariffs on all Mexican imports covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) and used warm words for Sheinbaum. “I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum,” he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social. “Our relationship has been a very good one and we are working hard, together, on the border.”

Later, he extended that reprieve to Canada, too – but continued to target Trudeau, whom he has repeatedly mocked and made unsubstantiated claims against.

So why is Mexico’s president approaching Trump’s tariffs so differently from how Canada and Trudeau are handling them? What did she say to Trump on Thursday? How is Mexico responding to Sheinbaum’s strategy? How did we get here? And what’s at stake?

Even before he was sworn into office for a second time in January, Trump announced he would impose 25-percent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, citing concerns over border security and drug trafficking, particularly the flow of fentanyl into the US.

The US is the second-largest goods trader in the world after China, and Trump’s tariffs have rattled global markets.

These tariffs were initially scheduled to take effect on February 4, but negotiations between Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico resulted in the US postponing their imposition for a month.



In those negotiations, Trudeau and Sheinbaum agreed to boost border security to prevent drug trafficking and the entry of migrants into the US.

Trudeau appointed a “fentanyl czar” to tackle that issue. Sheinbaum deployed 10,000 additional soldiers to the US-Mexico border to help curb irregular immigration. Within Mexico, her law enforcement agencies busted fentanyl gangs, raided labs and made arrests. Last week, Mexico sent 29 drug cartel leaders to the US for prosecution.

Still, on Tuesday, Trump enacted the 25-percent tariffs, affecting a wide array of goods, before partly – and temporarily – rolling them back on Thursday. Additional tariffs were also imposed on China.

The US’s top three trading partners – Mexico, Canada and China – account for more than 35 percent of the goods that the world’s largest economy imports or exports.

Canada responded promptly and assertively to the US tariffs with retaliatory protectionist measures of its own that it had first announced on February 1.

Starting on Tuesday, Canada imposed 25-percent tariffs on $21bn worth of US goods with the threat of tariffs on another estimated $87bn if the dispute lasts.

Trudeau warned that Canada “will not back down from a fight” and tariffs would remain in place until the US tariffs are withdrawn.

Products including meats, grains, certain alcohol, clothes, footwear, motorcycles and cosmetics are just some of the US goods that will be subject to immediate tariffs, according to Canada’s Department of Finance.

Some Canadian provinces have taken steps of their own, ordering the removal of all US liquor from stores, for instance.

Trudeau, in comments on Tuesday, also seemed to back Canadians who are choosing to boycott American goods and boo the US national anthem at sporting events.

Trudeau had a call with Trump on Wednesday, but while the US president said it ended on a “somewhat ‘friendly'” note, he subsequently accused Canada of allowing fentanyl to enter the US – even though experts said only a minuscule amount of the opioid comes into the US across its northern border.

Ultimately, relief in the form of tariff exemptions on Canadian imports into the US that are covered by the USMCA only came after Trump’s call with Sheinbaum the following day.

While Trump and Trudeau have exchanged heated personal remarks in recent weeks, Sheinbaum has taken a more measured approach.

In her comments on Tuesday, Sheinbaum expressed the intention to implement “tariff and non-tariff measures” to safeguard Mexico’s interests but refrained from immediate action, suggesting she intends to exhaust all diplomatic channels first.

“What I can tell you is that this is a very definitive moment for Mexico … There is not going to be submission. Mexico is a great country, and Mexicans are brave and resistant,” she said.

If the tariffs continued, Mexico would “reach out to Canada and other nations”, Sheinbaum said. She added that Mexico may look for other trading partners besides the US and could shift trade alliances “if necessary”.

Recounting her conversation with Trump at a news conference later on Thursday, Sheinbaum said Trump initially insisted that the tariffs enforced on Tuesday would stay.

But Sheinbaum sent Trump a chart that demonstrated how seizures of fentanyl by agents along the US-Mexico border had fallen dramatically since she sent her 10,000 soldier-strong force there.

She told him their collaboration was yielding results in strengthening security along the border, and the tariffs would hurt that partnership, Sheinbaum told reporters.

The pitch worked.

On Truth Social, Trump announced that tariffs on Mexican imports covered by the USMCA would be waived until April 2, when he intends to implement reciprocal tariffs on all countries. He spoke of his respect for Sheinbaum. “Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!” he said.

The Mexican president reciprocated the gesture, with a message of her own. “Many thanks to President Donald Trump. We had an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results, within the framework of respect for our sovereignties,” she wrote on X.

At a briefing with reporters in early February, Sheinbaum offered insights into her mindset, saying that amid threats from Trump, Mexico needed to keep a “cool head”.

This cautious strategy reflects Mexico’s heavy reliance on the US as a market: More than 75 percent of Mexico’s exports go to its northern neighbour, so any dramatic disruption in that equation could bleed the country’s economy. Last year, the US imported $505.8bn in goods from Mexico and exported $334bn, resulting in a trade deficit of $171.8bn.

To be sure, Canada also needs the US for its exports: More than 70 percent of Canadian exports go to the US.

But the context of Trump’s tariffs on Mexico and Canada is quite different, Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera.

While Trump in the past has mooted the idea of bombing Mexico’s drug cartels, many of which his administration has designated as “terrorist” organisations, he has been much more direct in seeking Canada’s territory.

Trump has frequently said his northern neighbour should become the 51st US state.

And while Trump has said he respects Sheinbaum, he has repeatedly referred to Trudeau, including after their call on Wednesday, as governor rather than prime minister.

“In Canada’s case, Trudeau noted that Trump’s actions are aimed at crippling the Canadian economy to pave the way for an eventual annexation, which goes beyond a mere trade war,” Nadjibulla said, referring to Trump’s repeated threats to absorb Canada.

“It’s an existential fight for Canada’s sovereignty, so there’s a strong incentive to push back immediately and forcefully,” she said.

Commenting on the new tariffs, Trudeau on Tuesday said Trump was planning to cause the “total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us”.

“Retaliation here isn’t just about tit-for-tat tariffs. It’s about defending the country’s independence,” Nadjibulla said.

Sheinbaum also has something that Trudeau does not: Time.

Canada is fast approaching national elections, and Trudeau’s Liberal Party is playing catch-up. After trailing the opposition Conservative Party by double digits for more than a year, the country’s governing party has started to rapidly close the gap as Trudeau pushes back against Trump’s moves and the US president’s steps stoke a wave of patriotism among Canadians.

Sheinbaum, on the other hand, took office only in October and is wildly popular. In two polls in February, her approval rating was 80 percent and 85 percent.

It’s too early to say.

But on Wednesday, the Trump administration exempted auto manufacturers from the 25-percent tariffs for a month. While the sector’s supply chains are spread across North America, Mexico is the biggest beneficiary of the reprieve. Cars, trucks, other vehicles and auto parts constitute 27 percent of its exports to the US. For Canada, that figure stands at 13 percent.



Then, on Thursday, she won a reprieve on tariffs for all Mexican exports covered by the USMCA.

And Sheinbaum enjoys more than just popular support in Mexico. Her approach to Trump and his tariffs appears to have the trust of Mexican investors, too.

The IPC, the main index of the country’s stock exchange, is up 6 percent from the start of the year. By contrast, the S&P/TSX, the benchmark Canadian stock exchange index, is almost where it was at the start of the year.

Even with the temporary reprieve on Thursday, many goods exported by Mexico and Canada to the US – including Canadian oil, for instance – are not covered by the USMCA and so are subject to Trump’s tariffs. Canadian oil faces a 10 percent tariff. And on April 2, Trump plans to introduce across-the-board reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world.

With such tariffs, and the retaliatory steps taken by other countries, businesses exporting goods and services as well as consumers will pay higher prices. A potential recession in some or all three North American countries is a possibility.

 



 

But even if Trump decides to de-escalate, Nadjibulla said, “the damage to trust is already substantial.”

“We’ve seen him threaten new tariffs in April and continue to shift targets. That level of unpredictability erodes confidence among allies and trading partners,” she said.

The tariffs could also affect negotiations on renewing the USMCA, a free-trade pact that came into effect in 2020, was negotiated by Trump’s team during his first term and replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994. A review of the USMCA is due in 2026, but the tariffs could see talks take place sooner.

“How do you negotiate a stable agreement when one party is consistently changing the rules or imposing new tariffs without warning?” Nadjibulla asked.

“Even if some tariffs get lifted or eased, the bigger issue is that Canada and others now view the US as a less reliable trade partner,” she added.

BEIJING — China's top foreign policy official, Wang Yi, cast Beijing as a force for good and blasted the U.S. for being "two-faced," at a news conference during China's annual session of parliament on Friday.

Last month, the Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports to the U.S., and on Tuesday added another 10%, arguing that China needs to do more to stop the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the United States.

China has accused President Trump of using fentanyl as a pretext to threaten the country economically, and Beijing has retaliated with countertariffs and other measures.

Wang addressed the escalating trade war with the U.S. and promoted China as an "anchor" on the global stage as America retreats from international involvement. Here's what he had to say on five key issues.

Wang, who is a member of the elite Politburo and China's foreign minister, had very little positive to say about China-U.S. relations and instead offered criticisms of America's policies and exhortations for it to mend its ways.

Wang said the combination of tariffs on Chinese goods and Trump's expressions of willingness to have good relations with Beijing were incongruous.

"No country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while developing a good relationship with it on the other. Such a two-faced approach not only undermines the stability of bilateral relations but also fails to build mutual trust," he said.

On fentanyl, Wang said the problem is fundamentally the responsibility of the United States.

"In the spirit of humanitarianism, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S., and the U.S. should not repay goodwill with resentment or impose unjustified tariffs. This is not the behavior of a responsible major power," he said.

Wang said science and technology "should not be tools for building iron curtains" — a reference to a range of U.S. policies, including bans on the sale to China of the most advanced microchips.

"Wherever there is a blockade, there will be breakthroughs. Wherever there is suppression, there will be innovation," Wang said. "High walls cannot block innovative thinking. Decoupling and severed links will only isolate those who impose them."

More broadly, Wang took aim at the United States' confrontational approach to China.

"The U.S. should review what has been gained from years of tariff and trade wars. Has the trade deficit been reduced or increased? Has the competitiveness of manufacturing risen or declined? Has inflation improved or worsened? Have the lives of the people improved or deteriorated? Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations are mutual and reciprocal. Cooperation will lead to mutual benefit and win-win results, but if one side insists on pressure, China will take resolute countermeasures," he said.

Wang was asked directly whether Trump's retreat from multilateral forums, freezing of foreign aid and strained relations with allies presented a strategic opening for China on the global stage. He demurred.

"Imagine if every country prioritized itself above all else and placed blind faith in power and status — this world would regress to the law of the jungle, where smaller and weaker nations would bear the brunt of instability, and the international order and rules-based system would face severe disruption," Wang said.

He said major powers have a responsibility to fulfill their international obligations and act with accountability. "Pursuing self-interest at the expense of others, or wielding power to intimidate, is unacceptable," Wang said.

China's stability will help "anchor an uncertain world."

Trump's tilt toward Russia has raised questions about him doing a possible "reverse Nixon" — i.e., cozying up to Moscow to isolate Beijing, flipping President Richard Nixon's script from the early 1970s, when the U.S. engaged in detente with China to pressure the Soviet Union, its primary Cold War rival.

But Wang said "the historical logic" of China's good relations with Russia was steadfast.

"I want to emphasize that regardless of changes in the international landscape, the historical logic of the China-Russia friendship remains unchanged and the internal driving forces behind our relationship remain strong," Wang said.

"Both sides have deeply reflected on historical experiences and have committed to long-term, good-neighborly relations, comprehensive strategic coordination and mutually beneficial cooperation. This approach best serves the fundamental interests of both peoples and aligns with the broader trends of global development and progress. China and Russia have established a unique model of engagement — one that is nonaligned, nonconfrontational and not directed at any third party," he said.

Wang said a "mature, resilient and stable" relationship "will not change due to temporary events, nor will it be swayed by external influences. It is a constant in an uncertain world, not a variable in geopolitical competition."

China has tried to position itself as a potential mediator able to help bring the war in Ukraine to an end, but since Trump's foreign policy shift toward Russia, Beijing has been left largely on the sidelines.

"China welcomes and supports all efforts aimed at achieving peace. However, it is also important to recognize that this crisis has deep and complex historical roots — it was not created overnight, and it cannot be resolved overnight," Wang said.

He said China is willing to work with the international community "in line with the wishes of the relevant parties, to play a constructive role in achieving a lasting resolution."

"The world must move toward a new security vision based on common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. Only by doing so can we achieve lasting peace and stability — not just in Eurasia but across the entire world," he said.

Wang was unequivocal when asked about Trump's plan to boot Palestinians from Gaza and turn the territory over to the U.S. to develop.

"Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory," Wang said.

"Any attempt to forcibly change Gaza's status will not bring peace but will only trigger further turmoil. … The will of the people must not be violated, and justice cannot be ignored. If great powers truly care about the people of Gaza, they should push for a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire, increase humanitarian aid, uphold the principle of 'Palestinians governing Palestinians' and contribute to Gaza's reconstruction," he said.

Pharmaceutical giant Merck received a $30.2 million grant from the state in an effort to sway the company to build its $900 million manufacturing facility in the Wilmington area.

The taxpayer-funded grant is the highest amount that has been doled out to a company since Bloom Energy’s approval in 2011.

Merck & Co. has not confirmed whether or not it will choose Delaware as its place to expand, but business leaders in Delaware are optimistic about what the potential move could mean for the state.

Merck & Co. is a global health care company that specializes in the production and distribution of vaccines, pharmaceuticals and animal health care products.

Merck has been looking for a location to set up their newest manufacturing facility, which will produce drug substances and products with a targeted operational start date of 2030.

According to plans shared with Delaware Online/The News Journal via a Freedom of Information Act request, the company is considering constructing a $900 million multi-building complex for labs, manufacturing and distribution operations at the Chestnut Run Innovation and Science Park near Greenville.

Under the conservative estimates listed in the plans, the facility would bring roughly 375 full-time jobs to the area.

The company is reportedly still considering other locations, but is bound by nondisclosure agreements to reveal more about the other possibilities, as reported by the Delaware Business Times.

If Merck chooses the Delaware site, the company would be locked into a 20-year lease at the CRISP campus.

This wouldn’t be Merck’s first venture into the First State, however. The company already has an animal health facility in Millsboro.

The Delaware Council on Development Finance unanimously approved the grant application on Monday, Feb. 24.

The grant was divided into $4.7 million worth in job performance grants and $25.5 million in capital expenditure grants. The performance grants are dispersed after the company makes its investments into the facility and workforce.

Although nothing is promised yet, Michael Fleming, president and CEO of the Delaware Bioscience Association, remains optimistic and said that this deal could cement Delaware as a winner in the area in terms of attracting industrial and scientific investment.

“This new facility would be a tremendous boost for and validation of the growth and momentum of our dynamic life science industry,” Fleming said. “We look forward to welcoming Merck and applaud their interest in strengthening U.S. manufacturing and our supply chain right here in Delaware.

Susan Colby, senior manager of communications for the Delaware Prosperity Partnership echoed that the move would boost Delaware’s portfolio.

“This project would reinforce Delaware’s standing in the global biopharmaceutical ecosystem, and we are excited by the potential opportunities it would provide Delaware residents and businesses,” Colby said.  

As for what Merck has to say about the grant, Ned Ehrbar, associate director of Merck’s global media relations kept it vague, stating via email: Merck is considering Delaware as a potential location to develop a new commercialization and launch facility.

The CRISP campus, located at 984 Centre Road just outside of Greenville, has long been a mainstay in the state’s evolving life sciences investment.

Formerly a site for DuPont research, the 164-acre site was purchased by MRA Group in 2021 with hopes of transforming the site into the leading campus for Delaware’s life science laboratories and research facilities.

Amenities for the campus will include a hotel, childcare and fitness centers, an outdoor amphitheater and accommodations for restaurants.  

Chemical manufacturing company Solenis expanded its research and development facilities into the CRISP campus in late 2022 and precision oncology company Prelude Therapeutics cut the ribbon on their new headquarters at CRISP in February, 2024. DuPont is also leasing 190,000 square-feet of space at its former space.

Last month, the developer group broke ground on the Marriott Residence Inn, which will feature 127 rooms with both short- and long-term stay options, food services, a full-service bar, meeting spaces and outdoor patios

MRA Group declined to comment on the recently approved grant for Merck.

Awarding these grants worth tens of millions of dollars involves a process that is relatively new, with various “checks and balances” in place, but limited transparency at times.  

The Delaware Economic Development Authority was created by the General Assembly under former Gov. John Carney, intended to promote economic activity in Delaware. It is chaired by CJ Bell, the director of the Delaware Division of Small Business.

The Council on Development Finance is an advisor to the Delaware Economic Development Authority, and is responsible for conducting public hearings before the authority issues any financial support to potential projects.

The Delaware Prosperity Partnership, a nonprofit state economic development agency, often vets applications or potential investment opportunities and brings them to the Council. As previously reported by DelawareOnline, since DPP is not technically a part of the state government, it is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.

In the seven years of its existence, the Council on Development Finance has approved every Strategic Funds application that has been brought to it by the Delaware Prosperity Partnership.

The $30 million grant offered to Merck will be reimbursed after the company makes its investment – in this case, a nearly $1 billion one.

In 2021, the Council on Development Finance approved $19 million for WuXi AppTec, a Shanghai-based company that develops and manufactures drugs for pharmaceutical clients, to build its manufacturing campus near Middletown’s Amazon fulfillment center.

Gov. Matt Meyer has gone on record against these types of taxpayer-funded grants, announcing during a Delaware State Chamber of Commerce annual dinner that his administration will see “the use of cash assistance de-emphasized,” as reported by Spotlight Delaware.

Meyer’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the most recent grant funding.

The federal government is launching a more than $6-billion aid package for businesses impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and relaxing some employment insurance (EI) rules to help workers.

Steven MacKinnon, Mary Ng and Rechie Valdez — the ministers of labour, international trade and small business — made the announcement Friday afternoon.

"We have tried and tested tools to get our people through the toughest of crises and we will not hesitate to use them," MacKinnon said.

As part of the supports for businesses, the government is providing $5 billion over two years for exporters to help them find new markets beyond the U.S. and a $500-million loan program through the Business Development Bank of Canada for businesses directly impacted by the tariffs.

Ottawa is also boosting the financing program for the agricultural sector — known as Farm Credit Canada — to the tune of $1 billion.

Ottawa announces billions to support businesses, relaxes some EI rules

The government is also temporarily relaxing rules around a program that allows employees to receive partial EI benefits while working reduced hours. The government says the temporary measures will increase access to the program and lengthen the time that those benefits are typically available.

In a partial climbdown on Thursday, Trump said he is pausing tariffs on some Canadian goods until April 2, offering a reprieve from across-the-board 25 per cent tariffs.

Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Thursday that Canada would delay its second round of retaliatory tariffs, worth $125 billion, until April 2. That's when Trump's batch of "reciprocal" tariffs is due to be imposed on countries around the world. Canada has currently levied $30 billion worth of U.S. imports.

MacKinnon asked about calls for more EI changes amid U.S. tariffs 

Asked by reporters if further measures would be taken to support businesses and workers, MacKinnon said it would depend on how the situation unfolds.

"The ball seems to bounce every day. We have every intention of customizing a response to tariffs or no tariffs as the case may be. Our first duty is to make sure that these tariffs don't get imposed on Canada," he said.

MacKinnon noted has Trump employed "chaotic messaging" when trying to justify his tariffs.

"First this trade war was about securing the border and ending drug smuggling. Then it was about migration and the flow of people going south and then, puzzlingly, it was about American banks or the auto sector," he said.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump threatened to hit Canada's dairy and lumber industries with additional tariffs.

"Canada has been ripping us off for years," the president said.

Canada hardly exports any dairy products to the U.S.

Lumber, on the other hand, has been a consistent sticking point in Canada-U.S. relations for years.

The U.S. already imposes anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber, but Trump is threatening to top those with additional tariffs.

Widespread U.S. tariffs would have a devastating effect on the Canadian economy, with experts saying it would lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses and wreak havoc in key sectors such as Ontario's auto industry.

American tariffs on all steel and aluminum are still due to come into effect next week. Canada is the leading exporter of both metals to the U.S.

It's time to start thinking about planning that summer vacation so Amie Mitchell with the Better Business Bureau joined News On 6 to talk about how not to fall victim to scams when you head out.

Research thoroughly before booking:

Check companies on BBB.org, read reviews, and verify the legitimacy of vacation deals that seem too good to be true.

Be wary of “free” vacation offers:

These offers often come with hidden costs, such as mandatory sales meetings, taxes, or transportation fees. Always read the fine print carefully.

Protect your personal information:

Use secure Wi-Fi at hotels instead of free public networks and avoid sharing sensitive details with unsolicited vacation offer representatives.

Mitchell stressed that careful research and vigilance are essential for staying safe from vacation scams this summer.

Tesla (TSLA) stock fell as much as 4% on Friday, bringing its losses from a record close to nearly 50% as it continues to see its post-election rally fade.

This drop in shares of the EV carmaker prompted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives — one of the electric vehicle maker’s biggest bulls on Wall Street — to issue a forceful defense of the stock, doubling down on his bullish views during what he calls a "gut check moment for the Tesla bulls (including ourselves)."

In a note to clients published late Thursday, Ives wrote "the time has come" to defend the stock, with Ives adding Tesla to the firm's "Best Ideas List" and reiterating his Outperform rating and $550 price target on the name.

Ives's call came after Tesla stock fell 5.7% Thursday, a move that followed others on the Street saying CEO Elon Musk’s controversial association with the Trump administration was clouding sentiment on the stock.

Tesla stock closed at a record of over $479 on Dec. 17 and hit an intraday high of roughly $488 the following day. Shares were closer to $260 in midday trade on Friday and set to close at their lowest level since Nov. 5.

"There have been a number of times in the Tesla story over the past decade that negative sentiment and Street worries have overshadowed the narrative of this unique disruptive global tech story," Ives wrote.

"From the white knuckle production moments in 2017/2018 to financing worries to the Musk/Twitter soap opera in 2022 ... and now here again Tesla bulls find themselves with their back against the wall facing global negative sentiment around Musk/DOGE and the Trump Administration.

"This is a gut check moment for the Tesla bulls (including ourselves) after this massive sell-off in Tesla shares with fears mounting."

Ives holds the highest price target for Tesla among the 48 Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance. On average, Wall Street analysts have a $346 per share price target on the stock over the next 12 months. Shares closed Thursday's trading sessions at $263.

Tesla stock in February recorded its biggest decline to date.

Shares have given up nearly all of their gains that followed the election of Donald Trump. Musk became one of Trump's key surrogates on the campaign trail in the final months of the 2024 election.

In Ives's view, Musk's foray into politics puts less than 5% of Tesla's global sales at risk despite what Ives calls "the global draconian narrative for Musk."

"Importantly," Ives added, "we expect Musk will better balance his time between DOGE and Tesla/SpaceX over the course of 2025 and some of these distraction issues will fade. We continue to believe the best thing that ever happened to Musk and Tesla was Trump in the White House as this will create a deregulatory environment with a federal autonomous roadmap central to the Tesla golden strategic vision."

Ives also reaffirmed his view that Tesla’s autonomous driving efforts outweigh near-term demand concerns for its EVs and said that they, along with the company's push into robotics, could put the company north of $2 trillion in value.

            A day after offering Canada a one-month reprieve on punishing, virtually across-the-board 25% tariffs, President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs as soon as Friday on Canadian lumber and dairy products. It’s yet another twist in a serpentine trade policy that seems to shift on an hourly basis.
    


            “Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,” Trump said in an Oval Office address Friday, citing Canada’s roughly 250% tariff on US dairy exports to the country. Trump said America would match those tariffs dollar-for-dollar.
    


            “We may do it as early as today, or we’ll wait until Monday or Tuesday,” Trump said. “We’re going to charge the same thing. It’s not fair. It never has been fair, and they’ve treated our farmers badly.”
    


            Trump’s announcement gave investors, businesses and consumers another strong dose of whiplash. Just one day earlier, on Thursday, Trump announced a one-month pause on all tariffs on Canada and Mexico on products that comply with the US-Mexico-Canada free trade treaty, known as the USMCA. That had, at least temporarily, given many industries, especially autos and agriculture, a major sigh of relief.
    


            On Friday Trump said more “changes and adjustments” on tariffs should be expected in the future.
    


            “There’ll always be some modifications,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “If you have a wall in front of you, sometimes you have to go around the wall instead of through it.”
    


            Stocks, which were lower to start the day after a mixed bag of a jobs report, initially fell after Trump’s tariff threat but pared their losses. The Dow was up about 45 points, or 0.1%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down another 0.1% after falling into correction territory Thursday — a 10% decline from its most recent high.
    


            “The market is having trouble digesting the multidimensional chess that Trump and his team are playing,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. “This multidimensional chess game is not going well for the grand master. There may be a method to the madness. He might be trying to confuse world leaders. But the market is saying stop confusing us. we don’t like this.”
    


            Trump’s threat on Friday added more uncertainty into an economy that has shown cracks in its foundation and could be in danger of slipping if businesses and consumers grow nervous about the administration’s economic policy. Layoffs are mounting, hiring is slowing, consumer confidence is eroding and inflation is picking up again.
    


            Tariffs could worsen all of those factors.
    


            Canada charges exorbitant tariffs on certain dairy products, including a 241% tariff on milk, much to the consternation of America’s dairy farmers, who have complained for years that the border nation is treating them unfairly.
    


            In 2023, a trade dispute panel ruled in favor of Canada, arguing that the high import taxes did not violate the USMCA. Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin lambasted the decision, arguing it was creating an undue burden on her state’s dairy industry.
    


            “Wisconsin dairy farmers work hard every day to bring world class products to market, and they deserve a level playing field with their global competitors,” Baldwin said in the wake of the November 2023 decision. “This decision flies in the face of the agreement our country made with Canada and puts our Made in Wisconsin dairy products at a disadvantage.”
    


            But Trump, who frequently complained about high dairy tariffs in his first term in office, did not negotiate more reasonable tariffs into the USMCA treaty, which he signed.
    


            Despite the grievances and the alarmingly high number, Canadian dairy is not a significant export, and a reciprocal 241% tariff on milk is unlikely to do significant economic damage to either country.
    


            Trump has been criticizing Canadian tariffs on US lumber for several weeks, claiming America should respond in kind. He has claimed America can do without Canadian lumber.
    


            An executive order Trump signed Saturday said America has an “abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs.” It’s not quite that simple, industry experts argue: They warn tariffs could end up increasing lumber and building costs — and even push up housing prices for consumers.
    


            The United States has 300 billion trees, but economists and homebuilders caution that America does not currently have the industrial capacity to meet the demand and that placing a significant tariff on Canadian lumber imports could further exacerbate the ongoing housing affordability crisis.
    


            Lumber is a critical ingredient in the US homebuilding industry, and the United states sources about 30% of the softwood lumber it uses annually from Canada. Lumber imports from Canada are already subject to countervailing and anti-dumping duties of 14.5%.

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin discusses how DOGE exposed the wasteful spending on a vacant migrant shelter on ‘The Bottom Line.’

EXCLUSIVE: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says it is ending collective bargaining for Transportation Security Officers with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). 

In a release obtained exclusively by FOX Business, DHS said the TSA has more people doing "full-time union work" rather than performing screening functions at 86% of U.S. airports. 

This means that out of 432 federalized airports, 374 airports have fewer than 200 TSA Officers to perform screening functions. These officers are paid by the government but work "full-time on union matters" and do not retain certification to perform screening functions, DHS said. 

MASSIVE POWER OUTAGE AT BWI AIRPORT IMPACTS THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS WITH EXTENSIVE DELAYS

The department cited a recent TSA employee survey which found that more than 60% of "poor performers" are allowed to stay employed and "not surprisingly, continue to not perform."   

DHS said these circumstances have impeded TSA’s chief responsibility "to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe."  

DHS argued that eliminating collective bargaining will make airports more efficient by removing "bureaucratic hurdles that will enhance productivity, and lower passengers' wait times in security lines."

DHS said Transportation Security Officers will now be promoted based on their performance, not longevity or union membership. 

"Thanks to [DHS] Secretary Noem’s action, Transportation Security Officers will no longer lose their hard-earned dollars to a union that does not represent them. The Trump Administration is committed to returning to merit-based hiring and firing policies," a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.

"This action will ensure Americans will have a more effective and modernized [workforce] across the nation’s transportation networks—meaning shorter airport security wait times. TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans."  

The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents TSOs, has pushed back on DHS' claims, saying TSOs who volunteer as union representatives account for less than half a percent of all work hours performed at TSA, with fewer union representatives nationwide at TSA than the number of total screeners at 86% of individual federal airports. 

"47,000 Transportation Security Officers show up at over 400 airports across the country every single day to make sure our skies are safe for air travel. Many of them are veterans who went from serving their country in the armed forces to wearing a second uniform protecting the homeland and ensuring another terrorist attack like Sept. 11 never happens again," AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement, characterizing Friday's announcement as an "unprovoked attack" by DHS Secretary Noem and the Trump administration.

"They gave as a justification a completely fabricated claim about union officials – making clear this action has nothing to do with efficiency, safety, or homeland security. This is merely a pretext for attacking the rights of regular working Americans across the country because they happen to belong to a union," Kelley said. "Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion. Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action."

PostNord will stop delivering letters to Denmark at the end of 2025, though package distribution will remain

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- No more mail for Denmark: PostNord will stop delivering letters to the Nordic nation at the end of 2025, though package distribution will remain.

PostNord, a state-run agency that services Denmark and Sweden, announced the change Thursday. Roughly 1,500 mailboxes throughout Denmark will be taken down in the second half of the year, and Danes can seek refunds for stamps. An estimated 1,500 of PostNord’s 4,600 employees will be laid off this year.

Sweden’s letter delivery will not be affected, the agency said.

PostNord said the number of letters in Denmark has decreased by 90% since 2000, and by more than 30% in 2024 compared with the year before. The agency blamed an increasingly digital atmosphere in Denmark and worldwide, and 2024 Danish legislation that drove the cost of postage up.

“We have been the Danes' postal service for 400 years and therefore it is a difficult decision to put a bow on that part of our story," PostNord Denmark chief executive Kim Pedersen said in a news release. "The Danes have become more and more digital which means that there are very few letters left for us to handle today, and the downturn continues so clearly that the market for letters is no longer profitable.”

Pedersen said the heart of PostNord's business is parcel delivery, which it will focus on in 2026.

Pelle Dragsted, a member of the Danish parliament, wrote on social platform X that the cessation of letter delivery will unfairly affect Danes who live in remote areas.

Letters can still be sent through private companies, Danish public broadcaster DR reported. The state will ensure that infrastructure remains for mail to be delivered to Denmark’s remote areas, including smaller island communities.

Pedersen also told DR that people can send their letters as packages through PostNord’s parcel shops.

Germany's Deutsche Post also announced layoffs on Thursday, with plans to cut 8,000 jobs

Company receiving $7.5 million in loan proceeds from Oaktree in advance of the recapitalization; will receive additional capital at the closing of the recapitalization transaction; and announces delisting from the NYSE


NORTHBROOK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pinstripes Holdings, Inc. (“Pinstripes” or the “Company”) (OTC: PNST), a best-in-class experiential dining and entertainment brand combining bistro, bowling, bocce and private event space, today announced that it has entered into a binding letter of intent (the “LOI”) with funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”), an affiliate of the holders of the majority of its outstanding debt. Under the terms of the LOI, Oaktree is providing additional funding on similar loan terms to their prior commitments, and upon closing of the recapitalization transactions contemplated by the LOI will become the majority equity holder of the Company and will elect the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), with current stockholders retaining an equity interest and additionally being issued warrants providing for potential upside participation. The Company’s entry into the LOI follows extensive negotiations with Oaktree as the Company sought to maximize value for all of its stakeholders. Once completed, the recapitalization will reduce Pinstripes’ cash interest obligations, provide additional liquidity for operations and financial flexibility, and better position the Company for long-term success and new store development. Notably, the issuance of warrants to existing stockholders as contemplated by the LOI may enable such stockholders to potentially benefit from growth in the Company’s value should the business successfully implement its plan. The LOI has been approved by the Company’s Board upon the recommendation of a special committee of the Board consisting solely of independent, disinterested directors (the “Special Committee”).





"We are pleased to announce these transactions, which strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility for the benefit of the Company and its key stakeholders – investors, customers, vendors, and team members," said Dale Schwartz, Founder/CEO of Pinstripes. "The last year has proven challenging, and I am grateful for the dedication and hard work of our Pinstripes Team Members. Collectively, this announcement represents an important step in the revitalization of Pinstripes’ existing business, and demonstrates the confidence that investors have in our long-term success. We are appreciative of the support we have received from our lenders – Oaktree, Silverview and Granite Creek – and look forward to taking the further steps to improve Pinstripes' business and create substantial value for all our stakeholders.”



Oaktree, a leading alternative investment firm with $202 billion in assets under management, has committed to provide an incremental investment to strengthen Pinstripes’ balance sheet and support its leadership team’s strategic vision.



The closing of the recapitalization transaction contemplated by the LOI is subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive documentation and the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions to closing. Further details of the LOI and the recapitalization transaction are set forth in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).



Additionally, on March 5, 2025, the NYSE notified the Company and publicly disclosed that it has determined to commence proceedings to delist the Company’s class A common stock, as a result of the Company’s non-compliance with Rule 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual that requires listed companies to maintain an average global market capitalization of at least $15 million over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. Trading of the class A common stock on the NYSE was suspended after market close on March 5, 2025. The NYSE will apply to the SEC to delist the class A common stock upon completion of all applicable procedures. The Company has informed the NYSE that it will not appeal the delisting determination and accordingly, the Company’s class A common stock will be delisted from the NYSE. The Company's class A common stock is now trading on the OTC Pink Market operated by the OTC Market Group Inc., and the Company has not yet made any determination with respect to suspending its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP is serving as legal advisor and Piper Sandler & Co is serving as investment banker and financial advisor to Pinstripes, and Ropes & Gray LLP is serving as legal advisor to the Pinstripes Special Committee. White & Case LLP is serving as legal advisor to Oaktree.

The agreement will see Smith continue to lead 'First Take,' while freeing him up to pursue other options outside of sports.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


ESPN‘s superstar commentator Stephen A. Smith has inked a new long-term deal with the sports media giant.


	The deal, which could top nine figures per The Athletic, will see Smith continue to lead First Take, his flagship weekday show. He will also appear on other ESPN programming.




	However it also allows Smith to pursue other deals for programming that touches politics, culture, or other topics.


	“I’m happy and honored to remain a member of the Disney/ESPN family for, at least, the next five years,” Smith said. “There’s only bigger and bigger things ahead. It starts with continuing to put in that work. See y’all soon.”

	“Stephen A. works incredibly hard to elevate the sports conversation day-in and day-out and we are grateful he will remain at ESPN,” added Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN Chairman. “He is a difference maker, and fans are captivated by his deep sports knowledge, strong opinions and unmistakable flair.”


	When The Hollywood Reporter spoke to Smith last year about hus contract discussions with ESPN, Smith suggested that he was thinking bigger and broader about what he could be doing for the company, which is navigating the shift from linear TV to digital.


	“When we talk about adapting, ESPN is adapting from the standpoint of looking at the media landscape, the advent of podcasting and podcasters, the digital stratosphere, YouTube becoming the new television platform in a lot of people’s eyes and adapting to the inordinate amount of competition that’s coming from other places and saying, ‘okay, how can we maintain relevancy and ultimately continue to stand afloat above the crowd?’” Smith said. “That’s the challenge that ESPN has, and I view myself as a pivotal component to ensuring that that remains the state of affairs when it comes to ESPN and Walt Disney.”

EP+Co President Kat Shafer is surprised anyone knows she not only helped launch Clemson University’s first varsity rowing team — eventually earning a full scholarship in the sport — but also was Clemson’s first-ever All-ACC women’s rower.

It all seems so long ago for someone whose career took her from Clemson, where she graduated in 2002, to Greenville for a brief stint doing marketing work for a financial services firm, then on to EP+Co as a junior account executive, a move that eventually took her to the agency’s New York City office.

“I started at the bottom and just worked my way up. It only took 20 years,” she says, laughing.

In that time, Shafer remained on the account-management track. After earning an executive MBA from Clemson in 2006, she rose in 2016 to managing director before joining the C-Suite as chief client officer in 2020, a post she held until September 2024. That’s when her mentor, EP+Co founder and former president Allen Bosworth, chose her as his successor.

But while it is now firmly ensconced in Shafer’s past, rowing remains deeply rooted in her heart, molding the ethic that, as EP+Co president, shapes an entire ethos.

“Rowing for Clemson taught me that the best kind of leader is the one who lives by example,” she says. “Even now, I want to stay on the pitch, be in the room, and always be available. It comes down to fully committing to something and consistently working toward the objective.”

Shafer, whose roots extend from Greenville, through Clemson and into northeast Georgia, says the 16 years she spent in EP+Co’s New York office were both fascinating and challenging. And when she returned to Greenville, she enjoyed seeing how the place had grown, and changed.

“I’ve been gone 16 years — eight in Manhattan and eight in New Jersey — and life has changed a lot, as has Greenville,” she says. “It’s a great place to raise a family.”

EP+Co, the agency of record for a host of heavy-hitting brands such as Planet Oat, John Deere and Michelin, boasts about 130 employees between its Greenville and New York offices with another 30 in remote roles, Shafer says.

And as tectonic forces continue working on advertising business models great and small, she says EP+Co has found a sweet spot between traditional agency-of-record work and the rising demand for a more transactional, project-based approach demanded by a growing number of clients.

“In our industry, we’ve obviously seen a lot of internal hiring in marketing departments, but that still leads to project work, because those internal teams still outsource aspects of that work,” she says. “It’s more ‘madness’ than ‘Mad Men.’”

Shafer says about 40% of EP+Co’s work is on the project side, with the traditional agency-of-record space taking the other 60%.

“It’s a good, sustainable model for us,” she says.

Today’s marketers, Shafer says, want multiple experts working on different parts of the business, and given EP+Co’s remarkable retention rates (the average executive tenure is 14 years, while employee retention is six years), the agency is built to deliver on every client need.

Shafer says a top priority for her is positioning the agency name — and work — for continued success.

“By the end of 2025, I hope our name is more recognized nationally as we continue delivering for clients in unexpected ways, particularly in the evolving landscape now shaped by (artificial intelligence.)”

As she continues growing into the role of president, Shafer embraces the challenges still found in the everyday work.

“It’s never dull, never boring, and I’ve loved being part of our continuous evolution and transformation,” she says. “And I think of the people here as extensions of my family.”

The interiors and exterior of The Drifter Hotel on Tulane Avenue were "restored to the 1950s appearance," the Louisiana Landmark Society said in 2018. "Fortunately, this honored restoration converted this proto-typical example (of a mid-century motor motel) into the boutique 20-room Drifter Hotel," the citation said.

A new boutique hotel has opened in the 1950s-era motor lodge that until last year housed The Drifter Hotel, the hipster-friendly motel, bar and performance venue known for its clothing-optional pool.

The Drifter, which opened in 2017, was sold last year by the group that also operated the New Orleans boutique hotels Columns and Hotel Saint Vincent. 

Offering affordable passes for its adults-only heated pool, it became known as the site of lively parties and concerts along a decreasingly seedy stretch of Tulane Avenue in Mid-City. In 2019, it scored a spot on Architectural Digest's list of the "chicest" hotels in the nation.

In addition to sometimes topless sunbathers, the Drifter’s pool also hosted aquatic theatrical performances produced by Aqua Mob New Orleans.

A view of the pool area at The Drifter Hotel in Mid-City. The 20-room boutique hotel opened in 2017 in a renovated 1950s-era motel property on Tulane Avenue. 

Now known the Maidstone New Orleans, the latest version of the hotel that first opened in 1956 as the Crescent Motel officially opened Feb. 18 following a transformation by its new owners, ISMD.

The revamped mid-century space includes 18 rooms, two fewer than in its prior incarnation. All have been “extensively renovated” by a New York-based design agency and now feature custom tapestries made by a Oaxacan textile artist, according to a news release.

The poolside bar has been rebranded as the Maidstone Lounge, with the outdoor area now featuring a saltwater pool, a sunken fire pit and a menu of craft cocktails and small bites provided in partnership with local food vendors.

The 3522 Tulane Ave. property was purchased last year by an investment group that includes a celebrity attorney, a cannabis company CEO and a real estate investor awaiting trial for allegedly bribing a chief advisor for New York Mayor Eric Adams.

Mark Geragos, the Los Angeles-based lawyer who has represented Hunter Biden, Sean “Diddy” Combs and Michael Jackson, has partnered with Irwin Simon, who leads the publicly traded cannabis, beer and hemp food producer Tilray Brands, and Mayank Dwivedi, who faces charges of conspiracy and bribery stemming from allegations that he and a fellow hotelier paid kickbacks for building permits. Dwivedi, who is represented by Geragos's daughter in the case, pleaded not guilty last year.

Dwivedi has previously invested in New York hotel projects with Simon and Geragos, including the Maidstone Hotel in East Hampton with Simon and, with Geragos, the Capri Hotel in Southhampton.

The new owners aim to turn the hotel into “more of a four-star guest experience,” real estate broker Elizabeth Novit said last year.

Calls to the listed phone line for the Maidstone New Orleans, which is under separate management from its East Hampton operation, went unanswered, and hotel representatives did not respond Thursday to an email requesting further details.

The new ownership, which has announced plans for further expansion in New Orleans, has significantly hiked prices in its quest for swankiness.

Rooms at the Maidstone New Orleans are available starting at $295, before taxes and fees, according to its website.

The price for pool passes has also been increased, with drop-in passes now offered for $25 and annual memberships now $600, a representative told Axios New Orleans.

Both the room and pool rates are now about twice as high as they were under the hotel’s previous ownership.

The US owner of the Boots pharmacy chain is being taken over by a private equity firm in a $10bn (£7.8bn) deal.

The price being paid for Walgreens Boots Alliance is a fraction of what the company was worth a decade ago, reflecting its struggles with growing debt and shoppers going online for cheaper products. 

There have been reports that the Boots chain could be sold off separately by its new owner, US private equity firm Sycamore Partners.

Walgreens chief executive Tim Wentworth said the firm was navigating the "challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape".

"While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company," he added.

George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBC's Today programme that Boots had been "in and out of different ownership for some time" and that "its business model has struggled".

"People are buying more of those personal healthcare brands online than they are in the shop."

Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Savvy Marketing, said there would be "a lot of interested parties" if the Boots business was put up for sale.

She said the company had turned itself around after going through a difficult period and it was an "unbelievably trusted brand" with "a unique place in the UK psyche".

There are now 1,900 Boots stores left in the UK after the pharmacy chain began closing shops in June 2023 as part of a shake up.

Ms Shuttleworth said reports of a Boots sale would be difficult for staff.

"Any uncertainty over your ownership is going to make you quite concerned if you work for Boots."

Boots has been contacted for comment.

Sycamore Partners is paying $11.45 per share for Walgreens Boots Alliance, which is more than its shares are currently worth on the US stock market.

Walgreens shares rose by nearly 6% in extended trading in New York. But the company's stock market value has fallen by around 80% over the past five years.

The deal is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

The Illinois-based Walgreens took a 45% stake in Boots in 2012.

It bought the remainder of the firm two years later in a deal that valued Boots at around £9bn.

Walgreens is also made up of its namesake US retail business, specialty pharmacy group Shields Health Solutions and healthcare provider VillageMD.

In recent years, the company has faced mounting challenges as customers turned to cheaper rivals.

In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale but later dropped these plans, saying potential buyers had been unable to raise enough funds.

In October, it announced plans to shut 1,200 Walgreens stores in the US over the next three years under a cost-cutting programme.

The US government accused the university of "continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students".

Prosecutors want new text messages to be used as evidence in the trial of Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four college students.

Two unvaccinated people were killed in a rapidly spreading outbreak that has sickened more than 220.

Attendees to the recent Workshop & Golf Business Conference, arranged by Golf Accountancy Matters and hosted at Kingswood Golf & Country Club in Surrey, have proclaimed it a great success.

The event, the second of its type for Golf Accountancy Matters, bought together many of the 50-plus golf clubs that the company work with to discuss best practices in golf club accounting and bookkeeping, and to listen to the four guest speakers invited to talk at the conference.

In the first section, much of the emphasis was on how golf clubs and Golf Accountancy Matters can streamline their processes to reduce workload, increase accuracy and save money in the preparation of the golf club’s accounts. Golf Accountancy Matters adopt modern technologies to greatly assist in this regard, with an end-to-end solution that integrates the accounting software package, Xero, with Intelligent Golf. In addition, Datamolino provides for paperless billing and ApprovalMax for invoice payment authorisation – further adding to the timesaving in accounts preparation.

In the second section, delegates, largely comprising golf club managers, bookkeepers, accountants and treasurers, heard from Ben Hoskin of Regency Purchasing about the modern technologies being used to help supplier management in the food, beverage and hospitality areas.

Sam Hodson, Principle at Hillier Hopkins LLP, spoke next about some of the new accounting guidelines imminently coming into force, as well as valuable information about VAT partial exemption and golf club incorporation – two areas that private-member clubs need to understand in their relationship with taxation as non-profit organisations.

Mike Ramsey and Julian Curtis, from Centennial Investment Management, gave a joint presentation on their recent experience of an attempted bank fraud. It was both fascinating and terrifying in equal measure and opened everyone’s eyes to the high level of sophistication now being adopted by fraudsters. Fortunately, Mike and Julian’s experience of banking helped them recover the temporarily lost funds, but not without considerable stress and sleeplessness.

Finally, as the keynote speaker, Ben Sharpe, Managing Director & President of Callaway Golf, EMEA Division, took to the stage to give an insightful talk on his views of increasing participation in the game. Ben spoke about how we, as an industry, need to move from initiatives to grow the game, to embedding it within our mindset. 

Ben spoke of how technology can lead the way and facilitate growth. During his 45-minute presentation, he recalled his own career experiences as an industry leader of the gamification of the golf range through Topgolf and later, Toptracer, and how these new technologies revolutionised even the concept of playing golf and participation.

Paul Mould, Director at Golf Accountancy Matters, commented, “the event went really well, and it was great to see so many of our clients under one roof. It was an invaluable opportunity to not only talk about some of the latest initiatives and technologies we’re adopting, but also to share best practices in golf club bookkeeping and accounts.”

“A big thank you to our guest speakers, who each gave very different, but equally interesting and insightful, information on their areas of expertise. And of course, thank you must also go out to all attendees. They made the event by their enthusiasm and engagement.”

Plans are already in motion of Golf Accountancy Matters 3rd Annual Workshop & Golf Business Conference later in the year. For more details, visit www.golfaccountancymatters.co.uk.

Pitch Wharf, the new flagship venue from indoor golf brand Pitch, has officially opened in the heart of London's financial district.

Investors anxious for President Trump to return to his first-term playbook of tweeting about the stock market may have quite a wait ahead of them.

While tariffs have hit equity prices hard in recent weeks, a growing number of Wall Street strategists point to Trump's likely first order of business: lowering bond yields — even if it comes at the expense of a falling S&P 500 (^GSPC).

On Thursday, the broad-based index sank to its lowest level since November, bringing year-to-date losses to nearly 2.5%.

"It’s reasonable to think that the index has to fall quite a bit more before Trump views it as a concerning signal," Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote earlier this week.

"What we conjecture is that the relevant Trump put right now is for Treasuries, and that lower yields, not higher stock prices, are the best market indicator of success for Trump 2.0 policies," he added.

One important point to keep in mind: The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield is a benchmark for borrowing costs. A decrease in bond yields signifies lower costs for the refinancing of debt. On Thursday, the 10-year rose for a third straight session to 4.28%, but sat lower than the yield of more than 4.6% when Trump took office.

Draho added that "the best indication of a Treasury put is that Trump himself has tweeted very little about stock market performance, instead posting more often about the debt ceiling and government spending."

In front of Congress on Tuesday, Trump said, "Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it’s happening and it will happen rather quickly. There’ll be a little disturbance, but we are okay with that. It won’t be much."

When asked about the impact of tariffs on falling equity prices, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also telegraphed that the White House's priority in the short run isn't the stock market.

“Over the medium term, which is what we’re focused on, it’s a focus on Main Street," Bessent told "Fox & Friends" earlier this week. "Wall Street’s done great, Wall Street can continue to do fine, but we have a focus on small business and consumers, so we are going to rebalance the economy.”

The presumption is that if the economy slows enough, the Fed would step in to lower rates, while tax cuts and deregulation would spur growth. "Rather than slower growth being deemed a policy error, Trump may view this as a necessary precursor to higher future growth," Draho wrote.

"Investors, being impatient, would be more forgiving of this approach if it was coupled with future growth-enhancing policies such as tax cuts and de-regulation. Those policies are likely to come later in the year, an important sequencing that investors should not forget as they assess current growth," he added.

In a note on Wednesday morning, Nomura managing director Charlie McElligott wrote that a "negative wealth effect" is something the Trump administration is "actively acknowledging in order to rebalance the US economic hierarchy, as he attempts to shift growth from being dependent upon Government spending excess into something that is driven more by the private sector."

"This is hugely risky without a doubt," wrote McElligott. "And there is a price for everything, i.e. in the case of an increase in the speed/velocity of market shocks, which can then absolutely force him to trial-balloon softer, 'conciliatory' tones."

Those concessions started on Wednesday when the Trump administration gave a temporary exemption to the Big Three automakers after forging ahead with 25% tariffs against trading partners Canada and Mexico.

On Thursday, President Trump said he would pause tariffs on some Mexican goods, and the White House later said the delay also includes goods from Canada.

Sale of Walgreens Boots Alliance to Sycamore Partners will mean further uncertainty for pharmacy chain staff

The US owner of Boots is to be taken private in a $10bn (£7.8bn) deal that will mean further uncertainty for thousands of workers at the UK-based pharmacy chain.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, which operates more than 1,800 Boots stores in the UK, has been sold to the US private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The chain has been struggling as customers turn to online shopping for cheaper products.

Walgreens’ market value has collapsed by 90% since 2015 and is valued at $9.3bn. It has debt and lease obligations of $30bn.

Sycamore Partners has struck an $11.45-a-share deal for Walgreens Boots Alliance, giving it an equity value of about $10bn.

Sycamore is expected to retain the US retail business and sell or spin off the rest, including the UK chemist chain Boots, which traces its roots to John Boot’s first Nottingham store in 1849.

Boots has more than 50,000 employees, including at its headquarters in Nottingham, who face further uncertainty after more than three years of speculation over its future ownership.

In a letter to staff, seen by the Guardian, Ornella Barra, the head of Walgreens’ international business including Boots, said the deal was a significant development for the division, adding: “It’s important to note that nothing is changing today.”

In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale with a suggested price tag of up to £10bn but later dropped the plans as potential buyers, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, the US private equity investor Apollo Global Management and Asda’s owners TDR Capital, struggled to raise funds. A plan to float the business at a valuation of about £7bn was dropped last year.

Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said Sycamore was likely to seek a swift sale of Boots to a private equity buyer in the first instance as it “will care more about making money now rather than later”.

Mould said “considerable headwinds” for UK retailers, including rising costs and low consumer confidence as household bills continued to rise amid global political and economic difficulties, may make Boots a tough sell. Fears are also growing for hundreds of WH Smith stores as its listed owner tries to sell its estate of more than 500 shops on the high street to focus on its more successful travel arm.

However, in recent years, Boots has improved its pricing, closed hundreds of ageing stores and improved its beauty ranges to benefit from a shift among young people towards spending on cosmetics and beauty products rather than fashion. It could also benefit from the Labour government’s shift towards primary healthcare in which pharmacies are expected to play a bigger role.

Patrick O’Brien at the retail analysts GlobalData said a successful sale of Boots would depend on whether Sycamore was prepared to accept a lower figure than the “ludicrous valuation” previously sought by Walgreens.

He said: “Boots has improved dramatically since then but the valuations that were talked about when they were trying to sell a while ago were ridiculous in terms of multiples of revenues or profits.”

Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “The Boots business looks eminently floatable, but we will probably have to wait until this time next year to see it attempt an IPO as its new owner, Sycamore, won’t complete the takeover of Walgreens until [the last three months of] this year.”

Walgreens first took a stake in Boots in 2012 and completed a buyout two years later. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Boots said it was cutting 4,000 jobs, about 7% of its workforce, and shut almost 50 of its opticians branches.

Two years ago, the chain announced the closure of 300 shops, which it completed at the end of last year, as it “evolved” its store estate.

The deal will bring an end to Walgreens’ 98-year run as a listed company, although the second-largest pharmacy chain in the US still has 35 days to seek or entertain rival bids.

As part of the deal with Sycamore, the Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina, the Walgreens executive chair and the largest shareholder, will keep a minority shareholding in the business. Barra told staff Pessina would remain a significant owner alongside Sycamore.

Pessina forged the transatlantic pharmacy company by merging the US-based Walgreens with Alliance Boots of Europe in 2014, having paid £4.3bn to take a 45% stake in the business in 2012.

The Pharmacists’ Defence Association (PDA) said news of the buyout “may be particularly worrying to pharmacists and other employees who have so recently seen what happened in the UK community pharmacy sector in the case of LloydsPharmacy [where the entire chain was broken up and sold off to independents].”

Walgreens’ market value peaked at $100bn soon after the completion of the merger but it has declined over the past decade as e-commerce has hit its high street trading operation.

Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Walgreens, said the company was navigating the “challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape”.

President Donald Trump said Friday that he continues to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants peace and that he is “finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine.” His comments, to reporters in the Oval Office, came after Russia carried out a major missile attack against Ukraine while U.S. intelligence-sharing that normally helps Ukraine repel Russian forces was paused. Trump, who threatened to impose sanctions on Russia in response to the attack, said he had sent Russia a “very strong statement — can’t do that.” But he softened his tone during his Oval Office appearance. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to address a White House cryptocurrency summit, elevating an industry he promised to aid during his campaign.

The National Republican Congressional Committee deleted a social media post baselessly claiming that Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-New York) was an “illegal immigrant.”

Espaillat became a citizen after his family came to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic almost 60 years ago. They overstayed a tourist visa but then obtained green cards.

The NRCC’s post asserted that “Democrats literally chose an illegal immigrant to give their response to President Trump’s address,” referencing Espaillat’s Spanish-language response to Trump’s address to Congress earlier this week.

The post was up for roughly 24 hours and remained online after Democrats sharply criticized the House GOP campaign arm for the escalated rhetoric.

Several Hispanic Republicans in the House were also irked by the post, with Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-Florida) telling The Washington Post it is a term he would not have used, especially for a sitting member of Congress.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to create a White House task force to help prepare for the FIFA World Cup 2026, which is set to be played in the United States, Canada and Mexico. North America was awarded the right to host the tournament in 2018.

Asked by a reporter whether the latest political tensions over tariffs between his administration and the other two countries would affect the soccer tournament, Trump said, “I think it’s going to make it more exciting. Tension’s a good thing.”

Less than a month after placing the entire staff of the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights on administrative leave, the Environmental Protection Agency has reinstated dozens of employees in offices across the country.

Employees at regional EPA offices received an email Monday asking them to return to work, according to four employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, and they returned to work Wednesday.

The U.S. has temporarily suspended satellite imagery services to Ukraine, a fresh blow to Kyiv from the Trump administration, which has frozen weapons shipments and intelligence-sharing.

President Donald Trump on Friday celebrated “big gains for native-born Americans” in the latest jobs report, suggesting that the early gains were a product of U.S. businesses gearing up for his administration.

“For the first time in 15 months, the job gains for native-born Americans — for American people, people born in America — exceeded job gains for migrant and foreign-born workers,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “This is the first time this has happened in more than 15 months.”

Education Secretary Linda McMahon said Friday she’s on the same page as President Donald Trump on his desire to close the department she now leads.

Asked in an interview on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends” whether the United States “needs” the Education Department, McMahon directly said: “No, we don’t.”

McMahon’s comments come as Trump is set to issue an executive order directing her to begin the process of dismantling the agency with the goal to ultimately shut it down.

President Donald Trump is set to host the first White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

The event will put on display just how much Trump, once a skeptic of cryptocurrency, has aligned himself with the industry since winning the November election with the support of some of its biggest players. He tapped venture capitalist David Sacks to serve as his crypto czar and more recently announced a national crypto reserve.

President Donald Trump said he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran and sent a letter this week to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader, indicating his desire to do so.

“I’ve written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing,’” Trump told Maria Bartiromo in an interview with Fox Business recorded Thursday and partially aired Friday.

Democrats demanded Friday that the Trump administration explain the U.S. DOGE Service’s request to access a sensitive database kept by a federal child-support office and whether the group successfully accessed the system, which includes data on nearly all U.S. workers’ earnings.

Elon Musk and his allies in the U.S. DOGE Service have justified their efforts to dismantle federal agencies by invoking a frequent refrain: They’re merely targeting fraud, waste and abuse.

March 7 (UPI) -- Working with Germany and Finland, U.S. officials disrupted and took down the online infrastructure used to operate Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly facilitated money laundering by transnational criminal organizations.

Those organizations included terrorist groups, according to U.S. Justice Department officials, who made the announcement in a press release on Friday.
An indictment unsealed in the Eastern District of Virginia leveled charges against Aleksej Besciokov, 46, a Lithuanian national and Russian resident, and Aleksandr Mira Serda (also known as Aleksandr Ntifo-Siaw), 40, a Russian national and United Arab Emirates resident, according to Justice officials.
According to the indictment, Garantex has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since April 2019.

In the release, Justice officials said Mira Serda and Besciokov are charged with money laundering conspiracy, and Besciokov is charged with conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.

Garantex was run by Mira Serda and Besciokov from 2019 to 2015, according to Justice officials. Authorities said Besciokov was Garantex's main technical administrator and responsible for maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Officials say Mira Serda was Garantex's co-founder and chief commercial officer.
U.S. officials say the crypto exchange Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal funding and was used to "facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to U.S. victims."
Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that the exchange was facilitating crimes, Justice officials said, adding that Garantex took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities, such as money laundering, on its platform.
According to Friday's release from the Justice Department, in April 2022 the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Garantex for its role in facilitating money laundering of funds from ransomware actors and so-called darknet markets.
According to court documents cited in Friday's release, "despite the widespread publicity of the sanctions and Garantex administrator's personal knowledge of them, Besciokov and his co-conspirators violated those sanctions by continuing to transact with U.S.-based entities.
"Further, Besciokov and his co-conspirators redesigned Garantex's operations to evade and violate U.S. sanctions and induce U.S. businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions," Justice officials said.

As an example of attempts at evasion, Justice officials said Garantex allegedly moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis "in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts."
Additionally and despite doing a notable amount of business in the United States and operating as a money transmitting business, Garantex failed to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as required, Justice officials said.
The U.S. Justice Department said that, on March 6, U.S. law enforcement executed a seizure order authorized by a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia against three website domain names used to support Garantex's operations: Garantex.org, Garantex.io, and Garantex.academy.
According to officials, the seizure will prevent the sites from being used for money laundering and any other crimes. Individuals who go to those sites now see a message indicating that the site has been seized by law enforcement.
Additionally, officials said Friday that German and Finnish law enforcement also seized servers hosting Garantex's operations. U.S. law authorities, according to the Justice Department, have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex's servers, including customer and accounting databases. More than $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex's money laundering activities have been frozen, U.S. officials said.

If convicted, Besciokov and Mira Serda face decades behind bars.

Two Administrators Charged with Operating Multibillion-Dollar Crypto Money Laundering Service

US Department of Justice

The Justice Department announced today a coordinated action with Germany and Finland to disrupt and take down the online infrastructure used to operate Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly facilitated money laundering by transnational criminal organizations — including terrorist organizations — and sanctions violations. Since April 2019, Garantex has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions.

In conjunction with the operation targeting Garantex, the Department also announced the unsealing of an indictment in the Eastern District of Virginia against Aleksej Besciokov, 46, a Lithuanian national and Russian resident, and Aleksandr Mira Serda (previously Aleksandr Ntifo-Siaw), 40, a Russian national and United Arab Emirates resident. Mira Serda and Besciokov are charged with money laundering conspiracy, and Besciokov is charged with conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.

According to court documents, between 2019 and 2025, Besciokov and Mira Serda controlled and operated Garantex. Besciokov was Garantex’s primary technical administrator and responsible for obtaining and maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Mira Serda was Garantex’s co-founder and chief commercial officer.

Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to U.S. victims. According to the indictment, Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that criminal proceeds were being laundered through Garantex and took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities on its platform. For example, when Russian law enforcement sought records relating to an account registered to Mira Serda, Garantex provided incomplete information in response and falsely claimed the account was not verified. In reality, Garantex had associated the account with Mira Serda’s personal identifying documents, even while disclosing identifying information related to other accounts requested by Russian law enforcement.

On April 5, 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Garantex for its role in facilitating money laundering of funds from ransomware actors and darknet markets. According to court documents, despite the widespread publicity of the sanctions and Garantex administrator’s personal knowledge of them, Besciokov and his co-conspirators violated those sanctions by continuing to transact with U.S.-based entities. Further, Besciokov and his co-conspirators redesigned Garantex’s operations to evade and violate U.S. sanctions and induce U.S. businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions. For example, Garantex moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts.

Despite doing substantial business in the United States and operating as a money transmitting business, Garantex failed to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as required.

On March 6, U.S. law enforcement, led by the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), executed a seizure order authorized by a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia against three website domain names used to support Garantex’s operations. According to court records unsealed today, Garantex.org, Garantex.io, and Garantex.academy were associated with the administration and operation of Garantex. The seizure of these domains will prevent these sites from being used for money laundering and additional crimes. Individuals visiting those sites now will see a message indicating that the site has been seized by law enforcement.

As part of the coordinated actions, German and Finnish law enforcement seized servers hosting Garantex’s operations. U.S. law authorities have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex’s servers, including customer and accounting databases. In addition, U.S. law enforcement has also frozen over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering activities.

Besciokov and Mira Serda are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Besciokov is also charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.    

Supervisory Official Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Erik S. Siebert for the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant Director Michael Centrella of the USSS’ Office of Field Operations, and Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division made the announcement.

USSS and the FBI are investigating the case.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Zoe Bedell for the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Tamara Livshiz of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department’s National Security Division and Office of International Affairs provided valuable assistance.

The Justice Department also recognizes the critical cooperation of the German Federal Criminal Police Office, the Frankfurt General Prosecutor’s Office, the Dutch National Police, Europol, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, and the Estonian National Criminal Police.

Finally, the Department thanks Tether and blockchain analytics firm Elliptic for their proactive assistance in this investigation.

Any individual who believes he/she is a victim whose funds were laundered through Garantex or who may otherwise have a claim to restrained funds should reach out to law enforcement via email address GarantexClaimants@secretservice.gov.

President Donald Trump said Friday that he continues to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants peace and that he is “finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine.” His comments, to reporters in the Oval Office, came after Russia carried out a major missile attack against Ukraine while U.S. intelligence-sharing that normally helps Ukraine repel Russian forces was paused. Trump, who threatened to impose sanctions on Russia in response to the attack, said he had sent Russia a “very strong statement — can’t do that.” But he softened his tone during his Oval Office appearance. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to address a White House cryptocurrency summit, elevating an industry he promised to aid during his campaign.

Chiefs from Coinbase, Ripple and Robinhood to strategize with president on how to make US ‘crypto capital of world’

Cryptocurrency industry elite are set to meet with Donald Trump at the White House on Friday to discuss how the government will enact Trump’s vision of making the country the “crypto capital of the world”. The day before, the president signed an executive order creating a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency for the United States.

Trump will host players including Michael Saylor, co-founder and the executive chair of MicroStrategy, and Zach Witkoff, one of the founders of the president’s own crypto business, World Liberty Financial, according to the executives’ social media posts.

Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood Markets, will also attend, according to a spokesperson for Robinhood. Witkoff and Saylor did not respond to requests for comment. Attenders expect the event to focus on Trump’s plans to build the strategic reserve, which the president said will contain bitcoin and four other coins. Trump directed the secretaries of treasury and commerce to develop “budget-neutral strategies” for acquiring additional bitcoin that have no “incremental costs” on taxpayers.

“For the first time, industry leaders feel they’re walking into a collaborative discussion,” said Les Borsai, co-founder of Wave Digital Assets, a crypto investment adviser, who said he did not receive an invitation.

Participants said they were focused on any further details on the strategic reserve, a government stockpile of crypto assets.

The reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, the White House “crypto czar”, billionaire David Sacks, said in a post on social media platform X.

“This [strategic reserve] is going to be the biggest point of contention for many of us,” said JP Richardson, co-founder and CEO of Exodus, a bitcoin wallet developer. Although he owns the four other coins that Trump has suggested including in the reserve, he does not think they have a place in a strategic reserve.

“Crypto has made big strides, but it’s still a relatively nascent industry,” Richardson said. The other coins are smaller and function in a very different way, one he said may create more risk. Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, posted on X on Sunday that a bitcoin-only reserve was “probably … the best option”. Both Richardson and Armstrong will attend the summit.

In a post on X, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, who also confirmed his attendance at the summit, hailed Trump’s recognition that “we live in a multichain world” stretching beyond bitcoin. XRP, the coin tied to Ripple, is one of the four other cryptocurrencies Trump has suggested may be added to a crypto reserve. Attendees said they were optimistic about working with an administration that views crypto as a mainstream asset class and expressed hope for a straightforward regulatory process.

“What everyone really needs to have at this point is clarity on what the level of scrutiny and intensity of regulation will be, who the key regulators will be,” said Yesha Yadav, the associate dean and a professor of law at Vanderbilt University. That could speed up the process of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission of a flurry of new listings of exchange-traded funds.

Trump’s family has launched cryptocurrency meme coins and he also holds a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform, which has sparked some conflict-of-interest concerns. His aides have said Trump has handed over control of his business ventures, which are being reviewed by outside ethics lawyers. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. froze $26 million in crypto assets, according to authorities.

The United States Secret Service said it has seized a Russian cryptocurrency exchange website, according to court documents unsealed on Friday.

The Justice Department also charged the two administrators of that website with a multimillion-dollar money laundering scheme, court documents said.

Between 2019 and 2025, Aleksej Besciokov, 46, a Lithuanian national and Russian resident, and Aleksandr Mira Serda, 40, a Russian national, allegedly controlled and operated Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Moscow.

The two allegedly "operated Garantex to launder the proceeds of criminal activity, including ransomware, computer hacking, narcotics transactions, and sanctions violations, and profited from the laundering. Garantex offered its services to the public first through the website Garantex.io and then through Garantex.org. Garantex also misled law enforcement, including the Russian police, about the identities of its customers," the documents said.

The Justice Department said that since April 2019, Garantex has processed $96 billion in crypto transactions and noted that those proceeds were allegedly used to fund illicit activities.

"The seizure of website domains associated with Garantex's operations and the freezing of over $26 million in cryptocurrency strikes a serious financial blow to cybercriminals worldwide," said Michael Centrella, assistant director of the Secret Service's Office of Field Operations. "Alongside our U.S. and international law enforcement partners, this coordinated action will prevent additional funds from falling into the hands of criminals."

Court documents said Besciokov allegedly knew there were two different accounts linked to North Korean cyber threat actors but still let them use the cryptocurrency exchange.

The company was also under sanctions from the U.S. since at least 2022.

"By in and around early 2023, BESCIOKOV and his co-conspirators had also redesigned Garantex's operations to evade and violate U.S. sanctions and induce U.S. businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions," the indictment said. "For example, Garantex moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts."

Besciokov and Serda also allegedly took steps to conceal themselves from Russian law enforcement, according to the court records.

The US has a strategic bitcoin reserve.

Question: What's a strategic bitcoin reserve?

More important question: Why should the US have a strategic bitcoin reserve?

Spoiler: I've been trying to figure this out for a bit, and I really can't understand it.

Other people seem similarly perplexed. "It is not clear how such a reserve would work or how it would benefit taxpayers," Reuters said Thursday.

And while I don't usually compare myself to Donald Trump, I have definitely made the same face he made Thursday, when someone is telling me something I don't fully comprehend. "And this is something you believe in?" he asked David Sacks, his crypto czar, before signing the executive order creating the reserve.

A post shared by America 🇺🇸 (@usa)

To be clear: I know what the reserve is supposed to be. And I know why Trump signed the order creating it.

The president, who had previously called bitcoin "a scam," changed his stance on crypto last year — he now has his own cryptocurrency — and pledged at a Nashville bitcoin conference to create the reserve. His turnaround coincided with the crypto industry's embrace of his candidacy. (Though he still didn't seem like a true believer back in April: "Have a good time with your bitcoin and your crypto and everything else that you're playing with," he told the crowd as he left the stage.)

But I don't get the point of a strategic reserve.

The US already owns a bunch of bitcoin, mostly acquired through asset forfeiture in court proceedings. Those coins are now supposed to go into the reserve, and the government isn't supposed to ever sell them.

While some crypto and bitcoin fans thought the Trump plan was to go out and buy more bitcoin, that doesn't seem to be the case now. Though the order appears to provide some wiggle room on that front since it instructs Trump's Cabinet members to "develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin."

If you peruse crypto fans' commentary about the news, you'll see a mixed reaction: Some are upset that there's no immediate plan for the US to buy a lot of bitcoin — which would boost bitcoin prices. Others think it's a good thing for the US to actively support bitcoin instead of, say, calling it "a scam."

What I haven't found — and feel free to point it out to me if you have — is an explanation of why this is good policy.

Sacks and others say this is just the equivalent of the US holding gold in Fort Knox, or owning reserves of other valuable commodities, like it does with oil. But to what end? The government's relationship with gold is an old and complicated one. It keeps extra oil around in case of emergency. I don't see a parallel for crypto.

I also thought one of the main ideas behind crypto was that it allowed people to create assets without involving the government. And this sure seems like it's government involvement. At the very least, since the US owns a bunch of bitcoin and is now promising not to sell that bitcoin, it seems like that's the government actively supporting bitcoin.

Look. I'm no crypto expert. So over the past few days, I reached out to several crypto experts — who are also people who are fans of Trump 2.0's pro-crypto stance — to explain the thinking behind the reserve, and … couldn't get them to chat with me about it. Even off the record.

That reaction certainly doesn't prove anything. But it does make me think that even some crypto people aren't 100% convinced about this one. Let's see if people feel more comfortable about this idea in a year or so.

CEO Michael Saylor has grown Strategy’s pile to nearly half a million bitcoin and the stock is falling with most of the asset class.

It’s been quite a week for bitcoin, with President Trump’s executive order establishing a strategic bitcoin national reserve late last night, though it failed to boost the price of the coin, which has dropped to $86,000 as of 12:15 p.m. ET today. 

The details of the order specified only that the government would fund the reserve with previously seized cryptocurrencies, which seems to have hurt the overall cryptocurrency market as well as sentiment around Strategy, which is down more than 6% today.  

CEO Michael Saylor will be at today’s inaugural White House Crypto Summit and spoke on Fox Business about his ideas for how the reserve should be built, which included the US adding bitcoin slowly and strategically. 

Despite the executive order saying any bitcoin purchased will be done only through “budget-neutral strategies,” public companies around the globe are still steadily buying and stashing bitcoin.

This week, Japanese company Metaplanet added 156 bitcoin for $13.4 million. “As of 3/3/2025, we hold 2391 $BTC acquired for ~$196.3 million at ~82,100 per bitcoin,” CEO Simon Gerovich posted on X.

In Brazil, fintech company Méliuz said its board of directors has approved allocating 10% of the company’s cash reserves in bitcoin.

“The Company has made its first Bitcoin purchases, acquiring 45.72 Bitcoin for approximately $4.1 million at an average price of $90,296.11 per Bitcoin,” CEO Israel Salmen posted on X.

Meanwhile, stateside, publicly traded bitcoin platform Fold added 475 bitcoin to its reserve today — a 50% increase in the company’s bitcoin holdings, which now total 1,485 bitcoin, according to the release.

President Donald Trump’s March 6, 2025 executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Crypto Asset Stockpile is a historic moment for this original cryptocurrency first launched in January 2009, and for the digital assets industry, more broadly. The move signals a major shift in policy, with the U.S. government recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic asset alongside traditional reserves like gold.

Vocal crypto-critic Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has demanded immediate financial disclosures from Crypto Czar David Sacks (who  reportedly liquidated his holdings just days ago), questioning potential conflicts of interest amid Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement. Citing concerns over insider trading and regulatory rollbacks, Warren pressed for details on Sacks’ crypto divestments and who knew of Trump’s plans before his public announcement. The inclusion of Solana in the crypto stockpile has raised eyebrows, particularly since Trump launched his “Official Trump” meme coin on Solana’s blockchain prior to his inauguration.

This has fueled speculation that some aspects of the reserve and stockpile may be politically motivated rather than purely strategic.

While some in the crypto industry welcomed the announcement, Bitcoin’s price dropped more than 5% upon news that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile would not include government purchases, only a formalization of existing policy to hold confiscated assets. Despite its bold rhetoric, the order largely reaffirms current asset management practices rather than introducing substantive new policies. However, it does place Bitcoin alongside other strategic reserves and fulfills Trump’s campaign pledge to prioritize the asset in digital asset policy.

In a March 7, 2025, X/Twitter post, early Bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem reflected on the momentous shift in policy. “Not in our wildest dreams,” explained Shrem, “could we ever have imagined that one day the President of the United States would establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.”

The order’s vague framework has sparked concerns, particularly as Trump’s March 7, 2025, Crypto Summit is set to feature a narrow circle of industry elites, with little representation from diverse perspectives or consumer advocates. The revelation that the reserve would only consist of seized Bitcoin (rather than positioning the U.S. as an active buyer) sent the market into a freefall, failing to meet some expectations and deepening uncertainty and the tribal divide over the government’s long-term role in Bitcoin’s future.

Strategic reserves are government-controlled stockpiles of critical assets, typically created to mitigate national security or economic stability risks. The most well-known example is the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which holds crude oil to protect against supply disruptions. Governments, including the United States, also hold reserves of gold and foreign currencies to stabilize national economies.

By establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the U.S. is effectively placing Bitcoin in the same category as these traditional reserves, thus further legitimizing a nascent and volatile emerging asset class plagued by fear, uncertainty and doubt. The White House’s framing of Bitcoin as a national asset suggests that policymakers now view it as an emerging ‘store of value’ rather than merely a speculative investment. “In economics,” explains AccountingInsights.org, “the concept of a store of value is vital for understanding how assets retain their worth over time.” Assets that act as stores of value, “provide individuals and businesses confidence in preserving purchasing power against inflation or market fluctuations.” For this reason, Bitcoin is considered a “hedge” against inflation.

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, however, is not without controversy. Unlike oil, which is essential for energy security, or gold, which has served as a recognized store of value for millennia, Bitcoin remains highly volatile. At least for now. But volatility is not the absence of value; it is often a sign of an emerging asset class finding its place in the financial system. While critics argue that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic worth due to its digital nature and absence of industrial applications, intrinsic value is always in the eye of the beholder and shaped by the needs of the economic era in which an asset exists.

Today, Bitcoin’s value is derived from market demand, provable scarcity, and its decentralized security model, characteristics that have made it increasingly attractive as a hedge against currency debasement and financial instability. What is dismissed as speculation today may, as the world economy evolves, become an essential pillar of financial resilience tomorrow, a shift already evident in institutional adoption trends and now, through the U.S. government’s own recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.

When news of the imminent signing of this EO ahead of the March 7, 2025, Crypto Summit) first broke, Bitcoin’s price surged past $90,000 as traders speculated that the U.S. government would begin actively acquiring Bitcoin, especially with only 1.5 million of the total 21 million supply still available. However, once it became clear that the reserve would rely solely on confiscated Bitcoin rather than new government purchases, the market quickly reversed course. Adding to the uncertainty, an executive order is not law and, therefore, can be overturned by any future president, leaving the long-term fate of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in question absent congressional action.

Investors who had positioned themselves for a major institutional Bitcoin buying spree began offloading their holdings, triggering a sell-off that sent Bitcoin’s price tumbling below $82,000 in a matter of hours. The market reaction highlighted a broader issue: many traders had assumed that the reserve would function similarly to a central bank accumulating gold. Instead, the reliance on seized Bitcoin introduced uncertainty, reinforcing concerns that the reserve would be politically motivated rather than strategically structured.

Some investors also viewed the plan as antithetical to Bitcoin’s core ethos of decentralization and voluntary participation. The idea that the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings would come exclusively from confiscations rather than open-market purchases raised ethical concerns about whether the reserve represented a legitimate financial strategy or simply a means of monetizing legal seizures.

Adding to the confusion was the creation of a second entity, the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, which will be managed by the Treasury Department and hold other confiscated cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA).

This distinction has led to uncertainty about the government’s long-term approach to digital assets. While the Bitcoin reserve is intended to be a long-term strategic holding, the stockpile’s purpose is less clear. Unlike the Bitcoin reserve, which explicitly prohibits selling its assets, the stockpile may function as a more flexible repository of confiscated cryptocurrencies, potentially allowing for future liquidations.

Supporters of the Bitcoin reserve argue that it elevates Bitcoin’s status and signals U.S. leadership in digital asset policy. Some believe the move will encourage other nations to formalize their own Bitcoin reserves, accelerating institutional adoption.

Sacks defended the plan, arguing that the U.S. had lost over $17 billion in potential value by prematurely selling confiscated Bitcoin over the past decade. “Had we held onto the Bitcoin we seized, we would control a much more valuable reserve today,” Sacks wrote in a social media post. “The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve corrects that mistake.”

Some Bitcoin maximalists, including Tyler Winklevoss, applauded the idea of a government-controlled Bitcoin reserve but criticized the inclusion of other cryptocurrencies in the stockpile.

As reported by the Bitoinist, Winklevoss explained “I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA,but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve. Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar, and that digital asset is Bitcoin.”

Other industry figures, however, have raised concerns about the lack of clarity on how the government will manage its Bitcoin holdings. Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures noted that while a Bitcoin reserve could establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets, mixing it with other cryptocurrencies would dilute its credibility. “A Bitcoin-only reserve would ratify Bitcoin as a global asset of consequence, somewhere in the realm of gold,” Carter told CNBC. “Throwing in other digital currencies makes it look like another speculative fund.”

According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the U.S. government currently holds 198,109 Bitcoin, valued at $17.5 billion at today’s market prices. These holdings have accumulated over time through major enforcement actions, including the Silk Road seizures and the Bitfinex hack investigation. This makes the U.S. one of the largest institutional Bitcoin holders, controlling nearly 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. However, the long-term implications of this ownership remain unclear.

Trump’s Bitcoin reserve initiative has drawn both praise and skepticism, reflecting broader tensions in the crypto industry over government involvement in digital assets.

The political context is inescapable. After years of regulatory hostility under the Biden administration, Trump’s policy represents a dramatic shift toward institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. Yet, the lack of a clear strategy for managing the reserve, combined with concerns about potential political motivations, has left many unanswered questions. If the government mismanages the initiative—through opaque policymaking, insider deals, or future market interventions, it could undermine Bitcoin’s status as a neutral, censorship-resistant asset.

The coming weeks will determine whether the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a bold step toward financial modernization or a risky political experiment. For now, uncertainty looms over the digital asset market, and the debate over Bitcoin’s role in U.S. economic policy is far from settled.

NOTE: In this latest article of the Electing Crypto™ series, Prof. Evans breaks down the key provisions of Trump’s executive order, examines the market’s reaction, and assesses whether this move signals a meaningful shift in U.S. Bitcoin policy or simply repackages existing asset management practices under a new name.

A senior White House official told Decrypt that President Donald Trump created a strategic reserve exclusively for Bitcoin on Thursday because the president’s administration views the cryptocurrency as belonging to a league of its own. 

“Bitcoin is special in our view,” the senior White House official said. “It’s the most secure. It’s the most decentralized. It doesn’t have an issuer. So it deserves special treatment.”

In signing an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Trump also established a federal Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include various other cryptocurrencies seized by the U.S. government “in connection with criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.”

Trump stated on Sunday that such a stockpile would specifically feature XRP, Solana, and Cardano, sending market prices for those assets flying. "I think the president just gave five examples of cryptocurrencies in his post," the official said. "Those five have to be the largest by market cap, so I think people are reading into that a little bit too much. The bottom line is, I think that what we’ve announced here is consistent with what the president has always said about the space.”

It's currently unclear if the U.S. government is in possession of any assets mentioned in Trump's post, other than Bitcoin and Ethereum, that it may have gained from prior criminal proceedings. U.S. government crypto wallets identified by blockchain intelligence firm Arkham currently hold zero XRP, SOL, or ADA. 

When asked by Decrypt whether this means the crypto stockpile may not feature XRP, SOL, or ADA after all, the White House official deflected, saying the U.S. government does not yet have a full accounting of which digital assets it holds and in what amounts.

“We have to go see what the federal government actually owns,” the official said. “They've never done an audit before. I think that's the place to start.”

The official elaborated that while the nearly 200,000 Bitcoin believed to be in the U.S. government’s possession will be held indefinitely with the aim of generating “long term value,” the U.S. Treasury secretary will have the authority to sell off any altcoins in the Digital Assets Stockpile if they “decided that was the best strategy.”

The official also teased the agenda for this afternoon’s first ever White House Crypto Summit, which will put various industry leaders in dialogue with senior government officials. No tax-related issues will be discussed; the emphasis will instead be primarily on dismantling Biden-era, anti-crypto regulations.

President Donald Trump on Thursday night authorized the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve and a separate US stockpile of other digital assets, fulfilling a campaign promise he made to an industry that is gathering at the White House Friday for a "crypto summit."

The bitcoin reserve will be seeded with bitcoin (BTC-USD) already owned by the federal government that was taken as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks said in a post on the social media platform X.

"This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime," Sacks said. Before signing the executive order in the Oval Office, Trump asked Sacks if he believed in the reserve and then said, "We made the promise" — referring to the pledge of a bitcoin reserve he made on the 2024 campaign trail.

Sacks said on X that the US government owns an estimated 200,000 bitcoins after selling off about half of what it acquired through criminal seizures, although he said there has never been a complete audit.

Had the government not sold that sum for roughly $360 million over the last decade, according to White House officials, its bitcoin holdings would potentially be worth $17 billion.

Sacks said the US will not sell any bitcoin once it is in the reserve and that it will be kept as a store of value.

The reserve, he added, “is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.’”

Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Friday said she sent a letter she sent to Sacks raising concerns about the reserve and any conflicts of interest "as the administration pushes policies that could directly benefit the president, administration insiders, and wealthy investors."

Sacks said last Sunday in a social media post on X, "I sold all my cryptocurrency (including BTC, ETH, and SOL) prior to the start of the administration." On Monday he said he sold a $74,000 position in a Bitwise ETF and does not have "large indirect holdings."

He added that he would provide an "update at the end of the ethics process." The Financial Times reported that his venture capital firm retains stakes in a small number of crypto startups and that he was in the process of a government ethics review.

His boss, the president, is a participant in the cryptocurrency industry. Just before his inauguration, Trump's team launched an official meme coin for the 47th president (TRUMP) and one for first lady Melania Trump (MELANIA) on the solana blockchain.

Trump and his sons are also backers of another crypto project called World Liberty Financial, and his namesake Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) said it will allocate up to $250 million of cash tied up in a venture called Truth.Fi into cryptocurrencies and other investments.

One unknown question about the reserve announced Thursday by Sacks and Trump is whether it will be used to buy more bitcoin beyond the assets already held by the US government.

Sacks said Thursday night that the secretaries of Treasury and Commerce have the authorization “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Friday that seized crypto assets would go into the reserve first and "then we'll see what the way forward is for more acquisitions for the reserve. And we're starting with bitcoin, but it's an overall crypto reserve."

Sen. Cynthia Lummis has separately discussed a US government crypto-buying program that would call for the Federal Reserve to purchase more bitcoin using 1970s-era certificates for gold reserves. It would need congressional approval.

White House officials are not opposed to a separate effort by Congress to ensure a bitcoin reserve becomes permanent law. An executive order like the one signed by Trump can be reversed by future presidents.

"The goal of a strategic reserve is to buy or convert current assets into bitcoin and then hold them ... that way, we can remove the short-term volatility from the equation and look at this as a long-term strategic asset," she told Yahoo Finance in an interview last Friday.

Lummis said there is more work to do to help people understand “the reason why we should have it” and that it can interact with the world reserve currency status of the US dollar.

"We think they are very complementary," Lummis told Yahoo Finance.

When the president last weekend discussed his plans for a reserve on social media, he said it would include bitcoin as well as other digital assets: ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), solana (SOL), and cardano (ADA).

Sacks said Thursday that the president had also authorized a "US digital asset stockpile consisting of digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings" — without naming the assets.

But Sacks made it clear the government would not acquire additional assets for that stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

The new announcement at the end of this week comes after a period of extreme volatility for digital assets. The price of bitcoin has whipsawed following its worst correction since a 2022 meltdown.

It fell sharply from above $90,000 in the hour after Thursday's presidential action before regaining much of that ground. Bitcoin is down 1% since the order was announced. It's still down 18% from its all-time high above $109,000 on the day of Trump's inauguration in January.

The crypto world is hoping a White House crypto summit today will take it one step closer to getting even more of what it wants from a GOP-led Washington, providing some stability to a market trying to regain the upward momentum it had in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election victory.

The SEC has dropped several high-profile cases against prominent cryptocurrency companies since Trump took office and created a presidential working group on digital assets that is studying the possibility of moving legislation through Congress that could provide more clarity about regulatory oversight of digital assets.

The White House said in a statement that Trump is expected to host and deliver remarks at the crypto summit before prominent CEOs, founders, and investors from the industry.

Coinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong, Strategy’s (MSTR) Michael Saylor, Chainlink Labs CEO Sergey Nazarov, and Exodus CEO JP Richardson are expected to attend.

Coinbase is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the changes in Washington, D.C. Last week, the SEC dropped a lawsuit against Coinbase that had been filed and pursued aggressively by the Biden administration.

Just hours before the White House Crypto Summit, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate stockpile of other digital assets. The news plunged Bitcoin to $84,000 Thursday evening, however, as the federal government isn’t purchasing new bitcoins under the order; it’s merely establishing a reserve using its existing holdings. On Friday morning, Bitcoin was up 1%, hovering around $90,000.

Trump’s crypto advisor, David Sacks, stated on X that the Bitcoin reserve will be funded with Bitcoin already held by the federal government, seized through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.

The Treasury Department will establish an office to manage the reserve. “Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency,” the order said. “Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve.”

Currently, the United States is the largest government holder of Bitcoin, with a staggering 213,297 Bitcoin in its possession, according to data from CoinGecko. At current market prices, this amounts to approximately $19.3 billion.

Most of these Bitcoin holdings have been acquired through cryptocurrency seizures, often stemming from law enforcement operations targeting illicit activities such as black-market trading and transactions on darknet markets.

Crypto leaders such as Coinbase (COIN+1.96% CEO Brian Armstrong, Strategy (MSTR-1.45%) executive chairman Michael Saylor, and Robinhood (HOOD-1.34% CEO Vlad Tenev will attend the White House Crypto Summit later today.

 Bitcoin analysts warn of limited upside after Trump’s reserve plan excludes new government purchases, with BTC struggling to hold above key resistance levels. 

Bitcoin analysts are signaling limited upside potential for the cryptocurrency following disappointment over US President Donald Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan, which did not involve direct government purchases of Bitcoin, contrary to some expectations.

Trump’s executive order, signed on March 7, outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases rather than actively acquiring Bitcoin (BTC) through market purchases, Cointelegraph reported.

Bitcoin plunged over 6% after the announcement, falling from $90,400 to $84,979, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.

Bitcoin’s price action may lack any significant upside due to this initial investor disappointment, according to Bitfinex analysts, who told Cointelegraph:

Still, other analysts see the US Bitcoin reserve plan as the first “real step” for Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system.

“The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph.

Despite the short-term investor disappointment, Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plans may prove to be a viable middle ground to start experimenting with Bitcoin as a national reserve asset.

This “softer approach” may be more viable and meet less mainstream resistance, according to Bitfinex Analysts, who added:

Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains in a significant downtrend that resulted in a descending triangle on the four-hour chart, a bearish pattern that signals a market downtrend.

To break this ongoing downtrend, Bitcoin will need to recapture the key $93,000 mark, wrote pseudonymous crypto analyst Satoshi Flipper in a March 7 X post.

Donald Trump’s crypto summit could see Bitcoin’s price surge to $100,000.

That’s according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. 

He argued that if the White House’s meet-up delivers on the hope of clear regulatory signals, then that will prove a boon for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

“A successful summit could see Bitcoin reclaim $100,000 and crypto assets like ETH, XRP, and Solana soar, cementing US leadership in global crypto markets,” Lee said. 

However, he cautioned that “a lack of actionable steps might disappoint investors, underscoring the high stakes of this event.”

Lee’s comments come mere hours before the highly anticipated event and against a backdrop of markets in turmoil.

Traders have placed bullish bets that Bitcoin’s price will hit $120,000 by the end of March, and analysts like Maelstrom’s Arthur Hayes say the price could jump above $200,000 by the end of 2025.

Bitcoin sank on Friday as traders digested the details of Trump’s executive order to establish a national crypto stockpile, which fell short of expectations.

Trump’s order establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile, but with no immediate purchases — only seized crypto. 

This dashed investor hopes for a multibillion-dollar buying spree and, combined with uncertainties related to Trump’s foreign policies, triggered a sell-off that sent Bitcoin tumbling.

Bitcoin dropped as low as $84,800 before it recovered to $89,000 in the hours leading up to the crypto summit.

Despite the flat price action, the shift in US policy is noteworthy. 

“We went from no spot Bitcoin ETF to strategic Bitcoin reserve in just over a year,” said ETFStore President Nate Geraci.

When Trump first proposed the reserve in Nashville last year, traders speculated that the US would embark on a multibillion-dollar buying spree, fuelling a months-long rally.

While some see the reserve as a step toward legitimising Bitcoin as a strategic asset, others criticised the government’s involvement, arguing it risks turning into a de-facto, state-run crypto hedge fund.

Beyond Bitcoin, the executive order also outlined a broader digital asset stockpile. 

The executive order didn’t name any other digital assets by name, but Trump indicated earlier this week that he’d like to include Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP in it. 

These tokens all fell sharply after the government confirmed it wouldn’t be buying them any time soon.

“So the government made all these L1 founders come to DC to kiss the ring, and the night before published the news that they’re not actually buying their bags after all,” tweeted Nic Carter, co-founder and partner at Castle Island Ventures.

Ethereum fell 4.4%, Solana lost 3.2%, Cardano slid 7.9%, and XRP dropped 1.4% as traders unwound bets on a US-backed buying spree.

However, they have mostly recovered their losses and are now trading flat, just as those closest to the projects gather in Washington, looking for answers.

WASHINGTON – As part of a coordinated international effort, the United States Secret Service seized website domains linked to Russian cryptocurrency exchange, Garantex and froze multiple crypto currency assets owned by the exchange. Garantex allegedly facilitates sanctions violations and money laundering by transnational criminal organizations—including terrorist organizations. Since April 2019, Garantex has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions.

On March 6, the Secret Service seized three website domain names used to support Garantex’s operations. The seizure order was authorized by a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia. These sites are Garantex.org, Garantex.io, and Garantex academy and are associated with the administration and operation of Garantex. The seizures prevent the owners and third parties from using the sites for money laundering. Individuals visiting those sites will now see a message indicating that the site was seized by law enforcement. The Secret Service also froze over $26 million in crypto currency transactions made through the site that were used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering activities. In addition, indictments were unsealed against Lithuanian national Aleksej Besciokov and Russian national Aleksandr Mira Serda for their alleged roles in the operation of Garantex. 

“The seizure of website domains associated with Garantex’s operations and the freezing of over $26 million in cryptocurrency strikes a serious financial blow to cybercriminals worldwide,” said Michael Centrella, Assistant Director of the U.S. Secret Service’s Office of Field Operations. “Alongside our U.S. and international law enforcement partners, this coordinated action will prevent additional funds from falling into the hands of criminals.”

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to U.S. victims. According to the indictment, Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that criminal proceeds were being laundered through Garantex and took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities on its platform. For example, when Russian law enforcement sought records relating to an account registered to Mira Serda, Garantex provided incomplete information in response and falsely claimed the account was not verified. In reality, Garantex had associated the account with Mira Serda’s personal identifying documents, even while disclosing identifying information related to other accounts requested by Russian law enforcement.

As part of the coordinated actions, German and Finnish law enforcement seized servers hosting Garantex’s operations. Those servers have been taken offline at various locations around the world. U.S. law authorities have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex’s servers, including customer and accounting databases. The FBI also assisted with the investigation.

Scientists Date Remains of an Ancient Child That Resembles Both Humans and Neanderthals

NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have dated the skeleton of an ancient child that caused a stir when it was first discovered because it carries features from both humans and Neanderthals.

The child's remains were discovered 27 years ago in a rock shelter called Lagar Velho in central Portugal. The nearly complete skeleton was stained red, and scientists think it may have been wrapped in a painted animal skin before burial.

When the humanlike child was discovered, scientists noted that some of their attributes — including body proportions and jawbone — looked Neanderthal. The researchers suggested that the child was descended from populations in which humans and Neanderthals mated and mixed. That was a radical notion at the time, but advances in genetics have since proven those populations existed — and people today still carry Neanderthal DNA. 

But trying to figure out when exactly the child lived has been difficult. Small roots had grown through the bones and contamination — from plants or other sources — made it impossible for scientists to use traditional carbon dating to measure the child's age. They instead dated the charcoal and animal bones around the skeleton to between 27,700 and 29,700 years ago.

Techniques have improved, and researchers reported Friday in the journal Science Advances that they were able to date the skeleton by measuring part of a protein that's found primarily in human bones. 

Examining part of a crushed arm, they revealed that the earlier estimate was in the ballpark: the skeleton was from between 27,700 and 28,600 years ago.

“Being able to successfully date the child felt like giving them back a tiny piece of their story, which is a huge privilege,” said Bethan Linscott, a study author now at the University of Miami, in an email.

She noted the initial discovery was more than a skeleton — it was also the grave of a young child. When dating the bones, she couldn’t help but wonder who loved the child, what made them laugh and what their world looked like in the short four years they walked the planet.

Paul Pettitt, an archaeologist at Durham University in England who was not involved with the new research said in an email that the study is an example of how dating methods are becoming more effective and helping scientists better understand the past.

The study of where humans came from is important “for the same reason we keep the portraits of our parents and grandparents,” said study author João Zilhão from the University of Lisbon.

“It's a way of remembering,” he said.

	Experts argue that current tests are distracting and new ones are needed

Measuring progress in health care AI performance relies heavily on question-answer tests, researchers argue, and not enough on evaluating real-world medical tasks.

Artificial intelligence algorithms are being built into almost all aspects of health care. They’re integrated into breast cancer screenings, clinical note-taking, health insurance management and even phone and computer apps to create virtual nurses and transcribe doctor-patient conversations. Companies say that these tools will make medicine more efficient and reduce the burden on doctors and other health care workers. But some experts question whether the tools work as well as companies claim they do.

AI tools such as large language models, or LLMs, which are trained on vast troves of text data to generate humanlike text, are only as good as their training and testing. But the publicly available assessments of LLM capabilities in the medical domain are based on evaluations that use medical student exams, such as the MCAT. In fact, a review of studies evaluating health care AI models, specifically LLMs, found that only 5 percent used real patient data. Moreover, most studies evaluated LLMs by asking questions about medical knowledge. Very few assessed LLMs’ abilities to write prescriptions, summarize conversations or have conversations with patients — tasks LLMs would do in the real world.

The current benchmarks are distracting, computer scientist Deborah Raji and colleagues argue in the February New England Journal of Medicine AI. The tests can’t measure actual clinical ability; they don’t adequately account for the complexities of real-world cases that require nuanced decision-making. They also aren’t flexible in what they measure and can’t evaluate different types of clinical tasks. And because the tests are based on physicians’ knowledge, they don’t properly represent information from nurses or other medical staff.

“A lot of expectations and optimism people have for these systems were anchored to these medical exam test benchmarks,” says Raji, who studies AI auditing and evaluation at the University of California, Berkeley. “That optimism is now translating into deployments, with people trying to integrate these systems into the real world and throw them out there on real patients.” She and her colleagues argue that we need to develop evaluations of how LLMs perform when responding to complex and diverse clinical tasks.

Science News spoke with Raji about the current state of health care AI testing, concerns with it and solutions to create better evaluations. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

SN: Why do current benchmark tests fall short?

Raji: These benchmarks are not indicative of the types of applications people are aspiring to, so the whole field should not obsess about them in the way they do and to the degree they do.

This is not a new problem or specific to health care. This is something that exists throughout machine learning, where we put together these benchmarks and we want it to represent general intelligence or general competence at this particular domain that we care about. But we just have to be really careful about the claims we make around these datasets.

The further the representation of these systems is from the situations in which they are actually deployed, the more difficult it is for us to understand the failure modes these systems hold. These systems are far from perfect. Sometimes they fail on particular populations, and sometimes, because they misrepresent the tasks, they don’t capture the complexity of the task in a way that reveals certain failures in deployment. This sort of benchmark bias issue, where we make the choice to deploy these systems based on information that doesn’t represent the deployment situation, leads to a lot of hubris.

SN: How do you create better evaluations for health care AI models?

Raji: One strategy is interviewing domain experts in terms of what the actual practical workflow is and collecting naturalistic datasets of pilot interactions with the model to see the types or range of different queries that people put in and the different outputs. There’s also this idea that [coauthor] Roxana Daneshjou has been doing in some of her work with “red teaming,” with actively gathering a group of people to adversarialy prompt the model. Those are all different approaches to getting at a more realistic set of prompts closer to how people actually interact with the systems.

Another thing we are trying is getting information from actual hospitals as usage data — like how they are actually deploying it and workflows from them about how they are actually integrating the system — and anonymized patient information or anonymized inputs to these models that could then inform future benchmarking and evaluation practices.

Sponsor Message

There are approaches that exist from other disciplines [like psychology] about how to ground your evaluations in observations of reality to be able to assess something. The same applies here — how much of our current evaluation ecosystem is grounded in the reality of what people are observing and what people are either appreciating or struggling with in terms of the actual deployment of these systems.

SN: How specialized should model benchmark testing be?

Raji: The benchmark that is geared towards question answering and knowledge recall is very different from a benchmark to validate the model on summarizing doctors’ notes or doing questioning and answering on uploaded data. That kind of nuance in terms of the task design is something that I’m trying to get to. Not that every single person should have their own personalized benchmark, but that common task that we do share needs to be way more grounded than multiple-choice tests. Because even for real doctors, those multiple-choice questions are not indicative of their actual performance.

SN: What policies or frameworks need to be in place to create such evaluations?

Raji: This is mostly a call for researchers to invest in thinking through and constructing not just benchmarks but also evaluations, at large, that are more grounded in the reality of what our expectations are for these systems once they get deployed. Right now, evaluation is very much an afterthought. We just think that there’s a lot more attention that could be paid towards the methodology of evaluation, the methodology of benchmark design and the methodology of just assessment in this space. 

Second, we can ask for more transparency at the institutional level such as through AI inventories in hospitals, wherein hospitals should share the full list of different AI products that they make use of as part of their clinical practice. That’s the kind of practice at the institutional level, at the hospital level, that would really help us understand what people are currently using AI systems for. If [hospitals and other institutions] published information about the workflows that they sort of integrate these AI systems into, that can also help us think of better evaluations. That kind of thing at the hospital level will be super helpful.

At the vendor level too, sharing information about what their current evaluation practice is — what their current benchmarks rely on — helps us figure out the gap between what they are currently doing and something that could be more realistic or more grounded.

SN: What is your advice for people working with these models?

Raji: We should, as a field, be more thoughtful about the evaluations that we focus on or that we [overly base our performance on.]

It’s really easy to pick the lowest hanging fruit — medical exams are just the most available medical tests out there. And even if they are completely unrepresentative of what people are hoping to do with these models at deployment, it’s like an easy dataset to compile and put together and upload and download and run.

But I would challenge the field to be a lot more thoughtful and to pay more attention to really constructing valid representations of what we hope the models do and our expectations for these models once they are deployed.

Brain scans, postmortem dissections, artificial intelligence and lab mice reveal differences in the brain that are linked to sex. Do we know what they mean?

You're holding two wrinkly human brains, each dripping in formaldehyde. Look at one and then the other. Can you tell which brain is female and which is male?

You can't.

Humanity has been hunting for sex-based differences in the brain since at least the time of the ancient Greeks, and it has largely been an exercise in futility. That's partly because human brains do not come in two distinct forms, said Dr. Armin Raznahan, chief of the National Institute of Mental Health's Section on Developmental Neurogenomics.

"I'm not aware of any measure you can make of the human brain where the male and female distributions don't overlap," Raznahan told Live Science.

But the question of how male and female brains differ may still matter, because brain diseases and psychiatric disorders manifest differently between the sexes. Disentangling how much of that difference is rooted in biology versus the environment could lead to better treatments, experts argue.



There are many different disorders of the brain — psychiatric and neurologic diseases — that occur with different prevalence and are expressed in different ways between sexes, said Dr. Yvonne Lui, a clinician-scientist and vice chair of research in NYU Langone's Department of Radiology. "Trying to understand baseline differences can help us better understand how diseases manifest."

Now, thanks in part to artificial intelligence (AI), scientists are starting to reliably distinguish male and female brains using subtle differences in their cellular structures and in neural circuits that play a role in a wide range of cognitive tasks, from visual perception to movement to emotional regulation. Other studies point to sex-based differences in human brain structure that may be present from birth, and still other, lab-based research in animals points to sex-based differences in how brain cells fire at a molecular level.

What's still completely unclear is to what extent these differences matter. Do they change how people's brains function or how susceptible they are to disease? Should they dictate which treatments doctors offer to each patient? Even as scientists pinpoint subtle brain differences between females and males, their research inevitably runs up against tricky questions of how sex, gender and culture interplay to sculpt human cognition.

Right now, it's impossible to answer these big questions. But ongoing and future research — focused on lab animals, human chromosomes and brain development, and subjects followed from youth through adulthood — could start to reveal how these sex-based differences concretely affect cognition, and ultimately, the development of diseases of the brain.

Historically, scientists used purported brain differences to make sweeping statements about how men and women think and behave and to justify sexist beliefs that women were innately less intelligent and less capable than men.

While that early research has been discredited, modern studies still find cognitive differences between men and women — at least on average. For example, men reportedly perform better on tests of spatial ability, while women are better at interpreting the facial expressions of others. But men and women are raised and treated very differently in society, so what's at the root of these differences? Is it nature or nurture, or both?

"It's actually incredibly difficult in humans to … causally distinguish how much of a sex difference is societally or environmentally driven," Raznahan said. "We have all of these assumptions and biases that sort of slip into our heads through the back door without us realizing."

Given the dubious history of studying sex differences in the brain, and the logistical difficulty of doing it the right way, one might wonder why scientists bother. For many, it's because neurological diseases and psychiatric conditions seem to play out differently in males and females, and both biological and environmental factors could explain why that is.

Data suggest women experience higher rates of depression and migraine than men do, while men have higher rates of schizophrenia and autism. About twice the number of men develop Parkinson's disease than women do, but women with the condition tend to have faster-progressing disease. All these data come from studies that don't necessarily distinguish sex from gender — "sex" describes biology, while "gender" reflects self-identity, as well as societal roles and pressures. Lumping the two concepts together muddies our understanding of why a given difference exists.

For instance, pubescent girls are more likely to experience depression than boys are, which may be related to how their maturing brains handle stress or the possibility that they encounter more stressful events than boys do at that age. Conversely, do boys' brains make them resilient against depression, or are they actually going underdiagnosed due to social stigma? The answers to these questions point to different solutions.



Thanks to brain-scanning techniques like MRI, scientists have found subtle sex differences in the size, shape and thickness of various brain structures, as well as differences in networks that link different parts of the brain.

But these differences are small to negligible when you account for the average size difference between males and females, argues Lise Eliot, a professor of neuroscience at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science and author of "Pink Brain, Blue Brain" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009).

Eliot and colleagues recently looked at about 30 years of studies, finding that, on average, male brains are 6% larger than female brains at birth and grow to be 11% larger by adulthood. This makes sense because average brain size scales along with average body size, and male bodies tend to be larger. But when you take this overall size difference into account, subtler structural differences between male and female brains shrink to the point of negligibility, the researchers concluded.

"There are maybe species-wide sex differences in the brain, but so far, they haven't been proven," Eliot told Live Science. "And so if they exist, they must be pretty small."

Nonetheless, some scientists have reported differences that they say don't scale with body size. Some examples came from a research group who'd crunched MRI data from over 40,000 adult brains scanned for the UK Biobank, a repository of medical data from 500,000 adults in the United Kingdom.



In that study, males had a larger thalamus, a relay station for sensory information. They also had a larger putamen, which helps control movement and forms part of a feedback loop that tells you whether a movement was well executed. Females, on average, had a larger left-side nucleus accumbens, part of the brain's reward center, and a bigger hippocampus, the storage site for short-term memories of facts and events that also helps transfer the information to long-term memory.

But neither this nor other studies have revealed a specific feature that reliably distinguishes a given male brain from a female brain, since the size ranges seen in each sex largely overlap, Raznahan and colleagues noted in a letter responding to that study.

For the few size differences that do exist, it's currently impossible to say whether they explain any differences in cognition linked to sex, or alternatively, whether they actually make males' and females' cognition more similar, the letter authors noted. Perhaps male and female brains operate slightly differently to reach the same output — to "counterbalance" differences in hormones or genetics that may affect brain function, they wrote.

"When we're just talking about describing a difference in a measurement, that's not saying anything about whether it's got any functional relevance at all," Raznahan emphasized.

While large-scale structural features might not distinguish male and female brains, AI is helping to uncover other, subtler features that may differentiate the two. Some of these differences appear on the level of the brain's microstructure, meaning its individual cells and components of those cells.

For instance, a study published in May 2024 used different AI models to analyze brain scans from 1,030 young adults ages 22 to 37 years old. The research primarily focused on white matter, the bundles of insulated wiring that run between neurons. "I believe ours is the first study to detect brain microstructural differences between sexes," said Lui, who co-authored the study.

The AI models analyzed differences in both local landmarks in the brain — such as the corpus callosum, which connects the brain's two halves — and the highways that connect distant cells. It also looked at differences in how the white matter was bundled together, as well as in how dense and well insulated those bundles were.

The algorithms accurately predicted the sex of the subject tied to a given scan 92% to 98% of the time. That remaining gap in accuracy likely comes down to the "huge amount of variance in humans," Lui said.

No single part of the brain could be used to make predictions; one model relied on 15 distinct regions of white matter. All models showed some consistencies, though, with the largest white matter structure that crosses the midline, the corpus callosum, standing out as key.



Lui and colleagues' study was not designed to address how an individual's upbringing or environment shapes the brain. Nor did it aim to disentangle biological differences in the brain from those rooted in gender.

Sex describes biological differences in anatomy, physiology, hormones and chromosomes. Sex traits are categorized as male or female, although some people's traits don't fit neatly in either category. Gender, on the other hand, is cultural. It encompasses how people identify and express themselves, as well as how they are treated and expected to behave by others. Genders include man and woman, as well as others, including those that fall under the umbrella term nonbinary or are unique to specific cultures, like the māhū of Hawai'i.

Historically, studies have conflated sex and gender. To tease these factors apart and see how each manifests in the brain, it would be helpful to follow people over time as their brains are developing — and new research is beginning to do just that.

For example, a 2024 study looked at average brain volume in over 500 newborns: Males' brains were 6% larger overall, even after accounting for differences in birth weight, and females had larger gray-to-white matter ratios. (Gray matter, the cell bodies of neurons, is primarily found in the outer layer of the brain, called the cortex.) That average difference in gray matter is also seen in adults, which makes sense given that larger brains need more white matter to relay signals between far-apart cells.

Statistically, these big-picture brain differences were more significant than differences seen in smaller structures. Females had larger corpus callosa, as well as more gray matter around the hippocampus and in a key emotion-processing hub called the left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG). Males had more gray matter in parts of the temporal lobe involved in sensory processing, as well as in the subthalamic nucleus, key for movement control. But sex could only explain a fraction of the variance seen in these structures.



Some of these brain differences are "present from the earliest stage of postnatal life" and persist into adulthood, the authors noted. This applies mostly to the global differences, but also potentially to some of the smaller ones. For example, some studies — but not all — show that the left ACG is also larger in adult females, not only in babies.

Durable differences present from birth are likely sex-based. But differences that emerge or disappear in later life, like those in the hippocampus, may be influenced by the environment, or else reflect sex differences in development, including hormonal shifts in puberty.

Studies like this can help tease apart the influence of sex and gender on the brain. At present, there's a "massive gap" in our understanding of how these factors shape the brain independently and in tandem, said Elvisha Dhamala, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in New York.

Dhamala and colleagues recently aimed to fill in that gap using data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, an enormous U.S.-based study of brain development and child health. They incorporated functional MRI (fMRI) scans from nearly 4,800 children; fMRI tracks blood flow in the brain to give an indirect measure of brain activity. Each child joined the study at age 9 or 10 and will be followed for 10 years, which will enable follow-up studies.

The fMRI scans highlighted linked brain areas, or networks that lit up as the children did different tasks, including memory tests that required them to recall several images. The children and their parents also answered questions about the kids' feelings about their genders and how they typically play and express themselves. "It's not anything clinical," Dhamala noted. "It's just an aspect of behavior that represents your gender."

These answers were used to generate "scores" for each child that the AI algorithm could use as data points.



The algorithm ultimately revealed two largely distinct brain networks tied to sex and gender. The brain differences most strongly tied to sex were found in networks responsible for processing visual stimuli and physical sensations, controlling movement, making decisions and regulating emotions. Differences tied to gender were more widely dispersed, involving connections within and between many areas in the cortex.

After pinpointing these networks, the researchers trained their AI algorithms to "predict" a child's sex or gender based on brain activity. They accurately determined most children's sexes, similar to the results of Lui's study. Gender proved trickier: With the children's questionnaire answers, the AI couldn't predict where they landed on a continuum of gender, whereas with the parents' answers, its predictive power exceeded chance but was still "much lower" than the predictions for sex, Dhamala said.

Nonetheless, the study highlighted an understudied idea: that gender sculpts the brain in ways that are distinct from sex, she said.

Interestingly, some tentative lines can be drawn between Lui's and Dhamala's AI-powered studies. They can't be directly compared, as the two studies used different types of analyses and focused on different features of the brain. But many of the physical white matter tracts flagged in the former study correspond with functional networks highlighted in the latter, Dhamala told Live Science.

As an example, the cingulum — a white-matter tract that encircles the corpus callosum — seemed key for making predictions in Lui's study. It also links together various networks flagged in Dhamala's study, including circuits involved in emotional processing. That hints that sex differences exist in both the physical anatomy of these networks and in their activation patterns, Dhamala said.

Scientists have made some progress at teasing out sex differences in the brain, but to truly understand these distinctions, researchers will need to do more animal studies to allow for more experimental control, according to a 2020 paper co-authored by Raznahan.

Various studies in lab rats have already revealed differences in how males and females form connections between neurons, and how each sex processes fearful memories, for example.

In humans, scientists can collect more brain data right at the time of birth, to pinpoint baseline differences that might exist before a child encounters any cultural influences, and then track the child over time, Raznahan and colleagues added.

Another option is to study human genes that are unique to either the X or Y chromosome. By looking at people with extra or missing sex chromosomes, for example, scientists have started to unravel how these genes either inflate or shrink brain structures, contributing to sex differences in size. Chromosomes may also raise or lower the risk of disorders — for instance, carrying an extra Y raises the likelihood that a person has autism, whereas an extra X does not. That may help to explain why males, who usually carry one X and one Y, have higher autism rates than females, who typically have two Xs.

Right now, the fate of such research is uncertain in the U.S.

Prompted by executive orders from the new presidential administration, the National Science Foundation has been combing through active research projects to see if they include words that might violate said orders, such as "woman," "female" and "gender," and the National Institutes of Health appeared to archive a long-standing policy requiring both male and female lab animals in studies.

—Men have a daily hormone cycle — and it's synced to their brains shrinking from morning to night

—Pregnancy shrinks parts of the brain, leaving 'permanent etchings' postpartum

—Babies' brain activity changes dramatically before and after birth, groundbreaking study finds

"There's just a lot of uncertainty," Dhamala told Live Science. If the worst case scenario comes to pass, "removing that gender component, or making it harder to study sex differences, is going to push us backward rather than forward."

But if the field survives, future work could incorporate gender the way the ABCD study did, using questionnaires to generate composite scores, Dhamala said. As a start, scientists could at least ask study participants what gender they identify as, she added. Other experts agree.

By adopting these strategies, scientists could dramatically advance this research field that dates back to Aristotle. Their efforts could lend new talking points to the endless debate of nature versus nature. They could uncover meaningful sex differences that pave the way to better treatments for depression, Alzheimer's and more. Or they could highlight the ways members of the "opposite sex" are actually more alike than they are different.

Neuroscience research has only recently begun to prioritize the inclusion of both male and female lab animals in studies. Could we see that shift reverse?

Actions taken by the Trump administration have spurred changes at America's major science agencies — and if worst comes to worst, these shifts may jeopardize our understanding of how the brain works and how to treat neurological conditions, experts told Live Science.

For years, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has upheld a policy that requires scientists who work with vertebrate animals to consider "sex as a biological variable." To earn grants, researchers must explain how their study designs account for sex, such that any differences between the sexes will be made apparent. Researchers must provide strong scientific justification to include only one sex in a study.

But recently, The Transmitter reported that the NIH seems to have archived this policy. The NIH has yet to issue an official statement on the matter, but the move followed executive orders issued by the Trump administration that called for overturning "gender ideology" and "radical" diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

In apparently archiving its "sex as a biological variable" policy, the NIH could be signaling a shift away from requiring both males and females in research. And such a shift could be particularly dire for basic neuroscience research.

Emerging animal research is revealing fundamental differences between male and female brains. These differences manifest in how sex hormones influence brains at the basic level of memory formation and neuronal firing, for example, and evidence suggests these differences may be relevant not just to lab animals, but also to humans. Failing to include both sexes in lab research could lead us to miss fundamental forces that shape the human brain and how drugs affect it.

"If the fundamental mechanisms by which molecules sculpt neurophysiology differ between the sexes, then we need to know that as early as possible in the process," said Catherine Woolley, a professor of neurobiology at the Northwestern University Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.

Are male and female brains wired differently? The question has beguiled humanity for centuries, but scientists have only recently begun to find answers.

That's partly because, to uncover differences between males and females, you must study both sexes, including in research with lab animals. But scientists haven't done that until relatively recently.

Animal studies enable experiments that would be impossible with humans. Researchers can't slice living people's heads open, pluck out their neurons or implant electrodes with wild abandon.

Human subjects also come with baggage — namely, men and women are raised differently and have different life experiences. These cultural factors shape the brain alongside biological factors, like hormones and chromosomes, making it difficult to separate nature from nurture.

Historically, however, scientists simply ignored the variable of sex by excluding females altogether. This bias was particularly pronounced in neuroscience — one 2009 review found that studies with exclusively male lab animals outnumbered those with females 5.5-to-1.

There was a concern that the reproductive cycle of female lab animals would "mess up the data, make it too variable," said Lise Eliot, a professor of neuroscience at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in Chicago. That idea has been thoroughly debunked, but for a time, the prevailing viewpoint was, "let's just study males and keep it simple," Eliot told Live Science.

Only in recent years has that attitude begun to shift.

Including female lab animals has led to findings that unseated long-held assumptions about how the brain works.

For instance, Woolley uses lab rats to study how the sex hormone estrogen drives synaptic plasticity, the brain's ability to dynamically strengthen or weaken connections between neurons over time. This process enables the ability to learn and form memories, and it also underlies the brain changes behind psychiatric conditions like addiction.

Woolley has shown that plasticity works differently in males and females.

Connections between two neurons grow stronger via a process called long-term potentiation, which unfolds in two phases: an early phase, which lasts a few hours, and a late phase, which lasts longer. A key enzyme — protein kinase A (PKA) — was thought to participate in only the later, long-lasting phase.

It dawned on me that perhaps the results that we were getting differed from the published literature because we were using female animals.

"We've shown that that's true only in males," Woolley said. For females, PKA is crucial for the early phase of long-term potentiation, she and her colleagues revealed.

In another study, the team uncovered a sex-specific difference in the hippocampus, a brain region key for learning and memory. They showed that, exclusively in female rats, a specific type of estrogen makes neurons more likely to trigger a signal, thanks to a "previously unknown" mechanism. This particular estrogen is made in the brains of both males and females, and it doesn't follow the same cycle as estrogen made by the female reproductive system.

In that research, the team was "doing an experiment that has been done before … and our results were different," Woolley told Live Science. "It dawned on me that perhaps the results that we were getting differed from the published literature because we were using female animals." Previous work had included only males.

Many drugs act at the connection points between neurons, so it's important to understand how those connections are formed and maintained, Woolley said. Therefore, findings from these animal studies could help inform future treatments and diagnostics for people, she added.

There are some key differences between rodents and people, including that the human menstrual cycle is about seven times longer than the comparable cycle in rodents. But many studies have probed the similarities and differences in how estrogens act on the rodent brain and the nonhuman primate brain.

Based on these data, Woolley suspects many observations in the rat brain will translate to humans, even if they're not exactly the same.

Beyond Woolley's lab, scientists have also uncovered nuances in how male and female mice store fearful memories.

When the researchers blocked signals from part of the amygdala — a key emotion-processing center involved in fear conditioning — it stopped fear memories from being "saved" in male mice, but not in females.

Then, they studied people with a genetic mutation in that same signaling pathway. Males with the mutation had trouble remembering that a cue on a screen would come with a mild electric shock, but the same mutation had no effect on females' memories.

That hints that males and females store fearful memories differently, and that could have implications for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the authors speculated. For instance, using a drug to block those amygdala signals after a traumatic event could help prevent PTSD in males but likely not in females.

Another study revealed cell-level differences in the nucleus accumbens, the core of the brain's reward system. More excitatory, or "activating," signaling occurs in the nucleus accumbens of female mice and rats, compared with males.

And several methods of damping that excitement in males do not work in females, the team found. That finding could be relevant for better understanding depression and addiction, since signaling in the reward system underlies both conditions, the study authors suggested.

A better understanding of these sex differences could lead to improved psychiatric and neurological treatments tailored to each sex, scientists argue. But the future of this research is uncertain given the changes that seem to be unfolding at America's premier science institutions.

—Can rats 'imagine'? Rodents show signs of imagination while playing VR games

—Neurons aren't the only cells that make memories in the brain, rodent study reveals

The fate of the NIH's "sex as a biological variable" policy is currently unknown. But if including both sexes in research is no longer prioritized, it could set back the whole field of biomedicine, Woolley emphasized.

"It is very important to understand that the Sex as a Biological Variable policy is not about sex differences research," Woolley told Live Science. "This policy is about all biomedical research and ensuring that the results of taxpayer-funded biomedical research are relevant to everyone: both men and women, both boys and girls."

	For each 1-degree-Celsius increase in sea temp, green sea turtles lay eggs over 6 days earlier

Green sea turtles are laying their eggs earlier in the season to cope with warming temperatures, a new study shows.

Green sea turtles are adjusting their nesting habits in response to rising global temperatures. Individual females are laying their eggs earlier in the season to cope with warmer conditions, researchers report in the February Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Scientists have long known that the sex of most turtle species is determined by incubation temperature — higher temperatures give life to females, and lower ones produce males. As climate change drives up temperatures, more females and fewer males are being born, potentially weakening populations. Extreme heat can also be lethal for the eggs.

To understand how turtles are adapting, conservation ecologist Annette Broderick and colleagues analyzed three decades of nesting data from around 600 tagged green turtles (Chelonia mydas) on the beaches of Northern Cyprus. The data included the number of successful hatchlings in each nest and temperatures during incubation. The team found that individual females nested earlier as temperatures rose, laying eggs just over six days earlier, on average, for each 1-degree-Celsius increase.

This is “the first time anyone looked at individual turtles and looked at how they’re changing,” rather than studying nesting behavior at a population level, says Broderick, of the University of Exeter in England.

While previous research has shown the nesting activity of whole turtle populations moving earlier, the new study confirms that individual turtles are actively adjusting their behavior in response to climate change. “This may seem like a foregone conclusion. It really isn’t,” says study coauthor Mollie Rickwood, a marine biologist at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. That’s because population-wide shifts in nesting behavior could be happening for multiple reasons.

“For example,” Broderick says, “each female may be consistent in the time she nests each year, but new recruits to the population may lay earlier than older nesters, therefore making the average earlier.” By looking at individual animals, the researchers showed that all females are adjusting their timing.

Along with temperatures, breeding experience and number of clutches laid in a year equally influenced the timing of nesting. Other studies suggest that the earlier egg-laying seen now in some turtle species seems to be enough to offset the effects of warming temperatures on the eggs.

“This gives them a much better outlook in the face of climate change,” Rickwood says.

Samsung Galaxy Buds FE 2 is in development as the successor to 2023's Galaxy Buds FE, according to a report. The purported true wireless stereo (TWS) earbuds are expected to replace the original Buds FE as the South Korean technology conglomerate's most affordable offering. The development of the product is said to have reached a “fairly advanced stage”. Although details remain scarce, the Galaxy Buds FE 2 are speculated to build upon the features of its predecessor.

According to a report by Dutch publication GalaxyClub, the purported Galaxy Buds FE 2 may come with the model number SM-R410. Notably, the Galaxy Buds FE has SM-R400N listed as the model number. Although the report does not shed light on the specifications of the purported TWS earbuds, they are speculated to be launched before the end of summer.

Their development is said to have reached a “fairly advanced stage”, with the company also reportedly developing its firmware. The report speculates Galaxy Buds FE 2 could be launched alongside the Galaxy Z Flip FE.

The original Galaxy Buds FE were launched in October 2023 as the company's most affordable TWS earbuds, priced at Rs. 9,999. They are offered in two colourways — Graphite and White. Nearly two years after their debut, Samsung could finally introduce their successor.

Samsung Galaxy Buds FE TWS sport a design similar to the Galaxy Buds Plus model with the wing tips. However, this time around, they come equipped with active noise cancellation (ANC). They offer support for touch controls along with a feature which allows it to switch between devices automatically.

The wireless headset has an IPX2 rating for splash resistance, which means it should survive light splashes of water. The company claims you get up to six hours of battery life with these earphones when ANC is enabled and a total of 21 hours without ANC, including the charging case.

WhatsApp, the most popular instant messaging app, continues to improve user experience with new features. The platform is frequently updating itself to enhance privacy, security, and customization. Now, the company has started rolling out 5 new features that will make messaging more convenient for the users.

WhatsApp first tests its new features with beta users before making them available to everyone. Over the last couple of months, several new tools have been in the testing phase, and now their stable version is being released worldwide. These features will personalize chats, improve notifications, and enhance video playback. Let’s take a closer look at what’s new!

WhatsApp users can now personalize their chat experience with colourful themes. Previously, users had limited options to customize their chat backgrounds, but now WhatsApp has introduced 20 vibrant chat themes and 30 new wallpapers. This feature allows users to set theirfavouritee colors for conversations, giving the app a fresh and personalized look.

Many users find the unread message notification dot annoying, especially when dealing with multiple messages. To fix this, WhatsApp has introduced a clear chat notification feature. Now, users can control how notifications appear and eliminate unnecessary message alerts. This feature can be accessed in the notification settings section.

WhatsApp introduced chat filters last year, making it easier to organize messages. Now, a new unread chat counter has been added to this feature. This means users can see the exact number of unread messages directly in the chat filter, ensuring no important message is missed.

A long-awaited feature is finally here! WhatsApp now allows users to change the video playback speed. Earlier, this was only possible for voice notes, but now users can watch videos at 1.5x or 2x speed. This is especially useful for quickly viewing long videos shared on the platform.Read Also

Have you ever skipped a highly-rated movie just because of the language issue- not available in either Hindi or English? For this kind of movie, Amazon Prime Video is working on a solution by testing AI-assisted dubbing, which will make it easier for viewers to enjoy foreign films and shows without relying solely on subtitles.

Prime Video comes with a vast library of international films and TV series, but many of them are never dubbed into other languages due to the high costs and effort involved.

Traditional dubbing use to happen with the professional voice actors to record new dialogue, a process that is both time-consuming and expensive. As a result, several great movies and shows remain inaccessible to a global audience.

To address this, Amazon is leveraging AI technology to create dubbed versions of select titles. This approach reduces dubbing costs and speeds up the process, ensuring that more content becomes available to viewers worldwide.

The AI dubbing system isn’t fully automated—it combines AI technology with human expertise. Here’s how it works:

Initially, Prime Video is rolling out AI-assisted dubbing for 12 titles, including:

The AI dubs will be available in English and Latin American Spanish, with more languages expected in the future.

Amazon has been actively working to make its platform more inclusive. The company already provides subtitles, closed captions, and audio descriptions for better accessibility. AI dubbing is the next step in ensuring that users can enjoy a seamless language-friendly streaming experience.

In the future, viewers may see a wider selection of movies and shows dubbed in multiple languages using AI, making foreign content more accessible than ever before.

Gboard, the default keyboard app that comes pre-installed on almost all Android devices is getting a visual change that might be making many uncomfortable.

As it turns out, the latest version of Gboard for Android beta has introduced circle and pill-shaped keys for select users. Instead of the rectangular keys most of us are familiar with, the new shapes seem to be frustrating many as it has messed up with their muscle memory.

And while there is no functional change as to how these keys work and that the new keys look more modern than they ever did, some are having a hard time using the “”Long press for symbols option, which appears directly above a letter. The new keys seem to be rolling out for users who are on Gboard beta build version 15.1, and currently there seems to be no way to revert to the old key style. However, users can try turning off key borders for a cleaner look.

To do so, open Gboard settings, navigate to Themes, select a theme and on the pop-up that appears, turn off the toggle named ‘Key borders’. Alternatively, you can also opt out of Gboard beta from the Google Play Store, uninstall and then reinstall the stable version to get back the rectangle keys.

At the moment, it is still unclear if Google will bring the design change to the stable version of the app, so we will have to wait a while to know more.

NEW ORLEANS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Former Attorney General of Louisiana, Charles C. Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”), announces that KSF has commenced an investigation into Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ACHC).





On September 27, 2024, the Company disclosed the receipt of a voluntary request for information from the U. S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York as well as a grand jury subpoena from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri “related to its admissions, length of stay and billing practices.” Then, on October 30, 2024, the Company disclosed that it had lowered its full-year 2024 revenue outlook to a range of $3.15 to $3.165 billion and its full-year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $725 to $735 million due in part to slower same-store patient day growth of only 3% in the month of October.



The Company has been sued in a securities class action lawsuit for failing to disclose material information, violating federal securities laws, which remains ongoing.



KSF’s investigation is focusing on whether Acadia’s officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to Acadia’s shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws.

10About Town at 4 p.m.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — A Republican bill in the Tennessee legislature could allow healthcare providers to deny patients some kinds of treatments and services, such as birth control, based on their religious, moral or ethical beliefs.

SB 0955 was introduced by Senator Ferrell Haile (R-Gallatin). It would prohibit healthcare providers from requiring medical workers to participate or pay for healthcare procedures and treatments that they don't agree with. The bill includes language meant to ensure healthcare providers continue following their duties to treat people — as long as those treatments "do not violate the healthcare provider's conscience."

The bill also said insurance companies that are contractually obligated to pay for procedures and treatments would still need to pay for them, even if a provider objects to a treatment.

The bill would also protect healthcare providers who choose not to provide treatment from civil lawsuits or criminal prosecution. However, the bill also says protections do not extend to "procedures, treatments, or services governed by federal law, including the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act."

It also does not extend to situations in which a person is in imminent danger of harming themselves or others.

"The bill prevents healthcare professionals from being forced to provide certain treatments, but it does not allow them to refuse care to specific groups of people," Haile said.

He said pharmacists who refuse to give prescriptions for birth control because they object to it would be protected under the bill.

The bill passed the Tennessee Senate Thursday in a 27-3 vote, with four senators not voting. It will be discussed in the House Health Subcommittee on March 12.

The survey, which takes less than 10 minutes to complete, is accessible now through March 21, 2025. Those interested in participating must be 18 years or older. Click on the links below to participate today!

Information derived from the survey responses will provide the Health System with a better understanding of community needs and help guide decisions on how best to tailor programs and services to address those needs. “We encourage the community to participate in this survey and share their thoughts on how Southeast Georgia Health System can better address the health needs of the populations that we serve,” says Christy Jordan, Interim President & CEO/Chief Legal Officer. “The survey results provide valuable feedback which influences our strategic planning, allocation of resources, and development of partnerships with local programs.”

The Affordable Care Act requires all not-for-profit hospitals to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment of their service areas every three years. In addition to surveying local residents in six counties, data is collected from public sources, health experts, and public health and federally qualified health centers. Previous survey findings have resulted in Health System investments in recruitment of additional primary care physicians, screenings for cancers and diabetes, and community health education. Results of the survey will be made available on the Health System’s website later this year.

A nonprofit healthcare clinic in Normal that serves a largely uninsured clientele is hoping an update to its patient income qualifications will encourage more people to seek services.

The Community Health Care Clinic [CHCC] is now accepting applicants who make up to 250% of the Federal Poverty Level [FPL], according to an email the clinic sent to donors. Previously, applicants could make up to 185% of the FPL.

Updated 2025 poverty guidance says that a single household falling within 250% should make no more than $39,125 a year and a four-family household, no more than $80,375 a year. This, according to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation

Executive Director Holly Wayland-Hall said in the email that the organization’s policy was outdated and forced the clinic to turn many potential clients away.

“In the last two years, CHCC had discharged or not accepted hundreds of patients who exceeded income qualifying criteria but otherwise had no other access to healthcare,” she said. “A review of applicant data and comparison with other free and charitable clinics in Illinois revealed that an increase was in order.”

This marks the first time CHCC — which offers primary, dental and behavioral health care — is updating its guidance for patient income qualifications since the nonprofit opened over three decades ago. The nonprofit noted that the minimum wage has increased by $10 since then.

CHCC is encouraging patients who were previously turned away, as well as new patients who meet the updated criteria to apply for services.

Wayland-Hall wrote in the email that the clinic’s hope is “that we can once again be the medical home for those who have no other way to access healthcare, so they can manage chronic medical conditions and be able to continue working and providing for their families.”

Robert Kennedy Jr., in an interview with Fox’s Dr. Marc Siegel, is promising not only to Make America Healthy Again but to also improve the U.S. healthcare system and pharmaceutical innovations.

Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. argued the United States has one of the worst health outcomes among other peer nations despite consumers paying substantially more for care. 

"We spend two to three times what other countries pay for public health, and we have the worst outcomes and that's not acceptable," RFK Jr. said during an interview with Fox’s Dr. Marc Siegel. 

He touted that in four years the country will be "even more the center of innovation around the globe" when it comes to developing drugs and certain therapies for patients.  

AMERICANS' INSURANCE RATES ARE SOARING AND LAWSUITS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE

In its Mirror 2024 study, the Commonwealth Fund compared the performance of health systems in 10 countries, including the United States. Its findings ranked the U.S. last, trailing behind Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK, in terms of health outcomes.

It was the Commonwealth Fund’s eighth report, which aimed to highlight lessons from the experiences of these nations, with special attention to how they might inform health system improvement in the U.S. 

According to the report, the differences between the other countries were "relatively small." Comparatively, the U.S. was described as being in "a class by itself in the underperformance of its healthcare sector" given that the other nine countries "found a way to meet their residents’ most basic health care needs, including universal coverage," the report read. 

The Peterson Foundation reported that wealthier countries will spend more on healthcare than countries that are less affluent. That said, the U.S. spends nearly twice as much per capita on healthcare compared to similarly large and wealthy nations and yet, its health outcomes are not any better than those in other developed countries, according to the foundation.

SOCIAL MEDIA USERS MOCK UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO’S MURDER

"The United States actually performs worse in some common health metrics like life expectancy, infant mortality, unmanaged diabetes, and safety during childbirth," August 2024 Peterson Foundation report read. 

The U.S. has also seen worsening measures of health outcomes since the COVID-19 pandemic too. 

According to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker, life expectancy was similar in the U.S. and peer countries on average in 1980 at about 73.7 and 74.6 years, respectively. However, peer nations saw more rapid improvement in life expectancy in the following decades. The gap between the U.S. and peer nations grew even more during the pandemic. In 2022, life expectancy in the U.S. 77.5 years, while the life expectancy in comparable countries was 82.2 years on average. 

There has been growing animosity against the U.S. healthcare system as consumers lambast companies for putting profits above human lives.

The entire insurance industry in particular has faced an onslaught of public scrutiny over its denials of care even before UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thomposon was gunned down outside a New York City hotel in December in what police have called a "pre-meditated, targeted attack."

For instance, a Senate subcommittee accused UnitedHealthcare Group last fall of denying claims to a growing number of patients as it tried to leverage artificial intelligence to automate the process. 

The report claimed that UnitedHealthcare’s prior authorization denial rate for post-acute care jumped from 10.9% in 2020 to 22.7% in 2022. 

United refuted these claims, saying the report "mischaracterizes the Medicare Advantage program and our clinical practices."

Boston, Massachusetts, March  07, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a major step toward transparency and efficiency in the healthcare and home service industry, MyVisits.net has officially launched its innovative Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) app. Founded by behavioral healthcare veteran Joseph Catan, the platform aims to modernize the way home visits are tracked, verified, and reimbursed.

  

MyVisits

Available now on Apple and Google Play stores, the MyVisits app is designed to help companies and healthcare providers accurately document in-home visits, track mileage, and ensure services are delivered as billed. With a user-friendly interface, automated verification features, and cloud-based convenience, MyVisits is poised to become an essential tool for agencies across the United States and, eventually, the world.

The figures underscore the urgency of a solution like this. An investigation in New York revealed $14.5 billion in unverified Medicaid home care services, which is less than half of the claims submitted, due to a lack of reliable tracking. Without proper visit verification, fraudulent claims and billing errors remain widespread.

Joseph Catan, who spent 15 years running a behavioral healthcare company, has seen these issues firsthand. “When we started, we were told by the practitioners that verifying that staff actually went to a client’s home as scheduled was a major challenge,” Catan recalls. “The existing system was unreliable and easy to manipulate.”

Traditional verification methods, like manual sign-ins and random phone call confirmations, only address a small percentage of visits, leaving the majority unchecked. Compounding the issue, companies are held financially responsible for fraudulent or inaccurate claims, leading to steep fines and compliance risks.

Determined to solve this long-standing problem, Catan developed MyVisits.net: a secure, automated solution that gives verifiable data in real-time, which shows that visits happen as scheduled.

This cloud-based solution utilizes geolocation with its seamless QR code scanning to ensure the authenticity of the records. It also automatically records mileage from practitioners’ departures to patients’ locations, eliminating the need for manual calculations and ensuring accurate reimbursements. Telehealth integration allows practitioners to document telehealth calls, logging start, duration, and end times for billing purposes without disclosing doctor-patient conversations. 

Unlike expensive custom-built software, MyVisits requires no additional hardware, making it accessible for smaller agencies with limited budgets. Catan emphasizes affordability as a key factor, stating, “Small and mid-sized agencies don’t have the resources to develop custom software. We designed the app to be accessible to all providers without the high costs of IT infrastructure.”

The launch of the MyVisits app aligns with the federal mandate for Electronic Visit Verification under the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016, which required digital tracking for Medicaid-funded home services. Yet, many agencies have struggled to comply due to the lack of a universal, industry-wide solution. “The MyVisits app provides the scalable, standardized solution the industry has been waiting for,” says Catan.

While the initial rollout is focused on North America, Catan envisions a global expansion. With healthcare systems worldwide facing similar challenges, MyVisits.net has the potential to become the go-to verification tool for home healthcare, behavioral health, nursing, and beyond. “We want to evolve alongside our clients,” Catan states. “As regulations change and industry needs shift, we will adapt. The reason we’re in this situation is because the industry wasn’t agile enough. We’re here to change that.” 

Future updates will incorporate additional features based on user feedback to ensure continuous improvements. Telehealth capabilities, already integrated into the platform, will continue to expand as virtual care becomes more prevalent. “At the end of the day, this isn’t just for compliance; we need to be able to deliver better patient care,” Catan concludes. “When visits are accurately tracked and verified, patients receive the services they need. And that’s what matters most—one verified visit at a time.”

The department of veterans affairs announced this week that they plan on cutting 80,000 jobs, as part of the Trump Administration's DOGE initiative. 

Iowa's News Now stopped in to the Freedom Foundation in Cedar Rapids, which serves hundreds of our veterans every week with a food pantry and other resources,  to hear what they have to say about the news.

Vice President Roger Jensen says he is not worried just yet. He says he's confident the Trump Administration is doing what they can by cutting access spending, but there is one fear he has and that's the medical needs of the veterans he serves.  

"I don't believe that those cuts will involve doctors, nurses, people that are necessary, as far as the health care. If it started cutting health care, were in big trouble because they're already short on doctors. I don't think it'll go so far to affect us that bad. I really don't. I'm confident in what he's doing," said Jensen.

The health care executive left Mary's Center last year.

Dr. Tollie Elliott, the former CEO of Mary's Center, is the new president at the expanding District Healthcare Services LLC in D.C., he posted on LinkedIn Thursday.

Tollie joins DHCS as its prepares to expand to a second clinic at 1800 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., a building known as Anacostia Gateway. The company also operates a clinic at 1445 Howard Road SE.

DHCS, which was founded by CEO Dr. Habib Shamte in 2018 and began services in 2019, serves Medicare and Medicaid patients with an aim to provide holistic care, including human, medical, behavioral and spiritual health needs, according to its website.

Shamte said Elliott will spearhead the clinical team with the goal of improving the clinic's efficiencies. The president position is a new role at the for-profit company, which has 400 employees.

He said DHCS is going through the certificate-of-need process to merge with Medical Home Development Group Inc. It also will begin using the Epic Systems Corp.'s medical record system next month.

In September, Mary's Center announced Elliott was resigning after eights years, including nearly three as CEO, with the D.C. nonprofit community health provider. He previously held the role of chief medical officer.

Elliott sued Mary's Center in December alleging the clinic breached his contract by terminating his employment without notice, defamed him and violated a handful of D.C. laws. He is seeking damages of at least $10 million, as well back pay, front pay, other bonuses and attorneys’ fees. The clinic called the allegations meritless; the case is pending.

Mangione said the letter was the first to make him ‘tear up’ as the mom, only identified as Karen, shared details of her daughter’s rare, life-threatening disease

Luigi Mangione has written a letter from his prison cell to a mother who ‘made him tear up’ as she detailed her struggles to pay for her daughter’s healthcare.

“Your letter is the first to make me tear up. I am so, so, sorry for what you and your daughter so senselessly had to endure,” Mangione wrote from his cell at the end of December. 

Mangione’s letter to “Karen” was shared with journalist and novelist Ashley Shelby, who published it on her Substack dedicated to the case. The mom, Karen, detailed how her daughter deals with a life-threatening condition. Karen told said that her daughter requires constant care and medical treatment and last year, costs mounted after she was hospitalized for 60 nights, according to the Substack.

“What she and I went through as a result of insurance calling the shots rather than the doctors is a horrible story,” Karen said. “She is improving, but hardly close to her old self.”

The mom referenced the famed mosaic of Christ in Majesty at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., and referred to it as “Warrior Jesus” in her letter. 

She vowed that she would “keep up the fight” in Mangione’s name.

Mangione has developed a following of fans since his arrest in connection to the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was fatally shot outside of a hotel in Midtown Manhattan on December 4. Mangione has pleaded not guilty. A specific motive for the killing has not been released, but many have speculated that is tied to Thompson’s role with the insurance company. 

The 26-year-old is awaiting trial in New York’s notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. New York, where he sent the letter from. 

“If you are able to send a photo of you/your daughter or the mosaic, it would mean a great deal to me,” Mangione wrote to mom. “I will put it up on my prison cell wall next to your letter. Your daughter is blessed to have a mother who loves her so much and fights for her so relentlessly.” 

Initially, Karen felt “very weird” about writing to Mangione, she said, but did so after being “driven by some force that didn’t make sense but couldn’t be ignored.”

The mom added that after hearing similar stories of Americans’ battles with health insurers, her anger has turned to determination to support “nurses and doctors, telling them that a change was surely coming.”

Mangione has been inundated with fan mail since he began his prison stint. 

Last month the murder suspect released his first public statement since his December arrest where he told supporters he reads every letter he receives.

“I am overwhelmed by - and grateful for - everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions, as mail has flooded MDC from across the country, and around the globe,” Mangione’s statement said. “While I can't reply to most letters, please know that I read every one that I receive. Thank you again to everyone who took the time to write. I look forward to hearing more in the future.”

Supporters have been donating to his legal defense fund, which currently stands at $641,491. One generous donor gave $30,000 last month.

Hundreds of his fans turned up in droves to support Mangione at his pre-trial hearing inside a New York courthouse last month.

“I think what happened was inevitable given the amount of tension” between Americans and the healthcare industry, one New Yorker told The Independent outside the court.

One person who traveled three hours from Maryland just to see the reaction to the hearing remarked on this tension: “Something’s gotta give and that something was Luigi Mangione …. he’s a go-getter.”

Another protester, who flew in from Chicago to show solidarity, said: “I think major changes are needed in insurance.” Thompson’s killing “brought a spotlight and a charge to take action against wrongdoing by corporate entities milking as much as they can from normal people.”

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers delivered his weekly radio address highlighting plans from his 2025-27 Executive Budget to crack down on insurance companies and prescription price gouging, lower out-of-pocket healthcare costs, reduce appointment wait times, and enable Wisconsinites to get healthcare closer to home, and expand access to affordable healthcare statewide, including in rural communities.

During his 2025-27 Biennial Budget Message, Gov. Evers announced several key initiatives to:

As part of Gov. Evers’ comprehensive plan to lower costs for working families, he is also proposing to eliminate the sales tax on over-the-counter medications, which would save Wisconsinites a projected $70 million over the next two years. Additional information on Gov. Evers’s plan to address the frustrating challenges Wisconsinites face with sweeping changes to the healthcare industry in Wisconsin is available here.

Audio File of Radio Address.

Hey there, Wisconsin! Governor Tony Evers here.

A key part of my plan to lower costs for working families includes making it easier for folks to get the healthcare they need without breaking the bank.

It’s why I’m again proposing to expand BadgerCare, which would save Wisconsin taxpayers nearly $2 billion over the next two years and expand quality, affordable healthcare coverage for about 100,000 Wisconsinites.

I’m also proposing sweeping plans to lower costs for prescriptions and medication and crack down on price gouging and health insurers.

My “Less for Rx” plan will lower costs for life-saving prescription drugs and insulin, including capping insulin copays at $35 and eliminating the sales tax on over-the-counter medications to save Wisconsinites $70 million over the next two years alone.

And I hear from folks all the time who feel like they’re getting ripped off by the healthcare industry and insurers. Wisconsinites aren’t getting a fair shake when it comes to healthcare, and I want to change that.

So, first things first: I want to make Wisconsin the first state in America to start auditing insurance companies over denying healthcare claims.

If an insurance company is going to deny your healthcare claim, they should have a darn good reason for it. So, under my plan, if an insurance company is denying Wisconsinites’ claims too often, we’re going to audit them. Pretty simple.

And here’s what else my plan would do: we’d create a new office to help Wisconsinites whose health insurance claims are denied, and we’re going to create new standards to expand the healthcare services and procedures that insurance companies are required to cover.

That means more healthcare services and procedures will be covered by your insurance automatically—no delays, no hassle, no questions asked.

And we’re working to make sure Wisconsinites know what you’re getting when you buy your insurance plan, to reduce wait times, and to make sure covered care is close to home, and so much more.

Folks, healthcare should not be a privilege afforded by only the healthy and the wealthy. Wisconsinites should be able to get the healthcare they need when they need it.

So, let’s make this a priority this session. Thank you.

Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. The company also has an ongoing Phase 1 study of its novel internally discovered FGFR2 inhibitor. In addition, the Cogent Research Team is developing a portfolio of novel targeted therapies to help patients fighting serious, genetically driven diseases targeting mutations in ErbB2, PI3Kα and KRAS.

Changes this year to Tricare, the military’s health care program, have brought cascading disruptions to millions of service members, their families and network providers nationwide.

About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid for months, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.

The disruptions to a network that provides benefits to about 9.6 million people have left military members scrambling to secure medical, behavioral and mental health services for themselves and their loved ones, as advocates worry about lasting repercussions.

In Tennessee, Army Sgt. Bo Heggins has relied on Tricare for years to cover occupational therapy for his 8-year-old son who has autism. Up to eight hours with a provider each week had helped his son learn life and conversational skills. The progress was visible, and Heggins, 35, had hope that his son could grow to live a happy, independent life.

Then, in mid-February, when Heggins and his wife tried to schedule another routine appointment, they learned the provider was one of many who had not been paid by Tricare, which threatened future coverage. In all the confusion, his son has not had a session since and has begun to regress.“There’s no longer improvement,” Heggins said, as he began to cry. “My son is my heart. And I want him to be the best person he can be.”

The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since Jan. 1, after a new contractor began managing benefits on the West Coast and in six Eastern states that were reallocated to the west region.

The DHA previously said the new contracts would “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries.

This situation has become untenable.

Brenda Stephens, a tricare provider

In a statement to NBC News, DHA spokesperson Brenda Campbell said the agency was working with the contractors to resolve the issues.Among the most severe: Several thousand health care providers have not been paid since December 2024 because of a data issue, officials said. Some say they are owed more than $100,000.

“This situation has become untenable,” said Brenda Stephens, who submitted $180,000 in claims for services that her mental health clinic in San Diego provided to military members this year.

Another mental health provider in San Diego said he has only had about $1,000 to spend in monthly income, received through cash-paying patients, since January.

Rodger Questin, 50, a clinical psychologist, said his private practice has accrued about $50,000 in unpaid Tricare claims. He has had to dip into his savings and said he has not bought a single item this year that he did not need.

“There are times where I’m like, what am I going to do?” he said. 

A spokesperson for Humana Military, the regional contractor for the east region, said the company learned in early January that a “small percentage” of providers’ records in the claims administration system had outdated or incorrect data, which prevented the claims from being processed.

The issue affected fewer than 16,750 providers. The Humana spokesperson said that figure was less than 1% of the total number of providers in and out of the network.

The company said it has been “working around the clock” to clear the backlog of unpaid claims.

“We have identified the root cause of this issue and have fixed the majority of the issues caused by the incorrect data,” the spokesperson said. “We take our commitment to TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and providers very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this problem has caused.”

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the new contractor for the west region, did not say how many providers there have also not been paid.

“All major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges, and we are working tirelessly seven days a week to implement solutions because there is nothing more important than ensuring military families get the care they earned,” a TriWest spokesperson said in a statement.

TriWest said it has processed 1.6 million claims since January and issued more than 351,000 Tricare referrals and authorizations for care.

In a statement to NBC News, DHA officials said it will take one to two weeks to determine if the technical fixes resolved the east region issues.

The agency said the contractors have met the contractual requirements to pay 98% of processed claims within 30 days and all claims within 90 days to date.

The DHA officials, citing the contractors, said no east region provider has left the network due to claims issues but that a few have left in the west.

Regarding payment issues on the West Coast, DHA officials said claim payments are “always slightly slower” in the first month of every calendar year to make sure Tricare rates have been properly applied. Contractors, they said, also verify that numbers and provider information in each claim are correct before money is paid.

“This time frame has now passed and claims are now flowing much faster,” the officials said. “Additionally, TriWest is actively contacting the few providers who have left the network to ask them to rejoin the network.”

NBC News spoke to more than half a dozen providers across the country who said they are still waiting to be reimbursed. Faced with a sudden cash flow crisis, many have had to make difficult and heartbreaking decisions.

In San Diego, Stephens took out a $75,000 loan at the beginning of February, but it only got her clinic through two payrolls. By the end of February, she had to pause services for all of her clinic’s 350 Tricare patients — some whom she said are in “desperate shape” — as well as lay off seven employees.

“It’s been nothing short of devastating. I feel a reaction in my whole body right now,” she said through tears. “We’ve been forced into an impossible situation. We can’t continue to treat them without being paid and they can’t find other providers.”

A Florida clinic that provides psychiatry and therapy services to about 300 people also recently decided it would have to stop treating Tricare patients after it racked up more than $100,000 in unpaid claims since Jan. 1, office manager Beth Matricia said.

You're talking about people who are suicidal.

“We’re going to have to charge them out of pocket because if we keep going this way, we’re going to have to close down,” said Matricia, who manages MAPS Integrated Wellness in the military community of Fernandina Beach.Matricia said she and other staff members fear the fallout will further affect the mental health of service members, who will likely not be able to afford the full cost of up to $150 per session.

“You’re talking about people who are suicidal,” she said. “If you stop their care, they can choose to end their life. It’s very hard to transfer therapists. It’s really hard to open up again.”

Ross Wise, a registered nurse who works with a psychiatrist at MAPS, said some of their patients are children struggling at school and adults dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.

“It might spiral someone down to a deep depression,” Wise said.

In Clarksville, Tennessee, Jenne Nesbitt-Decker, owner and chief financial officer of Mariposa Behavioral Health Services, a small clinic that treats children and teens who have autism, said she has had to cut the number of available appointments in half to make up for the lack of payments and the loss of one provider who quit.

If she still has not been paid by April 1, Nesbitt-Decker, who has four children and a mortgage, said she will have to stop serving Tricare patients, which she has done since 2007.

There is a growing concern that if providers continue to leave Tricare, it will worsen an existing health care worker shortage, said Eileen Huck, the National Military Family Association’s acting director of government relations.

“That exacerbates an already difficult problem,” she said. “What implications does that have for health care access for service members and their families? That’s really troubling.”

The monthslong upheaval has left Heggins, the service member whose young son has autism, to make his own agonizing choice.

His son’s provider told NBC News that if Tricare does not resolve the reimbursement issue in two weeks, her clinic will send out a 45-day notice to current Tricare clients to terminate services. Her office has already stopped accepting new Tricare patients.

While Heggins has served in the military for 16 years and had plans to give another four years, he said he is contemplating leaving the Army when his contract is up in June to find better care for his son.

“If my insurance won’t cover what I think is an essential, needed service, I might have to look at getting covered by other insurance,” he said.

Other options, Heggins said, include selling his vehicle and relying on his wife’s car to transport their family of six in order to afford out-of-pocket treatment, or taking out a loan. He sees hardship with any decision.

“It would be incredibly difficult,” he said. “I hope and pray that the Defense Health Agency figures this is out in a timely manner.”

PROVIDENCE – More than 40,000 Rhode Islanders could see their premiums balloon when enhanced tax credits under Obamacare that help subsidize the cost of their insurance expire this year, according to Protect Our Healthcare RI, a group of organizations advocating for more affordable and accessible health care.

The credits – known as advanced premium tax credits – date back to 2021, when Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act. The act increased the premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, making insurance more accessible and leading to record enrollment in ACA plans. In 2022 Congress extended the credits to 2025 with the Inflation Reduction Act.

In Rhode Island, they provide about $40 million worth of tax credits for Rhode Islanders who get their insurance through HealthSource RI, the state’s individual marketplace, which currently has about 46,000 enrollees. The advanced premium tax credits, however, are set to expire at end of 2025, and it is unclear whether Congress will extend them.

Advocates from Protect Our Healthcare RI have warned that the expiration of the credits could have vast consequences for many in the state. More than 90% of people enrolled in HealthSourceRI plans rely on them to afford their insurance.

Shamus Durac, co-chair of Protect Our Healthcare RI, gave a few examples of what the impact could look like:

On average, HealthSource RI estimated that monthly insurance premiums will increase by 85%.

That's for those who manage to keep their insurance. As many as 11,300 people could lose coverage entirely, according to a report from HealthSource RI.

“These are people who have very high medical needs, who are suddenly going to see significant increases in the cost of their care and may go without health insurance, and if that happens, we are going to see what we expect to see when people lose health insurance: [them] not getting care, worse health outcomes and more costs for the state in terms of hospitals paying for care,” Durac said.

Last year the coalition convened a working group to assess the impact of losing the credits and make policy recommendations. A bill – the Rhode Island Individual Marketplace Affordability Act (H7694) – based on the group’s recommendations seeks to plug the hole left by the expiring credits.

Durac explained that the bill would create a 1% assessment put on commercial insurers and other forms of insurance that would help fund ACA plans.

Sen. Pamela Lauria, the bill’s co-sponsor, said the matter was personal to her.

“I have been a primary care nurse practitioner for the last 27 years, which means before the [Affordable Care Act] was passed, and certainly before the enhanced benefits were passed. So I remember what it was to have patients that could not afford health insurance and what that meant to their health outcomes,” Lauria said at an event at the State House last week.

She added that passing the bill was not only the right thing to do but the “economically smart” thing to do, as it would not have an effect on the state budget.

“This needs to be personal for everyone," Lauria said. "We cannot let these people go over this cliff.”

After yet another record year for health data breaches, updated federal security rules to protect patient information are on the table in 2025. Patients and providers have long complained that HIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, is ill-suited to protect patients’ sensitive health data in the digital age — and in January, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed updated regulations to protect against the growing threat of cyberattacks.

But in thousands of public comments, health systems and providers have pushed back aggressively against the suggested changes to the security rule. Increased privacy protections, in their view, would impact the financial viability of medical practices — especially small ones — and even timely patient care.

“It’s frankly a blizzard of very technical requirements, which I think would understandably be intimidating and frightening to anything but the largest health care systems,” said David Blumenthal, who was national coordinator for health information technology under the Obama administration, of the proposed HIPAA security rule. “It does raise significant issues about whether small practices and small institutions can effectively protect patient privacy in the new age we’re living in.”

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. – Senior Elza Tomase earned her 90th career singles victory as the sixth-ranked Tennessee women's tennis team defeated No. 25 South Carolina in a 4-1 triumph. Tomase is the 15th player in program history to reach the 90-win mark.

"South Carolina is very good; they just came off of a fantastic win against Auburn," head coach Alison Ojeda said. "They are a heck of a team that fights for every single point. I thought our doubles teams did an outstanding job. Going into singles, Elza had a huge win against Sarah Hamner. Hamner is fantastic. To Elza's credit, she played very disciplined tennis. Elza has had an outstanding career at Tennessee and I am very proud of her. "

Tennessee (9-2, 3-1 SEC) got off to a hot start, grabbing a 1-0 advantage with back-to-back doubles wins against South Carolina (7-5, 2-2 SEC). The pairing of Tomase and Maeve Thornton landed their first win together, taking down the No. 36-ranked duo of Sarah Hamner and Kaitlyn Carnicella, 6-0. The freshmen tandem of Conley Raidt and Saray Yli-Piipari edged Helena Buchwald and Misa Malkin in a 6-3 affair. The No. 52-ranked duo of Catherine Aulia and Leyla Britez Risso were mounting a comeback against Bella Larsson and Olympe Lancelot, 3-5 when play halted.

"All three of our doubles courts came out with so much energy," Thornton shared. It was our SEC match at home, so we wanted to take advantage of that. Elza Tomase and I clicked together and played very well. Kudos to Conley Raidt and Saray Yli-Piipari as well. Everyone fought so hard. 

In singles, the Big Orange found its groove and never looked back. No. 8 Tomase filed her 90th singles career victory against No. 19 Sarah Hamner, 6-3, 7-5, to put UT up by two. No. 103 Britez Risso posted a 7-6(2), 6-2 decision. Thornton added the final point from a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 triumph over Lancelot.

"It is a big honor to be beside all of the outstanding former Lady Vols that came before me," Tomase said. "It means a lot, but this team means more to me. I am really happy that we got this win today and I am really proud of everyone."

Francesca Mattioli was the lone Lady Vol to drop a contest, falling to No. 93 Misa Malkin, 5-7, 4-6.

Up Next: Tennessee will hit the road to face top-ranked Georgia on Sunday. The match is slated for 1 p.m. at Dan MaGill Tennis Complex.

Match Notables:

The win marked the 797th victory for the Tennessee women's tennis program.

Head coach Alison Ojeda now owns 152 victories during her tenure and is the third-winningest coach in program history.

Ojeda also tallied her 197th career win, moving her just three shy of 200 victories.

Tennessee collected its 39th victory against the Gamecocks, improving its all-time record to 39-24. 

The Lady Vols earned the doubles point for the eighth time this season.

The Big Orange have knocked off six ranked opponents thus far, defeating No. 15 Texas Tech, No. 15 Pepperdine, No.4 Stanford, No. 67 Kentucky, No. 71 Ole Miss and No. 25 South Carolina.

Conley Raidt and Saray Yli-Piipari earned their second win together in doubles, remaining flawless on the season.

O'Leary currently has her Cavaliers ranked No. 1 in the country.

Just last week, Virginia women’s tennis became the No. 1 team in the nation, an achievement never before earned in program history. To some, this surge to the top may seem sudden, even unexpected, but for this program, it has been years in the making. And at the center of it all is the coach who has transformed the program in under a decade.

When Coach Sara O’Leary took the helm June 12, 2017, the team was coming off a season in which it finished ranked No. 43. Almost eight years later, O’Leary has not only rebuilt the program but turned it into an ACC powerhouse and a national title contender. Her accolades speak for themselves — 2024 ACC Coach of the Year, two-time ITA Atlantic Region Coach of the Year and six NCAA Tournament appearances. 

Under her leadership, the Cavaliers have consistently ascended into the top 10 of the rankings, reaching No. 9 in 2019-20 as well as a record-breaking No. 4 in 2021-22 before claiming the top spot now. They also set a record with a 25-win season in 2023-24. Yet, players say that O’Leary’s most telling impact goes beyond wins and rankings — it is the culture she has instilled in her players and the development she has fostered.

Her philosophy has been simple but effective — focus on daily improvements rather than just long-term results. The success has been no accident. O’Leary inherited a struggling program and implemented a structured, player-centric development plan. 

Former Virginia star Natasha Subhash, who played under O’Leary from 2019 to 2024, credits the coaching staff’s emphasis on player development for her own growth. 

“The coaches, led by Coach O’Leary, prioritized player development above all else,” Subhash said in an interview. “For me, one of the biggest things that set U.Va. apart, and the coaches especially, was that they created this developmental plan for me as a recruit.”

This commitment to individual progress has resulted in 16 All-American honors during O’Leary’s tenure — more than in the program’s entire history before her arrival.

A prime example of O’Leary’s developmental expertise is Virginia alumna Emma Navarro, who won the 2021 NCAA Singles Championship under her guidance. Navarro’s dominance on the national stage cemented O’Leary’s reputation as a coach who could not only recruit top talent but also elevate it to elite status.

The impact of O’Leary’s approach is also evident in the team’s rise through the rankings and its consistent deep runs in the NCAA Tournament. In 2022, Virginia reached the quarterfinals for the first time since 2016, a feat it repeated in 2024 while securing an ACC regular-season co-title.

Just as important as the developmental expertise she’s passed onto individual players, O’Leary has fostered an environment that emphasizes unity, teamwork and resilience. Her teams have developed a reputation for their close-knit culture, where lifting each other up is paramount. 

“I think the biggest thing is just focusing on the culture first,” O’Leary said after the Georgia Tech match Feb. 23. “That's just what we always go back to. We're not super focused on the wins and the losses, just making sure we're doing the little things well and better every single day.”

According to Subhash, this culture is a defining aspect of the program. 

“In all my five years, we never had a problem with lineup disputes,” Subhash said. “Every single person on the team — no matter what you played or if you played at all — everyone mattered equally.”

Senior Elaine Chervinsky exemplified this camaraderie during the team’s ACC opener against Clemson Feb. 21. Though sidelined due to injury, she remained on court alongside her doubles partner, senior Melodie Collard, and Collard’s temporary partner, freshman Isabelle Lacy, for the entirety of their match. Collard and Lacy were struggling to gain the upper hand, and Chervinsky provided unwavering support, offering encouragement and strategic advice, fully engaged despite being unable to compete in such an exciting match.

Another pillar of O’Leary’s healthy culture is the program’s emphasis on leadership. Players are encouraged to take ownership of their improvement and to inspire those around them. One such player, graduate student Sara Ziodato, was recently named ACC Player of the Week, a recognition O’Leary attributes to her dedication and leadership.

“I think we have great leadership with Sara Ziodato and Nicole Kiefer,” O’Leary said Feb. 23. “They've been amazing leaders this spring … showing the younger players, this is how we do things, just the sacrifices they've made, they're just so committed.”

This type of culture is not only crucial in tennis but is difficult to achieve. Matches have a tendency to feel very individual, and it is easy to feel like you are competing with your teammates. A team-first mentality is also crucial during tight matches, where a close bond can combat the high-pressure environment.

One hallmark of O’Leary’s teams has been their dominance in doubles play. The 2022-23 season, for instance, saw two Virginia doubles teams ranked in the top 10 nationally. Graduate student Julia Adams and senior Mélodie Collard reached the NCAA doubles semifinals, tying the program’s best-ever finish, while Subhash and Chervinsky peaked at No. 3 in the national rankings.

O’Leary’s approach to doubles is meticulous, pairing players based on complementary styles and honing their chemistry through rigorous practice. 

“I think there's so much strategy that goes along with it. I think figuring out who they partner well with personality wise, game style wise, makes a huge difference,” O’Leary said. “I think we're just a team that loves playing doubles.”

That makes sense given O’Leary’s history. She won the 2007 NCAA doubles title as a senior at North Carolina. That was part of a career that included All-America honors in 2006 and 2007.

O’Leary spent six years as an assistant coach at North Carolina after that, helping guide the Tar Heels to their first NCAA final and developing multiple All-Americans. As a head coach, she led Davidson to three consecutive winning seasons, earning Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year honors before coming to Virginia.

With back-to-back NCAA quarterfinal appearances and a deep, talented roster, the Cavaliers are poised for even greater heights. O’Leary’s ability to recruit players like Subhash and develop players, coupled with her strategic acuity, suggests that an NCAA championship could be within reach.

But for O’Leary, the goal remains the same — continuous, daily improvement. 

“The culture that the coaches built was something to fall back on,” Subhash said. “ … Whenever we would have a couple tough results, it was never a fear of ours that we wouldn't ever get it back.”

Under her leadership, Virginia women’s tennis is not just relevant — it has become a force to be reckoned with. And with O’Leary at the helm, the best may still be yet to come.


                        The Cavaliers have a solid record, but half of the lineup has underperformed.
                    


                        Virginia's NCAA Tournament hopes are officially gone.
                    


                        You might not know it yet, but when you talk about that culture, you will already be talking about James Hopper.

The 24-time Grand Slam winner retired from his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev with a hamstring issue in January and then lost in the first round of the Qatar Open.

Djokovic - who could face Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals - has been joined by coach Andy Murray, with the partnership set to continue "indefinitely".

Jannik Sinner will miss Indian Wells after accepting a three-month ban in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Alcaraz is the two-time reigning Indian Wells champion, having downed Daniil Medvedev in the final of the last two editions.

Iga Swiatek is the reigning women's champion, while world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Australian Open winner Madison Keys will aim to topple the Pole.

"The 'sunshine double' of Indian Wells and Miami is very tough for any player to pull off because it's totally opposite conditions - even though it's two hard-court tournaments," said former British No 1 Laura Robson.

"It's a really long stint - both events are 12 days - and it's just a massive change conditions-wise, to go from one to the other as Miami is so hot and humid, compared to being in the desert of Palm Springs.

"Indian Wells, in particular, I always struggled at because it's much slower than you think. It doesn't always favour the Brits, who in general prefer slightly faster conditions and a pacier hard court that plays more lively, because you get a bit more out of your shots."

Expect a star-studded field on and off the court, with film stars including Zendaya, Tom Holland, Charlize Theron, Yvonne Orji, Ben Stiller and singer Gwen Stefani likely to be in attendance.

Stiller became the unwitting support act when Nick Kyrgios clashed with a fan at the event in 2022.

Topic:Indigenous Australians

Ash Barty, who won Wimbledon in 2021, says she played her best tennis after changing her mindset. (Anychance/Getty Images: Simon Bruty)

Former world tennis champion Ash Barty is no stranger to pressure. 

Watching her victorious Wimbledon match from 2021, you can hear it building in the crowd every time her opponent Karolina Pliskova missed the ball.

At just 25 years old, Barty was carrying the weight of the country on her shoulders.

And while that would be anxiety-inducing for many, Barty had a secret weapon she used in times like these — her positive mindset.

"I had so much genuine interest and investment and people wanting me to do well, and I think sometimes that can be perceived as pressure," she told the ABC's Indigenous Affairs Team.

"But I learned to really embrace it and understand it's coming from a good place."

The freedom that came from that new mindset helped her play some of her best tennis, she said.

After a three-set thriller, she became the first Australian ladies' Wimbledon champion in 41 years.

Barty has overcome many challenges to get to the top — from her body image battles as a teenager to the burnout that led to her 15-month tennis hiatus in 2014 — so how does she deal with setbacks?

"It's important to lean into the emotions you're feeling, whether it's sadness or anger; that's part of being a human being," the Ngarigo woman said.

"When I was going back through some of those moments, I really try and see the opportunity for growth, for learning and what I could've done better.

The three-time Grand Slam singles champion is now notching up another 'first' with the launch of Mattel's first Aboriginal Barbie doll.

Barty and her friend, fellow Indigenous global tennis star Evonne Goolagong Cawley, recently launched the dolls, which are part of a special collection.

"When we saw the dolls for the first time, it was pretty surreal," she said.

"To be able to do it with Evonne, someone who's been an idol of mine, a friend, a mentor, it was really neat."

For Barty and Googalong Cawley, the one-of-a-kind Barbie 'Role Model' dolls are also about empowering the next generation through representation.

"I've always been a big believer, if you can see it, you can believe it," Barty said.

"It's obviously special to be the first Indigenous release for Barbie but I think it spreads wider.

"It's creating this endless possibility of what girls can be, what they can dream of, and what they can achieve," she said.

Many people recognise Maminydjama Maymuru — also known as Magnolia Maymuru — from her iconic 2021 Vogue cover with her baby Djarraran and her AACTA award-winning role in the 2018 Netflix series The Nightingale.

She has graced the runways from local Australian fashion shows to international high-end brands.

But one decision during her modelling debut could have cost her her career before it began.

"During the bikini contest, I told them I was not comfortable," the proud Yolŋu woman said.

It was 2016 and Ms Maymuru had been selected to represent the Northern Territory in the contest for Australia's Miss World candidate — a chance to compete in one of the world's big four beauty pageants.

"My mob, specifically my group of people, we don't expose ourselves to that degree because it's sacred," she said.

"We only do these specific things in ceremonies. I wanted to feel comfortable and have my elders be proud of me."

Fortunately, the organisers were understanding.

"They respected my views, my beliefs, and allowed me to sit that one out," she said.

More than a decade later, Ms Maymuru has continued to break barriers with the help of other strong Blak women, while learning the art of walking in two very different worlds.

"I had a life coach, Jody, she was a beautiful strong, Blak woman … From posture to how to speak to capture people's attention, she taught me so much," she said.

"She was one of the women that guided me through that first year in becoming 'Magnolia'."

It took years before the isolating feeling of being the only First Nations model in the room disappeared but she has always remained steadfast in who she is and where she comes from.

"They keep me grounded and motivate me to do better."

As her career took off, she faced a devastating turn of events when her grandmother was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

"It was a big change," Ms Maymuru said, after deciding to become her grandmother's full-time carer.

"She took me in when I was six years old … I have an obligation; it was just fulfilling my role but I think it was only difficult for my career when I had to turn jobs down."

Maminydjama is well-versed when it comes to change — it's something she embraces.

And as she juggled her duties with being a new mum, it was watching her grandmother 'fight to get better' that kept her going — the same person who ignited the fire inside her during her modelling debut.

For Aunty Marjorie Anderson, her career wasn't as clear cut as Ash Barty's or Maminydjama Maymuru's.

"I just say the elders put me where I need to be when I need to be there. I've never planned a career as such," the proud Gamilaroi woman said.

It was a journey that led her to co-design Australia's first Indigenous crisis hotline.

Her initial thoughts? "I have no idea what I'm doing."

Like Barty, there was a weight leaning heavily on Aunty Marjorie to get this right, with the devastating suicide rate of First Nations people on the rise.

She says there wasn't a playbook to follow in Australia or overseas; Aunty Marjorie was developing the first hotline of its kind.

"I had to start with a blank sheet of paper and I made sure I got the diversity of our community in working groups to design the hotline.

"My motto has always been: 'Fake it till you make it and don't be scared of anything'."

That advice has paid off, with the hotline receiving tens of thousands of calls since launching in 2022.

The most rewarding part, she says, is hearing the words: "You saved my life."

This International Women's Day, Aunty Marjorie has been named 2025 NSW Aboriginal Woman of the Year, recognising her great contribution to her community.

She credits her tenacity and determination to growing up in Redfern, which is often described as the birthplace of the civil rights movement for First Nations people.

"I come from a long line of strong women," she said.

But when she was at school, the advice was different.

"When I was a student, I was told I would never amount to anything, and I should sit down and shut up," she reflected.

"I had a lot of people around me who were fighting for legal services, medical services for Aboriginal people and the freedom riders really pushing and making a real difference."

It gave her the resolve to push back.

"I looked at that generation of Aboriginal people above me, and instead of buying into that advice, I fought against it."

Belinda Bencic has always been a fighter. But this time, she wasn’t just battling opponents on the court—she was proving that motherhood and professional tennis can go hand in hand. The Swiss tennis player welcomed her baby, Bella, with her husband and fitness coach, Martin Hromkovic, in April 2024. Just when Bella was 10 months old, the super mom fought back from a set down to defeat American Ashlyn Krueger in the final, lifting the WTA 500 trophy in Abu Dhabi. Her daughter was there to witness it all, cradled in Bencic’s arms during the trophy ceremony. A moment to remember. And now she’s celebrating a landmark victory for tennis moms everywhere.

The WTA rolled out its groundbreaking maternity policy, offering 12 months of paid maternity leave for eligible players. The initiative also includes two months of leave for those becoming parents through surrogacy, partner pregnancy, or adoption. And that’s not all—grants for fertility treatments like egg freezing and IVF are now part of the package. The program, backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, is the first of its kind in professional sports. More than 320 players qualify for paid leave, with all receiving the same payout, regardless of ranking. If they choose not to return to the sport, they won’t have to repay any of the money. That’s a game-changer. And it was the same day the Swiss tennis player won her first match at Indian Wells.

So, what does tennis mom Bencic think of this? After her first-round win at Indian Wells, she shared her thoughts in the post-match interview.“Well, of course, I think it’s a great thing. It’s absolutely giving players the chance to not have to make such a hard decision. I think it makes their decision a little bit easier if they are looking for having a family and didn’t have to decide so much if it’s worth it. Especially the lower-ranked players, I think it’s important for them to have a guaranteed income so they don’t have to worry about money when they’re out for a year and a half and not stress about things. So I think it’s a great thing. Also, you know, that tennis is the first sport to do it for female athletes, so I hope it paves the way for other sports, as well.”

A well-deserved moment of recognition for the sport and for the women who make it great. But the former World No.4’s return wasn’t just about policies—it was about defying expectations. Many doubted whether she could come back at the same level, questioning if motherhood would slow her down. Belinda Bencic, however, had other ideas.

On the Tennis Insider Club podcast, Belinda Bencic opened up about the skepticism she faced.

Belinda Bencic defies odds—Can motherhood and top-level tennis truly coexist successfully?

Debate

“When I started my comeback, most people were like, ‘Oh, for sure, it’s not possible,’ you know? So, I always feel like people change their minds so quickly. And it’s fun for me to be like, ‘Oh, okay, you believe in me now, huh?’” she said to host Caroline Garcia. “It’s very classic. I had so many people saying: ‘Why she did this decision now in the middle of her career? It’s not possible to be back at the same level.’ But now (after Abu Dhabi) they say: ‘Yeah, she can win the Grand Slam for sure.’ I’m like, you changed your mind in one week!” she laughed.

It’s a testament to her resilience. The former world No. 4 and Olympic gold medalist never doubted herself. The Swiss tennis star further stated, “I also feel like all the work I did in my career, in my childhood, I don’t want to just throw it away. I just want to take out the most when I can out of my career and also like see that it’s possible to have both.”

Right now, the 27-year-old tennis player has won 14 of her 18 matches this season and sits firmly inside the top 60 in the world. The goal? Keep climbing and be seeded in major tournaments again. Next up, Belinda Bencic faces American Amanda Anisimova in the second round of Indian Wells. Another step forward. With her determination and the WTA’s new policy paving the way, could we see more mothers dominating the tour?

Novak Djokovic believes one teenage player has the potential to become a “really big superstar”. The current world No. 7 has achieved virtually everything possible in tennis and rewritten history. Now, he thinks one up-and-comer could bring plenty of eyes to the sport.

Joao Fonseca has been enjoying a breakthrough season, and Djokovic is buying into the hype. The 24-time Major winner has been impressed with the teenager’s composure and believes that a new Brazilian star could be just what tennis needs.

Fonseca has been taking the tennis world by storm in recent months. Aged just 18, he won the Next Gen ATP Finals in December and carried his momentum straight into the 2025 season.

So far this year, the Brazilian has won the Canberra Challenger, qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw, upset ninth seed Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open, and lifted his first ATP Tour title in Argentina.

Fonseca is in action in Indian Wells this week, and he’s already made an impression in his opening match winning the last five games to beat Jacob Fearnley 6-2 1-6 6-3. So it’s no surprise that Djokovic sees huge potential in the current world No. 80.

Following Fonseca’s latest victory in the Californian desert, Djokovic was asked what it was like to be an 18-year-old playing freely and shared his thoughts on tennis’ latest prospect.

“A little bit. It comes in flashes, but yeah, it does feel great, you know, when you're that young and playing in a high level, not much to lose, a lot to gain,” the Olympic champion said.

“Of course attention from the people, support, you know, builds up and it all adds to a great evolution of the player and the personality eventually will come to the point where it's going to convert into pressure and expectations from himself, from the others, and so forth.”

For now, Djokovic thinks Fonseca is on the right path. “He seems to be handling it all very well,” he added.

“I mean, I don't know him personally so well, but from what I have seen on the court, not only the way he plays but the way he behaves, and people around him, seems like there is a very good level of balance and professionalism and devotion, like what we have seen for the last couple years with [Carlos] Alcaraz.”

“He has the potential to be really a superstar of this game. No doubt about it. Coming from Brazil also, one of the biggest countries in the world, where they love tennis, love sports, very passionate people.

“It would be amazing for also our sport to have a Brazilian superstar, first really big superstar since Gustavo ‘Guga’ Kuerten, that was an idol of so many kids, incredible guy and big champion. Yeah, I wish him all the best.”

Fonseca will be delighted to hear the praise from Djokovic - especially after their heartwarming run-in after his opening match in Indian Wells. After his first-round win, the teenager got a brief moment to chat with the world No. 7.

“With Novak, I was just leaving the court that I practiced after my match, and then he was entering. He asked if I won. I said I won. Then he just congratulated me. It was just super cool that he was talking to me,” Fonseca said.

Novak Djokovic is searching for a record sixth title at Indian Wells, having enjoyed real success in California during his career.

The Serbian ATP star has traveled to the United States searching for a first tour-level title of 2025, after suffering a shock defeat recently.

Djokovic lost to Italy’s Matteo Berrettini in his opening match at the Qatar Open, 6-7, 2-6, in just his third tournament appearance of the season.

At the Australian Open, Djokovic retired with an injury during his semi-final match with world number two Alexander Zverev, having pulled off an impressive victory against Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round.

Now fully fit, Djokovic will work alongside Andy Murray in California, as the Grand Slam-winning pairing looks to return to form at Indian Wells.

Ahead of his opening match against Botic van de Zandschulp, Djokovic has received a significant confidence boost after beating a former world number three in a practice set.

Looking to get some good practice in, Djokovic took on world number 15 Grigor Dimitrov in a practice set.

Dimitrov and Djokovic held serve initially, before the 37-year-old broke when a backhand from the Bulgarian went long at 30-40, in the third game.

An error from Dimitrov in his next service game handed Djokovic a double break, as he stormed into a 4-1 lead.

Djokovic held his serve before two double faults from Dimitrov in his final service game saw the Serb take the set 6-1.

The world number seven’s level looked strong, as he thoroughly outplayed the 2017 ATP Finals champion.

Only time will tell if Djokovic can maintain his level when he takes on Van de Zandschulp in the Indian Wells second round on Saturday, March 8.

The 33-year-old enjoyed a strong season in 2024, as Dimitrov won his first ATP title in seven years at the Brisbane International, finishing the year ranked inside the world’s top ten.

The Bulgarian returned to the event this year looking to defend his title but was unable to do so, as he retired during the second set of his semi-final match with Jiri Lehecka.

Dimitrov has struggled for form since, losing his last three matches on the ATP Tour, as his injury issues persist.

Currently ranked 15th in the world, Dimitrov could potentially fall outside of the world’s top 20 upon the conclusion of this year’s ‘Sunshine Double’, thanks to his performances at the events in 2024.

Dimitrov reached the final of the Miami Open last year, losing out to Jannik Sinner in straight sets, 3-6, 1-6.

He is set to begin his Indian Wells campaign against Portugal’s Nuno Borges, who won their only previous meeting at last year’s Australian Open.

If he were to advance past Borges, he’d face a tough challenge against either Gael Monfils or Sebastian Korda in the third round.

Winning back-to-back matches for just the second time this season would likely set up a mouth-watering last-16 clash with two-time defending champion Alcaraz.

Dimitrov won’t want to get too far ahead of himself, however, as he first sets his sights on Borges, who he plays on Saturday, March 8.

The two-time Grand Slam champion, Victoria Azarenka, initiated a maternity fund for women players in partnership with PIF and WTA. The programme supports female tennis players in starting a family by giving paid leaves during the pregnancy period or providing funds for any kind of fertility treatments for the athletes.

Many women tennis players and other people from the fraternity celebrated this groundbreaking initiative taken by Azarenka in partnership with PIF and WTA.

Azarenka became a mother in 2016 when she gave birth to her son, Leo. At that time, there were no programs or policies supporting women athletes starting a family.

In 2019, the WTA introduced a protected ranking system for players on maternity leave. This allowed players to compete in tournaments without going through the qualification rounds, regardless of their ranking. However, it did not solve all the problems faced by a woman athlete who wanted to conceive a child.

Azarenka, a WTA players council representative, finally made it possible. What started as a personal passion project will now help hundreds of women athletes to start families without hesitation while still being able to compete at the highest level. Something that the Belarussian had envisioned years ago has now become a reality.

The five-time Grand Slam champion, Maria Sharapova, showed her enthusiasm by reposting the WTA tweet and wrote:

Another WTA player, Katie Boulter, who is currently ranked No. 38 in the world, also shared her enthusiasm by reposting and reacting to the WTA’s tweet.

Ons Jabeur, a Tunisian tennis player and former World No. 2, who had also raised her voice against the problem, was seen celebrating this initiative. She posted an Instagram story reacting to the program.

Judy Murray, Andy Murray’s mother and his former coach, also portrayed her happiness about the program through her Instagram story.

The widespread acknowledgment of the program showed its impact and significance. This will change how the players pursue their careers along with leading happy family lives. It is a huge step towards allowing the women tennis players to lead a life of their own choice without being bothered by external forces.

The former World No. 1 talked about how she was scared about being able to play the sport on the highest level again. While talking to CNN Sport, Victoria Azarenka said:

Azarenka had difficulty returning to the sport. Yet she battled through challenges to earn her place back in the tennis world, showing that motherhood and a career at the top of your sport are possible at the same time. She is ranked No. 35 in the world at the age of 35, which is quite impressive.

Victoria Azarenka's determination led to advocating the birth of a revolutionary policy that will shift the landscape of women’s tennis for generations. This initiative means that future players won’t have to choose between starting a family and maintaining their career, which was once an almost impossible thing to contemplate.

            Only a few years ago, João Fonseca was a young tennis fan eager to collect autographs from the world’s top players. Now, kids are starting to queue up for his signature.
    


            The 18-year-old is fast becoming one of the most exciting talents in men’s tennis, and on Thursday, he continued to impress with an opening-round victory against Britain’s Jacob Fearnley at the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.
    


            It was by no means easy for Fonseca, who battled windy conditions and trailed 3-1 in the deciding set before coming from behind to win 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. Only his second victory at an ATP Masters 1000 tournament, the Brazilian had to demonstrate the sort of composure and tenacity that is fast earning him popularity with fans.

            “Everything is new for me – I’m still young and I’m still getting used to this,” Fonseca told reporters after the match. “But seeing people – not just Brazilians but from all over the world – cheering for me and calling my name, wanting autographs … It’s very nice to see those kids and people watching me.”
    


            After winning the first title of his young career at the Argentina Open last month, Fonseca has started to gain attention from all the right people.
    


            “(It) seems like there is a very good level of balance and professionalism and devotion, like what we have seen for the last couple years with (Carlos) Alcaraz,” Novak Djokovic said prior to competing at Indian Wells.
    


            The victory against Fearnley, and the manner in which he reeled off the last five games of the match in high-pressure circumstances, will only earn Fonseca more praise from the sport’s biggest names.
    


            He raced into an early lead with two breaks of serve and claimed the first set of the match with a forehand winner into an open court after Fearnley had stretched to make a return.
    


            However, the world No. 81, ranked just one spot below Fonseca, raised his level and responded well in the second set to level the contest. He then secured an early break in the decider and backed it up by holding his serve in the following game.
    


            But a double fault saw Fonseca draw level at 3-3 before he powered through the remainder of the set, wrapping up the victory in two hours with a well-angled backhand volley.
    


            “The first round of a Masters, it was windy, I was playing against a great guy – it was difficult conditions, but I got through, so I’m very happy with the way I fought today,” said Fonseca.
    


            He will now face another British player, world No. 14 Jack Draper, in the second round at Indian Wells. A deep run in California would continue Fonseca’s breakthrough year having previously knocked ninth seed Andrey Rublev out of the Australian Open in January. A month earlier, he became the second-youngest winner of the Next Gen ATP Finals in Saudi Arabia – a tournament for the best men’s players aged 20 and under.
    


            Elsewhere, Australian Nick Kyrgios’ latest bid to reignite his career was thwarted by a right wrist injury in his first-round match against the Netherlands’ Botic van de Zandschulp.
    


            Injuries have plagued Kyrgios’ progress in recent years, and he is now without a Tour-level win since October 2022. The former Wimbledon finalist retired while trailing 7-6 (7), 3-0 against van de Zandschulp after having held a set point in the first-set tie-break. As a result, the Aussie misses out on a second-round clash against Djokovic.
    


            Kyrgios appeared tearful at the end of the match, later explaining that he had experienced a flare-up of a recurring wrist injury during practice two days earlier.
    


            “No one in the sport’s had a wrist reconstruction and tried to play after that,” Kyrgios told reporters after the match. “There have been players that have had wrist surgeries, (but) nowhere near as bad as what I’ve had.
    


            “It’s all an experiment at this point,” he added, saying he was unsure when he would next be able to play. “I was told that I was arguably maybe not ever playing tennis again.”
    


            The first round of matches at Indian Wells continues on Friday, with men’s top seed Alexander Zverev in action against Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor.

Nick Kyrgios has continued his criticism of world No 1 Jannik Sinner by suggesting the doping scandal was getting “more cringe every day”.

The three-time Grand Slam winner is currently serving a three-month suspension after reaching a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for failing two doping tests for the anabolic steroid clostebol last year.

But the length of the suspension, which sees Sinner return in time for the Italian Open and not miss a Grand Slam, has been criticised by many, particularly Kyrgios.

The Australian has frequently criticised the decision, saying at the time of its announcement that “fairness in tennis does not exist”, and now the 29-year-old has taken to the comments section of a Tennis365 post to continue his war of words with Sinner.

In a recent interview, Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill praised the reigning Australian Open champion’s maturity, saying the world No 1 gave him the following quote: “Don’t concern yourself with the criticism of someone that you wouldn’t take advice from.”

Cahill added that “this is coming from a 23-year-old. Because we have been talking about all the noise, some from players, some from coaches, some from the media around his particular case”

Underneath a graphic, Kyrgios responded: “Like his team that gave him a prohibited substance gets more cringe every day.”

Kyrgios’ initial criticism was put to Sinner but the 23-year-old maintained he does not care what other think.

“I don’t think I have to answer this, to be honest,” he said.

“How do I block it? It’s not that you just put it in a part and you just say I don’t think any more about this. In my mind I know exactly what happened, and that’s how I block it, no?

“I haven’t done anything wrong. That’s why I’m still here. That’s why I’m still playing. I don’t want to respond on what Nick said or what other players says.

“I think the most important part is to have my people around me who I can trust, people they exactly know what happened. That’s it.”

Kyrgios made the Instagram comment just hours before retiring from his opening round match at Indian Wells.

The Australian lost the first set 7-6 to World No 85 Botis van de Zandschulp before going down 3-0 in the second. After a wide backhand, the doctor was called onto the court to examine Kyrgios’ right wrist shortly before his retirement.

Jannik Sinner’s big problem revealed after ‘convenient’ drug suspension

Kyrgios has yet to win a match in 2025 having lost in both the Brisbane International and the Australian Open in January. This latest injury comes after the 2022 Wimbledon finalist was forced to sit out the entirety of 2024 and there are now concerns about his long-term future in the sport.

“It’s all an experiment at this point,” Kyrgios said after his defeat.

“I was told I was arguably maybe not ever playing tennis again. [But] I feel I’m like right there. I feel like I can compete.

“I’m there, but if I’m not able to finish matches it doesn’t really matter at this point. I’m not too sure right now.”

 Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Taylor Swift fans are convinced that the pop star may have secretly contributed to Lady Gaga's new track, "How Bad Do U Want Me."

The track was featured on Gaga's new album MAYHEM, which was released on Friday, March 7. Despite Swift not being officially credited on the song, many of her fans are convinced they hear her distinct background vocals, sparking a wave of theories online.

"This song is so Taylor coded," said one user on X (formerly Twitter).

Another person pointed out, "this can be true... remember when both (taylor and gaga) [were seen] getting out of the same studio back in 2023?"

A third noted, "This just sounds like a Taylor song but I don't think it's her I don't think they'd collab."

"I don't believe the vocal part but I always think every time I play the song that the intro sounds like the intro to gorgeous," a fourth explained.

Though the two iconic pop stars have never worked together, they have shown mutual admiration. In a Vogue interview last year, Gaga, 38, expressed her support for Swift, 35, and other rising stars. "I watch it all, and I'm like, 'Yup. Go! Just go,'" Gaga shared. "I'm not only cheering them on, I want them to know that my heart is in it with them. I want them all to feel really happy."

Swift has recently shown her support for Gaga as well, defending her from pregnancy rumors in July 2024 with Swift calling comments about the "Bad Romance" singer "invasive & irresponsible" on TikTok.

For Gaga's new album, she sported a different look, straying from her typical platinum blonde locks. Back in January the pop star posted a teaser for MAYHEM, debuting a much shorter and darker hairstyle, pairing it with some bright red lipstick and dramatic eye makeup. The album can be streamed on platforms like Apple Music and Spotify.

True Royalty TV co-founder Nick Bullen reveals the one lesson he believes the Duchess of Sussex should learn from her late mother-in-law's brief life. The Princess of Wales passed away on Aug. 31, 1997 at age 36.

Pamela Anderson's team is reacting to claims Meghan Markle copied the actress with her new lifestyle show, "With Love, Meghan."

Anderson released her own show, "Pamela's Cooking with Love," in February, while Markle's hit Netflix on March 4. Some claimed Markle's show seemingly matched the "Baywatch" star's, sometimes "frame-for-frame."

However, Anderson's show co-creator did not seem to mind the accusations.

"We take pride in planting the first seeds – creating original, distinctive programming that audiences love – and it’s a compliment to see our work with Ms. Anderson resonate so strongly," Anderson's producer, Jesse Fawcett, told the Daily Mail.

MEGHAN MARKLE IN ‘DIRE SITUATION’ AMID REBRAND RIDICULE: EXPERT

Royal expert Neil Sean, in a video for his YouTube channel, called Markle’s show a "frame-for-frame" copy in some cases. 

"As you can see, Meghan has been inspired by her [Anderson’s] cookery show, right?" Sean said, showing a shot of Markle high-fiving her guest on set next to one of Anderson high-fiving her guest. 

"There’s very little new in the world of cookery," he said.

"It’s difficult to reinvent it, but Meghan didn’t even bother with that. Clearly, she just got inspired," he said.

Sean said a "very well-placed source" told him Anderson is "actually delighted with Meghan Markle. Well, maybe that’s stretching it a bit but, you know, kind of happy for this simple reason. You see, this has elevated Pamela’s show. You know, the sort of publicity she could have only dreamt about."

"Not only that, this is going to be very successful for Pamela Anderson in effect, Meghan being inspired by Pamela's show," he added. "It’s literally been an injection back into Pamela’s brand.

Despite being compared to Anderson's cooking show, Markle fell short of audience expectations. Many have criticized the Duchess of Sussex's Netflix endeavor as "cringey."

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard previously told Fox News Digital the show "appears mundane and lacks wow factor."

"Meghan seems eager to play the altruistic, kind soul, but it is a tad smarmy," she claimed. "My toes are curling… This is so cringey and not fun at all. It feels too staged, and the tips and tricks are far too basic… Meghan comes across as a modern Stepford Wife."

Regardless, Markle's show has been renewed for a second season. She shared the news Friday on Instagram.

"Lettuce romaine calm…or not(!) because I'm thrilled to share that Season 2 of 'With Love, Meghan is coming!" she captioned a video of herself dancing.

Netflix revealed filming for season two has already wrapped and fans can expect the show to premiere in the fall.

Michael Polansky's proposal to Lady Gaga directly inspired one of the songs on her new album, Mayhem, which was released today! 

The "Bad Romance" songstress told E!News that track 11, "Blade of Grass," is a nod to a very real moment she experienced with her fiancé ahead of their engagement. Before Polansky asked Gaga to be his wife, the "Born This Way" icon told him to wrap a blade of grass around her finger. 

"He said to me, 'If I ever proposed to you, how do I do that? And I said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the backyard and wrap it around my finger.' And he did. He did that when he proposed."

The adorable duo co-wrote the song together, with the chorus capturing the intimate nature of the proposal and the blade of grass serving as a symbol of their lasting union.

As for the writing process, the star referred to creating melodic magic with Polansky as "a totally different experience" than what she's used to. Gaga also hopes to explain the meaning behind the special track to their children one day. 

"That song gets to last forever and, hopefully, one day our kids will hear it," and when they do, the standout will say, "'It's so special. That's about your dad.'"

Hannah Berner has apologized following her controversial interview with Megan Thee Stallion on the red carpet for the Vanity Fair Oscar Party.

On Sunday (March 3), Berner and her "Giggly Squad" podcast co-host, Paige DeSorbo, interviewed several Hollywood stars before they entered the Oscars after-party. 

The pair's interview with Megan Thee Stallion went viral due to comments Berner made toward the Grammy Award-winning rapper that social media users considered a "microaggression" and "racist."

"Your music has literally made me want — when I want to fight someone, I listen to your music," Berner told Meg, adding, "When people are talking sh**, I go, 'Turn on Megan Thee Stallion!'"

Berner faced swift backlash for linking Meg with fighting, violence, and aggression when the "Hot Girl" is known for making music that empowers women to be confident and love themselves.

The podcast host and former reality television star addressed the backlash in a statement on her Instagram Story on Thursday (March 6).

"Interviewing Megan Thee Stallion was a dream of mine. I love her music and it's my go to whenever I need to boost my confidence before a show. Looking back at the interview, I wish I used any other word except 'fight' to describe how her songs impact me," Berner wrote.

"It was a careless choice of words and though there was no ill intent, I recognize and acknowledge that what I said has a deeper meaning and I am so sorry to Megan," she added. "I appreciate everyone who brought this to my attention."

During Sunday's interview, Megan appeared to respond to Berner's comments by diverting the conversation back to her message of self-love.

"You want to throw that fighting sh** out the window, and you want to get cute and be a bad b****," the rapper said.

Social media users were more critical in their response to Berner's interview.

"Megan doesn’t have a single song about fighting," one social media user said.

"Meg was like “fight people? Girl, I make Bad Bih music. Do you see these nails? We don’t fight," another user added.

"Meg handled that micro aggression so well," a third user commented.

"The racism is loud," a fourth user said.

Fatma Begum, born in 1892 into an Urdu-speaking Muslim family in India, holds the title of India’s first female film director. A pioneering figure in a male-dominated industry, her career not only defied gender norms but also helped shape the future of Indian cinema. Her resilience, creativity, and vision paved the way for women in filmmaking during a time when they were often marginalized.

Fatma Begum developed a passion for the arts early in life, performing in Urdu theatre as a youth. Though rumors circulated that she was married to Nawab Sidi Ibrahim Muhammad Yakut Khan III, a prominent figure in India’s royal circles, no legal records of their marriage exist. None of her daughters were recognized as his, adding an air of mystery to her personal life. Despite societal expectations that acting was an unsuitable career for women, Fatma pursued her passion for theater and filmmaking with determination, challenging conventional gender roles.

Fatma Begum made her film debut in 1922 at the age of 30 in the silent film Veer Abhimanyu (The Brave Abhimanyu), directed by Ardeshir Irani. In a time when the Indian film industry was predominantly male, with female roles often portrayed by men, Fatma boldly carved out her space. She went on to star in films such as Sati Sardaba, Prithi Vallabh, Kala Nag (Black Cobra), and Gul-e-Bakavali (A Nocturnal Flower) in 1924, solidifying her position in the industry.

In 1926, Fatma Begum became the first woman in India to establish her own production company, Fatima Films, which was later renamed Victoria-Fatma Films in 1928. As a producer, screenwriter, and actress, she created a platform for women’s voices in cinema. Her directorial debut, Bulbul-e-Paristan (Nightingale of Fantasyland), a fantasy film, was a major success but unfortunately no prints of it have survived. Despite this, it sparked a wave of fantasy films in Indian cinema.

Fatma’s contributions to Indian cinema were groundbreaking. She created leading roles for women, who were seldom in the spotlight at the time. Notable films she directed include Goddess of Love (1927) and Shakuntala (1929). Her studio, however, faced legal troubles in 1929, marking the end of its journey. Though many of her films have been lost, her legacy as a trailblazer for women filmmakers endures. Her daughter, Zubeida, went on to star in India’s first talking film, Alam Ara (1931), continuing Fatma’s trailblazing legacy.

Fatma Begum passed away in 1983 at the age of 91, leaving a lasting mark on Indian cinema and inspiring future generations of women filmmakers.

Country music legend Dolly Parton discusses her faith, family and music on America Reports.

Dolly Parton and Carl Dean had one of the entertainment industry's most enduring marriages, but very little is known about the country music legend's late husband. 

Despite being married to the internationally famous singer for almost 60 years, Dean, who died on March 3 at the age of 82, was a very private man who steered clear of the spotlight and was rarely seen in public. 

He's being remembered by Parton in a new song she promoted on social media called "If You Hadn't Been There."

"I fell in love with Carl Dean when I was 18 years old," she wrote on Instagram. "We have spent 60 precious and meaningful years together. Like all great love stories, they never end. They live on in memory and song. He will always be the star of my life story, and I dedicate this song to him."

The emotional song features lyrics like "If you hadn't been there, where would I be / Without your trust, love and belief / The ups and downs we've always shared / And I wouldn't be here if you hadn't been there."

Few of Parton's friends ever met Dean, and he avoided accompanying his wife to public events, leading to persistent rumors that he didn't actually exist.

However, in 1977, country music journalist Alanna Nash was "flabbergasted" when she received a rare invitation to join Parton at the Nashville house she shared with Dean for an interview for the May 1977 issue of Country Music magazine.

In a new essay for Variety, Nash detailed her two-day visit, offering a glimpse into the couple's home life and recalling her encounters with the "delightfully unusual" Dean.

Nash wrote that the interview took place in the living room of the Tudor-style home where Parton and Dean were living temporarily. The journalist described the room as decorated with Victorian furnishings, oil paintings of herself and Dean as children and "butterflies everywhere" — many of which she noted were mementos from fans.

Before the interview began, Parton asked Nash if she wanted to listen to the "Jolene" singer's album "New Harvest… First Gathering," which had yet to be released at the time. After playing the first side of the record, Parton asked if Nash wanted to hear the second side. After Nash agreed, Parton told her, "Well, before that," she said, "Carl is here — he’s working outside — and I want him to come in and fix the fire. But he doesn’t want to hear my record, so we’ll have to wait."

Nash recalled that Dean was initially reluctant to join the two, writing that she overheard him tell Parton "I don’t want to do no interviews." After being reassured by Parton, Dean entered the living room and Nash caught her first glimpse of the singer's elusive spouse. Nash described him as appearing "shy and uncomfortable in the presence of a stranger."

"He loves me good and all, but I’m really not his favorite singer."

However, she noted that Dean was "friendly and polite" when he was introduced to her. As Dean tended to the fire, Nash observed that he was "ruggedly handsome" and "looked at his wife as if she were the only woman in the world."

As their interview continued, Parton invited Nash to stay for dinner and try some of her "world-famous spaghetti," saying she would tell Dean that Nash was a "friend."  Nash noted that the invite was a rarity since the couple "rarely socialized and never entertained." 

In Nash's essay, she recalled that Dean excused himself from joining them for dinner since he had a cold. However, he continued to return to the living room from time to time to fix the fire as Parton and Nash talked late into the evening. 

Nash remembered she was apprehensive that she might be intruding on the couple's private time, but the feeling began to dissipate as the night progressed.

"If I felt I were trespassing, the feeling faded as Carl reappeared several times, usually to bring Dolly and me something to drink as we taped late into the evening. ‘Y’all growin’ roots?’" he asked at midnight, Nash wrote. 

She continued, "With each successive visit, he was more at ease, more likable and charming. At one point, he asked me if I’d gone to school for journalism. I told him I had, in New York City. He then, in an offhand way, began asking me about New York politicians. I wasn’t sure whether he was just making conversation, testing me, or pulling my leg, which I’d heard he liked to do."

After Dean's final visit of the night, Parton began to play the second side of "New Harvest… First Gathering" and explained why she waited until her husband was out of earshot.

"He just doesn’t want to hear the record, because we’re both so emotional," she told Nash. "He’ll put it on and listen to it sometime when he’s here by himself, and if he likes it, he’ll tell me it’s pretty good. I bought him a video tape recorder, and he tapes me every time I’m on TV, but he won’t watch it unless he hears I done good."

"You know, he loves me good and all, but I’m really not his favorite singer," Nash recalled Parton saying with "a little girl’s smile and giggle."

"We have a great relationship and he’s a wonderful person, but he’s not my biggest fan," Parton added. "He likes bluegrass and hard rock music."

Parton also addressed the speculation that Dean didn't exist, and she had made him up to ward off admirers. 

"I know that’s a big rumor," she told Nash. "He’s a real mystery person to the public. That’s good, though."

"I mean, that’s fine with us, fine with him," Parton clarified. "My career being separate from my marriage is perfectly natural for us. We like it that way. It’s too right and too natural and too comfortable and too secure for it to ever be anything else."

Parton first met Dean at a laundromat in Nashville when she was 18 and he was 21. Two years later, the couple married in 1966 during a ceremony that was only attended by her mother, Avie Lee, the preacher and the preacher's wife. 

During his lifetime, Dean rarely gave interviews. However, in 2016, he spoke lovingly of Parton while the couple were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary.

"My first thought was, 'I'm going to marry that girl,'" Dean told Entertainment Tonight about meeting Parton for the first time. "My second thought was, 'Lord, she’s good-looking.' And that was the day my life began. I wouldn't trade the last 50 years for nothing on this Earth."

Over the years, Parton provided glimpses into their lives during interviews and has occasionally shared throwback photos of herself with Dean on social media. In 2021, she shared a throwback snap of the two, writing, "Find you a partner who will support you like my Carl Dean does!"

On Valentine's Day in 2022, the 10-time Grammy Award winner marked the occasion by posting an image of herself with her longtime love. She captioned the photo, "Happy Valentine’s Day y’all! Remember to squeeze your loved ones a little tighter today and tell them you love ‘em!"
