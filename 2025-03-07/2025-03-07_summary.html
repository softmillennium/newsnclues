President Donald Trump's administration said Friday it was cutting $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University over claims the institution stood by "in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students" following anti-Israel protests. Trump said earlier this week that he would cut funding for schools that allow "illegal protests," his latest threat to turn off the flow of federal money to the country's education system. US campuses including Columbia's were rocked last year by student protests against Israel's war in Gaza following the October 7, 2023 attacks, which ignited accusations of anti-Semitism. "For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus.

“We’re delighted and relieved that all this has come to an end,” Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot was able to finally declare Friday afternoon — 12 hours after the bomb-disposal police were first called — as roads reopened and rail services were progressively being restored. Retired Parisian Michel Garrot also found himself stranded with his wife in the Belgian capital. Workers laboring overnight on a bridge-replacement project spotted the rust-eaten, dirt-covered bomb before dawn Friday, after it was found by an earth-moving machine at a depth of about two meters (six feet), between train tracks to the north of Gare du Nord, national rail operator SNCF said. Bomb disposal services arrived within the hour and set up a 200-meter security perimeter, later extended to 500 meters. Morning rush-hour travelers arriving at Gare du Nord to catch trains were greeted by bright-red signs warning of disruptions, lines of passengers seeking information and ticket exchanges, and barriers blocking access to the Eurostar terminal.</p>

US President Donald Trump said Friday that he finds it "easier" to deal with Russia than with Ukraine in efforts to end the war in the pro-Western country -- and that he trusts Vladimir Putin. "I believe him," he said in a televised press conference at the White House. "I'm finding it more difficult frankly to deal with Ukraine and they don't have the cards," he said. Despite threatening new sanctions on Russia earlier Friday, Trump said he understood why Putin's forces had inflicted a massive bombing campaign across Ukraine overnight.

Days after spat with Zelensky, Trump says he's considering "large-scale" sanctions and tariffs against Russia, until a ceasefire and peace agreement is reached with Ukraine. This turn takes place after a wave of strikes at night on Ukraine. Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another in order to stop them from breaking international laws or act aggressively. The United States, United Kingdom and Europe, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan have imposed more than 21,000 sanctions on Russia since its invaded Ukraine three years ago. In January, after assuming office, Trump had warned of tariffs and more sanctions if Putin did not end the war.</p>

The White House later confirmed Trump’s remarks, saying that he had sent a letter to Iranian officials proposing talks. Iran has long insisted that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. However, as tensions with the US persist over sanctions and a fragile ceasefire holds in Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, Iranian officials have increasingly hinted at the possibility of pursuing nuclear weapons. Trump's statement was reported by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, citing the broadcast. However, a recent report from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog indicated that Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium.</p>

US President Donald Trump said Friday that he has written to Iran, pressing for talks on preventing the development of nuclear weapons and warning it faces possible military action if not. Tehran's mission to the United Nations told AFP that "we have not received such a letter so far." A landmark 2015 deal negotiated under former president Barack Obama -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. Tehran adhered to the deal until a year after Washington pulled out, but then began rolling back its commitments.

While butterflies are one of the most surveyed insect groups, previous studies have either been geographically limited or relied on data from a single monitoring program. Experts stress that the consequences of losing butterfly populations could be dire, as they play critical roles in ecosystems, including pollination and food chains. "In just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!" Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal told NYPost that he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans. "They are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species.</p>

Trump said he has been of this view for years and shared it with NATO allies during his 2017-2021 presidential term. Those efforts prompted more spending from other members of the 75-year-old transatlantic alliance, he said, but "even now, it's not enough." Trump's remarks could trigger alarm bells in capitals from Europe to Asia, where leaders were already worried about a withdrawal of US security support after Trump clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and showed greater willingness to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Japan's post-World War Two constitution long restricted its military activities, reforms have meant it could exercise collective self-defense and help protect the United States under certain circumstances, Szechenyi said.

These findings are consistent with earlier research indicating that melatonin not only has antioxidant properties but may also boost specific genes involved in the repair process. Larger trials, exploring different doses and long-term use, will be crucial to determine whether melatonin supplementation can have a broader application for those who don't get enough sleep. This new evidence suggests that their benefits might extend beyond just helping you fall asleep – they could also play a role in maintaining the health of your DNA.

In a rousing speech, he said he put "Canadians first" every single day as the prime minister and won't let them down in the future as well. Trudeau had announced his resignation in January amid growing internal dissent and declining popularity ratings. Trudeau also warned of Trump's tariff threat in his speech and called for unity among Canadians to overcome the tough times ahead. His speech came after Trump paused new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports to give reprieve to consumers and companies after the increased taxes rattled equities markets. Both sides must win, he said, suggesting that's how international trade and bilateral ties work, thought not in real estate deals.</p>

They urged their ministers to review these proposals on an urgent basis. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, presenting to leaders an ambitious €800bn (£670bn) plan to increase European defence spending, said it was “a watershed moment for Europe” and also for Ukraine. He added that Europe as a whole was truly capable of winning any "military, financial, economic confrontation with Russia—we are simply stronger." After the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron said that regardless of what happens in Ukraine, Europe must develop its own self-defence capabilities. US military aid accounted for 30 per cent of Ukraine's weapons and ammunition needs.</p>

Why is it so important for Trump to do a minerals deal before he can start peace negotiations? Poland currently spends a higher proportion of GDP on defence than any other NATO member, including the United States. In January, Washington intensified the measures it is taking against Vladimir Putin's regime by targeting Russia's oil production and exports. Volodymyr Zelenskyy needs to acknowledge security guarantees for Ukraine will be provided by Europe, the US treasury secretary has said. Scott Bessent told CNBC the situation regarding any peace deal over Russia's war in Ukraine is fluid.</p>

So-called "coffee raves" - an early-morning take on late-night club raves, dominated not by alcohol and drugs but by cappuccinos and macchiatos - are cropping up all across Russia after taking global capitals like Amsterdam, London and New York by storm. Many enjoy the chance to socialise with friends in a party-like atmosphere - without the brutal hangovers that result from traditional drug-dominated nightclub culture. "I want to give people an idea that you can listen to great music, gather without alcohol, without drugs, and so on - in a more familiar atmosphere with coffee, delicious food and friends," Zhiganov says.

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. A sweeping 25 per cent tariff on all Canadian goods went into effect Tuesday, before Trump announced a partial, temporary reprieve for some goods that fall under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA). “We are moving ahead with these changes, despite yesterday’s pause, because businesses and workers need assurances right now,” he said, adding that measures will remain in place for as long as needed. Under the working-sharing agreement, all employees who participate in it must agree to cutting their normal working hours – a minimum 10 per cent reduction. Ottawa also announced a suite of other supports for Canadian businesses and workers.</p>

Many essential functions, such as satellite information, weather and its effect on airplane engine health, come from these offices, said Craig McLean, former NOAA director of research, during a news conference last Friday.

As deadly severe storms swept the US this week, recent Donald Trump administration staffing cuts have left key parts of weather monitoring and disaster preparedness systems severely understaffed, the Guardian has learned. A multi-day tornado outbreak tore across several southern states, with significant damage reported near Ada, Oklahoma, including part of an elementary school. In addition to this week’s tornado threat, weather warnings for high winds, dust storms, wildfires and a major blizzard stretched across much of the central US this week as a tumultuous spring storm system swept the country. Some high-impact offices, such as the one in New Orleans, did not appear to lose any staff. This happens most typically when weather service staff are forced to seek physical shelter when the storms they are forecasting affect their home office, but can also happen during periods of communication outages.</p>

Even before he was sworn into office for a second time in January, Trump announced he would impose 25-percent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, citing concerns over border security and drug trafficking, particularly the flow of fentanyl into the US. Canada responded promptly and assertively to the US tariffs with retaliatory protectionist measures of its own that it had first announced on February 1. While Trump and Trudeau have exchanged heated personal remarks in recent weeks, Sheinbaum has taken a more measured approach. She added that Mexico may look for other trading partners besides the US and could shift trade alliances “if necessary”. “How do you negotiate a stable agreement when one party is consistently changing the rules or imposing new tariffs without warning?” Nadjibulla asked.</p>

"High walls cannot block innovative thinking; decoupling and severed links will only isolate those who impose them." Wang was asked directly if Trump's retreat from multilateral forums, freezing of foreign aid and strained relations with allies presented a strategic opening for China on the global stage. He said major powers have a responsibility to fulfill their international obligations and act with accountability.

The federal government is launching a more than $6-billion aid package for businesses impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and relaxing some employment insurance (EI) rules to help workers. The government is also temporarily relaxing rules around a program that allows employees to receive partial EI benefits while working reduced hours. Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Thursday that Canada would delay its second round of retaliatory tariffs, worth $125 billion, until April 2. Our first duty is to make sure that these tariffs don't get imposed on Canada," he said. The U.S. already imposes anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber, but Trump is threatening to top those with additional tariffs.</p>

Ives also reaffirmed his view that Tesla’s autonomous driving efforts outweigh near-term demand concerns for its EVs and said that they, along with the company's push into robotics, could put the company north of $2 trillion in value.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/07/business/tariffs-trump-canada/index.html'>Trump threatens new tariffs on Canada, including 250% tax on dairy</a></h2><b>Source:</b> CNN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-07 17:48:45 <p>
It’s yet another twist in a serpentine trade policy that seems to shift on an hourly basis. Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin lambasted the decision, arguing it was creating an undue burden on her state’s dairy industry. Trump has been criticizing Canadian tariffs on US lumber for several weeks, claiming America should respond in kind. An executive order Trump signed Saturday said America has an “abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs.” It’s not quite that simple, industry experts argue: They warn tariffs could end up increasing lumber and building costs — and even push up housing prices for consumers.

In a release obtained exclusively by FOX Business, DHS said the TSA has more people doing "full-time union work" rather than performing screening functions at 86% of U.S. airports. These officers are paid by the government but work "full-time on union matters" and do not retain certification to perform screening functions, DHS said. DHS said these circumstances have impeded TSA’s chief responsibility "to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe." DHS said Transportation Security Officers will now be promoted based on their performance, not longevity or union membership.

President Donald Trump discusses his latest talks with Iran, shedding light on how he prefers to negotiate a deal. "There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal," he said. An infographic titled "Iran's highly enriched uranium stockpiles rapidly increase" was created in Istanbul on May 28, 2024. The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has repeatedly warned in recent months that Iran is pushing forward in its development of near-nuclear-grade uranium and now possesses enough uranium, if further enriched, to develop five nuclear weapons. Russia has reportedly offered to serve as a mediator in the U.S. talks with Iran, though Trump did not comment on whether that would happen.</p>

There have been reports that the Boots chain could be sold off separately by its new owner, US private equity firm Sycamore Partners. "While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company," he added. Walgreens is also made up of its namesake US retail business, specialty pharmacy group Shields Health Solutions and healthcare provider VillageMD. In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale but later dropped these plans, saying potential buyers had been unable to raise enough funds. The past seven days have seen tariffs implemented, a major domestic speech and developments on relations with Ukraine.</p>

Sale of Walgreens Boots Alliance to Sycamore Partners will mean further uncertainty for pharmacy chain staff In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale with a suggested price tag of up to £10bn but later dropped the plans as potential buyers, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, the US private equity investor Apollo Global Management and Asda’s owners TDR Capital, struggled to raise funds. Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said Sycamore was likely to seek a swift sale of Boots to a private equity buyer in the first instance as it “will care more about making money now rather than later”. However, in recent years, Boots has improved its pricing, closed hundreds of ageing stores and improved its beauty ranges to benefit from a shift among young people towards spending on cosmetics and beauty products rather than fashion. It could also benefit from the Labour government’s shift towards primary healthcare in which pharmacies are expected to play a bigger role.</p>

President Donald Trump indicated Friday that he is considering imposing “large scale” sanctions on Russia to pressure the country into a ceasefire and peace deal with Ukraine. Hobbs is running for a second term after Donald Trump carried the state last year by six percentage points. That idea has been echoed by President Donald Trump, who suggested there was significant “fraud” in the Social Security program in his address to Congress on Tuesday night, and by Republicans who are eying potential cuts to Medicaid and other federal spending. David Sacks, a tech investor and President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar, announced late Thursday that Trump has signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, to be funded using bitcoin seized by the federal government in criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. SAN FRANCISCO — President Donald Trump will host cryptocurrency CEOs and investors at the White House on Friday, signaling a dramatic change in the fortunes of an industry with a reputation for scandals and that has been treated with suspicion by financial regulators.</p>

"The reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings," said White House crypto czar and billionaire David Sacks in an X post Thursday. Bitcoin is a digital currency and virtual payment system designed to exist outside the control of an central entity. It runs on a network of computers in which all transactions are recorded, verified, and updated by technology known as blockchain, which is akin to an online public ledger meant to prevent fraud. Blockchain and bitcoin were created in 2009 by a person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. You can also buy bitcoin funds, the way you would purchase a mutual fund, or buy the coin directly on financial platforms like Cash App or PayPal.</p>

But, by Thursday night March 6, when he signed an executive order on the reserve, that plan had changed. Many Bitcoiners complained BTC would be diluted alongside lesser-cap coins and that Bitcoin has unique characteristics as “digital gold” where other projects don’t. Texas passed a bill to create its own Bitcoin Reserve, leading about 20 other states that are considering the same, Hamilton reported.

Trump directed the secretaries of treasury and commerce to develop “budget-neutral strategies” for acquiring additional bitcoin that have no “incremental costs” on taxpayers. “For the first time, industry leaders feel they’re walking into a collaborative discussion,” said Les Borsai, co-founder of Wave Digital Assets, a crypto investment adviser, who said he did not receive an invitation. “Crypto has made big strides, but it’s still a relatively nascent industry,” Richardson said. The other coins are smaller and function in a very different way, one he said may create more risk.

One of the first steps after the establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate stockpile of other digital assets will be an audit of how much cryptocurrency the government holds, according to White House crypto czar David Sacks.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Thursday creating the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the separate stockpile of other digital assets, to be capitalized with crypto forfeited in legal proceedings. Both the reserve and the stockpile will contain crypto forfeited as part of legal proceedings, the action said. </p>

The president, who had previously called bitcoin "a scam," changed his stance on crypto last year — he now has his own cryptocurrency — and pledged at a Nashville bitcoin conference to create the reserve. The US already owns a bunch of bitcoin, mostly acquired through asset forfeiture in court proceedings. If you peruse crypto fans' commentary about the news, you'll see a mixed reaction: Some are upset that there's no immediate plan for the US to buy a lot of bitcoin — which would boost bitcoin prices.

CEO Michael Saylor has grown Strategy’s pile to nearly half a million bitcoin and the stock is falling with most of the asset class. It’s been quite a week for bitcoin, with President Trump’s executive order establishing a strategic bitcoin national reserve late last night, though it failed to boost the price of the coin, which has dropped to $86,000 as of 12:15 p.m. CEO Michael Saylor will be at today’s inaugural White House Crypto Summit and spoke on Fox Business about his ideas for how the reserve should be built, which included the US adding bitcoin slowly and strategically. Despite the executive order saying any bitcoin purchased will be done only through “budget-neutral strategies,” public companies around the globe are still steadily buying and stashing bitcoin. “As of 3/3/2025, we hold 2391 $BTC acquired for ~$196.3 million at ~82,100 per bitcoin,” CEO Simon Gerovich posted on X.</p>

A simmering tension in the crypto industry resurfaced after President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited order creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and an additional stockpile of other digital assets.

Even as crypto executives issued effusive social media posts praising the move, Bitcoin fell as much as 5.7%. The largest digital asset later pared losses to about 3%, trading at $87,125 as of 12 p.m. in New York. </p>

Establishing a bitcoin reserve was one of several crypto-related promises Trump made on the campaign trail last year. Critics have long said bitcoin lacks any inherent value, but it’s so far defied naysayers with remarkable price increases. Some supporters of a strategic bitcoin reserve said it could one day help pay off the U.S. national debt. Trump’s executive order did not equate to an immediate price spike for bitcoin, which was trading around $86,000 shortly after his announcement.

has demanded immediate financial disclosures from Crypto Czar David Sacks (who  reportedly liquidated his holdings just days ago), questioning potential conflicts of interest amid Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement. This has fueled speculation that some aspects of the reserve and stockpile may be politically motivated rather than purely strategic. Despite its bold rhetoric, the order largely reaffirms current asset management practices rather than introducing substantive new policies. Strategic reserves are government-controlled stockpiles of critical assets, typically created to mitigate national security or economic stability risks. Some investors also viewed the plan as antithetical to Bitcoin’s core ethos of decentralization and voluntary participation.</p>

In signing an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Trump also established a federal Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include various other cryptocurrencies seized by the U.S. government “in connection with criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.” Trump stated on Sunday that such a stockpile would specifically feature XRP, Solana, and Cardano, sending market prices for those assets flying. "Those five have to be the largest by market cap, so I think people are reading into that a little bit too much.

When the president last weekend discussed his plans for a reserve on social media, he said it would include bitcoin as well as other digital assets: ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), solana (SOL), and cardano (ADA). But Sacks made it clear the government would not acquire additional assets for that stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings. It fell sharply from above $90,000 in the hour after Thursday's presidential action before regaining much of that ground. It's still down 18% from its all-time high above $109,000 on the day of Trump's inauguration in January. The SEC has dropped several high-profile cases against prominent cryptocurrency companies since Trump took office and created a presidential working group on digital assets that is studying the possibility of moving legislation through Congress that could provide more clarity about regulatory oversight of digital assets.</p>

Trump’s crypto advisor, David Sacks, stated on X that the Bitcoin reserve will be funded with Bitcoin already held by the federal government, seized through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. Most of these Bitcoin holdings have been acquired through cryptocurrency seizures, often stemming from law enforcement operations targeting illicit activities such as black-market trading and transactions on darknet markets.

Bitcoin analysts warn of limited upside after Trump’s reserve plan excludes new government purchases, with BTC struggling to hold above key resistance levels. Trump’s executive order, signed on March 7, outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases rather than actively acquiring Bitcoin (BTC) through market purchases, Cointelegraph reported. Bitcoin plunged over 6% after the announcement, falling from $90,400 to $84,979, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows. “The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph. This “softer approach” may be more viable and meet less mainstream resistance, according to Bitfinex Analysts, who added:</p>

Lee’s comments come mere hours before the highly anticipated event and against a backdrop of markets in turmoil. Trump’s order establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile, but with no immediate purchases — only seized crypto. These tokens all fell sharply after the government confirmed it wouldn’t be buying them any time soon. Ethereum fell 4.4%, Solana lost 3.2%, Cardano slid 7.9%, and XRP dropped 1.4% as traders unwound bets on a US-backed buying spree. However, they have mostly recovered their losses and are now trading flat, just as those closest to the projects gather in Washington, looking for answers.</p>

The first-of-its-kind reserve will be anchored by a stash of Bitcoin the government already owns, estimated to be worth billions of dollars. President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to create a national stockpile of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, an audacious idea that has been widely criticized as a scheme to enrich crypto investors. The order also calls for federal agencies to develop strategies to buy more Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, as long as those purchases do not generate extra costs for taxpayers. Since Mr. Trump took office in January, his administration has moved rapidly to elevate the crypto industry, a volatile sector that had battled with federal regulators for years. Mr. Trump has a personal stake in the success of the crypto industry, creating conflicts of interests that have raised alarms with government ethics experts.</p>

President Donald Trump's decision to establish official government cryptocurrency reserves in the US has drawn criticism from industry watchers. Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. "No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the government," he said. "This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets," said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Additionally, Sacks said that each government department - including the intelligence agencies - will have to audit and "self-report" their own cryptocurrency holdings.</p>

Several million dollars were funneled directly to Trump's campaign and inaugural fund, a sign of just how much was riding on his victory. For Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, a key issue is how the U.S. can use blockchain technology to maintain its dominance in global finance. Nazarov said the U.S. must ensure that key financial markets – treasuries, investment funds, and real estate – are tokenized. The reserve will be funded exclusively through bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases, ensuring taxpayers bear no financial burden. Non-bitcoin assets will be placed in a separate Digital Asset Stockpile managed by the Treasury Department.</p>

For believers, cryptocurrencies represent a financial revolution that reduces dependence on centralized authorities while offering individuals an alternative to traditional banking systems. The proliferation of "memecoins" -- cryptocurrencies based on celebrities, internet memes, or pop culture items rather than technical utility -- presents another challenge. Sacks has said that if previous administrations had held onto their digital holdings over the past decade, they would be worth $17 billion today. The previous administration had implemented restrictions on banks holding cryptocurrencies -- which have since been lifted -- and allowed former SEC chairman Gary Gensler to pursue aggressive enforcement. However, meaningful change will likely require congressional action, where crypto legislation has remained stalled despite intense lobbying efforts led by investors, including Trump ally Marc Andreessen, an influential venture capitalist.</p>

The nearly complete skeleton was stained red, and scientists think it may have been wrapped in a painted animal skin before burial. When the humanlike child was discovered, scientists noted that some of their attributes — including body proportions and jawbone — looked Neanderthal. That was a radical notion at the time, but advances in genetics have since proven those populations existed — and people today still carry Neanderthal DNA. Techniques have improved, and researchers reported Friday in the journal Science Advances that they were able to date the skeleton by measuring part of a protein that's found primarily in human bones.

Disentangling how much of that difference is rooted in biology versus the environment could lead to better treatments, experts argue. While that early research has been discredited, modern studies still find cognitive differences between men and women — at least on average. "It's actually incredibly difficult in humans to … causally distinguish how much of a sex difference is societally or environmentally driven," Raznahan said. "There are maybe species-wide sex differences in the brain, but so far, they haven't been proven," Eliot told Live Science. After pinpointing these networks, the researchers trained their AI algorithms to "predict" a child's sex or gender based on brain activity.</p>

To earn grants, researchers must explain how their study designs account for sex, such that any differences between the sexes will be made apparent. That's partly because, to uncover differences between males and females, you must study both sexes, including in research with lab animals. That idea has been thoroughly debunked, but for a time, the prevailing viewpoint was, "let's just study males and keep it simple," Eliot told Live Science. Many drugs act at the connection points between neurons, so it's important to understand how those connections are formed and maintained, Woolley said. But if including both sexes in research is no longer prioritized, it could set back the whole field of biomedicine, Woolley emphasized.</p>

The tandem hunting practiced by Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) and local fishermen often yields more bounty for all. Previous research from a 40-year-long monitoring program centered around this joint dolphin-human foraging has shown how the humans cooperate with each other to maximize their fish catch. Cantor and his colleagues used drones to film dolphins’ foraging behavior near Laguna over 18 days in 2018 during the peak of mullet migration season. Ecologists on Cantor’s team are now working with computer scientists to build an AI model that can more efficiently extract patterns in the dolphins’ surface behavior from drone videos.

Green sea turtles are laying their eggs earlier in the season to cope with warming temperatures, a new study shows. Scientists have long known that the sex of most turtle species is determined by incubation temperature — higher temperatures give life to females, and lower ones produce males. As climate change drives up temperatures, more females and fewer males are being born, potentially weakening populations. It really isn’t,” says study coauthor Mollie Rickwood, a marine biologist at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.

An artificial intelligence (AI) powered service offered by Apple turned it into a text message which - to her surprise - asked if she been "able to have sex" before calling her a "piece of ****". If it is something you would be interested in, feel free to give me a call on ____, ask for myself ____ INAUDIBLE. He suggested it was at the "challenging end for speech-to-text engines to deal with". He believes there are a number of factors which could have resulted in rogue transcription: Apple also suspended its AI summaries of news headlines after it displayed false notifications on stories.</p>

The findings are based on a survey of 3,000 women employed in IT, global capability centres (GCCs), and emerging tech sectors. While there has been a marked shift in gender representation, challenges such as the glass ceiling, pay inequity, and limited mentorship continue to hinder progress. Approximately 80% of respondents were from key tech hubs such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, and the National Capital Region (NCR). However, tech companies have improved gender representation, with women now making up nearly 42% of their workforce — an increase from single-digit figures in previous years. Around 60% of women acknowledge that diversity initiatives are gaining momentum; however, 40% believe these efforts remain largely symbolic or ineffective.</p>

Have you ever skipped a highly-rated movie just because of the language issue- not available in either Hindi or English? For this kind of movie, Amazon Prime Video is working on a solution by testing AI-assisted dubbing, which will make it easier for viewers to enjoy foreign films and shows without relying solely on subtitles. This approach reduces dubbing costs and speeds up the process, ensuring that more content becomes available to viewers worldwide. The company already provides subtitles, closed captions, and audio descriptions for better accessibility. AI dubbing is the next step in ensuring that users can enjoy a seamless language-friendly streaming experience.</p>

Gboard, the default keyboard app that comes pre-installed on almost all Android devices is getting a visual change that might be making many uncomfortable. Instead of the rectangular keys most of us are familiar with, the new shapes seem to be frustrating many as it has messed up with their muscle memory. And while there is no functional change as to how these keys work and that the new keys look more modern than they ever did, some are having a hard time using the “”Long press for symbols option, which appears directly above a letter. However, users can try turning off key borders for a cleaner look. To do so, open Gboard settings, navigate to Themes, select a theme and on the pop-up that appears, turn off the toggle named ‘Key borders’.</p>

New head coach Pete Carroll has made it clear that he wants to compete now. However, this quarterback class isn't viewed as exceptional -- especially compared to last year's group. Yes, that apparently includes the possibility of trading for a current starting quarterback. The Seahawks released Tyler Lockett, Rayshawn Jenkins, George Fant, Dre'Mont Jones and Roy Robertson-Harris, plus DK Metcalf is looking for a change of scenery. Smith set career highs in completion percentage (70.4%), passing yards (4,320) and wins (10) last season, but also finished 21st among qualified quarterbacks in EPA/play (-0.04), and threw 15 interceptions, which was one off from the league high.</p>

He misses plenty of bats and the ERA estimators outline just how unlucky Pfaadt was last year. He's looked almost too good to be true thus far, with a deep arsenal of pitches and one dominant spring start under his belt. And he's merely entering his age-23 season; it's scary to think that Sasaki is still on the escalator. My Call: The ADP keeps rising on Sasaki as his early unveiling to America has been exciting. Injury optimism is not my favorite game with pitchers, so I'll probably ignore Strider unless his ADP falls outside pick 200 (it won't).</p>

But plenty of action is already underway as teams are cutting veterans, re-signing stars and shopping for potential trades. Wagner, 34, led Washington with 132 tackles last season, a performance that earned him second-team All-Pro honors and his 10th Pro Bowl selection.

Gavin Newsom, an LGBTQ ally, broke with his party, saying that transgender athletes playing in female sports is "deeply unfair." Newsom, sometimes viewed as a 2028 presidential hopeful, also agreed that the political ad that hurt former Vice President Kamala Harris the most in her presidential campaign was her previous support for providing taxpayer-funded gender transition-related medical care for detained immigrants and federal prisoners. He referenced that moment while discussing his alignment with Kirk's views on transgender athletes in women's sports. Newsom briefly referenced the law in his discussion with Kirk, highlighting that it was passed before he became governor. Newsom's remarks came just a month after Trump signed an executive order intending on banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports.</p>

Danny Briere made the difficult decision to trade Scott Laughton ahead of Friday's 3 p.m. In exchange, the Flyers received a first-round pick and prospect Nikita Grebenkin, per reports. "Like I told him this morning, no matter what happens here today — if you're still with us or you're not — our relationship is always going to be our relationship. Contending clubs love players like him, guys that play multiple positions, have a playoff edge to their game and kill penalties. "Right from the get-go, when my name was in rumors, I got a call from Torts right away, we had a good chat about it," Laughton said last April at his end-of-the-season press conference.</p>

Things will get started on March 10 when the exclusive negotiating rights NFL teams have had with their impending free agents ends. Along those lines, I have set target prices with total contract value, overall guarantees, amount fully guaranteed at signing and first three years compensation (when applicable) for 10 intriguing defensive players who will be unrestricted free agents. Players don't necessarily sign for their target prices because free agency is a fluid process where adaptations must be made to changing market conditions. Greenlaw didn't make his 2024 season debut until Week 15 because of a fluke injury in Super Bowl LVIII. Reed was arguably the Jets' most consistent cornerback in 2024 playing opposite two-time first-team All-Pro Sauce Gardner, who had a down year by his standards.</p>

Garrett Podell came up with several bold predictions for free agency, and we're going to check out three of those below. At this point, it's starting to feel like we're getting a new trade request EVERY DAY in the NFL, and on Thursday, that request came from Trey Hendrickson, who was given permission to seek a trade by the Bengals.

Just two weeks ago, the Washington Commanders granted star defensive lineman Jonathan Allen permission to seek a trade. Allen was set to enter the final year of a four-year, $72 million contract he signed in 2021. ESPN reports that a handful of teams expressed interest in Allen, but felt as though he would eventually be released. Not only has Cincinnati granted Trey Hendrickson permission to seek a trade, but they have also released defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins, Sam Hubbard surprisingly announced his retirement and then B.J.

The position is important, as teams look for their matchup cheat codes like Trey McBride or Brock Bowers. There just aren't enough good TEs for each team to have a player like that. Yet, in a weak tight end class, he's probably one of the best options. Johnson was fine in his five Saints seasons, but he never broke out. He's a starting tight end somewhere, but it's getting harder to see another level coming for him.</p>

Even at 30 years old, in search of an elevated salary, Hendrickson should have a formidable market thanks to his production. So here's a rundown of the most logical landing spots, keeping in mind Hendrickson is already owed more than $18 million this year: They've also got plenty of money to spend, with more than $46 million in projected 2025 cap space. Filling their pass-rushing need via trade would potentially also allow them to focus on addressing cornerback in free agency. The Bears just gave up picks -- and a big contract -- to Montez Sweat in 2023, but they could use another proven edge presence.</p>

Brown’s future had been a source of speculation for much of the 2024 season — he even told the team he’d quit if they didn’t believe in him after a loss to James Madison — as North Carolina scuffled to an uneven season. Brown was one of just three active coaches in college football who had won a national title and was in his second stint at North Carolina after coming out of retirement to replace Larry Fedora.

Stephen A. Smith has become a fixture on ESPN’s airwaves, and that won’t be changing anytime soon. “I’m happy and honored to remain a member of the Disney/ESPN family for, at least, the next five years,” Smith said in a statement on Friday. “Stephen A. works incredibly hard to elevate the sports conversation day-in and day-out and we are grateful he will remain at ESPN,” said Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN Chairman. Smith will continue to appear on “First Take,” the morning debate show, but according to The Athletic, will no longer be a figurehead of the NBA pregame show next season, and will be allowed to scale back other ESPN appearances, too.

Both Myles Garrett and the Cleveland Browns are dug in on their respective positions, with Garrett wanting a trade out of Cleveland and the organization steadfastly refusing to even discuss it. "While I've loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won't allow me to be complacent," Garrett said when he announced his trade request. Meanwhile, Berry has been just as adamant that the team will not honor Garrett's request. "We understand the trade costs and everything, but our stance really has not changed," Berry said. "We can't imagine a situation where not having Myles in this organization is best for the Browns."</p>

SHEPHERDSTOWN — It’s been a season to remember with a smile and satisfied memories for the Shepherd University men’s basketball team. The regular season closed with an important road win at Millersville University, giving Shepherd third place in the PSAC’s East Division and a first-round tournament game versus Shippensburg University. Carson Poffenberger, Cole Paar and Elwyne Wordlaw were the other three players used by Coach Namolik. If the Rams did indeed defeat visiting Shippensburg, a team they defeated twice during the regular season, then Wednesday’s tournament quarterfinal gave them a chance to tie Namolik’s all-time season high in victories. Any of the other conference teams with worthy records are eligible for at-large bids to that same tournament.</p>

With the injury taking place in 1995, there was a lack of research and resources for treating traumatic brain injuries, commonly referred to as TBIs. Then athlete and coach Stephanie Zavilla will take the stage to share her personal experience of a traumatic brain injury. Once a brain injury patient is able to withstand regular activities and light aerobic exercise, they can begin moderate sport-specific exercises. Although there were very few concussion protocols in place when her son was playing baseball, Karika-Thompson is encouraged to see how far the science and research has advanced. Menon recognizes that significant problems around brain injuries still remain and calls for more collaboration in order to improve patient outcomes.</p>

Xavier McKinney got by far the most money among all free-agent safeties last offseason. Holland was a good safety for the Dolphins and is just 25 years old heading into next season. He isn't coming off his best season, but still has plenty of prime years left. Bynum started every game each of the past three seasons, and he does everything pretty well. He had 137 tackles two seasons ago and a career best three interceptions last season.</p>

It's rare for a first-team NFL All-Pro player to change teams in the offseason. Baun was the top option among linebackers, but there are some other good options. Bolton is a strong all-around three-down linebacker who will be just 25 years old next season. There are other good short-term veteran options (Bobby Wagner, Lavonte David) but Sherwood's age (25 years old) gives him a bump. David has played 13 NFL seasons, all with the Buccaneers, and is a franchise legend.</p>

Williams had a great game for the Philadelphia Eagles, sacking Patrick Mahomes twice. The timing couldn't have better, with Williams set to become a free agent. It says something about the Eagles' depth that Williams started only seven games last season. There's some question if Williams can have a similar impact without so much attention going to teammates like Carter, but he's going to get a nice payday.

Robinson was a midseason acquisition by the Vikings, and he competently played left tackle after Minnesota lost starter Christian Darrisaw to an injury. Robinson has started 101 games over eight seasons, mostly with the Jaguars, and he doesn't turn 30 until October. Zeitler will be 35 next season, but he is still a capable starter after 13 NFL seasons.</p>

He chose Troy Aikman with the first pick in the draft, then used a supplemental pick on former Cretin quarterback Steve Walsh, who had played for him at Miami. Turns out Walker would have been a bad addition even if the Vikings had traded nothing for him. Here’s what many might not remember about Johnson: He coached the Cowboys for only five seasons.

Liverpool’s manager, Arne Slot, faces minimal disruptions in his squad selection despite a few injury concerns. Notably, Tyler Morton, Joe Gomez, and Conor Bradley remain sidelined, whilst Cody Gakpo is still a doubt. Predicted to start are Alisson in goal, with a back four of Alexander-Arnold, Konate, Van Dijk, and Tsimikas. Liverpool’s approach to this game will be critical, as they balance their Premier League ambitions with the upcoming Carabao Cup final against Newcastle. For Liverpool, maintaining focus and applying Slot’s tactical game plan from the outset will be imperative to secure three points.</p>
