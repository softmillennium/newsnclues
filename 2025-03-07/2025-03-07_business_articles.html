HIIGHLAND PARK, Ill. (WLS) -- A group of thieves broke into or tried to break into nine north suburban businesses in about 30 minutes early Friday morning, Highland Park officials said.

The group of five people in a single vehicle tried to break into the businesses in search of cash in the burglaries and attempted burglaries, officials said.





In each incident, the front door or window was broken, officials said.

Other North Shore communities have experienced similar incidents, officials said.

Highland Park police have been in contact with the impacted businesses, and are working with regional law enforcement on the investigation.

Pharmaceutical giant Merck received a $30.2 million grant from the state in an effort to sway the company to build its $900 million manufacturing facility in the Wilmington area.

The taxpayer-funded grant is the highest amount that has been doled out to a company since Bloom Energy’s approval in 2011.

Merck & Co. has not confirmed whether or not it will choose Delaware as its place to expand, but business leaders in Delaware are optimistic about what the potential move could mean for the state.

Merck & Co. is a global health care company that specializes in the production and distribution of vaccines, pharmaceuticals and animal health care products.

Merck has been looking for a location to set up their newest manufacturing facility, which will produce drug substances and products with a targeted operational start date of 2030.

According to plans shared with Delaware Online/The News Journal via a Freedom of Information Act request, the company is considering constructing a $900 million multi-building complex for labs, manufacturing and distribution operations at the Chestnut Run Innovation and Science Park near Greenville.

Under the conservative estimates listed in the plans, the facility would bring roughly 375 full-time jobs to the area.

The company is reportedly still considering other locations, but is bound by nondisclosure agreements to reveal more about the other possibilities, as reported by the Delaware Business Times.

If Merck chooses the Delaware site, the company would be locked into a 20-year lease at the CRISP campus.

This wouldn’t be Merck’s first venture into the First State, however. The company already has an animal health facility in Millsboro.

The Delaware Council on Development Finance unanimously approved the grant application on Monday, Feb. 24.

The grant was divided into $4.7 million worth in job performance grants and $25.5 million in capital expenditure grants. The performance grants are dispersed after the company makes its investments into the facility and workforce.

Although nothing is promised yet, Michael Fleming, president and CEO of the Delaware Bioscience Association, remains optimistic and said that this deal could cement Delaware as a winner in the area in terms of attracting industrial and scientific investment.

“This new facility would be a tremendous boost for and validation of the growth and momentum of our dynamic life science industry,” Fleming said. “We look forward to welcoming Merck and applaud their interest in strengthening U.S. manufacturing and our supply chain right here in Delaware.

Susan Colby, senior manager of communications for the Delaware Prosperity Partnership echoed that the move would boost Delaware’s portfolio.

“This project would reinforce Delaware’s standing in the global biopharmaceutical ecosystem, and we are excited by the potential opportunities it would provide Delaware residents and businesses,” Colby said.  

As for what Merck has to say about the grant, Ned Ehrbar, associate director of Merck’s global media relations kept it vague, stating via email: Merck is considering Delaware as a potential location to develop a new commercialization and launch facility.

The CRISP campus, located at 984 Centre Road just outside of Greenville, has long been a mainstay in the state’s evolving life sciences investment.

Formerly a site for DuPont research, the 164-acre site was purchased by MRA Group in 2021 with hopes of transforming the site into the leading campus for Delaware’s life science laboratories and research facilities.

Amenities for the campus will include a hotel, childcare and fitness centers, an outdoor amphitheater and accommodations for restaurants.  

Chemical manufacturing company Solenis expanded its research and development facilities into the CRISP campus in late 2022 and precision oncology company Prelude Therapeutics cut the ribbon on their new headquarters at CRISP in February, 2024. DuPont is also leasing 190,000 square-feet of space at its former space.

Last month, the developer group broke ground on the Marriott Residence Inn, which will feature 127 rooms with both short- and long-term stay options, food services, a full-service bar, meeting spaces and outdoor patios

MRA Group declined to comment on the recently approved grant for Merck.

Awarding these grants worth tens of millions of dollars involves a process that is relatively new, with various “checks and balances” in place, but limited transparency at times.  

The Delaware Economic Development Authority was created by the General Assembly under former Gov. John Carney, intended to promote economic activity in Delaware. It is chaired by CJ Bell, the director of the Delaware Division of Small Business.

The Council on Development Finance is an advisor to the Delaware Economic Development Authority, and is responsible for conducting public hearings before the authority issues any financial support to potential projects.

The Delaware Prosperity Partnership, a nonprofit state economic development agency, often vets applications or potential investment opportunities and brings them to the Council. As previously reported by DelawareOnline, since DPP is not technically a part of the state government, it is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.

In the seven years of its existence, the Council on Development Finance has approved every Strategic Funds application that has been brought to it by the Delaware Prosperity Partnership.

The $30 million grant offered to Merck will be reimbursed after the company makes its investment – in this case, a nearly $1 billion one.

In 2021, the Council on Development Finance approved $19 million for WuXi AppTec, a Shanghai-based company that develops and manufactures drugs for pharmaceutical clients, to build its manufacturing campus near Middletown’s Amazon fulfillment center.

Gov. Matt Meyer has gone on record against these types of taxpayer-funded grants, announcing during a Delaware State Chamber of Commerce annual dinner that his administration will see “the use of cash assistance de-emphasized,” as reported by Spotlight Delaware.

Meyer’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the most recent grant funding.

The federal government is launching a more than $6-billion aid package for businesses impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and relaxing some employment insurance (EI) rules to help workers.

Steven MacKinnon, Mary Ng and Rechie Valdez — the ministers of labour, international trade and small business — made the announcement Friday afternoon.

"We have tried and tested tools to get our people through the toughest of crises and we will not hesitate to use them," MacKinnon said.

As part of the supports for businesses, the government is providing $5 billion over two years for exporters to help them find new markets beyond the U.S. and a $500-million loan program through the Business Development Bank of Canada for businesses directly impacted by the tariffs.

Ottawa is also boosting the financing program for the agricultural sector — known as Farm Credit Canada — to the tune of $1 billion.

Ottawa announces billions to support businesses, relaxes some EI rules

The government is also temporarily relaxing rules around a program that allows employees to receive partial EI benefits while working reduced hours. The government says the temporary measures will increase access to the program and lengthen the time that those benefits are typically available.

In a partial climbdown on Thursday, Trump said he is pausing tariffs on some Canadian goods until April 2, offering a reprieve from across-the-board 25 per cent tariffs.

Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Thursday that Canada would delay its second round of retaliatory tariffs, worth $125 billion, until April 2. That's when Trump's batch of "reciprocal" tariffs is due to be imposed on countries around the world. Canada has currently levied $30 billion worth of U.S. imports.

MacKinnon asked about calls for more EI changes amid U.S. tariffs 

Asked by reporters if further measures would be taken to support businesses and workers, MacKinnon said it would depend on how the situation unfolds.

"The ball seems to bounce every day. We have every intention of customizing a response to tariffs or no tariffs as the case may be. Our first duty is to make sure that these tariffs don't get imposed on Canada," he said.

MacKinnon noted has Trump employed "chaotic messaging" when trying to justify his tariffs.

"First this trade war was about securing the border and ending drug smuggling. Then it was about migration and the flow of people going south and then, puzzlingly, it was about American banks or the auto sector," he said.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump threatened to hit Canada's dairy and lumber industries with additional tariffs.

"Canada has been ripping us off for years," the president said.

Canada hardly exports any dairy products to the U.S.

Lumber, on the other hand, has been a consistent sticking point in Canada-U.S. relations for years.

The U.S. already imposes anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber, but Trump is threatening to top those with additional tariffs.

Widespread U.S. tariffs would have a devastating effect on the Canadian economy, with experts saying it would lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses and wreak havoc in key sectors such as Ontario's auto industry.

American tariffs on all steel and aluminum are still due to come into effect next week. Canada is the leading exporter of both metals to the U.S.

            A day after offering Canada a one-month reprieve on punishing, virtually across-the-board 25% tariffs, President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs as soon as Friday on Canadian lumber and dairy products. It’s yet another twist in a serpentine trade policy that seems to shift on an hourly basis.
    


            “Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,” Trump said in an Oval Office address Friday, citing Canada’s roughly 250% tariff on US dairy exports to the country. Trump said America would match those tariffs dollar-for-dollar.
    


            “We may do it as early as today, or we’ll wait until Monday or Tuesday,” Trump said. “We’re going to charge the same thing. It’s not fair. It never has been fair, and they’ve treated our farmers badly.”
    


            Trump’s announcement gave investors, businesses and consumers another strong dose of whiplash. Just one day earlier, on Thursday, Trump announced a one-month pause on all tariffs on Canada and Mexico on products that comply with the US-Mexico-Canada free trade treaty, known as the USMCA. That had, at least temporarily, given many industries, especially autos and agriculture, a major sigh of relief.
    


            On Friday Trump said more “changes and adjustments” on tariffs should be expected in the future.
    


            “There’ll always be some modifications,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “If you have a wall in front of you, sometimes you have to go around the wall instead of through it.”
    


            Stocks, which were lower to start the day after a mixed bag of a jobs report, initially fell after Trump’s tariff threat but pared their losses. The Dow was up about 45 points, or 0.1%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down another 0.1% after falling into correction territory Thursday — a 10% decline from its most recent high.
    


            “The market is having trouble digesting the multidimensional chess that Trump and his team are playing,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. “This multidimensional chess game is not going well for the grand master. There may be a method to the madness. He might be trying to confuse world leaders. But the market is saying stop confusing us. we don’t like this.”
    


            Trump’s threat on Friday added more uncertainty into an economy that has shown cracks in its foundation and could be in danger of slipping if businesses and consumers grow nervous about the administration’s economic policy. Layoffs are mounting, hiring is slowing, consumer confidence is eroding and inflation is picking up again.
    


            Tariffs could worsen all of those factors.
    


            Canada charges exorbitant tariffs on certain dairy products, including a 241% tariff on milk, much to the consternation of America’s dairy farmers, who have complained for years that the border nation is treating them unfairly.
    


            In 2023, a trade dispute panel ruled in favor of Canada, arguing that the high import taxes did not violate the USMCA. Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin lambasted the decision, arguing it was creating an undue burden on her state’s dairy industry.
    


            “Wisconsin dairy farmers work hard every day to bring world class products to market, and they deserve a level playing field with their global competitors,” Baldwin said in the wake of the November 2023 decision. “This decision flies in the face of the agreement our country made with Canada and puts our Made in Wisconsin dairy products at a disadvantage.”
    


            But Trump, who frequently complained about high dairy tariffs in his first term in office, did not negotiate more reasonable tariffs into the USMCA treaty, which he signed.
    


            Despite the grievances and the alarmingly high number, Canadian dairy is not a significant export, and a reciprocal 241% tariff on milk is unlikely to do significant economic damage to either country.
    


            Trump has been criticizing Canadian tariffs on US lumber for several weeks, claiming America should respond in kind. He has claimed America can do without Canadian lumber.
    


            An executive order Trump signed Saturday said America has an “abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs.” It’s not quite that simple, industry experts argue: They warn tariffs could end up increasing lumber and building costs — and even push up housing prices for consumers.
    


            The United States has 300 billion trees, but economists and homebuilders caution that America does not currently have the industrial capacity to meet the demand and that placing a significant tariff on Canadian lumber imports could further exacerbate the ongoing housing affordability crisis.
    


            Lumber is a critical ingredient in the US homebuilding industry, and the United states sources about 30% of the softwood lumber it uses annually from Canada. Lumber imports from Canada are already subject to countervailing and anti-dumping duties of 14.5%.

PostNord will stop delivering letters to Denmark at the end of 2025, though package distribution will remain

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- No more mail for Denmark: PostNord will stop delivering letters to the Nordic nation at the end of 2025, though package distribution will remain.

PostNord, a state-run agency that services Denmark and Sweden, announced the change Thursday. Roughly 1,500 mailboxes throughout Denmark will be taken down in the second half of the year, and Danes can seek refunds for stamps. An estimated 1,500 of PostNord’s 4,600 employees will be laid off this year.

Sweden’s letter delivery will not be affected, the agency said.

PostNord said the number of letters in Denmark has decreased by 90% since 2000, and by more than 30% in 2024 compared with the year before. The agency blamed an increasingly digital atmosphere in Denmark and worldwide, and 2024 Danish legislation that drove the cost of postage up.

“We have been the Danes' postal service for 400 years and therefore it is a difficult decision to put a bow on that part of our story," PostNord Denmark chief executive Kim Pedersen said in a news release. "The Danes have become more and more digital which means that there are very few letters left for us to handle today, and the downturn continues so clearly that the market for letters is no longer profitable.”

Pedersen said the heart of PostNord's business is parcel delivery, which it will focus on in 2026.

Pelle Dragsted, a member of the Danish parliament, wrote on social platform X that the cessation of letter delivery will unfairly affect Danes who live in remote areas.

Letters can still be sent through private companies, Danish public broadcaster DR reported. The state will ensure that infrastructure remains for mail to be delivered to Denmark’s remote areas, including smaller island communities.

Pedersen also told DR that people can send their letters as packages through PostNord’s parcel shops.

Germany's Deutsche Post also announced layoffs on Thursday, with plans to cut 8,000 jobs

The agreement will see Smith continue to lead 'First Take,' while freeing him up to pursue other options outside of sports.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


ESPN‘s superstar commentator Stephen A. Smith has inked a new long-term deal with the sports media giant.


	The deal, which could top nine figures per The Athletic, will see Smith continue to lead First Take, his flagship weekday show. He will also appear on other ESPN programming.




	However it also allows Smith to pursue other deals for programming that touches politics, culture, or other topics.


	“I’m happy and honored to remain a member of the Disney/ESPN family for, at least, the next five years,” Smith said. “There’s only bigger and bigger things ahead. It starts with continuing to put in that work. See y’all soon.”

	“Stephen A. works incredibly hard to elevate the sports conversation day-in and day-out and we are grateful he will remain at ESPN,” added Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN Chairman. “He is a difference maker, and fans are captivated by his deep sports knowledge, strong opinions and unmistakable flair.”


	When The Hollywood Reporter spoke to Smith last year about hus contract discussions with ESPN, Smith suggested that he was thinking bigger and broader about what he could be doing for the company, which is navigating the shift from linear TV to digital.


	“When we talk about adapting, ESPN is adapting from the standpoint of looking at the media landscape, the advent of podcasting and podcasters, the digital stratosphere, YouTube becoming the new television platform in a lot of people’s eyes and adapting to the inordinate amount of competition that’s coming from other places and saying, ‘okay, how can we maintain relevancy and ultimately continue to stand afloat above the crowd?’” Smith said. “That’s the challenge that ESPN has, and I view myself as a pivotal component to ensuring that that remains the state of affairs when it comes to ESPN and Walt Disney.”

Attendees to the recent Workshop & Golf Business Conference, arranged by Golf Accountancy Matters and hosted at Kingswood Golf & Country Club in Surrey, have proclaimed it a great success.

The event, the second of its type for Golf Accountancy Matters, bought together many of the 50-plus golf clubs that the company work with to discuss best practices in golf club accounting and bookkeeping, and to listen to the four guest speakers invited to talk at the conference.

In the first section, much of the emphasis was on how golf clubs and Golf Accountancy Matters can streamline their processes to reduce workload, increase accuracy and save money in the preparation of the golf club’s accounts. Golf Accountancy Matters adopt modern technologies to greatly assist in this regard, with an end-to-end solution that integrates the accounting software package, Xero, with Intelligent Golf. In addition, Datamolino provides for paperless billing and ApprovalMax for invoice payment authorisation – further adding to the timesaving in accounts preparation.

In the second section, delegates, largely comprising golf club managers, bookkeepers, accountants and treasurers, heard from Ben Hoskin of Regency Purchasing about the modern technologies being used to help supplier management in the food, beverage and hospitality areas.

Sam Hodson, Principle at Hillier Hopkins LLP, spoke next about some of the new accounting guidelines imminently coming into force, as well as valuable information about VAT partial exemption and golf club incorporation – two areas that private-member clubs need to understand in their relationship with taxation as non-profit organisations.

Mike Ramsey and Julian Curtis, from Centennial Investment Management, gave a joint presentation on their recent experience of an attempted bank fraud. It was both fascinating and terrifying in equal measure and opened everyone’s eyes to the high level of sophistication now being adopted by fraudsters. Fortunately, Mike and Julian’s experience of banking helped them recover the temporarily lost funds, but not without considerable stress and sleeplessness.

Finally, as the keynote speaker, Ben Sharpe, Managing Director & President of Callaway Golf, EMEA Division, took to the stage to give an insightful talk on his views of increasing participation in the game. Ben spoke about how we, as an industry, need to move from initiatives to grow the game, to embedding it within our mindset. 

Ben spoke of how technology can lead the way and facilitate growth. During his 45-minute presentation, he recalled his own career experiences as an industry leader of the gamification of the golf range through Topgolf and later, Toptracer, and how these new technologies revolutionised even the concept of playing golf and participation.

Paul Mould, Director at Golf Accountancy Matters, commented, “the event went really well, and it was great to see so many of our clients under one roof. It was an invaluable opportunity to not only talk about some of the latest initiatives and technologies we’re adopting, but also to share best practices in golf club bookkeeping and accounts.”

“A big thank you to our guest speakers, who each gave very different, but equally interesting and insightful, information on their areas of expertise. And of course, thank you must also go out to all attendees. They made the event by their enthusiasm and engagement.”

Plans are already in motion of Golf Accountancy Matters 3rd Annual Workshop & Golf Business Conference later in the year. For more details, visit www.golfaccountancymatters.co.uk.

Pitch Wharf, the new flagship venue from indoor golf brand Pitch, has officially opened in the heart of London's financial district.

Sale of Walgreens Boots Alliance to Sycamore Partners will mean further uncertainty for pharmacy chain staff

The US owner of Boots is to be taken private in a $10bn (£7.8bn) deal that will mean further uncertainty for thousands of workers at the UK-based pharmacy chain.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, which operates more than 1,800 Boots stores in the UK, has been sold to the US private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The chain has been struggling as customers turn to online shopping for cheaper products.

Walgreens’ market value has collapsed by 90% since 2015 and is valued at $9.3bn. It has debt and lease obligations of $30bn.

Sycamore Partners has struck an $11.45-a-share deal for Walgreens Boots Alliance, giving it an equity value of about $10bn.

Sycamore is expected to retain the US retail business and sell or spin off the rest, including the UK chemist chain Boots, which traces its roots to John Boot’s first Nottingham store in 1849.

Boots has more than 50,000 employees, including at its headquarters in Nottingham, who face further uncertainty after more than three years of speculation over its future ownership.

In a letter to staff, seen by the Guardian, Ornella Barra, the head of Walgreens’ international business including Boots, said the deal was a significant development for the division, adding: “It’s important to note that nothing is changing today.”

In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale with a suggested price tag of up to £10bn but later dropped the plans as potential buyers, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, the US private equity investor Apollo Global Management and Asda’s owners TDR Capital, struggled to raise funds. A plan to float the business at a valuation of about £7bn was dropped last year.

Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said Sycamore was likely to seek a swift sale of Boots to a private equity buyer in the first instance as it “will care more about making money now rather than later”.

Mould said “considerable headwinds” for UK retailers, including rising costs and low consumer confidence as household bills continued to rise amid global political and economic difficulties, may make Boots a tough sell. Fears are also growing for hundreds of WH Smith stores as its listed owner tries to sell its estate of more than 500 shops on the high street to focus on its more successful travel arm.

However, in recent years, Boots has improved its pricing, closed hundreds of ageing stores and improved its beauty ranges to benefit from a shift among young people towards spending on cosmetics and beauty products rather than fashion. It could also benefit from the Labour government’s shift towards primary healthcare in which pharmacies are expected to play a bigger role.

Patrick O’Brien at the retail analysts GlobalData said a successful sale of Boots would depend on whether Sycamore was prepared to accept a lower figure than the “ludicrous valuation” previously sought by Walgreens.

He said: “Boots has improved dramatically since then but the valuations that were talked about when they were trying to sell a while ago were ridiculous in terms of multiples of revenues or profits.”

Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “The Boots business looks eminently floatable, but we will probably have to wait until this time next year to see it attempt an IPO as its new owner, Sycamore, won’t complete the takeover of Walgreens until [the last three months of] this year.”

Walgreens first took a stake in Boots in 2012 and completed a buyout two years later. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Boots said it was cutting 4,000 jobs, about 7% of its workforce, and shut almost 50 of its opticians branches.

Two years ago, the chain announced the closure of 300 shops, which it completed at the end of last year, as it “evolved” its store estate.

The deal will bring an end to Walgreens’ 98-year run as a listed company, although the second-largest pharmacy chain in the US still has 35 days to seek or entertain rival bids.

As part of the deal with Sycamore, the Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina, the Walgreens executive chair and the largest shareholder, will keep a minority shareholding in the business. Barra told staff Pessina would remain a significant owner alongside Sycamore.

Pessina forged the transatlantic pharmacy company by merging the US-based Walgreens with Alliance Boots of Europe in 2014, having paid £4.3bn to take a 45% stake in the business in 2012.

The Pharmacists’ Defence Association (PDA) said news of the buyout “may be particularly worrying to pharmacists and other employees who have so recently seen what happened in the UK community pharmacy sector in the case of LloydsPharmacy [where the entire chain was broken up and sold off to independents].”

Walgreens’ market value peaked at $100bn soon after the completion of the merger but it has declined over the past decade as e-commerce has hit its high street trading operation.

Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Walgreens, said the company was navigating the “challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape”.</p>
